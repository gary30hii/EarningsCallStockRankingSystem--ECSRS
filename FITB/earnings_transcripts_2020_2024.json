At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Doll: Thank you, Melissa. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020. Please review the cautionary statements and our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking guidance or statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined by our CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Jamie Leonard; President, Tim Spence; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Jamie, we will open the call-up for questions. Let me turn the call over now for Greg to his \u2013 for his comments.\nGreg Carmichael: Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I hope you're all well and staying healthy. Earlier today, we reported full year 2020 net income of $1.4 billion or $1.83 per share. We delivered strong financial results in 2020, despite the challenging operating environment brought on by the pandemic. We had several highlights for the year. We generated a record adjusted pre-provision net revenue. We maintained our expense discipline, producing an adjusted efficiency ratio below 59%, which was stable compared to the prior year and remains near decade lows. We generated a record adjusted fee revenue, including records in both our commercial and wealth and asset management businesses. We also continue to generate peer-leading consumer household growth of 3% with outsized success in Chicago and our key Southeast markets. While nearly doubling our reserves, we generated 11.7% adjusted return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI for the full year and generated an ROTCE of 18.4% in the fourth quarter. Just as importantly, we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping 99% of our branches open for business, while working closely with our customers to support them during these challenging times through the PPP program, hardship relief programs, and other outreach efforts that we have previously discussed. Our efforts have been those externally. We were recognized by an independent third-party as a top-performing bank among the 12 largest U.S. retail banks based on our pandemic response for our customers, communities and employees. Also, we had the honor winning the Greenwich middle market CX Award reflecting our commitment to delivering a superior customer experience and for enduring the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, during the year, we published our inaugural ESG Report highlighting our efforts to generate sustainable value for all stakeholders. And just this week, we announced that we became the first regional bank to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations. Turning to the fourth quarter. We reported net income of $604 million. Our reported EPS include a negative $0.10 impact from the items shown on page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.88 per share. Jamie will walk you through the quarterly financial results in more detail in just a minute. Focused execution on our key strategic priorities and our disciplined approach to credit risk management, continue to drive strong financial performance. As we recently announced, we have taken decisive action to drive efficiencies and improve the long-term profitability of the bank by streamlining our operations, including divesting less profitable businesses, such as property and casualty insurance, while still investing in areas of growth and profitability. For example, we recently finalized the acquisition of H2C, which strengthens our health care investment banking and strategic advisory capabilities. We continue to assess, select strategic investments in non-bank acquisitions to improve fee growth. All reported and adjusted return metrics were solid and improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong operating results, including the provision for credit loss performance. We expect a positive momentum in our operating results to continue in 2021. Net interest income increased 1% sequentially despite loan portfolio headwinds. Underlying NIM, which excludes excess cash and PPP impacts, increased 8 basis points sequentially. We expect to generate differentiated NIM performance relative to peers in 2021 and beyond, reflecting the hedge and investment portfolio actions we have taken over the past several years. Our credit quality remains solid, with net charge-offs of 43 basis points stable compared to the recent quarters. Also, our criticized assets and allowance for credit losses both declined sequentially reflecting our credit discipline and improved credit results and economic outlook. We continue to benefit from diversification and resilience of our fee-based businesses in retail, commercial, and wealth and asset management. Many of our fee-based businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates. Our robust capital and liquidity levels further improved this quarter, indicative of our balance sheet strength. Our regulatory capital levels have increased for three consecutive quarters, as a result of our strong earnings power, balance sheet dynamics, and the Fed's temporary suspension of buybacks. With the partial relief announced by the Fed in December, we intend to execute up to $180 million in share repurchases in the first quarter. Through proactive management, we have built a strong and stable balance sheet and significantly improved the diversification of our fee revenue. We have done this all while maintaining our culture of expense discipline and demonstrating our commitment to consistent and solid through the cycle performance. Our financial performance continues to give us confidence that we can safely and soundly operate the company at significantly lower capital levels. Though our CET1 target remains at 9.5%, we will continue to evaluate the appropriate target -- capital target as the economy improves. We are also seeing continued strength in our commercial loan production levels in our pipelines. The fourth quarter loan production was the highest in 2020 and was down around 20% from the year ago quarter, but was up over 50% from the third quarter. We are encouraged by the recent trends, the sequential improvement in almost all regions and all verticals. Strong production was more than offset by elevated payoffs and another 1% decline in line utilization. Our middle market pipeline improvement was well diversified throughout our footprint including sigma [ph] strength in our Southeast markets. In corporate banking, the pipeline strengthened again this quarter with improvement in industrials, retail, healthcare, solar and financial institutions, partially offset by continued sluggishness in hospitality and energy. Based on a strong pipeline and stable utilization trends for the first three weeks of January, we currently expect C&I loan balances to improve on a period-end basis during the first quarter excluding the impact of PPP loans. Commercial real estate pipelines continue to be well-below pre-COVID levels. Before I turn it over to Jamie to further discuss results and our outlook, I want to reiterate our strategic priorities, which will enable us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value. Our four key strategic priorities have not changed over the past several years and include leveraging technology to accelerate digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies, and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection. We will put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on areas where we see the highest probability for driving strong financial returns and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well as we navigate this environment in 2021 and beyond. I'd like to once again thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers and each other doing these challenging times. Fifth Third continues to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities, while remaining committed to equality, equity and inclusion for all. Through the end, we made a three-year $2.8 billion pledge to this commitment through lending, investing and donating, including a $25 million contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation. Our financial results continue to reflect our focused execution, discipline and through the cycle principles. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top-performing regional bank. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook.\nJamie Leonard: Thank you, Greg, and thanks all of you for joining us today. One quick housekeeping item before discussing our financial results for the quarter. As you'll see in our earnings materials, we are no longer adjusting certain metrics for purchase accounting accretion or intangible amortization given that they largely offset and have an immaterial impact on pre-tax income. We hope this will help simplify our disclosures going forward to more easily assess our financial ratio. Now turning to our fourth quarter performance. We ended 2020 with positive momentum and delivered strong financial results. Reported results were impacted by several notable items including a $23 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap, a $21 million after-tax charge related to our acquisition and disposition actions as Greg mentioned; the sale of our HSA business remains in process and should close by the end of this quarter. We also recognized a $16 million after-tax charge related to our branch and non-branch real estate efficiency strategies. This includes impairments associated with seven branches we will be closing in April as part of our normal rigor on reviewing our network for efficiencies. These closures are in addition to the 37 branches we announced last quarter. Furthermore as Greg discussed, we recorded a $19 million after-tax charitable contribution expense to promote racial equality. And we also recorded $4 million after-tax from COVID-related expenses. Lastly, we had a onetime favorable item related to state taxes of $13 million. In terms of the financial highlights for the quarter. Despite the nearly 160 basis point decline in one-month LIBOR over the last 12 months, we were able to generate an adjusted PPNR above the fourth quarter of 2019 level. We generated an efficiency ratio of 58%. Our operating performance reflected a 1% increase in NII, a 16% increase in adjusted fees and a 4% increase in adjusted expenses. Given the strong PPNR results combined with continued credit related improvements, we produced strong reported and adjusted return metrics including an adjusted ROA of 1.31% and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18.4% excluding AOCI despite growing our regulatory capital 20 basis points during the quarter.  Drilling into the income statement performance. The sequential increase in NII of 1% reflected the strength of our balance sheet and deposit franchise. We saw a 4 basis point improvement in our total loan yields, which was supported by both the continued benefits from our long-duration deep-in-the-money cash flow hedges as well as $10 million in additional PPP income.  Our NII results included $11 million of incremental favorable prepayment penalties in the securities portfolio reflecting one of the benefits from our strategy to invest in bullet and locked-out cash flows. Approximately 59% of the investment portfolio still invested in bullet and locked-out cash flows at quarter end. And our investment portfolio yield increased 9 basis points sequentially to 3.1%. Net premium and amortization in our securities portfolio was only $1 million in the fourth quarter.  On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs by another 5 basis points. For the fourth quarter, the average cost of our core deposits was only 5 basis points. CD and debt maturities also provided a 2 basis point improvement to NIM versus the third quarter.  Reported NIM was stable compared to the third quarter reflecting the favorable securities portfolio and PPP income I mentioned, offset by the impact of higher cash levels. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash improved 8 basis points to 3.14%.  Once again, we had another strong quarter generating non-interest income to cushion the rate-driven NII pressure. The resilience in our fee income levels continues to highlight the revenue diversification that we have achieved. Total non-interest income increased 9% relative to the third quarter. Excluding the notable items, non-interest income increased 16%.  We generated record commercial banking revenue, which increased double-digits sequentially and year-over-year driven by strength across most of the business. We also recorded TRA income of $74 million as well as gains from several of our direct fintech investments in venture capital funds. These investments generated $75 million of fee income in 2020 and we expect continued gains in 2021.  Top line mortgage banking revenue declined $46 million sequentially driven by a $26 million headwind reflecting a decline in rate lock volumes; a $12 million impact from our decision to retain $250 million of our retail production during the quarter; and $8 million due to margin compression.  MSR decay in servicing fees were unchanged sequentially and will remain challenged in this environment. While we did not deliver the mortgage results we expected due to capacity pressures, we have seen meaningful improvement in December and January. Non-interest expenses also increased relative to the third quarter albeit to a much lesser extent than fees.  Adjusted expenses were up 3% excluding the mark-to-market impacts associated with non-qualified deferred compensation, but is offset in security gains within non-interest income. The largest contributor of the expense growth was performance-based compensation driven by the strong performance in fees related to business growth and other revenue-linked expenses.  Moving to the balance sheet. Total average loans declined 3% sequentially with both commercial and consumer balances in line with our previous guidance ranges. Commercial loan balances continued to reflect lower revolver utilization rates, which decreased another 1% in the quarter to 32%.  Line utilization rates so far in January are stable relative to the fourth quarter. We currently expect utilization to remain unchanged for the first half of 2021 and are forecasting only a modest increase of approximately 1% in the second half of the year as the economy improves. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially with end-of-period balances declining 1%.  As we have discussed before, we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current economic environment and supports our strategy of lower exposure and our focus on high-quality borrowers. We have provided more information related to our CRE exposures in our presentation this quarter. Average total consumer loans increased 1% sequentially driven by continued growth in the auto portfolio partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card.  We took additional action in the consumer portfolio at the end of December to improve our NII trajectory for 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion of our excess liquidity by purchasing government-guaranteed residential mortgages currently in forbearance under the CARES Act provision. These loans are in our held-for-sale portfolio as they are not expected to be held for more than one to two years. These loans provide a more attractive risk-adjusted return than other current investment alternatives.  Our securities portfolio of roughly $35 billion decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter reflecting the impact of pay downs combined with the lack of compelling reinvestment opportunities. Our investment portfolio positioning continues to support NII in the current environment allowing for patience in investing at the current unattractive long-term rates.  Given the potential for strong economic growth in the second half of 2021, we do not believe long-duration securities are providing an appropriate risk return trade-off. As a result, we do not expect to grow our investment portfolio in the near term. Our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained at $3.5 billion. Also our deliberate actions within the securities portfolio over the past several years focused on structuring the portfolio in anticipation of a lower rate environment and should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds. Average other short-term investments which includes interest-bearing cash increased to $35 billion, growing $5 billion from the prior quarter and $33 billion compared to the year ago quarter. In addition to the loan growth headwinds outside of PPP the significant increase in excess cash reflects record deposit growth over the past nine months. Core deposits increased 3% compared to the third quarter, despite a 12% reduction in consumer CD balances which helped drive down interest-bearing core deposit costs by five basis points. Moving on to credit. Overall credit quality continues to be solid reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting balance sheet optimization and the improved macroeconomic environment. Charge-offs remained well-behaved at 43 basis points. Nonperforming assets declined $67 million or 7% with the resulting NPA ratio of 79 basis points declining 5 basis points sequentially. Also our criticized assets declined 12% with appreciable improvements in energy, industrial and middle market. Given the solid credit results lower end-of-period loan balances and improvements in the macroeconomic outlook, our reserve coverage declined eight basis points to 2.41% of portfolio loans and leases with improvement in both consumer and commercial. The low level of net charge-offs combined with the $131 million decline in the allowance resulted in a net $13 million benefit to the provision loan. Our ACL decline of $131 million was attributable to several factors. Approximately 1/3 of the decline was the result of lower period-end loan balances with the remainder of the release due to both the improved economic outlook and the improved commercial credit risk profile which is reflected in our lower NPA and criticized asset levels. As is required under CECL, our reserve reflects all known macroeconomic and credit quality information as of December 31. While we are not predicting or forecasting reserve releases at this point, given both the significant uncertainty in the economy and our loan growth expectations to the extent there would be meaningful and sustained improvement in the broader economy, it's not unreasonable that reserves could come down from here even if credit losses tick up. Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes GDP remains below 2019 levels until the end of 2021; an unemployment rate higher than the current 6.7% ending 2021 at 7.2% and declining to 5.6% by the end of 2022. Importantly, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from fiscal stimulus generally consistent with the $900 billion package passed at the end of December, but does not incorporate additional relief as currently proposed by the new administration. We did not change our scenario rates of 16% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $200 million release to our fourth quarter reserve. Conversely applying a 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $900 million build. Inclusive of the impact of approximately $136 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio is 2.53%. Additionally excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL would be approximately 2.65%. Moving to capital. Our capital remained strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.3%, above our stated target of 9.5% which amounts to approximately $1.2 billion of excess capital. As a reminder we have remaining capacity to purchase 76 million shares from our 100 million share program, authorized by our Board of Directors in 2019 representing $2.4 billion or 11% of our current shares outstanding. As Greg mentioned, we plan to execute approximately $180 million in share repurchases during the first quarter. And should the Federal Reserve permit banks to continue to repurchase shares in 2021 under the current net income test framework, we would have around $1 billion of buyback capacity in total for 2021 assuming no change to our reserve coverage. Moving to our current outlook. We have provided detailed guidance for both the full year and the first quarter consistent with previous fourth quarter earnings calls. We expect full year 2021 total loans to be stable with 2020 on both an average and end-of-period basis, reflecting the full year headwinds of commercial line utilization declines from the second half of 2020 and PPP forgiveness offset by the benefit of the consumer loans added at the end of 2020 and our forecast of $2 billion of new PPP loan originations in 2021. Average commercial balances are expected to decline in the low to mid single-digits range compared to 2020, while consumer balances should increase in the mid to high single-digits range. For the first quarter, we expect average total loan balances to increase approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, reflecting relative stability in the C&I portfolio, continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage and other consumer loans, partially offset by a 1% decline in CRE. Given the loan outlook, combined with our expectations for the underlying margin to be around 3% reflective of the structural rate protection from our securities and hedge portfolios, we expect NII to decline approximately 3% next year and also decline around 3% in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, assuming no deployment of our excess liquidity. We expect non-interest income to increase 2% to 3% in 2021, which includes a 1% headwind from lower TRA income in 2021. If not for the TRA impact, our fee expectations would be for 3% to 4% growth, which includes the impact of approximately $40 million in foregone annual revenue, associated with our business exits as part of our expense savings program. For the first quarter, we expect fees to increase mid single-digits year-over-year, which is not which is a 9% to 10% decline sequentially reflecting seasonal impacts, such as the lack of TRA revenue and lighter other non-interest income, partially offset by the seasonal uptick in wealth revenue from tax preparation fees in the first quarter and significantly stronger mortgage revenue. We expect top line mortgage revenue to improve $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter and also anticipate stronger results in our loan and lease syndication businesses. We expect full year 2021 non-interest expense to decline approximately 1% relative to the adjusted 2020 expenses, driven by the impacts of our expense reduction program, but partially offset by expenses associated with strong fee growth, servicing expenses associated with the consumer loan portfolio purchased in the fourth quarter and continued investments to accelerate both our digital transformation and our sales force and branch expansion in our growth markets. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Compared to the first quarter of 2020 reported expenses, we expect total expenses to be flat. On a sequential basis excluding seasonal items, our total first quarter expenses are expected to be down approximately 3% to 4% from the fourth quarter. We currently expect to generate year-over-year adjusted positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 45 basis points to 55 basis point range. If the proposed stimulus passes we would expect to be at the lower end of that range. In summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles; disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChris Doll: Thanks Jamie. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and the follow-up, and then returning the queue if you have additional questions. We'll do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning. Melissa, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question.\nGreg Carmichael: Hi, Scott.\nScott Siefers: I just wanted to ask about sort of the C&I outlook. Near term, I guess, I would characterize the commentary as constructive, but you had the outlook for just, I think a 1% increase in line utilization in the second half. It seems to me it stands in a bit of contrast from some of your peers who seem to require a more robust acceleration in C&I later in the year. I guess, I'm just curious for maybe more color on how you're thinking about the potential rebound in C&I as the economy normalizes around say midyear or so?\nGreg Carmichael: Hey, Scott. This is Greg. First of all, I'd say, we were encouraged by the fourth quarter pipeline growth that we've seen up significantly over the third quarter albeit slightly down from where we were at the end of 2019. So we're seeing progress out there. It's really -- it's pretty broad-based across all of our regions and across our verticals. So we're encouraged by the strength we're seeing there. Obviously, there's a lot of unknowns going in as we go into 2021, digital stimulus, the vaccines and so forth, the recovery. And so it's a hard thing for us to gauge what the expectations are, but there's a lot of liquidity out there right now. So we're optimistic that if the vaccines get distributed appropriately and we get the economy back in full swing second half of the year that those numbers might look stronger. But right now we're just being at the end of the day conservative, but encouraged by the pipelines that we've seen already. I don't know, Tim if you have anything to add?\nTim Spence : No, I think, that's absolutely right. As you said, I think, we're particularly pleased with the pickup in middle market production that we saw in the fourth quarter and the continued strength in the industry verticals like renewable energy, technology and healthcare where the bank has made fairly significant strategic investments over the course of the past several years. \nScott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just within your guidance for the full year, I know that you guys conservatively don't include the PPP impacts. Just curious however to the extent that they do come through how are you expecting those to ebb and flow? While most of the forgiveness is from the first half as that expected to be, sort of, a first half event, or how do you see that flowing through? \nJamie Leonard: Yes. Scott, it's Jamie. For PPP in total NII, we expect about $150 million in 2021 which includes about $60 million in accelerated forgiveness fees, which compares to about $100 million of total NII in 2020, which included only $10 million in accelerated forgiveness fees. And right now in our outlook, we expect first quarter forgiveness fees to be in line with the fourth quarter. Perhaps that's we -- we'll be better than that from a forgiveness perspective. We've got about $400 million or a little bit less than 10% of the 2020 originations forgiven. And so as we model it out, we expect the majority of the fees from the 2020 originations to be forgiven in the third quarter as borrowers approach that 16-month time horizon of needing to make payments or have it forgiven. So right now we expect the back half of the year to have a little bit more accelerated fees. And then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the 2021 round of PPP to be about $2 billion in originations and then that will accrue at a lower rate just given the five year term on those loans. So we expect about a 1.8% yield prior to any of the forgiveness fees. \nScott Siefers: Perfect. All right. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. \nKen Usdin: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jamie, on the fee side I could just hear you reiterate that up 3% to 4% core growth excluding TRA. I heard your core -- your comments about mortgage for the first quarter, but can you just give some more color in terms of what you expect to drive that growth this year and how mortgage fits into that equation?\nJamie Leonard: Sure. I think some of the momentum coming off of 2020 will lead to a very successful 2021 in the fee businesses. We did grow households 3% on the consumer side. And then the investments we made in the capital market offerings over the past several years should bear fruit in 2021. So when you line up the fee categories for 2021, I expect high single-digit growth in treasury management and commercial banking, which does include the capital markets business; mid-single digits growth in consumer deposit fees, wealth and asset management and card and processing; and then low single-digit growth in mortgage. \nKen Usdin: Got it. So even with the strong year given some of that -- I guess it was a capacity point you made earlier about mortgage. You still think mortgage can grow this year. Is that just because you see production pulling through, or do you see less of the MSR drag over time? Just maybe a little more color on the mortgage side? Thanks.\nJamie Leonard: Yes. On mortgage in the fourth quarter there were capacity constraints and there was the headwind from our decision to portfolio $250 million of our retail production. Those loans will close in the first quarter, and then you'll see that show up in the residential mortgage balances in held for investment. And from there, we do expect the capacity constraints to be behind us. And from an MSR perspective this environment for servicing is certainly challenging. We expect that to abate in the second half of 2021. And all-in the low single-digit growth for 2021, I think is a very achievable number for us. \nKen Usdin: Okay. Understood. Thanks a lot, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. \nPeter Winter: Good morning. \nJamie Leonard: Hi, Peter.\nPeter Winter: I wanted to ask about capital. And if you can, if you could just go over the capacity what's left in the existing share buyback? How much do you have left? And then secondarily, if the Fed were to lift the restrictions on share buybacks, just how you're thinking about capital returns? \nJamie Leonard: Yes. Thanks for the question, Peter. In 2019, we approved $100 million share repurchase program. We have 76 million shares left under that program. So call it $2.4 billion. Right now for 2021 you assume the Fed continue their trailing 12-month net income test and you look at our guide on earnings you should generate about $1 billion of capacity assuming no additional reserve releases. And if you look at our capital from a spot basis at the end of 12/31/2020, we have about $1.2 billion of excess even with the loan performance that we've had. So I think for 2021 should the Fed open the window $1 billion or so is -- I think, everything triangulates to that level. \nPeter Winter: Okay. That's helpful. And then, you guys lowered the net charge-off guidance from December -- towards December, I think it was 55 to 65. What gives you the confidence that, like, there is nothing looming, especially with some of these loans coming off deferral, assuming we don't get an additional stimulus package? \nRichard Stein: Yes. Hey, it's Richard. Thanks for the question. I think it really comes down to the activity we have from a risk management perspective, the confidence we have in the underwriting and our portfolio management. We continue to see consumer loss rates lower than normal. We saw them lower than normal in 2020. We expect that to continue in 2021, as the impact of stimulus rolls through the portfolio. Remember, our portfolio is concentrated in prime and super prime. We have a weighted average FICO of close to 760. So confidence in what's happening there from an activity standpoint. We do expect commercial losses to tick up a little bit from the -- into the high 40s, low 50s. And that's just going to be a function of the normal migration we see in commercial. We highlighted some potential at-risk industries in the deck. But we've seen criticized assets come down, as Jamie mentioned. We've seen positive resolutions in our workout group. And so, just, given what we see in the portfolio, where we see performance restabilization across a number of sectors, we have a lot more confidence in that range. \nPeter Winter: That\u2019s great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Your line is open.\nTerry McEvoy: Hi. Good morning. Maybe start with a question for Jamie who, I guess, by now we'll call the chief cook and bottle washer at Fifth Third. So a question for Jamie. Pretty clear on kind of the securities purchases and your thoughts there on holding cash. I guess my question, are there opportunities to purchase loans like the government-guaranteed loans that you had in the fourth quarter, as well as the decision to just hold more mortgages on the balance sheet as you think about the next 12 months? \nJamie Leonard: Yes. And that's essentially what we did in the back half of 2020. In the third quarter, we repurchased our own Ginnie Mae forbearance pool and that was about $750 that came on to our balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, we purchased a servicers' pool to the tune of $2.1 billion, as well as taking the $250 million of retail production and putting it on the sheet. I think, for now we've done a lot of work on the residential mortgage portfolio to improve it. And we think the returns are incredibly attractive. I think going forward, I'd like to see the loan growth be in other categories, just given the convexity risk you have in residential mortgage and that we've done enough. So that's why we expect in the first quarter to get back to selling all of our production. But, again, I think, the trade that we were able to execute was a nice deployment of excess cash and certainly a far better return than just buying mortgage-backed securities. We think the ROA, it was 2% or so on that transaction, versus security purchases are probably 1% to sub-1% right now. \nTerry McEvoy: Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, just looking at the CECL allowance; I'm curious, what was behind the increase in commercial mortgage and commercial construction? Other categories drifted lower, those two were up higher quarter-over-quarter and I was hoping to get some insight there. Thank you.\nRichard Stein: Yes. It's Richard, again. Look, in commercial real estate, we've seen continued negative migration. That's just a portfolio and an asset class that has a longer tail in terms of when problems arise and a longer tail when they're going to be resolved. So we saw criticized assets go up in that sector. And so, we -- that, plus some qualitative adjustments, because we don't believe that the models fully reflect the variables that are impacting some of these subsectors, like hospitality and retail, in terms of the time of recovery. And so, just given the asset migration trends and some qualitative adjustments that drove the ACL for commercial real estate higher in the quarter.\nTerry McEvoy: Great. Thanks again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKen Zerbe: Hi. Great. Thanks. First question, just in terms of the NII guidance, I just want to make sure that the -- or question, whether the down 3% in 2021, does that include your expectation of accelerated PPP fee income?\nJamie Leonard: Yes. Thanks for the question. So we do include the $2 billion of additional 2021 PPP in our guide. I think the NII guide of down 3%, that trajectory could improve, I guess, to the point of the first question on the call today, through higher commercial line utilization, because we do assume just a small uptick in the back half of the year. And frankly, there's not much we can do about that. It's a borrower-customer demand situation. A steepening yield curve benefit would also help. We anchor our guidance on the January 4th implied forward curve. So, perhaps we'll do a little bit better there. And should the curve steepen significantly then we would have opportunity to deploy excess cash. Third, with regard to the PPP, we're assuming $2 billion of originations but as we -- and perhaps that's a conservative number because as we sit here today we've submitted over $1 billion in apps in just the first two days. And then finally, as Greg mentioned, perhaps there'll be better commercial loan production through higher borrower demand and CapEx and inventory buildups. And from a production expectation perspective, we're expecting 2021 commercial loan production to be up about 20% or so from 2020 but still down 7% or so from 2019 levels. So, our outlook assumes improvement, but not returning to a 2019 type of economy. \nKen Zerbe: Got it. Okay. And just my second question I think Greg mentioned the 9.5% your CET-1 target currently which I totally understand and you make a comment that you would kind of reconsider that as the economy gets better. Can you just help us dimension like let's assume that the economy is fully better like where is a good level for Fifth Third to run on CE Tier 1?\nJamie Leonard: So, prior to some of the challenges that were cropping up in the environment we had a 9% target. So, should the economy improve as we hope it does in the back half of 2021 9% I think is a logical next step for us. When we stress test our balance sheet we believe our balance sheet has a risk profile that could be run in the 8.5% to 9% range. Our stress capital buffer is currently 7%. So I guess the Fed's perspective is much lower than that. But I think for us for this year we're targeting 9.5% and we'll evaluate that target as we see how the economy unfolds.\nKen Zerbe: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning. We saw back book re-pricing headwinds to loan yields persist throughout the last strip cycle not just for Fifth Third, but across the banking system. I believe about half of your loan portfolio is variable rate and the mix was to the short end of the curve, but there's still some re-pricing yet to come through. Would you expect a similar dynamic with further pressure on loan yields to come in this strip cycle as well? Maybe if you could just speak to that and maybe compare and contrast what's different about this cycle?\nJamie Leonard: No, I think that's a good observation and we are experiencing that phenomenon. And we saw it in the fourth quarter NIM and it's a factor in our first quarter guide. Right now from C&I production levels just given the floating nature of the portfolio yields are roughly in line maybe five bps below the current portfolio. But on the consumer side which is more fixed rate in nature instruments, we are seeing new production yields 25 to 35 basis points below portfolio yields. And so that is certainly a headwind in our NII outlook.\nBill Carcache: Understood. And separately sorry if I missed this, but I wanted to ask about if you could give some color on new money rates in light of the curve steepening that we've seen? On the security side, it seems like some of the dynamics around QE have led agency MBS spreads over treasuries to turn negative which would seem to temper some of the benefits of the steeper curve. But I was hoping that you guys could discuss some of the opportunities that you see there.\nJamie Leonard: Yes, I think it's a great question and we're seeing a divergence in practice across the banks. Our view in terms of what the rate environment would need to progress to in order to put our excess liquidity to work is we would like to see 50 basis points or more improvement in the entry points either through the spread widening or curve steepening. A lot of banks to your point is defined in on the 25 basis points of steepening or even before that. But credit spreads have tightened 10 basis points or more over that time so that the net entry point improvement to us is not that compelling. In fact by our math if you bought in the third quarter or even in the first couple of months of the fourth quarter you lost $2 in value for every $1 in carry you picked up over that period of time. So, you still have more risk should the curve steepen further. And we don't want to be stuck in a bad trade chasing balances at what are still historically low levels of rates. So, the good news for us is we are very well-positioned in the investment portfolio. We have the luxury of time. Portfolio cash flows are about $1 billion a quarter is how we're modeling it. So, we just think being patient -- we can afford to be patient and we'll move when we think we are getting the appropriate risk return in the environment. \nBill Carcache: That's very helpful. Thank you for taking the questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. My first question is a clarification question. Jamie, you mentioned $1 billion in buyback capacity for the year. But that would imply that the Fed extends its income test beyond the first quarter, correct?\nJamie Leonard: Yes. $180 million in the first quarter and then any additional repurchases are certainly subject to the Fed allowing us to do so.\nErika Najarian: So, if they lift the income restriction, I guess number one, what are your plans for DFAST participation this summer? And number two, where could that capacity grow to, if you were not subject to that income restriction after first quarter?\nJamie Leonard: So the -- I'll take the second part of the question first because, that's the easier one. Right now, against our target of 9.5%, we have $1.2 billion of excess capital. So, until the economy shows significant improvement, $1.2 billion would take us down to our target. So I think that's a fair number to use. The income test would deliver a little bit less than that. In terms of the CCAR opt in, it's funny because, we've discussed this as a team and we officially have until April 5th to decide. But right now, given that our binding capital constraint is our own internal target of 9.5% versus the Fed's prior Stress Capital Buffer for us at 7% or even 7.2% in their COVID tests, should they adopt those December results in the SCB, frankly, we feel like our team deserves arrest at following the six stress tests we did during the pandemic. And there's essentially nothing to be gained by participating. So, I think for now, if I had to decide today, I would decide not to opt in.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And just my second question is on the net charge-off outlook for this cycle. Should we think, of that 45 to 55 basis points as your quantification of the peak, or are you expecting the spike to be delayed in 2022? I'm just trying to square that with a 2.65% reserve ex PPP.\nJamie Leonard: Yes. So, it's interesting when you look at the guide for us, the 45 to 55 basis points for the first quarter, we actually expect charge-offs to be in the 40 to 45 basis point range and grow during the year. And to your point those losses get pushed out. But we certainly expect the 45 to 55 range to be the peak, even though some of the additional stimulus are elongating this cycle. I think ultimately the peak of the cycle keeps coming down, which is why we continue to guide to a better and better number. So right now, I think 45 to 55 will be the peak for us.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. On the -- back to the capital topic, given your thoughts on capital and where you stand in terms of excess, can you just give us your updated thoughts on M&A potential in terms of both bank opportunities and what your thoughts are there as well as on the non-bank side? Thanks.\nGreg Carmichael: John, this is Greg. Good question. I get it often as you might imagine. I think first off, we haven't changed our position. We're really focused on non-bank M&A opportunities as evidenced by our recent acquisition of H2C that really supports our not-for-profit health care part of our vertical. So it's really about making sure that we are additive to both our products and our service capabilities for our fee-based business whether it be wealth and asset management, our payments capability, our capital markets capability. That's where we're spending our energies right now and then really getting out of businesses that are more in hobby such as we talked about our property and casualty business. That wasn't really providing the returns we're looking for and we couldn't get the scale. So our focus is going to continue to be on those opportunities to enhance our business value proposition and grow those fee businesses. And that's the move we've been focused on the last five years mainly. From a bank M&A perspective, it's not on our agenda right now. And as always, we would assess in an attractive situation. But today, that's not our focus. Our focus is on non-bank M&A, that adds to the business we just discussed.\nJohn Pancari: Thanks, Greg. And then, on that front, on the non-bank front, I know you mentioned wealth and asset management. Just to confirm, is that -- is it both areas that you'd be interested in? I know you've expressed an interest in wealth, but you would also be interested in the institutional asset management side as well?\nGreg Carmichael: No, that's pretty -- no not the institutional side. We're pretty much focused on like I said the wealth and asset management side, where we made acquisitions like the Franklin Street Partners in North Carolina. That's pretty much our focus right now on the wealth side of the business.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And if I can ask just one more question. In terms of the securities portfolio, just wanted to get an update on how the underlying credit within the securities book is holding up. I know you have a CRE concentration there in terms of CMBS. I just wanted get an updated -- an update there on what you're seeing in terms of the performance of the underlying securities if there's any stress there evolving? Thank you.\nJamie Leonard: Yes. We're invested in about $3.5 billion of non-agency CMBS and it's holding up well. The delinquency rates are mid to high single digits, but the credit enhancement right now is approaching 40%. And we only invest in the super senior AAA-rated tranches, so that we're at the top of the repayment stack. So we're not concerned about the credit exposure in the non-agency book.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.\nJamie Leonard: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nMike Mayo: Hi.\nGreg Carmichael: Hi Mike.\nMike Mayo: I think I heard you correctly so you're kind of guiding for negative operating leverage in the first half of the year, and positive operating leverage in the second half of the year, and kind of flattish for the year as a whole. Is that, kind of a fair summary of what you guys said?\nJamie Leonard: Yeah.\nMike Mayo: Okay. So the question really is, on the spending. And I'm sure, there's a lot of opportunities to spend money, but from the strategic landscape, you have a lot of large banks that are opening up branches in some of your markets, others that are saying branch like digital first, some are trying to use their credit cards in the markets to cross-sell, others are moving kind of middle market businesses into your area. So as it relates to the kind of the competitive banking wars in your markets. How do you think about that? I mean, are you seeing any impact yet? Are you worried about that over the next five years? Is it much to do about nothing, or is this a major strategic threat and you say \"Hey, we need to spend more money on, X, Y and Z?\"\nGreg Carmichael: Mike, let me start. This is Greg. And I'm going to defer it to Tim, because this is a great question for him also. If you think about, the investments we're making, we still expect to run on an expense basis down next year, as we continue to make the strategic investments. Our strategies and you've heard this over-and-over have not changed in the last five years as far as how we're focused on our business which is digital transformation, feeding our business organic opportunities to grow our businesses such as our fee-based business that I just discussed a moment ago. And that being added to the acquisitions our fintech plays to add to our products and capabilities to deliver to our customers, our services. So we're going to continue to focus on that. We're very competitive. The household growth that we've seen at 3%, strong growth in our Southeast markets, we're a leader in the Chicago market. So we like those investments. So we're very comfortable on our ability to compete. We think our investment structure we have in place today allows us to continue to grow our franchise. And be extremely competitive. So we're not going to change that. We're going to continue to feed the opportunities that we think creates the greatest value for our shareholders. Let me let Tim add, from his side.\nTim Spence: Yeah. No. I mean, Mike new competition is always something that we watch closely. And I think I wouldn't isolate it just to the folks, who are traditional, financial institutions that are building into our markets. We pay a lot of attention to the fintech companies. In particular given that in some cases they are arbitraging, the regulatory apparatus at the moment in a way that creates imbalanced competition. I think the point that Greg made to me is the most important one, is we have on a sustained basis continued to gain share, even in our highest density markets over the course of the past three or four years on primary banking relationships, which we view as being the best measure of market share. Because the decisions you make on pricing a deposit product or you domicile headquarter deposits or otherwise, have a big impact on the FDIC numbers that you sometimes see people use on a period-to-period basis. So the strong household growth we have seen across the franchise in particular in focused markets like Chicago and the Southeast as Greg mentioned, on the consumer side of the business and the strong core relationship growth that we continue to see out of our middle market franchise are the things that give us confidence in our ability to continue to compete.\nMike Mayo: I think -- so you say 3% household growth over what timeframe? And that's an interesting way to think about it, because what you're making for household is depressed from a -- the low rate environment, so the 3% household growth over the past year or, what timeframe?\nTim Spence: Yeah. It's 3% household growth over the past year. But if you were to look at our growth in prior years, it would have been in the 2% to 3% range, quite steadily. So we've actually seen some acceleration, driven both by the build-out in the Southeast. And the growth rates for our Chicago market post-MB have been among the strongest in the franchise and definitely far stronger than you've ever seen in Chicago, when we were Fifth Third on a stand-alone basis.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Your line is open.\nSaul Martinez: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on Erika's comments and questions. It seems to me, like your reserve ratios are just completely inconsistent with your charge-off guidance. Your NCO of 50 basis points at the midpoint you're -- at the peak of the cycle it does seem to be suggesting that the government has effectively played the role of superhero and prevented credit cycle from really even emerging. And your reserves are about five times that and I would guess your weighted average remaining life is not five years. And that doesn't even consider that your NCO rates are going to fall from here. So can you just help me bridge the gap on, your reserve levels relative to your charge-offs, because the conclusion would be you've -- would seem to me to be that, you're making an ample level of qualitative adjustments or your probability weighting downside scenarios pretty conservatively. And that we should be thinking that it's pretty likely you're going to see pretty significant reserve releases in -- coming in the coming quarters?\nJamie Leonard: Yeah. It's a very good question, and the answer really comes down to the fact that the modeling of the ACL was based on the Moody's hypothetical scenario, and that's frankly why we included that in the prepared remarks, so everybody would have that information. It is certainly a scenario that is one, the base scenario is more conservative than our own outlook; and two does include a 20% allocation to a downside scenario that obviously we don't expect to happen. So, by its very nature delivers an ACL reserve that would be higher than our expectations for losses in this environment.\nSaul Martinez: So, is your model factoring in net charge-offs that are higher than what you're guiding to in 2021?\nJamie Leonard: Well, the reserve calculation is a three-year -- for us a three-year reasonable and supportable period, and then it reverts back over the remaining years to your historical loss rates whereas our guide is our internal modeling over the next 12 months. So, you can have differences in that given the different scenarios that are used.\nSaul Martinez: Right, yes. I don't want to belabor this, but like if you're saying that this is the peak and your reserve is five times that, it just seems hard to disconnect the two to that degree. It just seems like there is a part that's more weighter.\nJamie Leonard: Yes. I think to your question, if the outlook continues to improve all other things being equal, the reserve will come down and should come down. Our point is, we remain conservatively positioned and prudently positioned given the uncertainty in the environment and we'd like to get through another three to six months and see how this unfolds with vaccine efficacy and the economy turnaround.\nGreg Carmichael: I think that's definitely important.\nSaul Martinez: Yes, right.\nGreg Carmichael: That's really important, Jamie, just to...\nSaul Martinez: Yes. It's a good problem to have. Yes. So, go ahead, sorry.\nJamie Leonard: Yes.\nGreg Carmichael: No. This is the conversation. It's Greg. With the conversation, we are obviously -- that's on the forefront of how we think about our business. But we are taking a conservative approach. We do want to wait and see over the next couple of quarters how this vaccine plays out, how the economy out. You're exactly right. If you look at what we've got modeled versus what our expectations are, I think there's significant upside for reserve releases as we go in to the latter part of this year if things play out as we expect they would.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. Just as a quick follow-up additional question on expenses, just make sure I'm getting the glide path right here. Would see -- based on your full year and your first quarter expenses, it would seem like at the midpoint of the range you're factoring in about $1.1 billion a quarter of expenses from 2Q to 4Q. And I guess you get there in 2Q with -- most of the way there with the seasonal expenses going away. But, I mean is it fair to say like how do we think about that glide path? And should we be thinking that by fourth quarter as some of these expense initiatives filter through you could be even below that $1.1 billion as you run rate as you head into 2022?\nJamie Leonard: Yes. It's a good observation. We do have a higher run rate in the first quarter and due to the seasonal items that we typically haven't that I discussed in the prepared remarks. And yes, when you model it out, $1.1 billion is a fairly good run rate to assume given the revenue projections. If the growth ends up being better than the 3% to 4% then expenses obviously revenue ranges would be higher. But for our outlook, right, you are exactly right. And then the benefit that we might have in the fourth quarter to the extent our lean process automation and other initiatives pay off sooner than the 2022 time horizon then you could see some additional improvement in the fourth quarter. But for now, we're expecting $100 million to $150 million of savings to occur in 2022 and not in 2021.\nSaul Martinez: Got it, okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Greg. Good morning, Jamie.\nGreg Carmichael: Good morning.\nJamie Leonard: Hey, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Coming back to loan loss reserves, when you take a look at your loan loss reserve on January 1, when the CECL was put into place for you and your peers, I think your loan loss reserve was about 180 basis points. Clearly -- there you go. Clearly it's higher today. Do you think ultimately, I don't know if it's 2022 or 2023, but is that a good end point that we should look at in terms of when this whole COVID issue is behind us? And then, the second part of this whole loan loss reserving, once your guys' view on CECL now that we've had it for a year? I know it was a very tumultuous year. But do you think it's made it more volatile, less volatile?\nJamie Leonard: I'll take these questions. I think Greg can answer the second one.\nGreg Carmichael: Okay.\nJamie Leonard: In terms of the 182 and the day one level, we spent a lot of time looking at that as to when should we or if we ever should return back to that day one, 182 basis points. And right now our current thinking is that in order to get there, it will take -- it's going to be measured a lot longer than several quarters, because we're going to exit this this crisis with corporate debt levels leverage levels significantly higher coming out than they were going in. And you would the way the modeling works you would have to have an economic outlook as well as the outlook was essentially in 4Q of 2019 and that might be hard to ever get back to at least in the next couple of years. So I think the bias for all of our reserves across the industry is probably to take a longer period of time. And ultimately if you said if - take a guess as to where that plays out over the next two years. Or at the end of two years from now would you be at your day 1? I'd say we probably are over that number because of the corporate debt levels and because the economic outlook is probably not as favorable as the 4Q 2019 outlook was when we adopted CECL.\nGerard Cassidy: Got it.\nGreg Carmichael: In terms of it's volatility absolutely yes. I mean obviously given the CECL methodology and going into a stress environment you saw this huge, huge swings that we're dealing with right now then also the adjustments necessary to release of reserves. On the models that have been tuned for this no one modeled in a pandemic. These are new models. So there's a lot of qualitative adjustments to these models that bears burdens to the uncertainty in front of us right now. So and it does definitely makes them more volatile for us. \nGerard Cassidy: No doubt. Greg here is a bigger picture question for you. When you go down the elevator in the evening the outlook for the banking industry including Fifth Third is positioned very well. Assuming that the economy recovers as we all think it will as bank stock prices as you know from your own stock price since the Pfizer announcement right after the election has been fantastic. What do you see as the everything is hopefully going to shape out real well this year but what are the risks that you worry about when you go down that elevator at night?\nGreg Carmichael : First off good question. I think we're well positioned to be competitive in the markets that we're in. The investments that we've made I think are aligned with our long-term growth expectations and success of our business. So I feel really good about how we're competing today. The challenge always is, is when we look what watch these fintech players come forward not under the same regulatory oversight that we're doing with capital expectations and so forth so there's a threat there that we're kind of watching. If they get access to the banking system payment rails and so forth that could create some stress for us that I'm very concerned about. But as far as our investments in fintech entities themselves, the investments that we're making I'm comfortable with. It's really those fintech players out there that aren't under the same regulatory framework that we are creating some stress for us snooping around the edge of our profit pools and maybe shifting some customer behavior. So that's probably the thing that keeps me up most at night. As far as competing against other banks I think we've done all the right things to do that just making sure we keep our eyes open and we have been on what it looks like against some of these other nontraditional bank players. To that end that's why we've made significant investments in our digital capabilities and really created a digital bank ourselves. All of our lending products are online available - production online service capabilities. And we've made huge investments in our digital capabilities to make sure we're well positioned to deal with those type of threats.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott.\nChristopher Marinac: Thanks. Greg just leveraging off of your last answer to Gerard. Do you see fintech acquisitions as a necessary item in the future, or do you just want to be a good customer of these companies?\nGreg Carmichael: I think once again we've been either a partner or acquirer of fintech opportunities. Once again it gets back into our strategy whether it's buy partner then build. So we always want to focus on the technology and capabilities that are already out there. And it fits into our strategic direction with respect to how we're going to gain a lot with proper offer or how we're going to offer it. And what the opportunity looks like from a growth perspective we'd like to buy that capability if it's already there. It's a quick way to get to the market. If we can't do that you can watch us do numerous fintech partnerships to allow us to get the capabilities through that type of relationship. And if we can't do that you've watched us build and build those capabilities. And that's really been our mindset over the last decade with respect to how we handle fintechs or how we address those long term.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. Thanks very much, and thanks for all the information this morning.\nGreg Carmichael: Thanks.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. Mr. Doll I turn the call back over to you.\nChris Doll: Thank you Melissa and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. If you have any follow-up questions please contact the IR department and we will be happy to assist you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

            "content": "No, I think, that's absolutely right. As you said, I think, we're particularly pleased with the pickup in middle market production that we saw in the fourth quarter and the continued strength in the industry verticals like renewable energy, technology and healthcare where the bank has made fairly significant strategic investments over the course of the past several years. Yeah. No. I mean, Mike new competition is always something that we watch closely. And I think I wouldn't isolate it just to the folks, who are traditional, financial institutions that are building into our markets. We pay a lot of attention to the fintech companies. In particular given that in some cases they are arbitraging, the regulatory apparatus at the moment in a way that creates imbalanced competition.

Yeah. It's 3% household growth over the past year. But if you were to look at our growth in prior years, it would have been in the 2% to 3% range, quite steadily. So we've actually seen some acceleration, driven both by the build-out in the Southeast. And the growth rates for our Chicago market post-MB have been among the strongest in the franchise and definitely far stronger than you've ever seen in Chicago, when we were Fifth Third on a stand-alone basis."

            "name": "Jamie Leonard",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and thanks all of you for joining us today. One quick housekeeping item before discussing our financial results for the quarter. As you'll see in our earnings materials, we are no longer adjusting certain metrics for purchase accounting accretion or intangible amortization given that they largely offset and have an immaterial impact on pre-tax income. We hope this will help simplify our disclosures going forward to more easily assess our financial ratio. Now turning to our fourth quarter performance. We ended 2020 with positive momentum and delivered strong financial results. Reported results were impacted by several notable items including a $23 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap, a $21 million after-tax charge related to our acquisition and disposition actions as Greg mentioned; the sale of our HSA business remains in process and should close by the end of this quarter. We also recognized a $16 million after-tax charge related to our branch and non-branch real estate efficiency strategies. This includes impairments associated with seven branches we will be closing in April as part of our normal rigor on reviewing our network for efficiencies. These closures are in addition to the 37 branches we announced last quarter. Furthermore as Greg discussed, we recorded a $19 million after-tax charitable contribution expense to promote racial equality. And we also recorded $4 million after-tax from COVID-related expenses. Lastly, we had a onetime favorable item related to state taxes of $13 million. In terms of the financial highlights for the quarter. Despite the nearly 160 basis point decline in one-month LIBOR over the last 12 months, we were able to generate an adjusted PPNR above the fourth quarter of 2019 level. We generated an efficiency ratio of 58%. Our operating performance reflected a 1% increase in NII, a 16% increase in adjusted fees and a 4% increase in adjusted expenses. Given the strong PPNR results combined with continued credit related improvements, we produced strong reported and adjusted return metrics including an adjusted ROA of 1.31% and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18.4% excluding AOCI despite growing our regulatory capital 20 basis points during the quarter.  Drilling into the income statement performance. The sequential increase in NII of 1% reflected the strength of our balance sheet and deposit franchise. We saw a 4 basis point improvement in our total loan yields, which was supported by both the continued benefits from our long-duration deep-in-the-money cash flow hedges as well as $10 million in additional PPP income.  Our NII results included $11 million of incremental favorable prepayment penalties in the securities portfolio reflecting one of the benefits from our strategy to invest in bullet and locked-out cash flows. Approximately 59% of the investment portfolio still invested in bullet and locked-out cash flows at quarter end. And our investment portfolio yield increased 9 basis points sequentially to 3.1%. Net premium and amortization in our securities portfolio was only $1 million in the fourth quarter.  On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs by another 5 basis points. For the fourth quarter, the average cost of our core deposits was only 5 basis points. CD and debt maturities also provided a 2 basis point improvement to NIM versus the third quarter.  Reported NIM was stable compared to the third quarter reflecting the favorable securities portfolio and PPP income I mentioned, offset by the impact of higher cash levels. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash improved 8 basis points to 3.14%.  Once again, we had another strong quarter generating non-interest income to cushion the rate-driven NII pressure. The resilience in our fee income levels continues to highlight the revenue diversification that we have achieved. Total non-interest income increased 9% relative to the third quarter. Excluding the notable items, non-interest income increased 16%.  We generated record commercial banking revenue, which increased double-digits sequentially and year-over-year driven by strength across most of the business. We also recorded TRA income of $74 million as well as gains from several of our direct fintech investments in venture capital funds. These investments generated $75 million of fee income in 2020 and we expect continued gains in 2021.  Top line mortgage banking revenue declined $46 million sequentially driven by a $26 million headwind reflecting a decline in rate lock volumes; a $12 million impact from our decision to retain $250 million of our retail production during the quarter; and $8 million due to margin compression.  MSR decay in servicing fees were unchanged sequentially and will remain challenged in this environment. While we did not deliver the mortgage results we expected due to capacity pressures, we have seen meaningful improvement in December and January. Non-interest expenses also increased relative to the third quarter albeit to a much lesser extent than fees.  Adjusted expenses were up 3% excluding the mark-to-market impacts associated with non-qualified deferred compensation, but is offset in security gains within non-interest income. The largest contributor of the expense growth was performance-based compensation driven by the strong performance in fees related to business growth and other revenue-linked expenses.  Moving to the balance sheet. Total average loans declined 3% sequentially with both commercial and consumer balances in line with our previous guidance ranges. Commercial loan balances continued to reflect lower revolver utilization rates, which decreased another 1% in the quarter to 32%.  Line utilization rates so far in January are stable relative to the fourth quarter. We currently expect utilization to remain unchanged for the first half of 2021 and are forecasting only a modest increase of approximately 1% in the second half of the year as the economy improves. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially with end-of-period balances declining 1%.  As we have discussed before, we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current economic environment and supports our strategy of lower exposure and our focus on high-quality borrowers. We have provided more information related to our CRE exposures in our presentation this quarter. Average total consumer loans increased 1% sequentially driven by continued growth in the auto portfolio partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card.  We took additional action in the consumer portfolio at the end of December to improve our NII trajectory for 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion of our excess liquidity by purchasing government-guaranteed residential mortgages currently in forbearance under the CARES Act provision. These loans are in our held-for-sale portfolio as they are not expected to be held for more than one to two years. These loans provide a more attractive risk-adjusted return than other current investment alternatives.  Our securities portfolio of roughly $35 billion decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter reflecting the impact of pay downs combined with the lack of compelling reinvestment opportunities. Our investment portfolio positioning continues to support NII in the current environment allowing for patience in investing at the current unattractive long-term rates.  Given the potential for strong economic growth in the second half of 2021, we do not believe long-duration securities are providing an appropriate risk return trade-off. As a result, we do not expect to grow our investment portfolio in the near term. Our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained at $3.5 billion. Also our deliberate actions within the securities portfolio over the past several years focused on structuring the portfolio in anticipation of a lower rate environment and should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds. Average other short-term investments which includes interest-bearing cash increased to $35 billion, growing $5 billion from the prior quarter and $33 billion compared to the year ago quarter. In addition to the loan growth headwinds outside of PPP the significant increase in excess cash reflects record deposit growth over the past nine months. Core deposits increased 3% compared to the third quarter, despite a 12% reduction in consumer CD balances which helped drive down interest-bearing core deposit costs by five basis points. Moving on to credit. Overall credit quality continues to be solid reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting balance sheet optimization and the improved macroeconomic environment. Charge-offs remained well-behaved at 43 basis points. Nonperforming assets declined $67 million or 7% with the resulting NPA ratio of 79 basis points declining 5 basis points sequentially. Also our criticized assets declined 12% with appreciable improvements in energy, industrial and middle market. Given the solid credit results lower end-of-period loan balances and improvements in the macroeconomic outlook, our reserve coverage declined eight basis points to 2.41% of portfolio loans and leases with improvement in both consumer and commercial. The low level of net charge-offs combined with the $131 million decline in the allowance resulted in a net $13 million benefit to the provision loan. Our ACL decline of $131 million was attributable to several factors. Approximately 1/3 of the decline was the result of lower period-end loan balances with the remainder of the release due to both the improved economic outlook and the improved commercial credit risk profile which is reflected in our lower NPA and criticized asset levels. As is required under CECL, our reserve reflects all known macroeconomic and credit quality information as of December 31. While we are not predicting or forecasting reserve releases at this point, given both the significant uncertainty in the economy and our loan growth expectations to the extent there would be meaningful and sustained improvement in the broader economy, it's not unreasonable that reserves could come down from here even if credit losses tick up. Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes GDP remains below 2019 levels until the end of 2021; an unemployment rate higher than the current 6.7% ending 2021 at 7.2% and declining to 5.6% by the end of 2022. Importantly, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from fiscal stimulus generally consistent with the $900 billion package passed at the end of December, but does not incorporate additional relief as currently proposed by the new administration. We did not change our scenario rates of 16% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $200 million release to our fourth quarter reserve. Conversely applying a 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $900 million build. Inclusive of the impact of approximately $136 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio is 2.53%. Additionally excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL would be approximately 2.65%. Moving to capital. Our capital remained strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.3%, above our stated target of 9.5% which amounts to approximately $1.2 billion of excess capital. As a reminder we have remaining capacity to purchase 76 million shares from our 100 million share program, authorized by our Board of Directors in 2019 representing $2.4 billion or 11% of our current shares outstanding. As Greg mentioned, we plan to execute approximately $180 million in share repurchases during the first quarter. And should the Federal Reserve permit banks to continue to repurchase shares in 2021 under the current net income test framework, we would have around $1 billion of buyback capacity in total for 2021 assuming no change to our reserve coverage. Moving to our current outlook. We have provided detailed guidance for both the full year and the first quarter consistent with previous fourth quarter earnings calls. We expect full year 2021 total loans to be stable with 2020 on both an average and end-of-period basis, reflecting the full year headwinds of commercial line utilization declines from the second half of 2020 and PPP forgiveness offset by the benefit of the consumer loans added at the end of 2020 and our forecast of $2 billion of new PPP loan originations in 2021. Average commercial balances are expected to decline in the low to mid single-digits range compared to 2020, while consumer balances should increase in the mid to high single-digits range. For the first quarter, we expect average total loan balances to increase approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, reflecting relative stability in the C&I portfolio, continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage and other consumer loans, partially offset by a 1% decline in CRE. Given the loan outlook, combined with our expectations for the underlying margin to be around 3% reflective of the structural rate protection from our securities and hedge portfolios, we expect NII to decline approximately 3% next year and also decline around 3% in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, assuming no deployment of our excess liquidity. We expect non-interest income to increase 2% to 3% in 2021, which includes a 1% headwind from lower TRA income in 2021. If not for the TRA impact, our fee expectations would be for 3% to 4% growth, which includes the impact of approximately $40 million in foregone annual revenue, associated with our business exits as part of our expense savings program. For the first quarter, we expect fees to increase mid single-digits year-over-year, which is not which is a 9% to 10% decline sequentially reflecting seasonal impacts, such as the lack of TRA revenue and lighter other non-interest income, partially offset by the seasonal uptick in wealth revenue from tax preparation fees in the first quarter and significantly stronger mortgage revenue. We expect top line mortgage revenue to improve $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter and also anticipate stronger results in our loan and lease syndication businesses. We expect full year 2021 non-interest expense to decline approximately 1% relative to the adjusted 2020 expenses, driven by the impacts of our expense reduction program, but partially offset by expenses associated with strong fee growth, servicing expenses associated with the consumer loan portfolio purchased in the fourth quarter and continued investments to accelerate both our digital transformation and our sales force and branch expansion in our growth markets. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Compared to the first quarter of 2020 reported expenses, we expect total expenses to be flat. On a sequential basis excluding seasonal items, our total first quarter expenses are expected to be down approximately 3% to 4% from the fourth quarter. We currently expect to generate year-over-year adjusted positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 45 basis points to 55 basis point range. If the proposed stimulus passes we would expect to be at the lower end of that range. In summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles; disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Yes. Scott, it's Jamie. For PPP in total NII, we expect about $150 million in 2021 which includes about $60 million in accelerated forgiveness fees, which compares to about $100 million of total NII in 2020, which included only $10 million in accelerated forgiveness fees. And right now in our outlook, we expect first quarter forgiveness fees to be in line with the fourth quarter. Perhaps that's we -- we'll be better than that from a forgiveness perspective. We've got about $400 million or a little bit less than 10% of the 2020 originations forgiven. And so as we model it out, we expect the majority of the fees from the 2020 originations to be forgiven in the third quarter as borrowers approach that 16-month time horizon of needing to make payments or have it forgiven. So right now we expect the back half of the year to have a little bit more accelerated fees. And then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the 2021 round of PPP to be about $2 billion in originations and then that will accrue at a lower rate just given the five year term on those loans. So we expect about a 1.8% yield prior to any of the forgiveness fees. Sure. I think some of the momentum coming off of 2020 will lead to a very successful 2021 in the fee businesses. We did grow households 3% on the consumer side. And then the investments we made in the capital market offerings over the past several years should bear fruit in 2021. So when you line up the fee categories for 2021, I expect high single-digit growth in treasury management and commercial banking, which does include the capital markets business; mid-single digits growth in consumer deposit fees, wealth and asset management and card and processing; and then low single-digit growth in mortgage. Yes. On mortgage in the fourth quarter there were capacity constraints and there was the headwind from our decision to portfolio $250 million of our retail production. Those loans will close in the first quarter, and then you'll see that show up in the residential mortgage balances in held for investment. And from there, we do expect the capacity constraints to be behind us. And from an MSR perspective this environment for servicing is certainly challenging. We expect that to abate in the second half of 2021. And all-in the low single-digit growth for 2021, I think is a very achievable number for us. Hi, Peter. Yes. Thanks for the question, Peter. In 2019, we approved $100 million share repurchase program. We have 76 million shares left under that program. So call it $2.4 billion. Right now for 2021 you assume the Fed continue their trailing 12-month net income test and you look at our guide on earnings you should generate about $1 billion of capacity assuming no additional reserve releases. And if you look at our capital from a spot basis at the end of 12/31/2020, we have about $1.2 billion of excess even with the loan performance that we've had. So I think for 2021 should the Fed open the window $1 billion or so is -- I think, everything triangulates to that level. Yes. And that's essentially what we did in the back half of 2020. In the third quarter, we repurchased our own Ginnie Mae forbearance pool and that was about $750 that came on to our balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, we purchased a servicers' pool to the tune of $2.1 billion, as well as taking the $250 million of retail production and putting it on the sheet. I think, for now we've done a lot of work on the residential mortgage portfolio to improve it. And we think the returns are incredibly attractive. I think going forward, I'd like to see the loan growth be in other categories, just given the convexity risk you have in residential mortgage and that we've done enough. So that's why we expect in the first quarter to get back to selling all of our production. But, again, I think, the trade that we were able to execute was a nice deployment of excess cash and certainly a far better return than just buying mortgage-backed securities. We think the ROA, it was 2% or so on that transaction, versus security purchases are probably 1% to sub-1% right now. Yes. Thanks for the question. So we do include the $2 billion of additional 2021 PPP in our guide. I think the NII guide of down 3%, that trajectory could improve, I guess, to the point of the first question on the call today, through higher commercial line utilization, because we do assume just a small uptick in the back half of the year. And frankly, there's not much we can do about that. It's a borrower-customer demand situation. A steepening yield curve benefit would also help. We anchor our guidance on the January 4th implied forward curve. So, perhaps we'll do a little bit better there. And should the curve steepen significantly then we would have opportunity to deploy excess cash. Third, with regard to the PPP, we're assuming $2 billion of originations but as we -- and perhaps that's a conservative number because as we sit here today we've submitted over $1 billion in apps in just the first two days. And then finally, as Greg mentioned, perhaps there'll be better commercial loan production through higher borrower demand and CapEx and inventory buildups. And from a production expectation perspective, we're expecting 2021 commercial loan production to be up about 20% or so from 2020 but still down 7% or so from 2019 levels. So, our outlook assumes improvement, but not returning to a 2019 type of economy. So, prior to some of the challenges that were cropping up in the environment we had a 9% target. So, should the economy improve as we hope it does in the back half of 2021 9% I think is a logical next step for us. When we stress test our balance sheet we believe our balance sheet has a risk profile that could be run in the 8.5% to 9% range. Our stress capital buffer is currently 7%. So I guess the Fed's perspective is much lower than that. But I think for us for this year we're targeting 9.5% and we'll evaluate that target as we see how the economy unfolds. No, I think that's a good observation and we are experiencing that phenomenon. And we saw it in the fourth quarter NIM and it's a factor in our first quarter guide. Right now from C&I production levels just given the floating nature of the portfolio yields are roughly in line maybe five bps below the current portfolio. But on the consumer side which is more fixed rate in nature instruments, we are seeing new production yields 25 to 35 basis points below portfolio yields. And so that is certainly a headwind in our NII outlook. Yes, I think it's a great question and we're seeing a divergence in practice across the banks. Our view in terms of what the rate environment would need to progress to in order to put our excess liquidity to work is we would like to see 50 basis points or more improvement in the entry points either through the spread widening or curve steepening. A lot of banks to your point is defined in on the 25 basis points of steepening or even before that. But credit spreads have tightened 10 basis points or more over that time so that the net entry point improvement to us is not that compelling. In fact by our math if you bought in the third quarter or even in the first couple of months of the fourth quarter you lost $2 in value for every $1 in carry you picked up over that period of time. So, you still have more risk should the curve steepen further. And we don't want to be stuck in a bad trade chasing balances at what are still historically low levels of rates. So, the good news for us is we are very well-positioned in the investment portfolio. We have the luxury of time. Portfolio cash flows are about $1 billion a quarter is how we're modeling it. So, we just think being patient -- we can afford to be patient and we'll move when we think we are getting the appropriate risk return in the environment. Yes. $180 million in the first quarter and then any additional repurchases are certainly subject to the Fed allowing us to do so. So the -- I'll take the second part of the question first because, that's the easier one. Right now, against our target of 9.5%, we have $1.2 billion of excess capital. So, until the economy shows significant improvement, $1.2 billion would take us down to our target. So I think that's a fair number to use. The income test would deliver a little bit less than that. In terms of the CCAR opt in, it's funny because, we've discussed this as a team and we officially have until April 5th to decide. But right now, given that our binding capital constraint is our own internal target of 9.5% versus the Fed's prior Stress Capital Buffer for us at 7% or even 7.2% in their COVID tests, should they adopt those December results in the SCB, frankly, we feel like our team deserves arrest at following the six stress tests we did during the pandemic. And there's essentially nothing to be gained by participating. So, I think for now, if I had to decide today, I would decide not to opt in. Yes. So, it's interesting when you look at the guide for us, the 45 to 55 basis points for the first quarter, we actually expect charge-offs to be in the 40 to 45 basis point range and grow during the year. And to your point those losses get pushed out. But we certainly expect the 45 to 55 range to be the peak, even though some of the additional stimulus are elongating this cycle. I think ultimately the peak of the cycle keeps coming down, which is why we continue to guide to a better and better number. So right now, I think 45 to 55 will be the peak for us. Yes. We're invested in about $3.5 billion of non-agency CMBS and it's holding up well. The delinquency rates are mid to high single digits, but the credit enhancement right now is approaching 40%. And we only invest in the super senior AAA-rated tranches, so that we're at the top of the repayment stack. So we're not concerned about the credit exposure in the non-agency book. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. It's a very good question, and the answer really comes down to the fact that the modeling of the ACL was based on the Moody's hypothetical scenario, and that's frankly why we included that in the prepared remarks, so everybody would have that information. It is certainly a scenario that is one, the base scenario is more conservative than our own outlook; and two does include a 20% allocation to a downside scenario that obviously we don't expect to happen. So, by its very nature delivers an ACL reserve that would be higher than our expectations for losses in this environment. Well, the reserve calculation is a three-year -- for us a three-year reasonable and supportable period, and then it reverts back over the remaining years to your historical loss rates whereas our guide is our internal modeling over the next 12 months. So, you can have differences in that given the different scenarios that are used. Yes. I think to your question, if the outlook continues to improve all other things being equal, the reserve will come down and should come down. Our point is, we remain conservatively positioned and prudently positioned given the uncertainty in the environment and we'd like to get through another three to six months and see how this unfolds with vaccine efficacy and the economy turnaround. Yes. Yes. It's a good observation. We do have a higher run rate in the first quarter and due to the seasonal items that we typically haven't that I discussed in the prepared remarks. And yes, when you model it out, $1.1 billion is a fairly good run rate to assume given the revenue projections. If the growth ends up being better than the 3% to 4% then expenses obviously revenue ranges would be higher. But for our outlook, right, you are exactly right. And then the benefit that we might have in the fourth quarter to the extent our lean process automation and other initiatives pay off sooner than the 2022 time horizon then you could see some additional improvement in the fourth quarter. But for now, we're expecting $100 million to $150 million of savings to occur in 2022 and not in 2021. Hey, Gerard. I'll take these questions. I think Greg can answer the second one. In terms of the 182 and the day one level, we spent a lot of time looking at that as to when should we or if we ever should return back to that day one, 182 basis points. And right now our current thinking is that in order to get there, it will take -- it's going to be measured a lot longer than several quarters, because we're going to exit this this crisis with corporate debt levels leverage levels significantly higher coming out than they were going in. And you would the way the modeling works you would have to have an economic outlook as well as the outlook was essentially in 4Q of 2019 and that might be hard to ever get back to at least in the next couple of years. So I think the bias for all of our reserves across the industry is probably to take a longer period of time. And ultimately if you said if - take a guess as to where that plays out over the next two years. Or at the end of two years from now would you be at your day 1? I'd say we probably are over that number because of the corporate debt levels and because the economic outlook is probably not as favorable as the 4Q 2019 outlook was when we adopted CECL."

            "name": "Greg Carmichael",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I hope you're all well and staying healthy. Earlier today, we reported full year 2020 net income of $1.4 billion or $1.83 per share. We delivered strong financial results in 2020, despite the challenging operating environment brought on by the pandemic. We had several highlights for the year. We generated a record adjusted pre-provision net revenue. We maintained our expense discipline, producing an adjusted efficiency ratio below 59%, which was stable compared to the prior year and remains near decade lows. We generated a record adjusted fee revenue, including records in both our commercial and wealth and asset management businesses. We also continue to generate peer-leading consumer household growth of 3% with outsized success in Chicago and our key Southeast markets. While nearly doubling our reserves, we generated 11.7% adjusted return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI for the full year and generated an ROTCE of 18.4% in the fourth quarter. Just as importantly, we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping 99% of our branches open for business, while working closely with our customers to support them during these challenging times through the PPP program, hardship relief programs, and other outreach efforts that we have previously discussed. Our efforts have been those externally. We were recognized by an independent third-party as a top-performing bank among the 12 largest U.S. retail banks based on our pandemic response for our customers, communities and employees. Also, we had the honor winning the Greenwich middle market CX Award reflecting our commitment to delivering a superior customer experience and for enduring the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, during the year, we published our inaugural ESG Report highlighting our efforts to generate sustainable value for all stakeholders. And just this week, we announced that we became the first regional bank to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations. Turning to the fourth quarter. We reported net income of $604 million. Our reported EPS include a negative $0.10 impact from the items shown on page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.88 per share. Jamie will walk you through the quarterly financial results in more detail in just a minute. Focused execution on our key strategic priorities and our disciplined approach to credit risk management, continue to drive strong financial performance. As we recently announced, we have taken decisive action to drive efficiencies and improve the long-term profitability of the bank by streamlining our operations, including divesting less profitable businesses, such as property and casualty insurance, while still investing in areas of growth and profitability. For example, we recently finalized the acquisition of H2C, which strengthens our health care investment banking and strategic advisory capabilities. We continue to assess, select strategic investments in non-bank acquisitions to improve fee growth. All reported and adjusted return metrics were solid and improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong operating results, including the provision for credit loss performance. We expect a positive momentum in our operating results to continue in 2021. Net interest income increased 1% sequentially despite loan portfolio headwinds. Underlying NIM, which excludes excess cash and PPP impacts, increased 8 basis points sequentially. We expect to generate differentiated NIM performance relative to peers in 2021 and beyond, reflecting the hedge and investment portfolio actions we have taken over the past several years. Our credit quality remains solid, with net charge-offs of 43 basis points stable compared to the recent quarters. Also, our criticized assets and allowance for credit losses both declined sequentially reflecting our credit discipline and improved credit results and economic outlook. We continue to benefit from diversification and resilience of our fee-based businesses in retail, commercial, and wealth and asset management. Many of our fee-based businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates. Our robust capital and liquidity levels further improved this quarter, indicative of our balance sheet strength. Our regulatory capital levels have increased for three consecutive quarters, as a result of our strong earnings power, balance sheet dynamics, and the Fed's temporary suspension of buybacks. With the partial relief announced by the Fed in December, we intend to execute up to $180 million in share repurchases in the first quarter. Through proactive management, we have built a strong and stable balance sheet and significantly improved the diversification of our fee revenue. We have done this all while maintaining our culture of expense discipline and demonstrating our commitment to consistent and solid through the cycle performance. Our financial performance continues to give us confidence that we can safely and soundly operate the company at significantly lower capital levels. Though our CET1 target remains at 9.5%, we will continue to evaluate the appropriate target -- capital target as the economy improves. We are also seeing continued strength in our commercial loan production levels in our pipelines. The fourth quarter loan production was the highest in 2020 and was down around 20% from the year ago quarter, but was up over 50% from the third quarter. We are encouraged by the recent trends, the sequential improvement in almost all regions and all verticals. Strong production was more than offset by elevated payoffs and another 1% decline in line utilization. Our middle market pipeline improvement was well diversified throughout our footprint including sigma [ph] strength in our Southeast markets. In corporate banking, the pipeline strengthened again this quarter with improvement in industrials, retail, healthcare, solar and financial institutions, partially offset by continued sluggishness in hospitality and energy. Based on a strong pipeline and stable utilization trends for the first three weeks of January, we currently expect C&I loan balances to improve on a period-end basis during the first quarter excluding the impact of PPP loans. Commercial real estate pipelines continue to be well-below pre-COVID levels. Before I turn it over to Jamie to further discuss results and our outlook, I want to reiterate our strategic priorities, which will enable us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value. Our four key strategic priorities have not changed over the past several years and include leveraging technology to accelerate digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies, and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection. We will put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on areas where we see the highest probability for driving strong financial returns and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well as we navigate this environment in 2021 and beyond. I'd like to once again thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers and each other doing these challenging times. Fifth Third continues to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities, while remaining committed to equality, equity and inclusion for all. Through the end, we made a three-year $2.8 billion pledge to this commitment through lending, investing and donating, including a $25 million contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation. Our financial results continue to reflect our focused execution, discipline and through the cycle principles. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top-performing regional bank. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook. Hi, Scott. Hey, Scott. This is Greg. First of all, I'd say, we were encouraged by the fourth quarter pipeline growth that we've seen up significantly over the third quarter albeit slightly down from where we were at the end of 2019. So we're seeing progress out there. It's really -- it's pretty broad-based across all of our regions and across our verticals. So we're encouraged by the strength we're seeing there. Obviously, there's a lot of unknowns going in as we go into 2021, digital stimulus, the vaccines and so forth, the recovery. And so it's a hard thing for us to gauge what the expectations are, but there's a lot of liquidity out there right now. So we're optimistic that if the vaccines get distributed appropriately and we get the economy back in full swing second half of the year that those numbers might look stronger. But right now we're just being at the end of the day conservative, but encouraged by the pipelines that we've seen already. I don't know, Tim if you have anything to add? John, this is Greg. Good question. I get it often as you might imagine. I think first off, we haven't changed our position. We're really focused on non-bank M&A opportunities as evidenced by our recent acquisition of H2C that really supports our not-for-profit health care part of our vertical. So it's really about making sure that we are additive to both our products and our service capabilities for our fee-based business whether it be wealth and asset management, our payments capability, our capital markets capability. That's where we're spending our energies right now and then really getting out of businesses that are more in hobby such as we talked about our property and casualty business. That wasn't really providing the returns we're looking for and we couldn't get the scale. So our focus is going to continue to be on those opportunities to enhance our business value proposition and grow those fee businesses. And that's the move we've been focused on the last five years mainly. From a bank M&A perspective, it's not on our agenda right now. And as always, we would assess in an attractive situation. But today, that's not our focus. Our focus is on non-bank M&A, that adds to the business we just discussed. No, that's pretty -- no not the institutional side. We're pretty much focused on like I said the wealth and asset management side, where we made acquisitions like the Franklin Street Partners in North Carolina. That's pretty much our focus right now on the wealth side of the business. Hi Mike. Mike, let me start. This is Greg. And I'm going to defer it to Tim, because this is a great question for him also. If you think about, the investments we're making, we still expect to run on an expense basis down next year, as we continue to make the strategic investments. Our strategies and you've heard this over-and-over have not changed in the last five years as far as how we're focused on our business which is digital transformation, feeding our business organic opportunities to grow our businesses such as our fee-based business that I just discussed a moment ago. And that being added to the acquisitions our fintech plays to add to our products and capabilities to deliver to our customers, our services. So we're going to continue to focus on that. We're very competitive. The household growth that we've seen at 3%, strong growth in our Southeast markets, we're a leader in the Chicago market. So we like those investments. So we're very comfortable on our ability to compete. We think our investment structure we have in place today allows us to continue to grow our franchise. And be extremely competitive. So we're not going to change that. We're going to continue to feed the opportunities that we think creates the greatest value for our shareholders. Let me let Tim add, from his side. I think that's definitely important. That's really important, Jamie, just to... No. This is the conversation. It's Greg. With the conversation, we are obviously -- that's on the forefront of how we think about our business. But we are taking a conservative approach. We do want to wait and see over the next couple of quarters how this vaccine plays out, how the economy out. You're exactly right. If you look at what we've got modeled versus what our expectations are, I think there's significant upside for reserve releases as we go in to the latter part of this year if things play out as we expect they would. Good morning. Okay. In terms of it's volatility absolutely yes. I mean obviously given the CECL methodology and going into a stress environment you saw this huge, huge swings that we're dealing with right now then also the adjustments necessary to release of reserves. On the models that have been tuned for this no one modeled in a pandemic. These are new models. So there's a lot of qualitative adjustments to these models that bears burdens to the uncertainty in front of us right now. So and it does definitely makes them more volatile for us. First off good question. I think we're well positioned to be competitive in the markets that we're in. The investments that we've made I think are aligned with our long-term growth expectations and success of our business. So I feel really good about how we're competing today. The challenge always is, is when we look what watch these fintech players come forward not under the same regulatory oversight that we're doing with capital expectations and so forth so there's a threat there that we're kind of watching. If they get access to the banking system payment rails and so forth that could create some stress for us that I'm very concerned about. But as far as our investments in fintech entities themselves, the investments that we're making I'm comfortable with. It's really those fintech players out there that aren't under the same regulatory framework that we are creating some stress for us snooping around the edge of our profit pools and maybe shifting some customer behavior. So that's probably the thing that keeps me up most at night. As far as competing against other banks I think we've done all the right things to do that just making sure we keep our eyes open and we have been on what it looks like against some of these other nontraditional bank players. To that end that's why we've made significant investments in our digital capabilities and really created a digital bank ourselves. All of our lending products are online available - production online service capabilities. And we've made huge investments in our digital capabilities to make sure we're well positioned to deal with those type of threats. I think once again we've been either a partner or acquirer of fintech opportunities. Once again it gets back into our strategy whether it's buy partner then build. So we always want to focus on the technology and capabilities that are already out there. And it fits into our strategic direction with respect to how we're going to gain a lot with proper offer or how we're going to offer it. And what the opportunity looks like from a growth perspective we'd like to buy that capability if it's already there. It's a quick way to get to the market. If we can't do that you can watch us do numerous fintech partnerships to allow us to get the capabilities through that type of relationship. And if we can't do that you've watched us build and build those capabilities. And that's really been our mindset over the last decade with respect to how we handle fintechs or how we address those long term. Thanks."

            "name": "Richard Stein",
            "content": "Yes. Hey, it's Richard. Thanks for the question. I think it really comes down to the activity we have from a risk management perspective, the confidence we have in the underwriting and our portfolio management. We continue to see consumer loss rates lower than normal. We saw them lower than normal in 2020. We expect that to continue in 2021, as the impact of stimulus rolls through the portfolio. Remember, our portfolio is concentrated in prime and super prime. We have a weighted average FICO of close to 760. So confidence in what's happening there from an activity standpoint. We do expect commercial losses to tick up a little bit from the -- into the high 40s, low 50s. And that's just going to be a function of the normal migration we see in commercial. We highlighted some potential at-risk industries in the deck. But we've seen criticized assets come down, as Jamie mentioned. We've seen positive resolutions in our workout group. And so, just, given what we see in the portfolio, where we see performance restabilization across a number of sectors, we have a lot more confidence in that range. Yes. It's Richard, again. Look, in commercial real estate, we've seen continued negative migration. That's just a portfolio and an asset class that has a longer tail in terms of when problems arise and a longer tail when they're going to be resolved. So we saw criticized assets go up in that sector. And so, we -- that, plus some qualitative adjustments, because we don't believe that the models fully reflect the variables that are impacting some of these subsectors, like hospitality and retail, in terms of the time of recovery. And so, just given the asset migration trends and some qualitative adjustments that drove the ACL for commercial real estate higher in the quarter."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speakers today. Chris Doll, you may begin.\nChris Doll: Thank you, Marcella. Good morning, thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our results for the third quarter of 2020. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. I'm joined this morning by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Risk Officer, Jamie Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tyson, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over to Greg now for his comments.\nGreg Carmichael: Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I hope you are all doing well and staying healthy. Once again, our financial results were strong despite the challenges associated with the current environment. As an essential business, we continue to take appropriate actions for our customers, our employees and our communities during the pandemic. Earlier today, we reported third quarter net income available to common shareholders of $562 million or $0.78 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.07 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted third quarter earnings were $0.85 per share. Tayfun will provide more details on the quarterly financial results in his remarks. But I will share some highlights. Our reported adjusted return metrics were solid, reflecting our strong operating results, including a provision for credit loss performance. Our credit losses were significantly better than expectations. At 35 basis points, our third quarter charge-offs were the lowest level in over a year, with improvement in both consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs of 40 basis points is the lowest in the past 15-plus years, reflecting our consistently strong approach to underwriting, as well as the benefits of fiscal stimulus and payment deferrals. Our already strong capital position further improved this quarter. Our CET1 ratio of 10.1% is well above our stated target of around 9.5%, and our income levels, combined with the outcomes from our quarterly stress test continue to suggest that we will maintain our current dividend. Furthermore, we have grown tangible book value per share for 6 consecutive quarters. Our PPNR results were better than our previous expectations, reflecting the strength and resilience of our diverse revenue mix in retail, commercial and wealth and asset management. Based on our fee-based businesses, many of our fee-based businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates. For instance, wealth and asset management revenue increased 10% sequentially as we generated positive AUM inflows again this quarter as we have done in 9 out of the last 10 quarters. Capital markets revenue was up 8% from last year, and was down slightly relative to the record second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, total commercial banking fee revenue was up 16% compared to last year. Topline mortgage revenue is up 45% from the year-ago quarter, with a low rate environment impacting servicing revenue and the MSR valuation. Deposit fees increased 18%, and processing revenue increased 12% sequentially, both better than our previous guidance as we are seeing early signs of normalization in business and consumer spending patterns. While we continue to streamline our operations and position the bank for long-term success, we continue to assess strategic investments in non-bank acquisitions and our fee-based businesses to accelerate revenue growth. For instance, we recently increased our strategic investment in Bellwether Enterprise, a national multiproduct CRE firm, which we originally announced in April. This investment provides clients with a broader set of permanent financing solutions without Fifth Third being exposed to the balance sheet risk associated with longer duration CRE assets. Commercial loan production was relatively stable this quarter compared to the second quarter, offset by further declines in line utilization. Total average loans declined 4% sequentially. Within our previous guidance range, we expect near-term pressure in the loan portfolio to continue. Despite the tepid loan environment, net interest income exceeded our previous guidance as we aggressively reduced our deposit costs in excess of our prior expectations. While the environment remains uncertain, our commercial loan pipelines are beginning to improve in certain areas, particularly in technology, telecom, health care and industrials, which should provide support as we head into next year. Before I turn it over to Tayfun to further discuss the results and outlook, and I'll review our guiding principles, strategic actions and key strategic priorities, which will enable us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value. We have consistently communicated our through-the-cycle principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and overall balance sheet management approach focused on long-term performance. Our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. We have executed numerous strategic actions over the past five years in anticipation of a downturn, which will continue to serve us well. We've reduced our credit risk exposures and built strong reserve coverage. We've built long-term protection to mitigate the impact of lower interest rates. We took decisive actions to reduce our expense base, and we successfully invested in and diversified our fee businesses. From a commercial client standpoint, we continue to focus on generating relationships with clients who have more diversified and resilient businesses. We are confident in our client selection process and proactive approach to credit risk management. We continue to believe we are well positioned relative to peers in commercial real estate, an area where we have been named disciplined. We have focused predominantly on top-tier developers with a track record of resiliency. Our portfolio is well diversified by geography and property type. And as we have discussed before, we continue to be at the low end of peers as a percentage of total capital. In addition to the CRE portfolio, our other lending portfolios continue to do well, be well positioned, combining our strong retail and regional commercial banking franchises in the Midwest and Southeast with our national lending businesses. These portfolios will be instrumental in delivering a differentiated credit performance, given the likelihood of an uneven economic recovery. We're mining our exposures across our total commercial loan portfolio, utilizing early warning systems through a combination of internal portfolio analysis, and third party data. Our relationship teams receive timely alerts that we detect any sign of credit deterioration. This helps us make prompt, prudent and accurate credit rating determinations proactively without waiting for customer statements. Looking ahead to 2021, we continue to expect full year net charge-offs to come in well below 1%. We have also strengthened our balance sheet that building long-term protection, the positioning of our securities, and hedge portfolios. With high likelihood of lower rates for the next several years, our prudent interest rate risk management should help preserve our core margin. Our very strong balance sheet liquidity has enabled us to decisively act in aggressively lower deposit rates. Given the industry wide revenue headwinds, including a strong likelihood of persistently low interest rates, we recently announced an expense optimization plan. We are taking decisive and appropriate actions to reduce our expense base, both temporarily reflecting the weaker revenue environment, and also permanently based on long-term structural saving opportunities. Our four key strategic priorities remain intact, leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies, and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection. We will put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on the areas that have the highest probability of driving strong financial returns and generate long-term value for shareholders in order for us to emerge from the current environment, a top performing regional bank. Our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues, we continue focus on disciplined expense management to serve us well as we navigate this challenging environment. I would like to once again thank our employees. I'm very proud the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers, our communities, and each other during these unprecedented times. Our commitment to generate sustainable value for our stakeholders is evident in our inaugural, environmental, social, and governance report as we also became the first U.S. commercial bank to join the SASB alliance in the GRI community report, and other health disclosures are available for your review on a dedicated ESG page on our Investor Relations' website. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter results, our current outlook.\nTayfun Tuzun: Thank you, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let's move to the financial highlights on slide three of the earnings presentation. Reported results for this quarter were negatively impacted by three notable items, a $30 million after-tax charge related to our previously announced restructuring plan, a $17 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap, and $4 million after-tax from COVID-related expenses. Strong operating results for the quarter reflected solid business performance throughout the bank, as well as the impact to provision, which resulted from our best quarterly charge-off performance since mid-2019 stabilization and key forward looking macroeconomic indicators compared to the past several quarters as well as lower period end balances. Although we are seeing relative stability in the key macroeconomic variables used in our reserve calculations, we continue to take a cautious approach, given remaining uncertainties related to the pandemic and the economy. Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes GDP remains below the end of 2019 levels until the second quarter of 2022, with an unemployment rate worse than the current environment, remaining elevated above 8% through 2021. Our base case is generally more conservative than the Fed base scenario published last month. Our downside scenario assumes that GDP will remain below the end of 2019 levels until the second quarter of 2023 with unemployment further deteriorating from the third quarter exceeding 12% through the first half of improving until improving to 11% by the end of 2021 and reaching 8.4% by the end of \u201822. If we were to assign a 100% probability to the downside scenario we would likely require an additional $1.2 billion in reserve based on our balance sheet exposures. Reported and adjusted revenue grew 2%, despite the generally weak environment, as we outperformed our previous fee and NII expectations. Total non-interest income excluding the impact of security gains was up 5% sequentially, 3 percentage points better than our previous guidance. With respect to the outside securities gains this quarter, it is important to note that our unrealized gains in the portfolio at the end of the quarter remained very high at $2.7 billion. Our very deliberate actions over the past few years that focused on structuring the portfolio in an anticipation for a lower rate environment should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds. Having said that, even continue to be prudent in managing the gains for the best outcome for our shareholders, cognizant that these gains will continue to be subject to future volatility, especially to fluctuations in the current pre-payment environment.  This quarter, a small portion of our portfolio gains cushion the impact of the restructuring charges that we incurred -- related to our expense reduction plan, which we believe was a prudent risk based action in light of the current environment. Reported and adjusted non-interest expenses were flat year over year. On a sequential basis, adjusted expenses increased slightly more than our previous guidance of up 2%. We are in the midst of executing our expense reduction actions announced last month, which will generate annual efficiencies of $200 million starting in 2021 with an additional $100 million, $150 million of annual efficiencies to be generated starting in 2022. As a result of our strong revenue performance and continued expense discipline PPNR increased sequentially and outperformed our July guidance by approximately $15 million. Given the strong PPNR performance combined with the credit related improvements, we generated strong reported and adjusted return metrics. Adjusted ROA of 1.24% and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18.2% excluding ALCI despite growing our regulatory capital of 42 basis points during the quarter. Excluding the security gains, our adjusted ROTC was nearly 17% even on a credit normalized basis, our underlying ROTC performance is indicative of the strength of the franchise and our ability to successfully navigate a low rate environment.  Moving to slide 4, total average loans declined 4% sequentially within our previous guidance range. CNI loan balance trends continue to reflect lower revolve utilization rates, which declined by 15% from the minute April peak to 33% at quarter end and declined by 5% since the end of June. The decrease in average CNI loans was partially offset by an increase in average auto loan balances. Due to the uneven nature of revolving utilization rates and the impact of PPP loans, we are providing period-end loan balance performance. Revolving line of credit balance has decreased in excess of $3 billion, which constituted approximately three-fourths of the end of period balance quarter-over-quarter decline. Line utilization trends so far in the first two weeks of the fourth quarter indicate continued low utilization levels, which we expect will likely persist at least through the end of this year. C&I client pipelines remain generally soft, but have somewhat improved relative to last quarter. Average and period-end CRE loans decreased 1% sequentially. As we discussed before, we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current economic environment, and potential changes in the post-pandemic economy, which continues to favor low exposure and focus on high quality borrower in this sector. Average total consumer loans, increased 1% sequentially continued growth in the auto portfolio was offset by declines in home equity and credit cards. Auto production in the quarter was strong at $1.8 billion with average FICO scores around 780, and lower advanced rates, higher internal scores, better spreads and a higher concentration of new versus used autos compared to recent quarters. Most of the other consumer loan categories continue to reflect the generally subdued borrower demand. Our securities portfolio of around $35 billion decreased 2% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of the sales, as well as continued pay down. Unless the market environment changes, we are unlikely to use any of the excess liquidity to grow our investment portfolio in the long-term. The underlying risk return profile of many of the investment options is not attractive in light of the impact of the aggressive monetary actions that the Fed is executing. Average other short-term investments, which includes interest bearing cash increased $10 billion, compared to the prior quarter and increased $27 billion, compared to the year ago quarter, the significant increase in excess cash is the outcome of the ongoing decline in loan balances combined with record deposit growth over the past six months. Moving on to slide 5. Compared to the prior quarter, average core deposits increased 4% with growth in all deposits captions, except other time deposits. Average demand deposits represented 33% of total core deposits in the current quarter, compared to 31% in the prior quarter. Average commercial transaction deposits increased 6% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 3%. The deposit growth, came from improvement in every line of business, and was very granular across product types and customer size. Overall, the deposit performance reflects our strong long standing client relationships, and our customers desire to remain liquid. In addition to growth in deposit dollars, we once again generate consumer household growth during the quarter, reflecting strong production, as well as limited attrition. As shown on slide 6, we have continued to take proactive steps, which are predominantly focused on the right side of the balance sheet to mitigate the impact of lower rates, which should provide additional support in the coming quarter, compared to the second quarter, we lowered our interest bearing core deposit rates 14 basis points, more than our expectations, while continuing to generate strong deposit growth. As a result, our September interest bearing core deposit rate is now just 11 basis points with total core deposit costs of just seven basis points, both well below the floors from the previous rate cycle. We expect fourth quarter interest bearing core deposit costs to benefit from our actions and decline another few basis points. Our loan to core deposit ratio improved to 72% as our short-term investments predominantly interest bearing cash were approximately $31 billion at quarter end. Excluding PPP, our loan to core deposit ratio was 69%. Currently, there are no strong indications that the liquidity profile of our balance sheet is likely to change soon as loan growth continues to be elusive and investment opportunities relatively unattractive, we will remain -- we will maintain our short-term cash balances at these levels until further notice. Turning to slide seven, reported and adjusted NII decreased 2% compared to the prior quarter. The decline was primarily attributable to lower C&I balances and the impact of lower market rates. These impacts were partially offset by the reduction in deposit costs, the full quarter impact of PPP loans, day counts, and the favorable impact of previously executed cash flow hedges. As you can see on the slide, the hedges added an incremental $10 million to our third quarter NII for a total contribution of $72 million during the quarter. Purchase accounting adjustments benefited our third quarter net interest margin by three basis points this quarter. Our adjusted NIM decreased 16 basis points sequentially, driven by the unfavorable impacts from elevated cash balances, which created an approximate 15 basis point drag on NIM compared to the prior quarter, lower market rates, and lower C&I balances, partially offset by benefits from our actions to lower deposit costs, and the previously executed cash flow hedges. As we have been highlighting all along our interest rate risk hedging strategy has two pillars, the structure and composition of our investment portfolio and the size and duration of our derivative portfolio. As I stated earlier, our swaps and floors contributed $72 million this quarter. Our portfolio premium amortization was only $1 million and our portfolio yield declined only seven basis points. You can easily see that our investment portfolio does not erode the protection provided by derivative portfolio like it has for many of our peers. And importantly, we have protection in both portfolios longer than our peers. Excluding the impact of excess cash relative to historical averages and the lower yielding PPP loans, normalized NIM was approximately 3.03% for the third quarter. We expect that we will continue to be able to generate a normalized NIM of around 3% for the foreseeable future helped by our interest rate hedges and investment portfolio composition. The fourth quarter NII and NIM are both expected to remain stable. Our guidance has no accelerated benefits from PPP loan forbearance [ph]. Moving on to slide eight, we once again had a strong quarter generating fee revenues that offset the pressure on interest income. The resilience in our total fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved. Adjusted non-interest income, excluding the benefit of securities gains increased 5% sequentially, exceeding our previous guidance by approximately $20 million. The strong performance reflected another solid quarter in capital market. Strong performance in wealth and asset management and rebounds in deposit service charges, card and processing revenue and in leasing business. In our commercial business, the strong capital markets revenue was down from the record set last quarter but was up approximately 8% from the year-ago quarter. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $23 million sequentially primarily driven by an unfavorable MSR net evaluation adjustment and an increase in MSR resulting from higher prepayment fees. Current quarter mortgage originations up $4.5 billion, 32% compared to the prior quarter. Asset management fees increased 10% sequentially, benefiting from stronger market conditions, improved brokerage fees and the continuation of positive AUM flows. With strong wealth and asset management performance over the past several quarters reflects our prioritized investments in this business both in talent upgrades as well as acquisitions to improve the ROE profile of our company. Card and processing revenue increased $10 million or 12%, reflecting increases in credit and debit transaction volumes resulting from continues normalization in consumer spending patterns. Deposit service charges increased $22 million or 18%, with improving commercial deposit fee reflecting a partial loan realization of treasury management service volumes and lower earning credits as well as elevated consumer deposit fees compared to the prior quarter which included hardship-related fee waivers. We expect processing revenues and deposit fees to be stable to slightly higher in the fourth quarter. Moving on to slide 9, third quarter reported pretax expenses included restructuring charges of $8 million, intangible amortization expense of $12 million and COVID-related expenses of $5 million. Adjusting for these items and prior-period items shown in our materials, non-interest expense increased 3% sequentially and decreased $1 million compared to the year-ago quarter. As we discussed first in September during the Barclays Conference, in light of revenue headwinds, we are taking action to reduce our annual 2021 run rate expenses by approximately $200 million. We have started taking appropriate actions in September and expect to finalize all actions by the end of this quarter. We will share with you the full set of details in January during our fourth quarter earnings call when we will also give you an outlook for the direction of our expenses in 2021. With respect to personnel decisions, we expect to generate the full run-rate savings beginning in the first quarter of 2021. In addition to the staffing optimization, we remain on track to deliver the remaining savings through accommodation of process re-engineering, rationalization of certain smaller non-core businesses, vendor re-negotiations and corporate real estate rationalization which are all progressing as well as the savings associated with reduction in our branch network. While we will continue to open branches in our existing high growth southeast markets to generate household and revenue growth, we expect to further optimize our network by closing an additional 37 branches in the first quarter of 2021, predominantly in the Midwest. As we have discussed before, the recent acceleration in customer digitals adoption trends, raising the returns on our technology investments made over the past several years. This gives us increased conviction that we can continue to optimize our branch network while also expanding our presence in high growth markets. Also, our investments and focus on process re-engineering and our areas of our operations will allow us to permanently optimize our expenses in our middle office and back office functions. We believe that approximately 20% of the 2021 savings are environment dependence. When the market rebounds and sustains economic recovery, we will re-adjust these resources accordingly. In addition to a near-term savings target, we also announced a longer-term expense strategy which will help us achieve an additional $100 million to $150 million in run rate savings, starting in 2022 through investments in lean process automation. Slide 10 provides an update on our COVID-19 high impact portfolios. The amounts on this page represent approximately 10% of our total loans and our down 8% from last quarter excluding PPP loans. As you can see, the paydowns during the quarter reduced our balances relative to the second quarter in all sub-categories, except for leisure travel where we have a rather small overall exposure, all to larger operators. The total balances on this slide include approximately $1 billion from our leveraged loan portfolio which remains below $4 billion and has decreased 7% sequentially. The information on this slide lays out the reasons why we believe that our client selection in these portfolios has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that have access to capital in stressed environments and where we have the appropriate credit mitigants in place to limit the ultimate loss content in these portfolios. On slide 11, we provide an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios. The FICO scores clearly indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over 57% containing FICO scores of 750 or higher on a balance-rated basis. Approximately 90% of the consumer portfolio is secured. And as you can see by our FICO band distributions, our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high prime/super prime space. As we have previously discussed, we have taken proactive steps to enhance our underwriting standards, specifically on minimum FICO scores and maximum LTV levels in addition to increasing our efforts in collections. Turning to credit results on slide 12. The net charge-off ratio, were 45 basis points improved, 9 basis points sequentially. The sequential improvement reflects stable outcomes in both portfolios with the commercial credit favorability coming from better resolutions as well as expansion and consumer credit continuing to exhibit results that are more commensurate with a strong or employment environment. Borrowers have been clearly helped by the stimulus and COVID-related relief programs. And those who request an additional 180 days of mortgage payment assistance as provided under the CARES Act will benefit into next year. NPAs remain generally well behaved at 84 basis points. The sequential increase was entirely in commercial with growth coming predominantly from our COVID high impact portfolios and some credits in the energy portfolio, which we believe will ultimately result in a low-loss content. Our ACL ratio declined only by 1 basis point sequentially to 2.49% reflecting the stability in both the current macroeconomic environment, as well as the drivers of the forward looking scenarios. The low level of net charge-offs, combined with the $116 million decline in the allowance, reflecting a lower period end loans resulted in a net $15 million benefit to the provision. Slide 13 provides more information on the allocation of our allowance and the composition of the changes this quarter commercial. In commercial, higher reserve coverage was warranted due to ratings migration during the quarter. This was partially offset by lower end-of-period balances compared to last quarter. In consumer, the change in reserve coverage reflects improvements in the expected loss content in the portfolio. Including the impact of approximately $150 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.62%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans, with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.75%. Our reserves reflect the current macroeconomic expectations embedded in the scenarios that we deploy in this exercise. But the outlook does not further deteriorate; there should not be a need to increase our reserve coverage beyond the current levels. Turning to slide 14, our capital and liquidity positions remain strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at over 10.1%, above our stated target of around 9.5%. Given the dynamics during the quarter, we providing you a CET1 reconciliation between net income, risk weighted assets and the impact of dividends. As you can see, dividend payouts constitute a very small portion of the change in CET1. We expect to have adequate capital and trailing reported net income to maintain our current dividend for the foreseeable future. We will be resubmitting our stress tested in early November, with the rest of the CCAR banks. We have been very consistent in stating our view that given our very strong capital ratios, balance sheet strength, earnings power and relatively modest pre-COVID dividend payout ratio, we expect to fare well. We believe that our performance in this downturn ultimately will prove the resiliency of our model. Our tangible book value per share was $23.06 this quarter, up 9% year-over-year. At the end of the quarter, our unrealized pre-tax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately $3.8 billion, which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios. From a liquidity perspective, we have over $100 billion in total liquidity sources. Slide 15 provides a summary of our fourth quarter outlook. We expect a decline in total loan -- average loan balances of approximately 2% on a quarter over quarter basis, with a 4% to 5% decline in commercial loans and a 1% to 2% increase in consumer balances. The decline in commercial balances is a result of expected paydowns in commercial credit lines. Net interest income and NIM are expected to be stable to last quarter, assuming no benefits from accelerated amortization of PPP fees. We expect non-interest income to increase 7% to 8% sequentially, including the recognition of our TRA of approximately $70 million. We expect our expenses to be flat to slightly up. Total net charge offs are expected to be in the 40 to 50 basis point range. In summary, our third quarter results were strong. And continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years, improving our resiliency, diversifying our revenues, and proactively managing the balance sheets. We will continue to rely on the same principals. We settle in client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on the long-term performance horizon which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. We fully intend to preserve the optimal level of efficiency of our operations in this weak revenue environment, while we maintain the investments that we believe are vital to preserve the earnings power and the operational resilience y of our company. With that, let me turn it over to Chris, to open the call up for the Q&A.\nChris Doll: Thanks, Tayfun. [Operator Instructions] Marcella, please open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is come from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKen Zerbe: Great. Thank you. In terms of your expense initiatives, just given that most of that falls to the bottom-line, is it possible that we see expenses down on an absolute basis in 2021?\nGreg Carmichael: Ken this is Greg. First off we provide 2021 guidance after our fourth quarter, earnings net call. We'll talk more about that. As we talk about our expense optimization plans, 200 million that we expect to be out by the end of first quarter, 75% of the actions necessary to accomplish that objective have already been completed. So we're highly confident in our ability to take out that $200 million, by the end of the first quarter. And then we mentioned another 100 million to 150 million that will show up in 2022. Once again we focused mainly on automation, investing in our technology platforms. So we're very confidence. But we'll provide guidance as far as our expense numbers as we get through the fourth quarter.\nTayfun Tuzun: Yeah. I think Ken and the other point that I want to make about the program is, we stated that the composition is 80% to 20% between currently in savings and environment-related savings of 20%. But that environment-related savings number is really, how we see 2021. So the other lever that we have here is if things actually look worse or will be worse next year compared to our assumptions, we still will continue to adjust those numbers. So we say that part of it is going to be variable. And it does have more potential, depending upon the economic environment. Obviously, our preference would be that the, be stronger. And we don't have to necessarily go back to that world. But we do have the availability.\nKen Zerbe: All right, great. And just one follow-up, Tayfun you mentioned that you don't expect invest the excess cash, can you just help us understand like why not invest in it sounds like something very short-term securities with little risk that would generate a lot more than or at least a little more than cash returns?\nTayfun Tuzun: Ken, we don't believe that the tradeoff between the small NII incrementality versus the market exposure is worth taking at this point. It really does not -- from your perspective, our ability to invest the money in the short-term, doesn't really add much to the long-term performance to the company. So, because we believe that, that cash is going to ultimately leave the company over time. So therefore we are more interested in shielding ourselves from a market-to-market exposure because the market volatility continues to be a concern for us related to all investments.\nKen Zerbe: All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKen Usdin: Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. A follow-up on the loan side. So obviously you guys have I think been more or fort rite than other about the declines in loans that you're expecting and the quality of the commercial book. Can you just give us some thoughts just as you look across the footprint of where, if at all, you see activity starting to change from a pacing perspective and at what point would you see the loan book especially the commercial side C&I starting to bottom out?\nGreg Carmichael: This is Greg. First off, on the loan side on commercial, look at our pipelines, we're seeing some growth in positive forward progress in the area of healthcare, telecom and technology would be two other areas that we're seeing some good growth. And also, the industrials would be the areas that we're most encouraged by as we look ahead here. So we feel pretty good. As we mentioned on the consumer side, we expect the growth 1% to 2% the next quarter and that business continues to perform well. So that's where I think we have the biggest opportunities.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Got it. And then in terms of the deposit side, you've got so good growth and you mentioned some opportunities to still re-price. What other offsets do you have on the right side of the balance sheet, if any to continue to roll down either the fixed term \u2013 fixed short-term borrowings, long-term debt footprint in addition to deposit pricing?\nGreg Carmichael: We don't really have a lot of long-term debt opportunities other than just running the maturity schedules at this point. So, you know, we've pretty much executed what was available to us. We're looking at some small items maybe bad debt we securitized in the past. But those are small opportunities, so there's not a whole lot remaining there.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And then last quick one, Tayfun you mentioned that you're not really interested in building the securities portfolio. Other banks have started to put some of their liquidity to work in contrast. Can you just walk through your philosophy on that and how you expect to just manage overall balance sheet size then if you are not \u2013 net reinvesting?\nTayfun Tuzun: Again, as I mentioned, when can ask the question. At this point, we don't believe that the trade-off between incremental NII associated with margin investments and continuing to expose ourselves to an unattractive mark-to-market environment related to those investments is as attractive. So, at this point, we will continue to watch. Now, those decisions are made on a week-to-week, month-to-mouth basis. If you find opportunities, we will be in the market. But at this point, given what we know today, we are currently choosing to be on the sidelines.\nKen Usdin: Understood. Sorry, I missed that one.\nOperator: Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nGreg Carmichael: Hi, Mike.\nMike Mayo: Hey. I guess, I have a wow on the positive side and a wow on the negative side. So the wow on the positive side would be only 35 basis points of loan losses and lowest consumer charges off in 15 years. So that's quite noteworthy. But the wow on the negative side is, a negative provision seems like an outlier. And do you really want to set a tone at this stage of the cycle of taking a negative provision? I mean, you might be right, but you might be wrong. But we don't really know, how this is going to play out. So I guess, my questions are, you said if you had your downside scenario at 100%, that would be 1.3 billion of additional reserves. How much overlay do you have for that downside scenario now? That's number one. Number two, when you mentioned that there were commercial extensions, what does that mean? Is that delaying some of the inevitable? And you did say that loan losses would go up from year. And then third, just the whole tone perspective like it set the tone that that things are okay.\nTayfun Tuzun: So, this is Tayfun. Let me take the first part of that and then I'll turn it over to Jamie for his comments. Look, I mean I think as you know at the end of the first quarter, at the end of the second quarter, we came out much more aggressively in terms of building reserves relative to the peers. And when you look at our coverage, it is 2.49% or 2.62% or 2.75%, we are still above the median levels of our peers. And internally obviously when we look at the risk profile of our loan book, we feel very good about it. And, two, we really did not take the cover ratio down. It's only from 2.50% to 2.49. And the balances obviously are lower at the end of the quarter, which have an impact. In terms of rating of the base scenario, we actually increased the lowest wage of the base of the base scenario this and increase the wage of the scenario this quarter. So we are quite cognizant of potential downturns in the economy. But, look, I mean, the underlying profile, credit profile of our balance sheet and the outstanding balances resulted in a release. And we have to abide by certain accounting principles and do the right thing. So that's from my side. Jamie, any comments from your side?\nJamie Leonard: Yeah, and Mike, thanks for the question. When we looked at the net provision, it really is an output. And when we break it down into the two inputs, the CECL reserve, the release was 116 million in the quarter. And as we said, it's driven primarily by the payoffs and paydowns in the commercial loan book. And as Tayfun mentioned, the economic outlook did improve during the quarter, both from unemployment and GDP perspective, which does lower our loss expectations in the portfolio. But given the uncertainty in the environment of especially related to additional government support, we increased the weightings on the upside and downside in the scenarios from 10% last quarter to 20% this quarter. And those scenarios really have an asymmetrical profile, so it ultimately increases the required CECL reserve and essentially offsets the benefit from the improvement in the economic outlook. And to your other question then, if we were to run a scenario where it's -- there are no upside or downside scenario and we just said 100% is base, then the reserve requirement would be 250 million less than what it is today. So to your point, the downside scenario does result in a higher CECL reserve than roughly 250 million or so range.\nTayfun Tuzun: The other part of the question, I mean it's your job to work with the borrowers, try to bridge the gap between the pre and post-COVID economies, but when you have commercial extensions, I think that's where a lot of people are focused, do you accept that you extend -- you drop covenants, you looseen covenants, I don't really -- there's a whole litany of things that you can do to make the life for borrowers easier, in some cases, probably most cases that will make sense, but in some cases that might not make sense. So what are you doing when you mentioned commercial extensions earlier?\nRichard Stein: Hey, Mike, it's Richard, I'll take that one. It really is, as you described, working with the borrowers, trying to understand their cash flow needs, their cash flow availability, the collateral that's available that maybe we don't have as part of a security package. So it's really just reworking the transactions, making sure that we're being thoughtful about things like maturity dates and extending maturity dates so that or reamortizing transactions with the cash flow. So it's really part of the workout process to make sure that we can be as accommodative as we can within the risk appetite support our customers and minimize losses over the long-term.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Sorry if I missed it, but did you guys say, how much of the 200 million of savings is in the third quarter runrate?\nTayfun Tuzun: In the fourth quarter run rate or third quarter?\nMatt O\u2019Connor: I guess\u2026\nTayfun Tuzun: There's nothing in the third quarter and large majority of the savings will come in the first quarter of 2021.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. So not now and most of the 200 will be in 1Q on average and then in the second quarter.\nTayfun Tuzun: Correct. That's correct.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then looking ahead to the kind of -- so most of that has already been identified I think you said in your earlier comments. And then looking ahead to the $100 million and $150 million, remind us what some of those drivers might be and could identified?\nTayfun Tuzun: The opportunity is great, really focuses on our investments in technology, artificial intelligence. You look at our operations, we've done a really good job of being very efficient, but we still have more opportunities over there to reduce our people-related costs and really automate a lot of functions and processes and create more resiliencey and high quality outcomes. So we are very focused on process reengineering, automation. We've identified those process opportunities. We've got teams working aggressively on them. And we fully expect to achieve those objectives going forward. That will show up more in 2022 than it will in 2021 and give the time it takes to put some of these process, these re-engineering exercises in place.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question.\nTayfun Tuzun: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Siefers: Hey. Appreciate you taking the question. You guys are one of the few guys that have offered a charge-off assumption for next year and you said it a few times well below a percent. So, I guess in that vein, curious how you guys are thinking about how this cycle will end up trajecting? In other words, will we be taking care of most of the losses from this cycle next year? Or will they bleed into 2022 at a higher rate, as well? And I guess part of that question is because you guys have such a strong reserve that if losses indeed stay well below a percent, I guess I'm curious under CECL, at what point it becomes more challenging even to substantiate today's reserves? In other words, you don't just look adequately reserve, but potentially very over reserved. So I'm just curious about how you just think about those dynamics?\nTayfun Tuzun: There's a lot of moving pieces, Scott, as you think about what's occurring right now with the amount of stimulus that was thrown at on the pandemic, whether we get the CARES Act next iteration of that, how's that going to be distributed with respect to PPP potential, consumer stimulus opportunities. So, there's a lot of variables involved here. But what we have visibility of right now as you think about the consumer side. We can see forward looking our roll rates, and we think we're in pretty good shape. The consumers are in a pretty good shape as we get into the \u2013 until we get into the second half of next year and it\u2019s going to depend on the variables I mentioned and some of the actions that are being taken. So more to come there, that's probably more of the second half of 2021, and we start to see those losses creep up if we don't get next iteration in the CARES Act. On the commercial side once again, a lot of challenges with respect to how we think about the sector because it really gets back to when do we see a vaccine out there? How effective is it? How is it being distributed certain parts of the economy are opening reopening quicker than the other parts of the economy? Southeast is reopened quicker right now. We\u2019re seeing positive outcomes there from a production standpoint. So this is a lot going on right now, which you can show yourself, because that's going to be very cautious. We came out with aggressive reserve levels. We're going to be very thoughtful and mindful about how we map our environment looks going forward and expectations are. And what's happening with some of the [indiscernible]. Jamie if you want to give more color on it.\nJamie Leonard: Thanks for the question. As we look out at 2021 and we say well below 1%, that for us our models would indicate loss rate in the 70 basis points to 80 basis points range and that's as we sit here today with obviously a lot of uncertainty between the path of the virus and the path of stimulus. And when we look at and analyze a lot of data, especially consumer portfolios as Greg said a little bit easier to predicted model, but we get through all the data, really the simple answer when you pulling it out down as that if you were delinquent going into the pandemic you're going to be delinquent coming out. And if you're healthy going in, you're going healthy coming out. And that's what we're seeing and internally we call it the wind-chill effect. So if it's 50 degrees outside and it could be you get a pretty big tailwind and it feels like it's 30 degrees outside really from an un unemployment perspective, the wind-chill was reported numbers of 13% and now we're sitting around 8%. But the wind-chill, because of all of the stimulus programs and hardship relief, it's actually behaving at a 3% level. And that's why you see such good loss rates from us and our forecast assumption for next year has some stimulus round two backed into it. But if we get more than what we've assumed then those numbers could continue to improve from there.\nScott Siefers: All right. That's perfect. Thank you guys very much for your thoughts.\nOperator: Gerard Cassidy from RBC, your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, everyone.\nTayfun Tuzun: Good morning Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Thanks. Can you share with us, I know you touched on the capital position in your prepared remarks and your CET1 ratio now is over 10%. Can you remind us what your ideal ratio would be in terms of the amount of capital you want to carry to run the company? And then second, obviously the Fed has suspended buybacks for all the large banks including your own. What's your view that once the gate is lifted, assuming it will be, how quickly would you go back into re-purchasing your stock?\nTayfun Tuzun: Gerard, we are at the 10.1% to 4% of CET1 today. I suspect as we look ahead by the end of the year, we will be approaching 10.5% likely and we entered this year coming out of 2019 with a capital ratio target of 9.5%. And that was actually elevated relative to our 9% target just about a year ago before that and we think that even then, back in 2017 and '18, we were making comments that we can run this company with an eight handle capital ratio, but we are very cognizant of where the peers are and the regulators are? So we said okay, 9% probably.  And then as we saw the probability of a recession going up, we lifted back to 9.5%. So from 10.5% to 9.5% assuming that we look ahead to a normalized economy, that's 1% of capital that we either consume by growing loans or we return to shareholders. Tough to predict the timing of the regulatory change in their current position, but I suspect that when we see the results of this CCAR run and when we find out what the regulators are going to do. If the gate opens, I don\u2019t why it would take us a long time to go back to a buyback scenario environment.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And the follow-up, your comments about extending out on the securities portfolio or the cash portfolio, your preference not to do that is very understandable. Would that suggest to us that you are all thinking that interest are likely to rise to 11 [ph] and we'll see a positive yield curve?\nTayfun Tuzun: So our perspective on the interest rate outlook is that we will be in this environment for two, three years. I think it's hard to disagree where the market is pricing the next rate moves. Our concern about -- I mentioned, our concern around not exposing ourselves to a market-to-market. We're also very concerned that in the current environment, the spreads do not reflect the actual risk-return profiles, but they are very skewed by the Fed's aggressive actions. And they turn the credit spreads upside down. And in this environment with that kind of uncertainty, despite the fact that we are expecting this low rate environment to continue for a while, we're choosing to be on the sidelines.  We also expect that down the road here, whether it's going to happen in 2021 or 2022, once the sort of Fed starts either stepping back a little bit, slowing down their aggressiveness and once the market builds a certain level of expectation, whether it's about inflation or about the other end of this rate cycle. The yield curve will start to steepen. We are not necessarily expecting that to happen in the near-term. So a combination of the fact that portion of this cash flow -- cash will leave the bank and also we believe that weighting out until a better investment environment is the better alternative for us. That's why we're sitting out.\nGerard Cassidy: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Saul Martinez from UBS. Your line is open.\nSaul Martinez: Hey, good morning. What weighted average remaining maturity are you using in calculating your CECL results?\nTayfun Tuzun: I\u2019m sorry. Can you repeat that question again?\nSaul Martinez: Yeah. What is the weighted average remaining maturity of your loan book that you are using as the basis for your CECL calculation?\nTayfun Tuzun: I don't necessarily have a number ready, sort of, to give you right now. But I suspect that number is between three and five years.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. So -- and I would think a portion of your C&I book is much shorter because it is, you know, it's based on contract maturity. You do have a fair amount of revolvers -- annual revolvers. If it is in that -- I mean, is one way to think about it than, sort of, what's implicit in the loss content. If you were to use a four years [indiscernible] it would imply that, you know, the 2.5% reserve ratio, implies an average annual loss ratio or charge-off rate is about 60 basis points. Is that -- and you'll be higher than that during the peak and maybe lower than that when the credit cycle, kind of, -- really goes back to normal. Is that, you know, a fair way to think about it? Because three and five years, you know, would have -- depending on what number you use, it does have a pretty material difference in terms of what the underlying assumption is for annual loss content. So, I guess, I mean, is that a good way to think about, sort of, what's interesting, in your estimate? \nTayfun Tuzun: I think, so I think directionally your comment is logical. If you look at page 13. And look at the difference -- that portfolio is within the commercial book. You see that, you know, the commercial mortgage loans, there's a coverage ratio for that one to 3.4%, whereas the -- for the C&I book, it's 2%. It appears, again, your question, and the logic that you're using is reasonable, it gets a little bit skewed in this environment because you know, the we are within -- for the commercial book the bigger impact comes from the reasonable supportable period, which is driven solely by the economic outlook. So the reason why I'm hesitating to say you are correct, is because that relationship does not necessarily readily fail translate to a reasonable annual loss content. So I just want to make that comment on that.\nSaul Martinez: Got it. You know that well understood. But I guess my point is, that the weighted average the main maturity is arguably the most important input into this calculation. And this isn't a comment on two-thirds of the general comment. And we you know, we received virtually no information on that from any bank. So it is, you know, it is a little bit of a disconnect that. I think..\nTayfun Tuzun: We can actually -- important, we can provide you that information. And we can do that -- in a couple [ph] for your basis, which will give you a little bit flow of content.\nSaul Martinez: Yes. One additional question. I want to ask on expenses. I mean, 200 million is almost 5% of your current expense base. And I think in the past, you guys had talked about, you know, the vast majority of that flown into the bottom-line. And then you have the additional expense saves. Is this fair to say we should when all said done expect your run rate expenses to be lower than what they are now? And can you just give us a sense as to the timing, I know you're not going to get one -- you're going to wait to get 2021 guidance, but you know, next quarter you see it costs a little bit but [indiscernible] first quarter has some seasonality. So we're likely pushing closer to 12 billion and expenses going 11 [ph], by the first quarter, potentially, maybe I am wrong. But, you know, is my logic, is right that we should expect expense to be lower on a dollar basis at some point in 2021 versus where we\u2019re at now. And any color on timing and magnitude of that?\nTayfun Tuzun: So, we will maintain our discipline and not give you color on 2021 today.\nSaul Martinez: All right.\nTayfun Tuzun: But what goes against that $200 million expense save is going to be some natural built-in inflation, whether it's related to merit increases or other compensation-related inflation. And, two, is going to be investments in our company. We will continue to make investments in our company. And the technology line item for all the right reasons is going up. What we feel good about it, though, is that we have now established a discipline the company, so look at those investments that are technology-related with a very disciplined return requirement. So, whatever the built-in expense growth is, is not going to be driven by head count increases.\nSaul Martinez: Right.\nTayfun Tuzun: It's going to be driven by very reasonable investments in our business that have a return profile that we all feel comfortable with and that we believe is prioritized based on our corporate objectives.\nSaul Martinez: Yeah, okay. Helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Just one follow-up question, I know we're almost over time. As we think about that adjusted NIM of 255, assuming no impact from PPP and also, assuming a static balance sheet, how close are we to the trough?\nTayfun Tuzun: I believe we are close, Erika. As we look ahead, we believe that we have now a level of stability that we're comfortable with. Could it be within 2, 3, 4 basis points? Yes, it could be. And obviously the margin itself today is probably less meaningful of the metric than it has ever been because it's the influence of the cash balances that we're sitting on. But I do believe that with an assumption that we will live in this highly liquid environment for a while, we are now pretty close to achieving stability here even if we sort of maintain the level of cash. And the faster we get out of the cash position, the faster we're going to start moving towards that 3% number that we believe are natural NIM stands out. But what gives us confidence there, when you think about it, we have $35 billion in the investment portfolio. Our sort of normal level of earning assets is about $150 billion. So, and we have -- I believe it's going to take us, two, three years to get down to where our peers are in their investment portfolio in this low rate environment. We have a huge advantage there. And then we have a significantly longer derivative portfolio compared to most of our peers. Those two give us a pretty reasonable confidence that once we get out of this liquidity environment, we will actually show you a pretty decent margin performance.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Bill Carcache from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nBill Carcache: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. If we set hedging benefits aside, could you discuss the impact of rates at the long end of the curve remaining low, how much are you receiving each quarter on loan and securities portfolio paydowns from your back book? And what's the yield differential between what's coming off and what you're putting on across products that should also give us a sense of how much you could benefit from curve steeping?\nTayfun Tuzun: Yeah. So, on the investment portfolio, you have seen our yields went down by 7 basis points and we're not investing anything. And the cash flows are reasonably small, so that's the step down in portfolio yields could be relatively small compared to that's what I will say about that. In terms of the other fixed portfolios, in the auto portfolio, which is really the portfolio that is growing right now, we are probably the current coupons are probably about 20 basis points or so below the portfolio yield. So when you think about that, that really is the portfolio, loan portfolio, that's the only one that's exposed to a fixed rate repricing.\nBill Carcache: Thanks, Tayfun.\nTayfun Tuzun: Yep.\nOperator: John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. Just a couple on the credit front. Do you have what you're criticized or classified assets did the third quarter?\nRichard Stein: Yeah. Hey \u2013 it's Richard. We had a slight uptick in the third quarter we'll give you the details in the Q. It was \u2013 it was really around the things that you would imagine across leisure as the cycle continues to extend.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. All right. And then the other thing on the credit front, but it's not on the loan side, you \u2013 I know commercial mortgage back securities make up a larger percentage of your securities portfolio than peers. And I know you indicated that Tayfun, you indicated that commercial real estate is particularly vulnerable. Do you have any concerns around how that credit dynamic within commercial real estate could impact your bond investments?\nGreg Carmichael: We don't, I think we've \u2013 the commercial real estate the non-agent commercial \u2013 I'm sorry, non-agency commercial real estate book that we have is smaller portion. It's about $3 billion or so in the portfolio. And it's all superseding. So the built in credit content of that portfolio does not give us any concern.\nJamie Leonard: And John, it's Jamie, I guess since I bought a lot of those bonds, I can tell you that I keep an eye on them in the delinquency rates, like high single digits in the book. And the credit enhancement is approaching 40%. So we are a long way away from having any credit issues in that portfolio it.\nJohn Pancari: All right, Jamie. Thank you. That's helpful. If I can ask just one more question, I know you mentioned you're prioritizing investments in your asset and wealth management, including acquisitions, and we actually have seen some asset manager deals, larger ones, in the industry recently. Is that something you will consider as a potential acquisition of an asset manager for your business there?\nGreg Carmichael: Yeah. This is Greg. First off, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve invested heavily in our fee businesses and registration of our fee businesses and diversification of our fee businesses. That's going to shoot well, wealth and asset management is one of the areas that we're very focused on with respect to additional opportunities both from the acquisition of an entity of nature speaking up or account NIM in that business, and as you've seen, that business has grown really well for us over the years, up 10% sequentially. So we'll continue to look for those opportunities. And, yes, that will be included in that potential opportunity.\nTayfun Tuzun: Anything that was slightly larger than our size? So appetite, so we just read that one, right?\nJohn Pancari: Yeah, got it. All right. Thank you, appreciate.\nOperator: Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.\nChristopher Marinac: Excited similar question that Jonathan Callie asked about classified and criticized. So when you have the commercial extensions, do those get picked up a special mention? Or there is something else has to happen before those would migrate?\nRichard Stein: It's Richard again. If the two words are separate, we think about, when we think about workouts. The rating is the rating and then the workout strategies to workout strategy. Now, I think when we think about things that impact or reduce charge offs, clearly that's going to be in the criticize category, whether it's special mention or substandard. But we don't have the details about around the breakup, between those two. Remember, if you think about as Tayfun mention that is a potential weakness. And there's a ton of judgment of what a potential weakness looks like. It just effectively means higher probability of default, substandard, again another step down in terms of the fault probability. But again, that's a place where we're mitigates like collateral starts to come into play.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. So some of the extensions could be there now, but others could transition later. It's just \u2026\nRichard Stein: Absolutely. And as I said, before, we start thinking about extensions. We're also looking at structural and other mitigates like structural enhancements, guaranteed, collateral. There's other ways we can work with a borrower to help them and protect the day.\nChristopher Marinac: Got you. Sounds good, Richard. Thank you very much for the insight. Thanks for all the information this morning.\nRichard Stein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Vivek Jain from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nVivek Jain: For squeezing me in just a couple of questions. Jamie, I think you mentioned if you're healthy going in, you'll be healthy going out, we're referring to consumers, corporates. And how are you thinking about, what the pandemic does change in the economy. And the way things work?\nTayfun Tuzun: Yeah, I was referring to the consumer portfolio, where we have, so much me of information. And then we are just trying to make it as simple as possible. No matter how you slice and dice the data. The bottom line is and there was such a big focus on hardship related and hardship programs and deferral ways all of those things. And no matter how you slice and dice the data. The bottom line is, you know, and there was such a big focus on hardship, relief and hardship programs, and re-default rates, referral rate, all of those things. But no matter how you slice it, it really just comes down to something as simple as you're coming in, you're going to be helping coming out, from a consumer perspective. And that's why that consumer performance really does reflect, frankly, credit losses and credit projections, as if unemployment weren't 3%. So we feel very, very good about that. I think, to your point about, how this ultimately plays out in the economy, it really is the competing forces of the path of the virus versus the path of further stimulus. So if we get an additional round of stimulus, we think the loss curves continue to flatten, perhaps elongate. But again, the peak charge-offs, aren't going to be all that high, relative to the great financial crisis, especially for a bank like the third. Where we've put a lot of thought and effort over the last five years to position the company, as well as we have so that we think our loss rates are a fourth of what they were in the great financial crisis. So we feel good about that.\nVivek Jain: So that means even with, if you think post pandemic, even if un unemployment runs at a higher run-rate, you think you'll be fine is what you're assuming?\nTayfun Tuzun: We do, but again the stimulus and what that looks like will certainly be a big swing factor in those loss projections. So, for example, on the consumer side, we also are in different model efforts where we took out stimulus altogether, and so, we modeled that as a 20 basis point change in our outcomes if they are going to be no stimulus, so just to put guardrails on what these outcomes might look like.\nVivek Jain: One more, if I may, completely different topic. What are you seeing in terms deposits on the pure end basis were flattish, but more if you think about consumer and corporate deposits, Tayfun, Jamie, what are you all seeing in terms of the trends there? Slowing static? Still growing? Any color on that?\nTayfun Tuzun: Vivek, we are seeing stable consumer deposits. They're not going down, but we're not seeing any noticeable increases in consumer deposits at very healthy levels there. But we are not seeing further increases. The commercial balance has continued to pick up and I suspect that will in the fourth quarter. It's an election quarter. And there's a lot of hesitancy on the corporate side to do anything different at this point. I do believe that come early 2021, hopefully we will see some more emerging signs. It\u2019s hard to predict yet which side it will go. But that will be dependent on the economy. So for the foreseeable future, we see maybe small upticks in corporate balances and stable consumer balance.\nVivek Jain: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to Chris Doll for closing remarks.\nChris Doll: All right. Thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR department.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Hey, Mike, it's Richard, I'll take that one. It really is, as you described, working with the borrowers, trying to understand their cash flow needs, their cash flow availability, the collateral that's available that maybe we don't have as part of a security package. So it's really just reworking the transactions, making sure that we're being thoughtful about things like maturity dates and extending maturity dates so that or reamortizing transactions with the cash flow. So it's really part of the workout process to make sure that we can be as accommodative as we can within the risk appetite support our customers and minimize losses over the long-term. Yeah. Hey \u2013 it's Richard. We had a slight uptick in the third quarter we'll give you the details in the Q. It was \u2013 it was really around the things that you would imagine across leisure as the cycle continues to extend. It's Richard again. If the two words are separate, we think about, when we think about workouts. The rating is the rating and then the workout strategies to workout strategy.

            "name": "Jamie Leonard",
            "content": "Yeah, and Mike, thanks for the question. When we looked at the net provision, it really is an output. And when we break it down into the two inputs, the CECL reserve, the release was 116 million in the quarter. And as we said, it's driven primarily by the payoffs and paydowns in the commercial loan book. And as Tayfun mentioned, the economic outlook did improve during the quarter, both from unemployment and GDP perspective, which does lower our loss expectations in the portfolio. But given the uncertainty in the environment of especially related to additional government support, we increased the weightings on the upside and downside in the scenarios from 10% last quarter to 20% this quarter. And those scenarios really have an asymmetrical profile, so it ultimately increases the required CECL reserve and essentially offsets the benefit from the improvement in the economic outlook. And to your other question then, if we were to run a scenario where it's -- there are no upside or downside scenario and we just said 100% is base, then the reserve requirement would be 250 million less than what it is today. So to your point, the downside scenario does result in a higher CECL reserve than roughly 250 million or so range. Thanks for the question. As we look out at 2021 and we say well below 1%, that for us our models would indicate loss rate in the 70 basis points to 80 basis points range and that's as we sit here today with obviously a lot of uncertainty between the path of the virus and the path of stimulus. And when we look at and analyze a lot of data, especially consumer portfolios as Greg said a little bit easier to predicted model, but we get through all the data, really the simple answer when you pulling it out down as that if you were delinquent going into the pandemic you're going to be delinquent coming out. And if you're healthy going in, you're going healthy coming out. And that's what we're seeing and internally we call it the wind-chill effect. So if it's 50 degrees outside and it could be you get a pretty big tailwind and it feels like it's 30 degrees outside really from an un unemployment perspective, the wind-chill was reported numbers of 13% and now we're sitting around 8%. But the wind-chill, because of all of the stimulus programs and hardship relief, it's actually behaving at a 3% level. And that's why you see such good loss rates from us and our forecast assumption for next year has some stimulus round two backed into it. But if we get more than what we've assumed then those numbers could continue to improve from there. And John, it's Jamie, I guess since I bought a lot of those bonds, I can tell you that I keep an eye on them in the delinquency rates, like high single digits in the book. And the credit enhancement is approaching 40%. So we are a long way away from having any credit issues in that portfolio it."

            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I hope you are all doing well and staying healthy. Once again, our financial results were strong despite the challenges associated with the current environment. As an essential business, we continue to take appropriate actions for our customers, our employees and our communities during the pandemic. Earlier today, we reported third quarter net income available to common shareholders of $562 million or $0.78 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.07 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted third quarter earnings were $0.85 per share. Tayfun will provide more details on the quarterly financial results in his remarks. But I will share some highlights. Our reported adjusted return metrics were solid, reflecting our strong operating results, including a provision for credit loss performance. Our credit losses were significantly better than expectations. At 35 basis points, our third quarter charge-offs were the lowest level in over a year, with improvement in both consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs of 40 basis points is the lowest in the past 15-plus years, reflecting our consistently strong approach to underwriting, as well as the benefits of fiscal stimulus and payment deferrals. Our already strong capital position further improved this quarter. Our CET1 ratio of 10.1% is well above our stated target of around 9.5%, and our income levels, combined with the outcomes from our quarterly stress test continue to suggest that we will maintain our current dividend. Furthermore, we have grown tangible book value per share for 6 consecutive quarters. Our PPNR results were better than our previous expectations, reflecting the strength and resilience of our diverse revenue mix in retail, commercial and wealth and asset management. Based on our fee-based businesses, many of our fee-based businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates. For instance, wealth and asset management revenue increased 10% sequentially as we generated positive AUM inflows again this quarter as we have done in 9 out of the last 10 quarters. Capital markets revenue was up 8% from last year, and was down slightly relative to the record second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, total commercial banking fee revenue was up 16% compared to last year. Topline mortgage revenue is up 45% from the year-ago quarter, with a low rate environment impacting servicing revenue and the MSR valuation. Deposit fees increased 18%, and processing revenue increased 12% sequentially, both better than our previous guidance as we are seeing early signs of normalization in business and consumer spending patterns. While we continue to streamline our operations and position the bank for long-term success, we continue to assess strategic investments in non-bank acquisitions and our fee-based businesses to accelerate revenue growth. For instance, we recently increased our strategic investment in Bellwether Enterprise, a national multiproduct CRE firm, which we originally announced in April. This investment provides clients with a broader set of permanent financing solutions without Fifth Third being exposed to the balance sheet risk associated with longer duration CRE assets. Commercial loan production was relatively stable this quarter compared to the second quarter, offset by further declines in line utilization. Total average loans declined 4% sequentially. Within our previous guidance range, we expect near-term pressure in the loan portfolio to continue. Despite the tepid loan environment, net interest income exceeded our previous guidance as we aggressively reduced our deposit costs in excess of our prior expectations. While the environment remains uncertain, our commercial loan pipelines are beginning to improve in certain areas, particularly in technology, telecom, health care and industrials, which should provide support as we head into next year. Before I turn it over to Tayfun to further discuss the results and outlook, and I'll review our guiding principles, strategic actions and key strategic priorities, which will enable us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value. We have consistently communicated our through-the-cycle principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and overall balance sheet management approach focused on long-term performance. Our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. We have executed numerous strategic actions over the past five years in anticipation of a downturn, which will continue to serve us well. We've reduced our credit risk exposures and built strong reserve coverage. We've built long-term protection to mitigate the impact of lower interest rates. We took decisive actions to reduce our expense base, and we successfully invested in and diversified our fee businesses. From a commercial client standpoint, we continue to focus on generating relationships with clients who have more diversified and resilient businesses. We are confident in our client selection process and proactive approach to credit risk management. We continue to believe we are well positioned relative to peers in commercial real estate, an area where we have been named disciplined. We have focused predominantly on top-tier developers with a track record of resiliency. Our portfolio is well diversified by geography and property type. And as we have discussed before, we continue to be at the low end of peers as a percentage of total capital. In addition to the CRE portfolio, our other lending portfolios continue to do well, be well positioned, combining our strong retail and regional commercial banking franchises in the Midwest and Southeast with our national lending businesses. These portfolios will be instrumental in delivering a differentiated credit performance, given the likelihood of an uneven economic recovery. We're mining our exposures across our total commercial loan portfolio, utilizing early warning systems through a combination of internal portfolio analysis, and third party data. Our relationship teams receive timely alerts that we detect any sign of credit deterioration. This helps us make prompt, prudent and accurate credit rating determinations proactively without waiting for customer statements. Looking ahead to 2021, we continue to expect full year net charge-offs to come in well below 1%. We have also strengthened our balance sheet that building long-term protection, the positioning of our securities, and hedge portfolios. With high likelihood of lower rates for the next several years, our prudent interest rate risk management should help preserve our core margin. Our very strong balance sheet liquidity has enabled us to decisively act in aggressively lower deposit rates. Given the industry wide revenue headwinds, including a strong likelihood of persistently low interest rates, we recently announced an expense optimization plan. We are taking decisive and appropriate actions to reduce our expense base, both temporarily reflecting the weaker revenue environment, and also permanently based on long-term structural saving opportunities. Our four key strategic priorities remain intact, leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies, and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection. We will put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on the areas that have the highest probability of driving strong financial returns and generate long-term value for shareholders in order for us to emerge from the current environment, a top performing regional bank. Our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues, we continue focus on disciplined expense management to serve us well as we navigate this challenging environment. I would like to once again thank our employees. I'm very proud the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers, our communities, and each other during these unprecedented times. Our commitment to generate sustainable value for our stakeholders is evident in our inaugural, environmental, social, and governance report as we also became the first U.S. commercial bank to join the SASB alliance in the GRI community report, and other health disclosures are available for your review on a dedicated ESG page on our Investor Relations' website. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter results, our current outlook. Ken this is Greg. First off we provide 2021 guidance after our fourth quarter, earnings net call. We'll talk more about that. As we talk about our expense optimization plans, 200 million that we expect to be out by the end of first quarter, 75% of the actions necessary to accomplish that objective have already been completed. So we're highly confident in our ability to take out that $200 million, by the end of the first quarter. And then we mentioned another 100 million to 150 million that will show up in 2022. Once again we focused mainly on automation, investing in our technology platforms. So we're very confidence. But we'll provide guidance as far as our expense numbers as we get through the fourth quarter. This is Greg. First off, on the loan side on commercial, look at our pipelines, we're seeing some growth in positive forward progress in the area of healthcare, telecom and technology would be two other areas that we're seeing some good growth. And also, the industrials would be the areas that we're most encouraged by as we look ahead here. So we feel pretty good. As we mentioned on the consumer side, we expect the growth 1% to 2% the next quarter and that business continues to perform well. So that's where I think we have the biggest opportunities. We don't really have a lot of long-term debt opportunities other than just running the maturity schedules at this point. So, you know, we've pretty much executed what was available to us. We're looking at some small items maybe bad debt we securitized in the past. But those are small opportunities, so there's not a whole lot remaining there. Hi, Mike. We don't, I think we've \u2013 the commercial real estate the non-agent commercial \u2013 I'm sorry, non-agency commercial real estate book that we have is smaller portion. It's about $3 billion or so in the portfolio. And it's all superseding. So the built in credit content of that portfolio does not give us any concern. Yeah. This is Greg. First off, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've invested heavily in our fee businesses and registration of our fee businesses and diversification of our fee businesses. That's going to shoot well, wealth and asset management is one of the areas that we're very focused on with respect to additional opportunities both from the acquisition of an entity of nature speaking up or account NIM in that business, and as you've seen, that business has grown really well for us over the years, up 10% sequentially. So we'll continue to look for those opportunities. And, yes, that will be included in that potential opportunity."

            "name": "Tayfun Tuzun",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let's move to the financial highlights on slide three of the earnings presentation. Reported results for this quarter were negatively impacted by three notable items, a $30 million after-tax charge related to our previously announced restructuring plan, a $17 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap, and $4 million after-tax from COVID-related expenses. Strong operating results for the quarter reflected solid business performance throughout the bank, as well as the impact to provision, which resulted from our best quarterly charge-off performance since mid-2019 stabilization and key forward looking macroeconomic indicators compared to the past several quarters as well as lower period end balances. Although we are seeing relative stability in the key macroeconomic variables used in our reserve calculations, we continue to take a cautious approach, given remaining uncertainties related to the pandemic and the economy. Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes GDP remains below the end of 2019 levels until the second quarter of 2022, with an unemployment rate worse than the current environment, remaining elevated above 8% through 2021. Our base case is generally more conservative than the Fed base scenario published last month. Our downside scenario assumes that GDP will remain below the end of 2019 levels until the second quarter of 2023 with unemployment further deteriorating from the third quarter exceeding 12% through the first half of improving until improving to 11% by the end of 2021 and reaching 8.4% by the end of \u201822. If we were to assign a 100% probability to the downside scenario we would likely require an additional $1.2 billion in reserve based on our balance sheet exposures. Reported and adjusted revenue grew 2%, despite the generally weak environment, as we outperformed our previous fee and NII expectations. Total non-interest income excluding the impact of security gains was up 5% sequentially, 3 percentage points better than our previous guidance. With respect to the outside securities gains this quarter, it is important to note that our unrealized gains in the portfolio at the end of the quarter remained very high at $2.7 billion. Our very deliberate actions over the past few years that focused on structuring the portfolio in an anticipation for a lower rate environment should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds. Having said that, even continue to be prudent in managing the gains for the best outcome for our shareholders, cognizant that these gains will continue to be subject to future volatility, especially to fluctuations in the current pre-payment environment.  This quarter, a small portion of our portfolio gains cushion the impact of the restructuring charges that we incurred -- related to our expense reduction plan, which we believe was a prudent risk based action in light of the current environment. Reported and adjusted non-interest expenses were flat year over year. On a sequential basis, adjusted expenses increased slightly more than our previous guidance of up 2%. We are in the midst of executing our expense reduction actions announced last month, which will generate annual efficiencies of $200 million starting in 2021 with an additional $100 million, $150 million of annual efficiencies to be generated starting in 2022. As a result of our strong revenue performance and continued expense discipline PPNR increased sequentially and outperformed our July guidance by approximately $15 million. Given the strong PPNR performance combined with the credit related improvements, we generated strong reported and adjusted return metrics. Adjusted ROA of 1.24% and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18.2% excluding ALCI despite growing our regulatory capital of 42 basis points during the quarter. Excluding the security gains, our adjusted ROTC was nearly 17% even on a credit normalized basis, our underlying ROTC performance is indicative of the strength of the franchise and our ability to successfully navigate a low rate environment.  Moving to slide 4, total average loans declined 4% sequentially within our previous guidance range. CNI loan balance trends continue to reflect lower revolve utilization rates, which declined by 15% from the minute April peak to 33% at quarter end and declined by 5% since the end of June. The decrease in average CNI loans was partially offset by an increase in average auto loan balances. Due to the uneven nature of revolving utilization rates and the impact of PPP loans, we are providing period-end loan balance performance. Revolving line of credit balance has decreased in excess of $3 billion, which constituted approximately three-fourths of the end of period balance quarter-over-quarter decline. Line utilization trends so far in the first two weeks of the fourth quarter indicate continued low utilization levels, which we expect will likely persist at least through the end of this year. C&I client pipelines remain generally soft, but have somewhat improved relative to last quarter. Average and period-end CRE loans decreased 1% sequentially. As we discussed before, we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current economic environment, and potential changes in the post-pandemic economy, which continues to favor low exposure and focus on high quality borrower in this sector. Average total consumer loans, increased 1% sequentially continued growth in the auto portfolio was offset by declines in home equity and credit cards. Auto production in the quarter was strong at $1.8 billion with average FICO scores around 780, and lower advanced rates, higher internal scores, better spreads and a higher concentration of new versus used autos compared to recent quarters. Most of the other consumer loan categories continue to reflect the generally subdued borrower demand. Our securities portfolio of around $35 billion decreased 2% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of the sales, as well as continued pay down. Unless the market environment changes, we are unlikely to use any of the excess liquidity to grow our investment portfolio in the long-term. The underlying risk return profile of many of the investment options is not attractive in light of the impact of the aggressive monetary actions that the Fed is executing. Average other short-term investments, which includes interest bearing cash increased $10 billion, compared to the prior quarter and increased $27 billion, compared to the year ago quarter, the significant increase in excess cash is the outcome of the ongoing decline in loan balances combined with record deposit growth over the past six months. Moving on to slide 5. Compared to the prior quarter, average core deposits increased 4% with growth in all deposits captions, except other time deposits. Average demand deposits represented 33% of total core deposits in the current quarter, compared to 31% in the prior quarter. Average commercial transaction deposits increased 6% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 3%. The deposit growth, came from improvement in every line of business, and was very granular across product types and customer size. Overall, the deposit performance reflects our strong long standing client relationships, and our customers desire to remain liquid. In addition to growth in deposit dollars, we once again generate consumer household growth during the quarter, reflecting strong production, as well as limited attrition. As shown on slide 6, we have continued to take proactive steps, which are predominantly focused on the right side of the balance sheet to mitigate the impact of lower rates, which should provide additional support in the coming quarter, compared to the second quarter, we lowered our interest bearing core deposit rates 14 basis points, more than our expectations, while continuing to generate strong deposit growth. As a result, our September interest bearing core deposit rate is now just 11 basis points with total core deposit costs of just seven basis points, both well below the floors from the previous rate cycle. We expect fourth quarter interest bearing core deposit costs to benefit from our actions and decline another few basis points. Our loan to core deposit ratio improved to 72% as our short-term investments predominantly interest bearing cash were approximately $31 billion at quarter end. Excluding PPP, our loan to core deposit ratio was 69%. Currently, there are no strong indications that the liquidity profile of our balance sheet is likely to change soon as loan growth continues to be elusive and investment opportunities relatively unattractive, we will remain -- we will maintain our short-term cash balances at these levels until further notice. Turning to slide seven, reported and adjusted NII decreased 2% compared to the prior quarter. The decline was primarily attributable to lower C&I balances and the impact of lower market rates. These impacts were partially offset by the reduction in deposit costs, the full quarter impact of PPP loans, day counts, and the favorable impact of previously executed cash flow hedges. As you can see on the slide, the hedges added an incremental $10 million to our third quarter NII for a total contribution of $72 million during the quarter. Purchase accounting adjustments benefited our third quarter net interest margin by three basis points this quarter. Our adjusted NIM decreased 16 basis points sequentially, driven by the unfavorable impacts from elevated cash balances, which created an approximate 15 basis point drag on NIM compared to the prior quarter, lower market rates, and lower C&I balances, partially offset by benefits from our actions to lower deposit costs, and the previously executed cash flow hedges. As we have been highlighting all along our interest rate risk hedging strategy has two pillars, the structure and composition of our investment portfolio and the size and duration of our derivative portfolio. As I stated earlier, our swaps and floors contributed $72 million this quarter. Our portfolio premium amortization was only $1 million and our portfolio yield declined only seven basis points. You can easily see that our investment portfolio does not erode the protection provided by derivative portfolio like it has for many of our peers. And importantly, we have protection in both portfolios longer than our peers. Excluding the impact of excess cash relative to historical averages and the lower yielding PPP loans, normalized NIM was approximately 3.03% for the third quarter. We expect that we will continue to be able to generate a normalized NIM of around 3% for the foreseeable future helped by our interest rate hedges and investment portfolio composition. The fourth quarter NII and NIM are both expected to remain stable. Our guidance has no accelerated benefits from PPP loan forbearance [ph]. Moving on to slide eight, we once again had a strong quarter generating fee revenues that offset the pressure on interest income. The resilience in our total fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved. Adjusted non-interest income, excluding the benefit of securities gains increased 5% sequentially, exceeding our previous guidance by approximately $20 million. The strong performance reflected another solid quarter in capital market. Strong performance in wealth and asset management and rebounds in deposit service charges, card and processing revenue and in leasing business. In our commercial business, the strong capital markets revenue was down from the record set last quarter but was up approximately 8% from the year-ago quarter. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $23 million sequentially primarily driven by an unfavorable MSR net evaluation adjustment and an increase in MSR resulting from higher prepayment fees. Current quarter mortgage originations up $4.5 billion, 32% compared to the prior quarter. Asset management fees increased 10% sequentially, benefiting from stronger market conditions, improved brokerage fees and the continuation of positive AUM flows. With strong wealth and asset management performance over the past several quarters reflects our prioritized investments in this business both in talent upgrades as well as acquisitions to improve the ROE profile of our company. Card and processing revenue increased $10 million or 12%, reflecting increases in credit and debit transaction volumes resulting from continues normalization in consumer spending patterns. Deposit service charges increased $22 million or 18%, with improving commercial deposit fee reflecting a partial loan realization of treasury management service volumes and lower earning credits as well as elevated consumer deposit fees compared to the prior quarter which included hardship-related fee waivers. We expect processing revenues and deposit fees to be stable to slightly higher in the fourth quarter. Moving on to slide 9, third quarter reported pretax expenses included restructuring charges of $8 million, intangible amortization expense of $12 million and COVID-related expenses of $5 million. Adjusting for these items and prior-period items shown in our materials, non-interest expense increased 3% sequentially and decreased $1 million compared to the year-ago quarter. As we discussed first in September during the Barclays Conference, in light of revenue headwinds, we are taking action to reduce our annual 2021 run rate expenses by approximately $200 million. We have started taking appropriate actions in September and expect to finalize all actions by the end of this quarter. We will share with you the full set of details in January during our fourth quarter earnings call when we will also give you an outlook for the direction of our expenses in 2021. With respect to personnel decisions, we expect to generate the full run-rate savings beginning in the first quarter of 2021. In addition to the staffing optimization, we remain on track to deliver the remaining savings through accommodation of process re-engineering, rationalization of certain smaller non-core businesses, vendor re-negotiations and corporate real estate rationalization which are all progressing as well as the savings associated with reduction in our branch network. While we will continue to open branches in our existing high growth southeast markets to generate household and revenue growth, we expect to further optimize our network by closing an additional 37 branches in the first quarter of 2021, predominantly in the Midwest. As we have discussed before, the recent acceleration in customer digitals adoption trends, raising the returns on our technology investments made over the past several years. This gives us increased conviction that we can continue to optimize our branch network while also expanding our presence in high growth markets. Also, our investments and focus on process re-engineering and our areas of our operations will allow us to permanently optimize our expenses in our middle office and back office functions. We believe that approximately 20% of the 2021 savings are environment dependence. When the market rebounds and sustains economic recovery, we will re-adjust these resources accordingly. In addition to a near-term savings target, we also announced a longer-term expense strategy which will help us achieve an additional $100 million to $150 million in run rate savings, starting in 2022 through investments in lean process automation. Slide 10 provides an update on our COVID-19 high impact portfolios. The amounts on this page represent approximately 10% of our total loans and our down 8% from last quarter excluding PPP loans. As you can see, the paydowns during the quarter reduced our balances relative to the second quarter in all sub-categories, except for leisure travel where we have a rather small overall exposure, all to larger operators. The total balances on this slide include approximately $1 billion from our leveraged loan portfolio which remains below $4 billion and has decreased 7% sequentially. The information on this slide lays out the reasons why we believe that our client selection in these portfolios has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that have access to capital in stressed environments and where we have the appropriate credit mitigants in place to limit the ultimate loss content in these portfolios. On slide 11, we provide an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios. The FICO scores clearly indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over 57% containing FICO scores of 750 or higher on a balance-rated basis. Approximately 90% of the consumer portfolio is secured. And as you can see by our FICO band distributions, our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high prime/super prime space. As we have previously discussed, we have taken proactive steps to enhance our underwriting standards, specifically on minimum FICO scores and maximum LTV levels in addition to increasing our efforts in collections. Turning to credit results on slide 12. The net charge-off ratio, were 45 basis points improved, 9 basis points sequentially. The sequential improvement reflects stable outcomes in both portfolios with the commercial credit favorability coming from better resolutions as well as expansion and consumer credit continuing to exhibit results that are more commensurate with a strong or employment environment. Borrowers have been clearly helped by the stimulus and COVID-related relief programs. And those who request an additional 180 days of mortgage payment assistance as provided under the CARES Act will benefit into next year. NPAs remain generally well behaved at 84 basis points. The sequential increase was entirely in commercial with growth coming predominantly from our COVID high impact portfolios and some credits in the energy portfolio, which we believe will ultimately result in a low-loss content. Our ACL ratio declined only by 1 basis point sequentially to 2.49% reflecting the stability in both the current macroeconomic environment, as well as the drivers of the forward looking scenarios. The low level of net charge-offs, combined with the $116 million decline in the allowance, reflecting a lower period end loans resulted in a net $15 million benefit to the provision. Slide 13 provides more information on the allocation of our allowance and the composition of the changes this quarter commercial. In commercial, higher reserve coverage was warranted due to ratings migration during the quarter. This was partially offset by lower end-of-period balances compared to last quarter. In consumer, the change in reserve coverage reflects improvements in the expected loss content in the portfolio. Including the impact of approximately $150 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.62%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans, with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.75%. Our reserves reflect the current macroeconomic expectations embedded in the scenarios that we deploy in this exercise. But the outlook does not further deteriorate; there should not be a need to increase our reserve coverage beyond the current levels. Turning to slide 14, our capital and liquidity positions remain strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at over 10.1%, above our stated target of around 9.5%. Given the dynamics during the quarter, we providing you a CET1 reconciliation between net income, risk weighted assets and the impact of dividends. As you can see, dividend payouts constitute a very small portion of the change in CET1. We expect to have adequate capital and trailing reported net income to maintain our current dividend for the foreseeable future. We will be resubmitting our stress tested in early November, with the rest of the CCAR banks. We have been very consistent in stating our view that given our very strong capital ratios, balance sheet strength, earnings power and relatively modest pre-COVID dividend payout ratio, we expect to fare well. We believe that our performance in this downturn ultimately will prove the resiliency of our model. Our tangible book value per share was $23.06 this quarter, up 9% year-over-year. At the end of the quarter, our unrealized pre-tax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately $3.8 billion, which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios. From a liquidity perspective, we have over $100 billion in total liquidity sources. Slide 15 provides a summary of our fourth quarter outlook. We expect a decline in total loan -- average loan balances of approximately 2% on a quarter over quarter basis, with a 4% to 5% decline in commercial loans and a 1% to 2% increase in consumer balances. The decline in commercial balances is a result of expected paydowns in commercial credit lines. Net interest income and NIM are expected to be stable to last quarter, assuming no benefits from accelerated amortization of PPP fees. We expect non-interest income to increase 7% to 8% sequentially, including the recognition of our TRA of approximately $70 million. We expect our expenses to be flat to slightly up. Total net charge offs are expected to be in the 40 to 50 basis point range. In summary, our third quarter results were strong. And continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years, improving our resiliency, diversifying our revenues, and proactively managing the balance sheets. We will continue to rely on the same principals. We settle in client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on the long-term performance horizon which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. We fully intend to preserve the optimal level of efficiency of our operations in this weak revenue environment, while we maintain the investments that we believe are vital to preserve the earnings power and the operational resilience y of our company. With that, let me turn it over to Chris, to open the call up for the Q&A. Yeah. I think Ken and the other point that I want to make about the program is, we stated that the composition is 80% to 20% between currently in savings and environment-related savings of 20%. But that environment-related savings number is really, how we see 2021. So the other lever that we have here is if things actually look worse or will be worse next year compared to our assumptions, we still will continue to adjust those numbers. So we say that part of it is going to be variable. And it does have more potential, depending upon the economic environment. Obviously, our preference would be that the, be stronger. And we don't have to necessarily go back to that world. But we do have the availability. Ken, we don't believe that the tradeoff between the small NII incrementality versus the market exposure is worth taking at this point. It really does not -- from your perspective, our ability to invest the money in the short-term, doesn't really add much to the long-term performance to the company. So, because we believe that, that cash is going to ultimately leave the company over time. So therefore we are more interested in shielding ourselves from a market-to-market exposure because the market volatility continues to be a concern for us related to all investments. Again, as I mentioned, when can ask the question. At this point, we don't believe that the trade-off between incremental NII associated with margin investments and continuing to expose ourselves to an unattractive mark-to-market environment related to those investments is as attractive. So, at this point, we will continue to watch. Now, those decisions are made on a week-to-week, month-to-mouth basis. If you find opportunities, we will be in the market. But at this point, given what we know today, we are currently choosing to be on the sidelines. So, this is Tayfun. Let me take the first part of that and then I'll turn it over to Jamie for his comments. Look, I mean I think as you know at the end of the first quarter, at the end of the second quarter, we came out much more aggressively in terms of building reserves relative to the peers. And when you look at our coverage, it is 2.49% or 2.62% or 2.75%, we are still above the median levels of our peers. And internally obviously when we look at the risk profile of our loan book, we feel very good about it. And, two, we really did not take the cover ratio down. It's only from 2.50% to 2.49. And the balances obviously are lower at the end of the quarter, which have an impact. In terms of rating of the base scenario, we actually increased the lowest wage of the base of the base scenario this and increase the wage of the scenario this quarter. So we are quite cognizant of potential downturns in the economy. But, look, I mean, the underlying profile, credit profile of our balance sheet and the outstanding balances resulted in a release. And we have to abide by certain accounting principles and do the right thing. So that's from my side. Jamie, any comments from your side? The other part of the question, I mean it's your job to work with the borrowers, try to bridge the gap between the pre and post-COVID economies, but when you have commercial extensions, I think that's where a lot of people are focused, do you accept that you extend -- you drop covenants, you looseen covenants, I don't really -- there's a whole litany of things that you can do to make the life for borrowers easier, in some cases, probably most cases that will make sense, but in some cases that might not make sense. So what are you doing when you mentioned commercial extensions earlier? In the fourth quarter run rate or third quarter? There's nothing in the third quarter and large majority of the savings will come in the first quarter of 2021. Correct. That's correct. The opportunity is great, really focuses on our investments in technology, artificial intelligence. You look at our operations, we've done a really good job of being very efficient, but we still have more opportunities over there to reduce our people-related costs and really automate a lot of functions and processes and create more resiliencey and high quality outcomes. So we are very focused on process reengineering, automation. We've identified those process opportunities. We've got teams working aggressively on them. And we fully expect to achieve those objectives going forward. That will show up more in 2022 than it will in 2021 and give the time it takes to put some of these process, these re-engineering exercises in place. Good morning, Scott. There's a lot of moving pieces, Scott, as you think about what's occurring right now with the amount of stimulus that was thrown at on the pandemic, whether we get the CARES Act next iteration of that, how's that going to be distributed with respect to PPP potential, consumer stimulus opportunities. So, there's a lot of variables involved here. But what we have visibility of right now as you think about the consumer side. We can see forward looking our roll rates, and we think we're in pretty good shape. The consumers are in a pretty good shape as we get into the \u2013 until we get into the second half of next year and it's going to depend on the variables I mentioned and some of the actions that are being taken. So more to come there, that's probably more of the second half of 2021, and we start to see those losses creep up if we don't get next iteration in the CARES Act. On the commercial side once again, a lot of challenges with respect to how we think about the sector because it really gets back to when do we see a vaccine out there? How effective is it? How is it being distributed certain parts of the economy are opening reopening quicker than the other parts of the economy? Southeast is reopened quicker right now. We're seeing positive outcomes there from a production standpoint. So this is a lot going on right now, which you can show yourself, because that's going to be very cautious. We came out with aggressive reserve levels. We're going to be very thoughtful and mindful about how we map our environment looks going forward and expectations are. And what's happening with some of the [indiscernible]. Jamie if you want to give more color on it. Good morning Gerard. Gerard, we are at the 10.1% to 4% of CET1 today. I suspect as we look ahead by the end of the year, we will be approaching 10.5% likely and we entered this year coming out of 2019 with a capital ratio target of 9.5%. And that was actually elevated relative to our 9% target just about a year ago before that and we think that even then, back in 2017 and '18, we were making comments that we can run this company with an eight handle capital ratio, but we are very cognizant of where the peers are and the regulators are? So we said okay, 9% probably.  And then as we saw the probability of a recession going up, we lifted back to 9.5%. So from 10.5% to 9.5% assuming that we look ahead to a normalized economy, that's 1% of capital that we either consume by growing loans or we return to shareholders. Tough to predict the timing of the regulatory change in their current position, but I suspect that when we see the results of this CCAR run and when we find out what the regulators are going to do. If the gate opens, I don't why it would take us a long time to go back to a buyback scenario environment. So our perspective on the interest rate outlook is that we will be in this environment for two, three years. I think it's hard to disagree where the market is pricing the next rate moves. Our concern about -- I mentioned, our concern around not exposing ourselves to a market-to-market. We're also very concerned that in the current environment, the spreads do not reflect the actual risk-return profiles, but they are very skewed by the Fed's aggressive actions. And they turn the credit spreads upside down. And in this environment with that kind of uncertainty, despite the fact that we are expecting this low rate environment to continue for a while, we're choosing to be on the sidelines.  We also expect that down the road here, whether it's going to happen in 2021 or 2022, once the sort of Fed starts either stepping back a little bit, slowing down their aggressiveness and once the market builds a certain level of expectation, whether it's about inflation or about the other end of this rate cycle. The yield curve will start to steepen. We are not necessarily expecting that to happen in the near-term. So a combination of the fact that portion of this cash flow -- cash will leave the bank and also we believe that weighting out until a better investment environment is the better alternative for us. That's why we're sitting out. I'm sorry. Can you repeat that question again? I don't necessarily have a number ready, sort of, to give you right now. But I suspect that number is between three and five years. I think, so I think directionally your comment is logical. If you look at page 13. And look at the difference -- that portfolio is within the commercial book. You see that, you know, the commercial mortgage loans, there's a coverage ratio for that one to 3.4%, whereas the -- for the C&I book, it's 2%. It appears, again, your question, and the logic that you're using is reasonable, it gets a little bit skewed in this environment because you know, the we are within -- for the commercial book the bigger impact comes from the reasonable supportable period, which is driven solely by the economic outlook. So the reason why I'm hesitating to say you are correct, is because that relationship does not necessarily readily fail translate to a reasonable annual loss content. So I just want to make that comment on that. We can actually -- important, we can provide you that information. And we can do that -- in a couple [ph] for your basis, which will give you a little bit flow of content. So, we will maintain our discipline and not give you color on 2021 today. But what goes against that $200 million expense save is going to be some natural built-in inflation, whether it's related to merit increases or other compensation-related inflation. And, two, is going to be investments in our company. We will continue to make investments in our company. And the technology line item for all the right reasons is going up. What we feel good about it, though, is that we have now established a discipline the company, so look at those investments that are technology-related with a very disciplined return requirement. So, whatever the built-in expense growth is, is not going to be driven by head count increases. It's going to be driven by very reasonable investments in our business that have a return profile that we all feel comfortable with and that we believe is prioritized based on our corporate objectives. I believe we are close, Erika. As we look ahead, we believe that we have now a level of stability that we're comfortable with. Could it be within 2, 3, 4 basis points? Yes, it could be. And obviously the margin itself today is probably less meaningful of the metric than it has ever been because it's the influence of the cash balances that we're sitting on. But I do believe that with an assumption that we will live in this highly liquid environment for a while, we are now pretty close to achieving stability here even if we sort of maintain the level of cash. And the faster we get out of the cash position, the faster we're going to start moving towards that 3% number that we believe are natural NIM stands out. But what gives us confidence there, when you think about it, we have $35 billion in the investment portfolio. Our sort of normal level of earning assets is about $150 billion. So, and we have -- I believe it's going to take us, two, three years to get down to where our peers are in their investment portfolio in this low rate environment. We have a huge advantage there. And then we have a significantly longer derivative portfolio compared to most of our peers. Those two give us a pretty reasonable confidence that once we get out of this liquidity environment, we will actually show you a pretty decent margin performance. Yeah. So, on the investment portfolio, you have seen our yields went down by 7 basis points and we're not investing anything. And the cash flows are reasonably small, so that's the step down in portfolio yields could be relatively small compared to that's what I will say about that. In terms of the other fixed portfolios, in the auto portfolio, which is really the portfolio that is growing right now, we are probably the current coupons are probably about 20 basis points or so below the portfolio yield. So when you think about that, that really is the portfolio, loan portfolio, that's the only one that's exposed to a fixed rate repricing. Yep. Anything that was slightly larger than our size? So appetite, so we just read that one, right? Yeah, I was referring to the consumer portfolio, where we have, so much me of information. And then we are just trying to make it as simple as possible. No matter how you slice and dice the data. The bottom line is and there was such a big focus on hardship related and hardship programs and deferral ways all of those things. And no matter how you slice and dice the data. The bottom line is, you know, and there was such a big focus on hardship, relief and hardship programs, and re-default rates, referral rate, all of those things. But no matter how you slice it, it really just comes down to something as simple as you're coming in, you're going to be helping coming out, from a consumer perspective. And that's why that consumer performance really does reflect, frankly, credit losses and credit projections, as if unemployment weren't 3%. So we feel very, very good about that. I think, to your point about, how this ultimately plays out in the economy, it really is the competing forces of the path of the virus versus the path of further stimulus. So if we get an additional round of stimulus, we think the loss curves continue to flatten, perhaps elongate. But again, the peak charge-offs, aren't going to be all that high, relative to the great financial crisis, especially for a bank like the third. Where we've put a lot of thought and effort over the last five years to position the company, as well as we have so that we think our loss rates are a fourth of what they were in the great financial crisis. So we feel good about that. We do, but again the stimulus and what that looks like will certainly be a big swing factor in those loss projections. So, for example, on the consumer side, we also are in different model efforts where we took out stimulus altogether, and so, we modeled that as a 20 basis point change in our outcomes if they are going to be no stimulus, so just to put guardrails on what these outcomes might look like. Vivek, we are seeing stable consumer deposits. They're not going down, but we're not seeing any noticeable increases in consumer deposits at very healthy levels there. But we are not seeing further increases. The commercial balance has continued to pick up and I suspect that will in the fourth quarter. It's an election quarter. And there's a lot of hesitancy on the corporate side to do anything different at this point. I do believe that come early 2021, hopefully we will see some more emerging signs. It's hard to predict yet which side it will go. But that will be dependent on the economy. So for the foreseeable future, we see maybe small upticks in corporate balances and stable consumer balance."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Doll: Thank you, Denise. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we will be discussing our financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Risk Officer, Jimmy Leonard and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.\nGregory Carmichael: Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I'll focus most of my comments on the actions we have taken to navigate this challenging environment, and provide some highlights on our strong financial performance this quarter. Tayfun will then provide more details related to the quarterly financial results in his remarks. In light of the ongoing challenges brought on by the pandemic and the heightened civil unrest resulting from the inequities in our country, we continue to prioritize our actions to support our customers, our communities and our employees. We proactively made over 3 million calls to our customers since the onset of the pandemic to assess their financial situation. In total, we have processed over 150,000 loan deferral and forbearance requests since the rollout of our COVID hardship programs, or approximately 6% of total loans. More than 35% of those in our consumer deferral or forbearance programs have made one or more payments. Consumer hardship relief requests, including mortgage, declined approximately 85% from the mid-April peak through last week of June. Beginning July 1st, we started methodically transitioning our customers from the COVID hardship programs to a combination of short and long-term options if the customer required further assistance, depending on the product type and borrower circumstances. This approach is consistent with our pre-COVID hardship programs. As of the end of last week, more than 50% of the consumer loan deferrals have transitioned off the COVID programs, of which only 12% have requested additional hardship assistance. In total, consumers who have exited COVID programs and requested additional relief represent less than 0.5% of total consumer loans. The declining request, the high percentage of customers who have made a payment and a small number of customers requesting additional assistance, give us confidence in the strength of the underlying credit quality of our consumer portfolio. In addition to providing hardship relief, we continue to support our customers through the Paycheck Protection Program. Due to the tremendous efforts by hundreds of Fifth Third employees, we have successfully originated $5.5 billion of loans, benefiting 38,000 small and mid-sized businesses, which in turn, helps approximately 500,000 employees of our PPP customers. Looking ahead the client forgiveness request, where we are awaiting further clarity from the SBA, we have developed an automated solution, which should help simplify the forgiveness process. Ultimately, we estimate nearly 90% of PPP clients will request and qualify for forgiveness. Our top priority remains the health and safety of our customers and employees. While we have kept approximately 99% of our branches open throughout the pandemic to serve our customers, we continue to monitor developments in select geographies, given the recent increase in COVID cases, and we will continue to follow the state and CDC guidelines to protect the safety of our employees and customers. We continue to encourage customers to utilize our digital tools going into pandemic. As a result, we are seeing increased adoption rates with about 75% of all transactions now occurring through our digital channels. Now moving on to financial results. Our second quarter performance was strong. Once again, our results highlight the strength of our franchise and our ability to navigate the dynamic environment and mitigate the impact of lower rates through well diversified fee revenues and continued expense discipline. We have now generated year-over-year adjusted positive operating leverage in seven out of the past eight quarters and grew tangible book value per share for five consecutive quarters. We grew common equity Tier 1 capital this quarter despite adding to our reserves and paying nearly $200 million in common dividends. Our CET1 ratio improved 35 basis points to 9.7%. Additionally, our loan to core deposit ratio reached a historically low level of 72%, excluding PPP loans. Our strong capital and liquidity ratios are indicative of our balance sheet strength, which will serve us well as we navigate this challenging environment. With respect to capital, we recently announced our indicative stress capital buffer requirement from the 2020 CCAR exercise of 2.5%, which is a floor under the regulatory capital rules. Without the floor, we estimate our buffer would have been approximately 2.1%. We also announced our intention to maintain our current common dividend per share and continue the suspension of share repurchases through at least year-end. We will continue to provide our Board with the necessary information to make forward-looking and data-driven decisions about the sustainability of the dividend. In terms of credit quality, the net charge-off ratio of 44 basis points this quarter was better than the low end of our previous guidance range, reflecting improvement in consumer and relative stability in commercial. While we do not have perfect foresight with respect to the duration or severity of this downturn, we have consistently communicated our through-the-cycle principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and an overall balance sheet management approach focused on long-term performance. While economic visibility remains low, our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. From a commercial client standpoint, we continue to focus on generating relationships with clients who have more diversified and resilient balance sheets as well as multiple sources of repayment. We've been very successful keeping our client relationships. And as a result, have generated record capital markets revenue in three out of the last four quarters. We believe this composition towards larger relationships will serve us well as our clients navigate the pandemic. In fact, corporate banking clients representing approximately 20% of our exposures successfully accessed the debt and equity capital markets since the onset of the pandemic to bolster their liquidity, including 20% in the COVID high-impact industries. We continue to believe we are well positioned relative to peers in commercial real estate, an area where we have been deliberately underweight. We have focused predominantly on top-tier developers with a track record of resilience and significantly lower LTVs compared to the last downturn. Our portfolio is well diversified by geography and property type, including virtually no land loans. And as we have discussed before, we continue to get at the low end of peers as a percentage of total capital. It is worth noting that across both of our portfolios in consumer and commercial, we have focused on maintaining geographical diversification through several national businesses, including indirect auto and residential mortgage in addition to C&I and CRE. Our credit risk is well diversified beyond our retail footprint through these national lending businesses, which will be instrumental in delivering a differentiated credit performance given the likelihood of an uneven economic recovery. In addition to our deliberate positioning with respect to credit risk exposures, we have also spent many years preparing for a turn in the economic cycle by improving and diversifying both our key revenues and our loan portfolios, which was evident in the second quarter results. Our PPNR increased 10% from a year-ago quarter despite the continued headwinds from lower rates. This reflects a record quarter in capital markets, strong mortgage origination revenue, proactive liability management and continued expense discipline. Our four key strategic priorities, leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies, and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection, remain intact. Clearly, in this type of environment, we are putting the appropriate level of focus and prioritization on the initiatives within those four priorities, which had the highest probability of driving long-term financial success. Before I turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to once again thank our employees. I am very proud of the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers, our communities and each other during these unprecedented times. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook.\nTayfun Tuzun: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin my review of the quarter, let me also reiterate that we are very proud of our - how our colleagues have responded to the many uncertainties that we face in navigating through the challenges associated with the nature of this downturn. We do believe that the actions that we have taken so far and those that we will be taking in the coming quarters will continue to display our strong desire to fulfill our role in reinvigorating the economy by maintaining and leveraging our strength to support our clients in managing through this difficult period. The data and information that are available to us today continue to indicate low visibility regarding the direction of the economy. Our discussion today and our decisions during the second quarter collectively reflect our cautious approach behind our decisions on managing risk exposures in this uncertain period. As we commented during our first quarter earnings conference call, our economic assumptions based on Moody's economic scenarios, which underlie our outlook, including the background scenarios reflected in our reserve build, did not and still do not assume a V-shape recovery. Our downside scenario assumes that GDP will remain below the end of 2019 levels until the second quarter of 2023 and the base case assumes that it does not recover until the second quarter of 2022. Also, our downside scenario assumes the unemployment rates will remain near 12% until the second quarter of 2021, and remain above 11% heading into 2022, with the base case scenario assuming that after the current spike in recovery, the unemployment rate will worsen and peak at nearly 9.5% in the second quarter of 2021 before slowly recovering. This reflects our belief that the downturn will be prolonged and the recovery uneven. Turning to Slide 4. With respect to the second quarter, we were pleased with our overall financial performance despite the economic conditions. We took advantage of favorable market conditions in mortgage and capital markets, which helped us exceed our fee income projections. Credit performance remained relatively strong during the quarter. Charge-offs were better than our prior expectations, and the NPA ratio increased just 5 basis points sequentially. Deposit growth significantly exceeded our expectations. Although clearly a good portion of the inflows were related to the stimulus programs, we believe that we can leverage our clients' demonstrated preference to bank with us for future revenue opportunities and enhanced client interaction. We improved our regulatory capital and liquidity position during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio increased 35 basis points to above 9.7% despite the reserve build and exceeds the required minimum, including the indicative stress capital buffer by over 270 basis points. Our loan to core deposit ratio improved to 75 basis point at 75% as our short-term investments, predominantly interest-bearing cash were approximately $28 billion at quarter end. Our loan to core deposit ratio was 72%, excluding PPP loans. The combined hedge and investment portfolio on realized gain position stands at $3.9 billion, reflecting the growing value associated with the long-term protection that these portfolios provide. As a proof point, the sequential decline of our investment portfolio yield is about a third of the peer median decline. Reported results for the quarter included a negative $0.07 impact from several notable items, including a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap, certain real estate impairments, including from our branch network, specific COVID-related expenses, MB merger-related charges and a debt extinguishment charge. Second quarter pre-provision net revenue improved 4% from the prior quarter and 10% from the prior year as we generated positive operating leverage again despite the rate headwinds. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved nearly 200 basis points from last quarter and improved nearly 100 basis points from the year ago quarter. Return metrics were impacted by our reserve build, but we continue to produce strong revenues, while also generating efficiencies throughout the Company. Moving to Slide 5. Total average loans increased 7% sequentially, reflecting growth in C&I from increased line draws and PPP loans as well as growth in construction and auto loans. Excluding PPP, total average loans increased 4% sequentially. Given the rather uneven line utilization trends during the quarter, the timing of PPP loans, we are also providing period-end balance performance. End-of-period loans declined $3 billion sequentially or 3%, reflecting a repayment of line draws as well as subdued borrower demand in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. Our commercial line utilization rate was 38% at quarter end, down 9% from mid-April and essentially flat compared to the pre-pandemic rates. Line utilization so far this quarter has been stable. Commercial pipelines remain generally soft, as you would expect, and our focus continues to be on our existing client base in this environment. Average commercial real estate loans increased 4% sequentially, reflecting draws on previous commitments. Period-end CRE loans were flat compared to the prior quarter. As we discussed many times before, we believe that our industry loan CRE balance as a percentage of risk-based capital, which is less than half of what it was during the last downturn, combined with the strong risk profile of our borrowers, will benefit our future credit results, given the likelihood that commercial real estate will be exposed rather severely during this downturn. Average total consumer loans decreased 1% from last quarter. Growth in auto was offset by declines in home equity and credit cards. Auto production in the quarter was strong at $1.5 billion, rebounding nicely after the April slowdown with healthy spreads and the same super prime profile as before. Our average origination FICO scores were nearly 770 this quarter. Most of the other consumer loan categories reflected the generally-subdued borrower demand and consumer spend levels due to both weak economic activity and government stimulus and other benefit programs. Moving on to Slide 6. Average core deposits increased 19% sequentially with double-digit growth in all deposit captions, except consumer CDs and foreign office deposits. Our growth, so far, is multiple points ahead of the peer banks. This record deposit growth came from growth in every line of business and was very granular across product types and customer size. Growth in the initial months of the quarter reflected deposits from line draw proceeds, followed by growth from depositors who obtain funding through the PPP. Overall, the deposit performance reflects our strong long-standing client relationships, our customers' desire to remain extremely liquid in this environment and the lack of significant investment and growth opportunities. Average commercial transaction deposits increased 34%, and average consumer transaction deposits increased 8%. Commercial growth was well diversified between corporate banking and middle market clients. Average demand deposits represented 31% of total core deposits in the current quarter compared to 29% in the prior quarter. As shown on Slide 7, we have continued to take proactive steps to mitigate the impact of lower rates, which should provide additional support in the coming quarters. Compared to last quarter, we lowered our interest-bearing core deposit rates, 41 basis points, while generating record deposit growth, more than the high end of our previous rate guidance range and sooner than we expected. As a result, our June interest-bearing core deposit rate of 21 basis points was below the floor of the previous rate cycle with every product category meaningfully lower as we exited the second quarter. Our total core deposit costs, including DDAs, was just 19 basis points in the second quarter and 14 basis points in June. We expect third quarter interest-bearing core deposit costs to benefit from our actions and decline another 11 basis points. This reflects a cumulative beta in excess of 40. In addition to the actions taken with respect to deposits, we also terminated $3 billion in FHLB advances. End-of-period wholesale borrowings declined 13% sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, our current loan to core deposit ratio was 72%, excluding PPP loans at the end of the second quarter, significantly below almost all peers. Our current expectation is that the liquidity environment will be slow to change. We expect that our current loan to core deposit ratio will remain at or around the current levels at least through the end of this year. Although we are aggressively lowering our deposit rates, we will maintain a strong preference to meet the needs of our clients, which we believe will reward us in the long term. Ultimately, we believe that the strength of our deposit franchise will help lower and keep deposit costs below previous lows, while growing our client relationships. Turning to Slide 8. Net interest income decreased $30 million or 2% compared to the prior quarter. The NII performance reflects the impact of lower market rates on commercial loans, mortgage portfolio prepayments and the decline in home equity and credit card balances. These impacts were partially offset by elevated average commercial revolving line of credit balances and growth from lower-yielding PPP loans as well as continued focus on reducing deposit costs and the favorable impact of previously executed hedges. As you can see on this slide, the hedges added an incremental $30 million to our second quarter NII or a total contribution of $62 million during the quarter. Purchase accounting adjustments benefited our second quarter net interest margin by 4 basis points this quarter. Our NIM decreased 53 basis points sequentially. Although not detrimental to our net interest income, elevated cash had a 29 basis point incremental negative impact on our NIM, in addition to a 1 basis point drag from PPP loans. Our period-end short-term cash position increased by 4.5 times from $6.3 billion at the end of March to $28 billion at the end of June, with period end excess cash 18 times higher than our 2019 average. Excluding the impact of elevated cash positions and PPP loans, we estimate that our NIM would have been just about 3%. Our focus in this environment is on long-term NIM performance. As such, given the lack of attractive alternative investments and the uncertainty on the timing of future deposit outflows, we expect to remain in this cash position longer than we anticipated in early June. We don't believe that it is in our best interest to deploy any portion of the cash reserves today. We believe that there is more leverage in continuing to reduce our funding costs with the help of our strong liquidity position, but we will reevaluate our options if the market environment changes. In addition to the anticipated longer duration of our cash position, our expected NIM and NII progression over the next two quarters also changed compared to our earlier expectations as the PPP forgiveness period lengthen, which resulted in pushing out our expectations of the timing of the recognition of interest income to the fourth quarter and early next year. At this time, we anticipate forgiveness to commence in the fourth quarter, with about 60% of the NII benefit to accrue in the fourth quarter and the rest during the first quarter of 2021. We expect that our normalized NIM, excluding the impact of elevated cash and PPP loans, is approximately 3% and will remain there for the foreseeable future, helped by our interest rate hedges and investment portfolio composition. In our investment portfolio, we had a net discount accretion this quarter of $1 million as opposed to multiple millions of dollars of premium amortization some of our peers are experiencing. As we have always stated, one needs to look at both the derivative portfolio, where we took early actions with great entry points for longer duration, as well as the structure of the investment portfolio to gauge the long-term NIM performance. The significant impact of our cash reserves and the PPP portfolio during the next few quarters will create some noise, but we anticipate a more stable environment past that. The third quarter NIM is expected to contract another 7 to 10 basis points, driven by the full quarter impact of higher cash positions and PPP loans with NIM expected to then recover in the fourth quarter. The third quarter contraction is predominantly related to higher average cash balances on our balance sheet as the impact of lower rates is expected to be offset by the continued benefits of our hedge portfolio and deposit rate reductions. Moving on to Slide 9. We once again had a very strong quarter generating fee revenue to offset the pressure on interest income. The resilience in our fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved. Reported non-interest income decreased by 3% sequentially. Adjusted noninterest income of $670 million exceeded the high end of our previous guidance range by approximately $20 million. The strong performance was driven by another record in capital markets as well as better-than-previously-anticipated results in mortgage and wealth and asset management. In our commercial business, the strong performance was led by capital markets revenue, which increased nearly 20% from last quarter and approximately 50% from the year ago quarter. Debt and equity capital markets, both achieved record quarters, again, reflecting our clients' ability to access the market to bolster their liquidity positions. Mortgage banking origination fees and gains on loan sales were strong in the second quarter, up nearly 20%, reflecting improved margins. Originations of $3.4 billion decreased 15% sequentially due to a temporary pause in the corresponding channel in May as we waited for clarification from the agencies regarding loans for sale that entered the forbearance category. Mortgage originations, excluding correspondent channel production, increased 22% compared to the prior quarter.  Our retail originations were up 37% versus last quarter. Asset management fees were down 4%, reflecting the impact of equity market levels throughout the quarter. Total wealth and asset management revenue decreased 10% from the prior quarter, to a large extent, reflecting the seasonal decline in tax preparation fees. Card and processing revenue decreased $4 million or 5%, resulting from lower credit and debit volumes throughout the quarter, reflecting reduced customer spend, partially offset by lower rewards. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect low-to-mid single-digit growth in processing fees. Deposit service charges decreased sequentially, reflecting lower consumer and commercial fees, which were impacted by the record growth in deposit balances as well as hardship-related fee waivers granted throughout the quarter. Given some of the trends that we have seen towards the end of the quarter, we expect double-digit growth in deposit fees in the third quarter. Moving on to Slide 10. Second quarter reported pretax expenses included COVID-related expenses of $12 million, merger-related items of $9 million and FHLB debt extinguishment charge of $6 million, and intangible amortization expense of $12 million. Adjusting for these items and prior items shown in our materials, non-interest expense decreased over 5% sequentially and decreased approximately 3.5% compared to the year ago. Also, due to the mark-to-market nature of our non-qualified deferred comp plans, our expenses include the impact of $22 million expense compared to a $26 million benefit last quarter. Excluding this impact, our expenses declined $110 million or over 9% sequentially, driven by the declines from seasonal items, reduced marketing expense and continued discipline managing expenses throughout the Company. As we are diligently managing in-period expenses, we are also assessing our longer-term efficiency opportunities. We will continue to accelerate our investments in technology and innovation as we see permanent shifts in customer behavior and an increased need to reduce our dependence on manual processes in our operations. We are also very focused on improving the resiliency of our technology infrastructure to achieve a world-class network structure as more and more customer interactions are shifting to digital products. We are also accelerating our implementation of nCino in our commercial business. At the same time, we are very focused on working with an expense base that is more aligned with the muted revenue growth expectations over the next few years. We are sizing our targets within that context and approaching this comprehensively, including opportunities in corporate real estate, vendor management, alignment of our sales capacity with market opportunities, the size of our retail branch network and more efficient middle office and back office operations. Some, but not all of these actions, will be based on environmental factors. We are performing a deeper structural review of our business lines and middle office and back-office functions to identify opportunities that improve the profitability of our Company. We plan to share the outcome of our review with you in the next couple of months when we finalize our findings and decisions. As always, you can trust us to be prudent in managing our expenses with utmost flexibility. Slide 11 provides an update on our COVID high-impact portfolios. The amount on this page represent approximately 11% of our total loans and are down 9% from the last quarter, excluding PPP loans. As you can see, the paydowns during the quarter reduced our balances relative to the first quarter in all subcategories, except for leisure travel, where we have a rather small overall exposures, all to larger operators. The total balances on this slide include approximately $1 billion from our leveraged loan portfolio, which is now under $4 billion. The information on this slide lays out the reasons why we believe that our client selection in these portfolios has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that have access to capital in stressed environments and that we have the appropriate credit mitigants in place to limit the ultimate loss content in these portfolios. In addition, on Slide 12, we give you a snapshot of our energy portfolio. This portfolio is less levered and carries a higher hedge position than the portfolio during the last downturn in oil prices. As you can see, the leverage in this portfolio is 2 turns lower with a higher RBL balance and approximately one third of the percentage exposure to oilfield services compared to 2015. Our ongoing stress tests indicate that the level of charge-offs in our energy portfolio under stressed conditions would not meaningfully deviate from the rest of our commercial portfolio. Nearly 80% of the portfolio is in reserve-based structures, and we recently reduced our overall RBL borrowing base approximately 15% as a result of the spring re-determination. On Slide 13, we provide an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios. The FICO scores clearly indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over 55% containing FICO scores of 750 or higher on a balance-weighted basis. Approximately 90% of the consumer portfolio is secured. And as you can see by our FICO band distributions, our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high prime, super prime space. As we have previously discussed, we have taken proactive steps to enhance our underwriting standards, specifically on minimum FICO scores and maximum LTV levels in addition to increasing our efforts in collections. Turning to credit results on Slide 14. Net charge-offs were flat sequentially. The consumer net charge-off ratio declined 14 basis points this quarter, following a 12 basis point decline in the prior quarter. And commercial net charge-offs were relatively stable, resulting in a total net charge-off ratio of 44 basis points, better than the low end of our previous expectations. NPAs continue to be well-behaved at 65 basis points, up just 3 basis points since before the pandemic. The sequential increase was entirely in commercial, predominantly in the energy portfolio. As I just mentioned, we are comfortable with the loss content in our energy portfolio. The consumer nonperforming loans remain low. We added $355 million to our credit reserves this quarter, increasing our ACL ratio by 37 basis points to 2.5%. The incremental reserve build this quarter reflected the continued deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The cumulative increase in our allowance for credit losses since the end of 2019, including the day one impact, is now over $1.5 billion. As a reference point, we compare our current reserve level with a nine-quarter total loss estimates within the recent severe stress test runs - CCAR severe stress test runs. Our current reserves stand over - at over 60% of our Company run losses and nearly 40% of fed losses. The credit models that the Federal Reserve is utilizing still appear to be heavily influenced by our credit results during the last downturn, which results in a wide gap between our expectations and the fed's. Slide 15 provides more information on the allocation of our allowance and the composition of the changes this quarter. Higher levels of reserves in real estate-based portfolios reflect the deteriorated outlook in the economic scenarios related to real estate valuations in future periods. Including the impact of approximately $170 million in remaining discounts associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.64%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.76%. Our thoughts on the need-for-future reserve builds are similar to what you've heard from other banks. Our reserves reflect the current macroeconomic expectations embedded in the scenarios that we deploy in this exercise. If the outlook does not further deteriorate, there should not be a need to increase our reserve coverage beyond the current levels. Any further increases in reserves would result from a higher likelihood of a more severe and prolonged double dip scenario. Turning to Slide 16. Our capital and liquidity positions remained very strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at over 9.7%, exceeding the first quarter level, even as we built reserves. Given the dynamics during the quarter, we are providing you a CET1 reconciliation between net income, risk-weighted assets and the impact of dividends. As you can see, dividend payouts constitute a very small portion of the change in CET1. It is important to note that our capital levels are now well above our targets. As you may recall, our capital target in early 2019 was 9%. We raised that level closer to 9.5% about 1.5 years ago, and we are now above the 9.5% level. As a reminder, we had no buybacks in the first or second quarter, and our decision to extend that to the end of this year has changed the trajectory of our capital ratios. Even with buildup in reserves, we are ahead of our capital plan, and we expect continued strong levels of PPNR to support our current capital levels. We will be resubmitting our stress test sometime in the fall with the rest of the CCAR banks. We have been very consistent in stating our view that given our very strong capital ratios, balance sheet strength, earnings power and relatively modest pre-COVID dividend payout ratio, we expect to fare well. We believe that our performance in this downturn ultimately will prove the resiliency of our model. Despite the difference in projected loss rates between the two models that I just mentioned, we continue to show significant cushion in our forecasted capital ratios under stressed conditions. Our tangible book value per share was $22.66 this quarter, up 13% year-over-year. At the end of the quarter, our unrealized pretax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately $3.9 billion, which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios. From a liquidity perspective, we have over $100 billion in total liquidity sources. Slide 17 provides a summary of our current outlook. Given the uncertain environment, we continue to provide only quarterly expectations until we have more long-term visibility on the economic outlook. For the third quarter, we expect a decline in total average loan balances in the 3.5% to 4% range on a quarter-over-quarter basis, with a 6% to 7% decline in commercial loans and a 3% increase in consumer balances. The decline in commercial balances is a result of the paydowns in commercial credit lines. Net interest income is expected to decline approximately 3% compared to last quarter, assuming no benefits from accelerated amortization of PPP fees. This decline is primarily attributable to the impact of line paydowns in our commercial business as the impact of lower floating rate loans is fully offset by the hedges as well as the funding rate benefits. We expect non-interest income to increase 2 plus percent sequentially and expenses to increase about the same. Part of the expense increase is due to performance-based comp related to mortgage, wealth and asset management and leasing revenues that tend to result in higher dollar payouts. In addition, there are some accelerated expenses in IT that are related to our focus on automation. As I mentioned earlier, we are working on a broader expense reduction target that we will share with you in the coming months that is intended to reduce the pressure on our efficiency ratio, resulting from the weak revenue environment, and will also include longer-term structural targets. Total net charge-offs are expected to be in the 50 to 55 basis point range, continuing to reflect the widening gap between the near-term credit performance and the anticipated deterioration in credit metrics beyond 2020. In summary, our second quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we've made over the past few years, improving our resiliency, diversifying our revenues and proactively managing the balance sheet. With limited forecast visibility, we will continue to rely on the same principles: disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. We fully intend to preserve the optimal level of efficiency of our operations in this weak economic - weak revenue environment, while we maintain the investments that we believe are vital to preserve the earnings power and the operational resiliency of our Company. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChristopher Doll: Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A as a courtesy others, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have time for additional questions. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your Company to the operator. Denise, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers: Tayfun, just wanted to sort of follow-up on the liquidity. You gave a ton of good detail. So, thank you for that. And I certainly understand kind of the nuance of the elevated cash balances, why they'll stick around. But to a large degree, these are issues that affect everyone. Would you say - is there anything unique about Fifth Third that kind of amplifies the order of magnitude so much?\nTayfun Tuzun: I think the - we believe we've stayed very close to our clients during the past five, six months as we entered this period and our sales force has been in close contact, and our relationships are very strong across the board in both corporate banking as well as middle market banking. And they are clearly showing a preference to bank with us and to increase the size of their relationships. I mean, this is purely a function of their willingness to work with us because we are not offering any significant rates to them that they can't get with rival banks. So we've lowered our deposit rates well below where we were in the first quarter. But I think the strength of our relationships and our sales force coverage is enabling us to maintain this level of liquidity. And we - I mean, our liquidity levels are significantly higher. The 19% deposit growth, I think, exceeds all of our peers and the increase in our liquidity position is significantly higher than others. Look I mean I think it doesn't impact the NII. We reflect the liquidity profile of the balance sheet. And it also gives us many opportunities in coming quarters to continue to deepen our relationships with our clients. That's our perspective.\nScott Siefers: And just as a follow-up to that, I think you said an additional 7 to 10 basis points of margin erosion in the third quarter based on, I guess, like the full quarter impact of the higher cash balances. And then I believe you said it would recover in the fourth quarter with the PPP forgiveness. I know it can be tough to cut through the noise of what's going on with margins these days, but ex the benefit of the PPP benefits in the fourth quarter, would you expect sort of the steady-state margin to stabilize after the 3Q?\nTayfun Tuzun: Scott, I don't want to give fourth quarter guidance at this point. But I think what you should rely on is not just for Q4 but also beyond Q4, we believe that 3% level, the 3% NIM, once we are past the PPP and once we are past the impact of the higher cash balances, it's probably a good sort of target for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian: So as we think about a pretty sizable reserve, some of the PPNR puts and takes that you're expecting, I guess, if the fed rolls forward the dividend income test beyond the third quarter, are you confident that your GAAP level of pre-preferred earnings would be above that $0.27 run rate as calculated - dividend rate as calculated by the fed?\nTayfun Tuzun: Erika, everything that we look at today as well as sort of the outlook that we have in place gives us a lot of confidence that we will have plenty of room.\nErika Najarian: And the second follow-up question is, I'm sure a lot of my peers are going to try to tease out this expense reduction announcement. But I'm wondering, how will this initiative compare to North Star? And how conscious are you of incurring charges given the light - the possibility that this income test could extend beyond third quarter on the dividend?\nTayfun Tuzun: So North Star was a combination of revenue actions as well as expense actions. So we are talking here a focus on expenses only. And with respect to charges, it is way too early. And not necessarily all expense actions would accompany a charge associated with it. So I would not necessarily be too worried about that. I'm not saying that there's not a charge associated with any of the expense actions, but size-wise, at this point, I'm not too worried about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nPeter Winter: I wanted to follow-up on the expense initiative. And I'm just wondering, is the thought to bring the expense base down going forward? Or is the idea just to kind of hold expenses flat in a more challenging revenue environment?\nGregory Carmichael: Peter, this is Greg. First off, our intent is obviously to look at the opportunities in front of us. And the question was just asked about North Star, a lot of the expense opportunities in front of us are very similar to North Star. If you think about our branch transformation and opportunities to optimize our branch network. Thinking about the opportunities around our vendor management and the money that we spend in those areas and the attractive opportunities that sit there, rightsizing our organization for the sales opportunities. There are a lot of opportunities out there in front of us. So our intent would be to continue to invest in the critical aspects of our business that we've mentioned before, the digitization of our platforms, our Southeast expansion and so forth. We want to continue those investments. But over time, we would expect to run at a lower rate on expenses. And the realities of the revenue opportunities that are out there in the environment, we expect to run at a lower level going forward.\nPeter Winter: And if I could - just another question. You guys provided some really good color on the forbearance on the consumer side. I'm just wondering if you can give some updates on the commercial side about loan deferrals coming in for a second request and what's happening there on the commercial side.\nJames Leonard: Yes, Peter. It's Jamie. Thanks for the question. On the commercial side, I think you saw on the presentation, if you look at payment deferrals, 6% of the loan balances are in payment deferral and the vast majority, over 80% of the payment deferrals we have were 90 days in duration. But because they started midway through the quarter, not many of them have come off. So, I don't want to give you too much of a false positive. But to date, we've not had any request for the - a second 90-day deferral in the commercial book. I guess, some additional color would be that about 75% of our commercial customers that were on deferral have made payments while in the deferral. And then beyond the payment deferral information that we provided in terms of other types of forbearances, there's about 7% of the commercial book that's received a covenant waiver.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nMike Mayo: I guess, I have one negative question and one positive question. So I'll go to the negative question first. I mean, flattish charge-offs, kind of flattish problem loans just doesn't seem accurate, and this is not unique to you. It's an industry question. I mean if you didn't have the forbearance, if you didn't have a government assistance, how much worse would charge-offs and NPAs be? And it is a question because eventually, these programs run off and then bankers have to be bankers again and reality sets in. So we're - I mean, it's just in terms of a general question, how bad would it be if you didn't have this other support and forbearance?\nJames Leonard: Yes. So Mike, it's Jamie. On the commercial side, I think what you see is what you get, it's pretty straightforward, and there was a slight uptick in the charge offs, but it was offset by the improvement we saw on the consumer side. And so I think the heart of your question is how good is the consumer in this environment, given both the government support plus the support we've given customers that have requested it for the forbearance and payment deferrals. So when you look at our portfolio on the consumer side, Tayfun mentioned a couple of items. If you exclude mortgage because those were six months, and you look at the non-mortgage loans, only 12% have re-enrolled in additional hardship relief. And through last Friday, we've had over half of our original deferrals, they've come off the program. So I think that's one good data point. We initially expected that number to be as high as 30%. So the fact that we're experiencing 12% shows us both the government support plus the overall health of the consumer is perhaps a little bit better than we expected. The other data point I would point you to is for Fifth Third, in particular, Moody's published a study July 7th, and they evaluated the MSAs most-impacted by COVID. They used number of COVID cases, population density, tourism, global connectedness, et cetera. And the national average weighted by GDP was 0.31, and this was on a scale-up to 2.0 where we're playing golf, so lower is better. Our score for our consumer portfolio is 0.12. So we're 60% better than the national average. And so I think there's a lot of hard work going on in our consumer portfolio. We stopped the 90-day offers at the end of June. And really, we're working to move to the top of the customer payment priority and I think ultimately, between the geographic diversification we have, the overall credit quality of the book, you see in the FICO scores plus our revamped hardship programs, I think we're getting a good view that the consumer is doing better. And in fact, so much so that the second half of 2020, we expect our consumer charge-offs to be below the second half of 2019.\nMike Mayo: And then the other question was $3.9 billion of securities and derivatives gains. I mean, to what degree do you expect would you try to bank some of those gains? When we look at where rates are, and then you have cushion for more charges for North Star part two or more cushion for your dividends? Or maybe you could do buy back sooner because you were a little more unique saying no buybacks, including the fourth quarter, you went the extra step to be more conservative. Just wondering why you did that, and if you might want to bank some of those gains. Thanks.\nTayfun Tuzun: I will answer the question about the conservative stance. Look, I mean, I think we all recognize that there's a lot of uncertainty and very low level of visibility. Under those circumstances, I think it's natural for us to be a bit more conservative. And with respect to the $3.9 billion gain, it gives us a lot of flexibilities. If there is a need or if we view that the future outlook for rates changes in our perspective such that, that gain is better off harvested and deployed for other purposes, there are some accounting realities that don't necessarily allow you to immediately recognize all of that gain. But it clearly provides a very significant pool of, I would say, capital that we can deploy going forward. At this point, given our view, we're very happy with the portfolios as they stand, and we will continue to harvest, and we have a long maturity date so we were benefited, but as you stated, Mike, it's a rich man's problem, and it gives us a good amount of flexibility.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS. Your line is open.\nSaul Martinez: So one thing I'm struggling with this quarter with the banks in channel, it's just that there's a very divergent performance in terms of not just NIM, but the NII trajectory this quarter and also with regards to the outlook. And I mean you guys have been more conservative, I think, than your peers in terms of managing rate risk and the hedging, the way you manage your securities portfolio and yet - obviously, NII is under pressure this quarter, it's likely to be under pressure next quarter. So I guess, I'm asking how you think we should see this dynamic as it pertains to you. Is this is really simply a function of you guys just being much more conservative in terms of how you're managing your risk and that's reflected in your balance sheet dynamics and, obviously, you see that in your short-term investments and loans? So is it really just a function of how you're managing risk right now that's driving that? And - or is there something else that we should also be aware of that maybe more idiosyncratic?\nTayfun Tuzun: Two comments, Saul. So one is, if you actually normalize the NIM progress from the first quarter into the second quarter with cash positions and the PPP across all banks, you're getting to a much tighter distribution. So if you get to how core NIM has behaved, that volatility goes down significantly. From our perspective, we have $28 billion in cash, and we are choosing not to deploy any of that part just to show a higher NII outcome. Others have done that. Everybody has their own risk profile and risk preferences. I think what needs to be really more instrumental as we look forward, it's a long game and our outlook that the normalized NIM, once we pass-through this PPP period and a more normalized level of cash, is 3%. When you think about it, our NIM was 3.24% in the first quarter. So with where the short-term rates are and where the yield curve is, a 24 basis point movement between the first quarter NIM and our sort of longer-term outlook on NIM is a pretty good performance. And ultimately, again, this is just - we're talking about a few quarters here where things are going to look a little bit choppy, but NIM is just an outcome. And we have a strong preference in not going after NII boosts in the short-term that would put us into a riskier position in the long term.\nSaul Martinez: Okay. I mean, I have a few follow-ups, but I'll table that and switch gears to a different topic. And I actually want to ask you about your reserving and actually taking in the other direction, because I think you've been ahead of the curve in terms of building reserves. But when would you actually start to think about releasing reserves? And I mean, especially as charge-offs start to move up, you have reserves for those, for the loans that are charged off. And you - presumably then, your provisioning will reflect reserves on new growth and any sort of recalibration of reserves on the back book as we reassess the losses there. But I'm curious, is - should - could we start to see reserve releases quicker than people expect as charge-offs move up? Or do you think that there's sort of a predisposition for reserves to be sticky and less reserve releases going forward just because of the vast uncertainty in the macro environment. So I'm just kind of curious how we see things in terms of reserve levels as sort of credit normalizes, and we get a little bit more visibility on the macro dynamics.\nTayfun Tuzun: So setting aside the impact of loan balances on reserves. Clearly, if the loan balances decline, there's going to be impact of that. Setting that aside for a moment, what we have so far observed is coming out of the first quarter into May and to June and now into July, there is more stability in the economic scenarios that are being provided by Moody's as well as just overall market expectations. My expectation is that banks will continue to watch that progress over the next quarter or two. Because in order to be able to release reserves, you need to develop a confidence that - on the sustainability of the economic outlook. And if that - if the level of sustainability is truly dependable and if the economic indicators should give us the confidence, the answer to your question is, yes. At one point, we will start releasing reserves. But I do believe that we are a few quarters early on that, assuming that there is stability. We do need time in order to develop that level of confidence.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Connor: I was wondering if you could just talk about the process of kind of credit risk management more on like a granular basis, like at the ground level. Obviously, there's been some time since the role of collectors was all that important. So just talk about how you're reallocating, I would assume, some of your resources from originating loans to collecting loans in anticipation of more work to do there?\nRichard Stein: Matt, it's Richard. So if we think about portfolio management broadly, the expectation is that the relationship managers and their portfolio managers that work with them are continuously reviewing the portfolio. Since the pandemic, we've increased the frequency of those portfolio reviews. We've done specific targeted reviews around industry and geography and product. And from those outcomes, we've seen some re-rating and rating changes. And as a result, as things slide, we move - we start to leverage our special assets group. And there, have been really helpful at helping us work through problem credits, making sure that we can rehabilitate where appropriate. And what we're doing is we are absolutely reallocating resources from both the relationship management teams and our underwriting teams into special assets to increase the capacity there. And virtually, all of them have come from inside of Fifth Third. And the people we've drafted have historical experience and workout in special assets. And so we're trying to leverage that expertise across the platform. But it's the frequency of the reviews and making sure we've got continuity from a coverage standpoint from end-to-end.\nMatt O'Connor: And is the plan that you should be able to continue to do it in-house reallocating? Or do you think you might need to staff up with some - or partnering with like third parties?\nRichard Stein: We're not going to - we're not looking to partner with third parties. We believe we can cover with in-house resources.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. All right, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Tayfun or maybe, Jamie, on the loan loss reserves that you have established, Tayfun you outlaid those two economic scenarios for us, the downside one and the base case. Are those reserves set to a mix of those scenarios? Or is it - are they set to the base case scenario? And second, what metrics are you looking at going forward to see if you need to increase those reserves because of a worsening in the economy?\nJames Leonard: Yes, Gerard, it's Jamie. We do use three scenarios weighted with a baseline and then using Moody's one upside scenario, one downside scenario that Tayfun outlined for you. The major economic variables that have the greatest impact on the reserve levels would be unemployment, GDP, HPI are the ones that have the biggest impact on the models. And as Tayfun mentioned, this quarter, the build of $355 million in the ACL, the vast majority of that build was driven by the deterioration in the outlook, and then you have the net impact of loan portfolio decline and migration and ratings almost offsetting each other.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then moving over to the higher-risk commercial portfolio that's exposed to the COVID-19 issues, it fell 9%, as you showed us, to $12.8 billion. When you look going forward, is that a momentum that you can continue having a drop that much in a quarter? And second, what percentage of charge-offs are attributed to bringing that balance down?\nJames Leonard: Yes, I would say, in terms of the momentum going forward, the biggest improvement or biggest factor in the second quarter improvement was the paydown of the defensive draws we saw in the first quarter, and that drove a healthy portion of that decline. In terms of the charge-off composition, this quarter, you had a decent amount of the growth driven by energy and leisure and entertainment. As we look ahead to the third quarter, I think you'll see a common theme with entertainment and leisure, perhaps some CRE and then obviously, energy, as it completes its restructure. So I would say it's - a healthy portion of the charge-off expectation is driven by that COVID stress portfolio. But again, we still feel good about our client selection and the fact that, as Richard pointed out, it's a well-managed portfolio. It's just in this environment, there will be losses, but we think they'll be manageable.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKen Zerbe: I think you guys mentioned that some of the lower - the loan balances being lower and the lower NII guidance for third quarter is really driven by - at least in part, by further corporate line drawdowns. How much of the excess line drives, in terms of balances, do you still have outstanding? And I guess, are you assuming that all those fully run off or normalize or the line utilization normalizes by the end of 3Q? Thanks.\nJames Leonard: Yes, Ken. I think the guidance is based on average loan balances. So they really truly reflect what happened, especially sort of second half of May into June. So the second to third quarter guidance truly reflects that speedy paybacks at the end - towards the end of the second quarter. It's been stable so far. Utilization rate is basically back to where it was pre-pandemic. But again, the decline in average commercial balances is more a function of what happened at the end of the second quarter, more so than the third quarter.\nKen Zerbe: And I may have missed this, but have you addressed or did you address like this commentary around sort of ex corporate line draws, just the general sentiment around C&I borrowers? Like are you building in any expectation that C&I or other loan balances actually are declining in 3Q? Thanks.\nJames Leonard: There's not a lot of customer demand for new loans, Ken. The market is very muted at this point, both for economic reasons as well as for what's going on with sort of the healthcare situation that limits interactions. But so far, we're not seeing a whole lot of activity from our clients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.\nRahul Patil: This is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. I just want to go back to the discussion around the reserve release. And I want to put some numbers around it so correct me if I'm wrong. So you've guided to average loans down 3.5%, 4%. Let's say, loans growth - loans are declining, looks like around $4 billion of that. Commercial loans are coming down, $5 billion. Consumer is going up by $1 billion. And you've guided to charge-offs of around - it looks like it's around $150 million in 3Q of charge-offs. So am I thinking about this right, that in terms of provisioning in 3Q, the - really, the main driver of provision will be the consumer new loan growth of $1 billion. And basically, is it fair to then assume and apply that 3% reserve ratio on that $1 billion of new loan growth. And basically, that would imply like $30 million to $40 million of provision in third quarter. Am I thinking about that right?\nTayfun Tuzun: One needs to take into account what happens at the end of period. So you just have to - obviously, it's useful to look at the average loan guidance. But we will - when we get to the end of the third quarter, we will see where the balances are at that point. And if there are zero builds, our reserve position will reflect the end-of-period balances compared to - and the movement will be compared to the end-of-period balances in the second quarter.\nRahul Patil: But I just want to make sure like conceptually, am I thinking about this correctly in terms of - with regards to provision, and this is also assuming that the macro doesn't get worse or doesn't get better. It's basically assuming a status quo.\nJames Leonard: Yes. The provision could go down, clearly. I mean, if loans continue to go down and the charge-offs stay flat, there is a path which would indicate that the provision number on our income statement will be lower, so that could happen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAmanda Larsen: This is Amanda Larsen, on for Ken. Can you talk about the accelerated pace of technology investments that you expect? What have you learned about your technology during the pandemic? Are your structural uses of technology not as efficient as you hoped? Or is it more about client-facing technology and you feel limited in your ability to service your clients versus peers? And then as an addendum, if there's any business segment that you can touch on that may require like better tax, that would be helpful now. Thanks\nGregory Carmichael: Amanda, this is Greg. First off, we - our strategy and focus on investing in our technology platforms to better serve our customers through product distribution or servicing capabilities hasn't changed. And I think we've made tremendous progress as evidenced by the fact that 75% of all of our transactions now go through our digital channels, using that technology to serve our clients in a much more efficient way. There's more opportunities in front of us and there's an opportunity to replatform our commercial loan system, which we're going to do that. Origination system, we're going to do that. There's opportunities to continue to make the whole mortgage process a digital experience, and that's rolling out as we speak. So we'll continue to invest in those opportunities. In addition to that, there's tremendous opportunities, I believe. When you think about our back office to apply technologies, robotics, artificial intelligence in that environment in a more aggressive way to take out long-term costs, so when we think about our expense base and how we're looking forward here, we'll replace our technology dollars to drive the best outcome for our shareholders and serve our customers. It's going to be the area of automation of our back office, it's going to be continued automation of our origination systems, and it's going to be continued automation of our ability to distribute our products. In addition to that, when you think about the environment we're operating in, resiliency is extremely important. You always have to be on. This isn't 10 years ago, five years ago, where you can afford to have your systems offline. You have to always be on for your customers. So investments in our core infrastructure. We don't want to put new technology, new capabilities on old infrastructure. So it's refurbishing our older infrastructure, pulling our new infrastructure, focused on, once again, serving our clients and making us more efficient going forward in operations.\nAmanda Larsen: And then can you talk about the outlook for consumer loan growth? You certainly sound more positive on the consumer credit performance. Where do you expect the 3% consumer loan growth to come for in 3Q? Is it auto - Is it all auto? Or are you believing in elsewhere?\nGregory Carmichael: No, auto, I think, obviously, we expect to see - the team's done a fantastic job. As we've talked before, we're a super prime borrower in that space. We expect to continue to see growth in auto and attractive spreads. In addition to that, we expect our mortgage business also in our mortgage portfolio continue to expand as we go forward here. Card and so forth, we don't expect to see much growth in those areas.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.\nChristopher Marinac: Thanks, good morning. Greg, is there an update on the CFPB issue? And is that possible to get resolved before the end of the year?\nGregory Carmichael: First off, I wish it was resolved, and I do not have an update. This is a loan cycle process. As we've stated through numerous channels, we're very comfortable in our position here and willing to deal with that as we move forward here. But there is no update. Is there potential to get settled? Sure. There's always a potential it could get settled. But at the end of the day, we want to make sure that Fifth Third is viewed appropriately and the opportunity to characterize our behavior and the actions that we took proactively, I think, is very, very important to us. So no update at this point. But hopefully, we could solve it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, Woods. Your line is open.\nBrian Klock: Just one real quick follow-up. I know that you guys talked about some of the elevated expenses from the better revenue production that came in some of your fee businesses. And you've talked about some of the technology spend as well. I guess, just thinking about the guidance for the third quarter includes some acceleration of some automation and tech expenses. I mean, if we think about what a normalized run rate is even before you think about the new initiatives on the expense savings that you're going to be reviewing; and do we think that a normal run rate, I guess, beyond the third quarter should be something that's maybe back towards that $1.50 billion range where you kind of were before? Is that the way to think about it?\nTayfun Tuzun: Yes. I mean, at this point, given the fact that we are spending a lot of time on analyzing the expense base and looking for opportunities for efficiencies. I'd rather not get into the longer-term outlook for expenses, but it is clear that our intent is to lower our expense base from where it is today, so I will make that statement. And as Greg said, we continue to invest in areas where we believe we need to invest in to continue to grow our Company. But our intent is to do it in a way with the utmost efficiency at the rest of the Company. So the focus of this study is going to be lowering the expense base that we are running today and taking it from there.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: I have a follow-up. Jamie, can you tell us, on the consumer portfolio where you guys mentioned, I think, 53% of the deferrals have exited the program. Where did they go? Are they all back on accruing status? Or are they in some sort of work out and is separate from the COVID relief programs? Or were they charged off?\nJames Leonard: Yes. So of the loans, the consumer portfolio, this was through last Friday, 53% exited, 12% went into a new relief program. And those programs, I think we've got a pretty good approach there where we offer a short-term program of six months at 50% of your normal payment or we offer with certain eligibility criteria and proof of hardship to longer-term loan modification. And so that's 12% of the group. And of the remaining group, the vast, vast majority, I think the number is 79% or so are making payments and are back on track. And so one of the earlier questions was just how do we feel about the consumer loan portfolio and ultimately, how much support is out there? When we look at our growth rates and our delinquency rates on that core book, it is very good, which is why we're confident in our second half of the year outlook on consumer charge-offs.\nGerard Cassidy: And then just finally, Tayfun, this may be a naive question. Coming back to the cash balances, if you take out the money from the PPP loans that may have come into people's deposit accounts and you take out the line draws that were unusual because of the situation we're in today, where is all the cash coming from? Are companies just not spending on capital expenditures? And why is there such elevated cash balances, excluding those two reasons that I mentioned?\nTayfun Tuzun: Yes, I think, Gerard, clearly, the inability to use the cash in the short-term is one aspect of why these companies - and it's both individuals as well as companies. So we expect that some of the natural rundown is going to be base that they're going to have to spend that cash within their operating capital. The other one is, I think it is very likely that they - some of our clients have consolidated their deposits into a smaller number of banks, and we have been a beneficiary of that. Because as we look at the distribution, the distribution is extremely granular, which suggests that, again, more of a relationship-based direction in deposit flows than anything else.\nOperator: I'd now like to turn the call back over to Chris Doll for closing remarks.\nChristopher Doll: Thank you, Denise, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR department, and we'll be happy to assist you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Gregory Carmichael",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I'll focus most of my comments on the actions we have taken to navigate this challenging environment, and provide some highlights on our strong financial performance this quarter. Tayfun will then provide more details related to the quarterly financial results in his remarks. In light of the ongoing challenges brought on by the pandemic and the heightened civil unrest resulting from the inequities in our country, we continue to prioritize our actions to support our customers, our communities and our employees. We proactively made over 3 million calls to our customers since the onset of the pandemic to assess their financial situation. In total, we have processed over 150,000 loan deferral and forbearance requests since the rollout of our COVID hardship programs, or approximately 6% of total loans. More than 35% of those in our consumer deferral or forbearance programs have made one or more payments. Consumer hardship relief requests, including mortgage, declined approximately 85% from the mid-April peak through last week of June. Beginning July 1st, we started methodically transitioning our customers from the COVID hardship programs to a combination of short and long-term options if the customer required further assistance, depending on the product type and borrower circumstances. This approach is consistent with our pre-COVID hardship programs. As of the end of last week, more than 50% of the consumer loan deferrals have transitioned off the COVID programs, of which only 12% have requested additional hardship assistance. In total, consumers who have exited COVID programs and requested additional relief represent less than 0.5% of total consumer loans. The declining request, the high percentage of customers who have made a payment and a small number of customers requesting additional assistance, give us confidence in the strength of the underlying credit quality of our consumer portfolio. In addition to providing hardship relief, we continue to support our customers through the Paycheck Protection Program. Due to the tremendous efforts by hundreds of Fifth Third employees, we have successfully originated $5.5 billion of loans, benefiting 38,000 small and mid-sized businesses, which in turn, helps approximately 500,000 employees of our PPP customers. Looking ahead the client forgiveness request, where we are awaiting further clarity from the SBA, we have developed an automated solution, which should help simplify the forgiveness process. Ultimately, we estimate nearly 90% of PPP clients will request and qualify for forgiveness. Our top priority remains the health and safety of our customers and employees. While we have kept approximately 99% of our branches open throughout the pandemic to serve our customers, we continue to monitor developments in select geographies, given the recent increase in COVID cases, and we will continue to follow the state and CDC guidelines to protect the safety of our employees and customers. We continue to encourage customers to utilize our digital tools going into pandemic. As a result, we are seeing increased adoption rates with about 75% of all transactions now occurring through our digital channels. Now moving on to financial results. Our second quarter performance was strong. Once again, our results highlight the strength of our franchise and our ability to navigate the dynamic environment and mitigate the impact of lower rates through well diversified fee revenues and continued expense discipline. We have now generated year-over-year adjusted positive operating leverage in seven out of the past eight quarters and grew tangible book value per share for five consecutive quarters. We grew common equity Tier 1 capital this quarter despite adding to our reserves and paying nearly $200 million in common dividends. Our CET1 ratio improved 35 basis points to 9.7%. Additionally, our loan to core deposit ratio reached a historically low level of 72%, excluding PPP loans. Our strong capital and liquidity ratios are indicative of our balance sheet strength, which will serve us well as we navigate this challenging environment. With respect to capital, we recently announced our indicative stress capital buffer requirement from the 2020 CCAR exercise of 2.5%, which is a floor under the regulatory capital rules. Without the floor, we estimate our buffer would have been approximately 2.1%. We also announced our intention to maintain our current common dividend per share and continue the suspension of share repurchases through at least year-end. We will continue to provide our Board with the necessary information to make forward-looking and data-driven decisions about the sustainability of the dividend. In terms of credit quality, the net charge-off ratio of 44 basis points this quarter was better than the low end of our previous guidance range, reflecting improvement in consumer and relative stability in commercial. While we do not have perfect foresight with respect to the duration or severity of this downturn, we have consistently communicated our through-the-cycle principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and an overall balance sheet management approach focused on long-term performance. While economic visibility remains low, our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. From a commercial client standpoint, we continue to focus on generating relationships with clients who have more diversified and resilient balance sheets as well as multiple sources of repayment. We've been very successful keeping our client relationships. And as a result, have generated record capital markets revenue in three out of the last four quarters. We believe this composition towards larger relationships will serve us well as our clients navigate the pandemic. In fact, corporate banking clients representing approximately 20% of our exposures successfully accessed the debt and equity capital markets since the onset of the pandemic to bolster their liquidity, including 20% in the COVID high-impact industries. We continue to believe we are well positioned relative to peers in commercial real estate, an area where we have been deliberately underweight. We have focused predominantly on top-tier developers with a track record of resilience and significantly lower LTVs compared to the last downturn. Our portfolio is well diversified by geography and property type, including virtually no land loans. And as we have discussed before, we continue to get at the low end of peers as a percentage of total capital. It is worth noting that across both of our portfolios in consumer and commercial, we have focused on maintaining geographical diversification through several national businesses, including indirect auto and residential mortgage in addition to C&I and CRE. Our credit risk is well diversified beyond our retail footprint through these national lending businesses, which will be instrumental in delivering a differentiated credit performance given the likelihood of an uneven economic recovery. In addition to our deliberate positioning with respect to credit risk exposures, we have also spent many years preparing for a turn in the economic cycle by improving and diversifying both our key revenues and our loan portfolios, which was evident in the second quarter results. Our PPNR increased 10% from a year-ago quarter despite the continued headwinds from lower rates. This reflects a record quarter in capital markets, strong mortgage origination revenue, proactive liability management and continued expense discipline. Our four key strategic priorities, leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies, and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection, remain intact. Clearly, in this type of environment, we are putting the appropriate level of focus and prioritization on the initiatives within those four priorities, which had the highest probability of driving long-term financial success. Before I turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to once again thank our employees. I am very proud of the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers, our communities and each other during these unprecedented times. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook. Peter, this is Greg. First off, our intent is obviously to look at the opportunities in front of us. And the question was just asked about North Star, a lot of the expense opportunities in front of us are very similar to North Star. If you think about our branch transformation and opportunities to optimize our branch network. Thinking about the opportunities around our vendor management and the money that we spend in those areas and the attractive opportunities that sit there, rightsizing our organization for the sales opportunities. There are a lot of opportunities out there in front of us. So our intent would be to continue to invest in the critical aspects of our business that we've mentioned before, the digitization of our platforms, our Southeast expansion and so forth. We want to continue those investments. But over time, we would expect to run at a lower rate on expenses. And the realities of the revenue opportunities that are out there in the environment, we expect to run at a lower level going forward. Amanda, this is Greg. First off, we - our strategy and focus on investing in our technology platforms to better serve our customers through product distribution or servicing capabilities hasn't changed. And I think we've made tremendous progress as evidenced by the fact that 75% of all of our transactions now go through our digital channels, using that technology to serve our clients in a much more efficient way.

            "name": "Tayfun Tuzun",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin my review of the quarter, let me also reiterate that we are very proud of our - how our colleagues have responded to the many uncertainties that we face in navigating through the challenges associated with the nature of this downturn. We do believe that the actions that we have taken so far and those that we will be taking in the coming quarters will continue to display our strong desire to fulfill our role in reinvigorating the economy by maintaining and leveraging our strength to support our clients in managing through this difficult period. The data and information that are available to us today continue to indicate low visibility regarding the direction of the economy. Our discussion today and our decisions during the second quarter collectively reflect our cautious approach behind our decisions on managing risk exposures in this uncertain period. As we commented during our first quarter earnings conference call, our economic assumptions based on Moody's economic scenarios, which underlie our outlook, including the background scenarios reflected in our reserve build, did not and still do not assume a V-shape recovery. Our downside scenario assumes that GDP will remain below the end of 2019 levels until the second quarter of 2023 and the base case assumes that it does not recover until the second quarter of 2022. Also, our downside scenario assumes the unemployment rates will remain near 12% until the second quarter of 2021, and remain above 11% heading into 2022, with the base case scenario assuming that after the current spike in recovery, the unemployment rate will worsen and peak at nearly 9.5% in the second quarter of 2021 before slowly recovering. This reflects our belief that the downturn will be prolonged and the recovery uneven. Turning to Slide 4. With respect to the second quarter, we were pleased with our overall financial performance despite the economic conditions. We took advantage of favorable market conditions in mortgage and capital markets, which helped us exceed our fee income projections. Credit performance remained relatively strong during the quarter. Charge-offs were better than our prior expectations, and the NPA ratio increased just 5 basis points sequentially. Deposit growth significantly exceeded our expectations. Although clearly a good portion of the inflows were related to the stimulus programs, we believe that we can leverage our clients' demonstrated preference to bank with us for future revenue opportunities and enhanced client interaction. We improved our regulatory capital and liquidity position during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio increased 35 basis points to above 9.7% despite the reserve build and exceeds the required minimum, including the indicative stress capital buffer by over 270 basis points. Our loan to core deposit ratio improved to 75 basis point at 75% as our short-term investments, predominantly interest-bearing cash were approximately $28 billion at quarter end. Our loan to core deposit ratio was 72%, excluding PPP loans. The combined hedge and investment portfolio on realized gain position stands at $3.9 billion, reflecting the growing value associated with the long-term protection that these portfolios provide. As a proof point, the sequential decline of our investment portfolio yield is about a third of the peer median decline. Reported results for the quarter included a negative $0.07 impact from several notable items, including a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap, certain real estate impairments, including from our branch network, specific COVID-related expenses, MB merger-related charges and a debt extinguishment charge. Second quarter pre-provision net revenue improved 4% from the prior quarter and 10% from the prior year as we generated positive operating leverage again despite the rate headwinds. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved nearly 200 basis points from last quarter and improved nearly 100 basis points from the year ago quarter. Return metrics were impacted by our reserve build, but we continue to produce strong revenues, while also generating efficiencies throughout the Company. Moving to Slide 5. Total average loans increased 7% sequentially, reflecting growth in C&I from increased line draws and PPP loans as well as growth in construction and auto loans. Excluding PPP, total average loans increased 4% sequentially. Given the rather uneven line utilization trends during the quarter, the timing of PPP loans, we are also providing period-end balance performance. End-of-period loans declined $3 billion sequentially or 3%, reflecting a repayment of line draws as well as subdued borrower demand in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. Our commercial line utilization rate was 38% at quarter end, down 9% from mid-April and essentially flat compared to the pre-pandemic rates. Line utilization so far this quarter has been stable. Commercial pipelines remain generally soft, as you would expect, and our focus continues to be on our existing client base in this environment. Average commercial real estate loans increased 4% sequentially, reflecting draws on previous commitments. Period-end CRE loans were flat compared to the prior quarter. As we discussed many times before, we believe that our industry loan CRE balance as a percentage of risk-based capital, which is less than half of what it was during the last downturn, combined with the strong risk profile of our borrowers, will benefit our future credit results, given the likelihood that commercial real estate will be exposed rather severely during this downturn. Average total consumer loans decreased 1% from last quarter. Growth in auto was offset by declines in home equity and credit cards. Auto production in the quarter was strong at $1.5 billion, rebounding nicely after the April slowdown with healthy spreads and the same super prime profile as before. Our average origination FICO scores were nearly 770 this quarter. Most of the other consumer loan categories reflected the generally-subdued borrower demand and consumer spend levels due to both weak economic activity and government stimulus and other benefit programs. Moving on to Slide 6. Average core deposits increased 19% sequentially with double-digit growth in all deposit captions, except consumer CDs and foreign office deposits. Our growth, so far, is multiple points ahead of the peer banks. This record deposit growth came from growth in every line of business and was very granular across product types and customer size. Growth in the initial months of the quarter reflected deposits from line draw proceeds, followed by growth from depositors who obtain funding through the PPP. Overall, the deposit performance reflects our strong long-standing client relationships, our customers' desire to remain extremely liquid in this environment and the lack of significant investment and growth opportunities. Average commercial transaction deposits increased 34%, and average consumer transaction deposits increased 8%. Commercial growth was well diversified between corporate banking and middle market clients. Average demand deposits represented 31% of total core deposits in the current quarter compared to 29% in the prior quarter. As shown on Slide 7, we have continued to take proactive steps to mitigate the impact of lower rates, which should provide additional support in the coming quarters. Compared to last quarter, we lowered our interest-bearing core deposit rates, 41 basis points, while generating record deposit growth, more than the high end of our previous rate guidance range and sooner than we expected. As a result, our June interest-bearing core deposit rate of 21 basis points was below the floor of the previous rate cycle with every product category meaningfully lower as we exited the second quarter. Our total core deposit costs, including DDAs, was just 19 basis points in the second quarter and 14 basis points in June. We expect third quarter interest-bearing core deposit costs to benefit from our actions and decline another 11 basis points. This reflects a cumulative beta in excess of 40. In addition to the actions taken with respect to deposits, we also terminated $3 billion in FHLB advances. End-of-period wholesale borrowings declined 13% sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, our current loan to core deposit ratio was 72%, excluding PPP loans at the end of the second quarter, significantly below almost all peers. Our current expectation is that the liquidity environment will be slow to change. We expect that our current loan to core deposit ratio will remain at or around the current levels at least through the end of this year. Although we are aggressively lowering our deposit rates, we will maintain a strong preference to meet the needs of our clients, which we believe will reward us in the long term. Ultimately, we believe that the strength of our deposit franchise will help lower and keep deposit costs below previous lows, while growing our client relationships. Turning to Slide 8. Net interest income decreased $30 million or 2% compared to the prior quarter. The NII performance reflects the impact of lower market rates on commercial loans, mortgage portfolio prepayments and the decline in home equity and credit card balances. These impacts were partially offset by elevated average commercial revolving line of credit balances and growth from lower-yielding PPP loans as well as continued focus on reducing deposit costs and the favorable impact of previously executed hedges. As you can see on this slide, the hedges added an incremental $30 million to our second quarter NII or a total contribution of $62 million during the quarter. Purchase accounting adjustments benefited our second quarter net interest margin by 4 basis points this quarter. Our NIM decreased 53 basis points sequentially. Although not detrimental to our net interest income, elevated cash had a 29 basis point incremental negative impact on our NIM, in addition to a 1 basis point drag from PPP loans. Our period-end short-term cash position increased by 4.5 times from $6.3 billion at the end of March to $28 billion at the end of June, with period end excess cash 18 times higher than our 2019 average. Excluding the impact of elevated cash positions and PPP loans, we estimate that our NIM would have been just about 3%. Our focus in this environment is on long-term NIM performance. As such, given the lack of attractive alternative investments and the uncertainty on the timing of future deposit outflows, we expect to remain in this cash position longer than we anticipated in early June. We don't believe that it is in our best interest to deploy any portion of the cash reserves today. We believe that there is more leverage in continuing to reduce our funding costs with the help of our strong liquidity position, but we will reevaluate our options if the market environment changes. In addition to the anticipated longer duration of our cash position, our expected NIM and NII progression over the next two quarters also changed compared to our earlier expectations as the PPP forgiveness period lengthen, which resulted in pushing out our expectations of the timing of the recognition of interest income to the fourth quarter and early next year. At this time, we anticipate forgiveness to commence in the fourth quarter, with about 60% of the NII benefit to accrue in the fourth quarter and the rest during the first quarter of 2021. We expect that our normalized NIM, excluding the impact of elevated cash and PPP loans, is approximately 3% and will remain there for the foreseeable future, helped by our interest rate hedges and investment portfolio composition. In our investment portfolio, we had a net discount accretion this quarter of $1 million as opposed to multiple millions of dollars of premium amortization some of our peers are experiencing. As we have always stated, one needs to look at both the derivative portfolio, where we took early actions with great entry points for longer duration, as well as the structure of the investment portfolio to gauge the long-term NIM performance. The significant impact of our cash reserves and the PPP portfolio during the next few quarters will create some noise, but we anticipate a more stable environment past that. The third quarter NIM is expected to contract another 7 to 10 basis points, driven by the full quarter impact of higher cash positions and PPP loans with NIM expected to then recover in the fourth quarter. The third quarter contraction is predominantly related to higher average cash balances on our balance sheet as the impact of lower rates is expected to be offset by the continued benefits of our hedge portfolio and deposit rate reductions. Moving on to Slide 9. We once again had a very strong quarter generating fee revenue to offset the pressure on interest income. The resilience in our fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved. Reported non-interest income decreased by 3% sequentially. Adjusted noninterest income of $670 million exceeded the high end of our previous guidance range by approximately $20 million. The strong performance was driven by another record in capital markets as well as better-than-previously-anticipated results in mortgage and wealth and asset management. In our commercial business, the strong performance was led by capital markets revenue, which increased nearly 20% from last quarter and approximately 50% from the year ago quarter. Debt and equity capital markets, both achieved record quarters, again, reflecting our clients' ability to access the market to bolster their liquidity positions. Mortgage banking origination fees and gains on loan sales were strong in the second quarter, up nearly 20%, reflecting improved margins. Originations of $3.4 billion decreased 15% sequentially due to a temporary pause in the corresponding channel in May as we waited for clarification from the agencies regarding loans for sale that entered the forbearance category. Mortgage originations, excluding correspondent channel production, increased 22% compared to the prior quarter.  Our retail originations were up 37% versus last quarter. Asset management fees were down 4%, reflecting the impact of equity market levels throughout the quarter. Total wealth and asset management revenue decreased 10% from the prior quarter, to a large extent, reflecting the seasonal decline in tax preparation fees. Card and processing revenue decreased $4 million or 5%, resulting from lower credit and debit volumes throughout the quarter, reflecting reduced customer spend, partially offset by lower rewards. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect low-to-mid single-digit growth in processing fees. Deposit service charges decreased sequentially, reflecting lower consumer and commercial fees, which were impacted by the record growth in deposit balances as well as hardship-related fee waivers granted throughout the quarter. Given some of the trends that we have seen towards the end of the quarter, we expect double-digit growth in deposit fees in the third quarter. Moving on to Slide 10. Second quarter reported pretax expenses included COVID-related expenses of $12 million, merger-related items of $9 million and FHLB debt extinguishment charge of $6 million, and intangible amortization expense of $12 million. Adjusting for these items and prior items shown in our materials, non-interest expense decreased over 5% sequentially and decreased approximately 3.5% compared to the year ago. Also, due to the mark-to-market nature of our non-qualified deferred comp plans, our expenses include the impact of $22 million expense compared to a $26 million benefit last quarter. Excluding this impact, our expenses declined $110 million or over 9% sequentially, driven by the declines from seasonal items, reduced marketing expense and continued discipline managing expenses throughout the Company. As we are diligently managing in-period expenses, we are also assessing our longer-term efficiency opportunities. We will continue to accelerate our investments in technology and innovation as we see permanent shifts in customer behavior and an increased need to reduce our dependence on manual processes in our operations. We are also very focused on improving the resiliency of our technology infrastructure to achieve a world-class network structure as more and more customer interactions are shifting to digital products. We are also accelerating our implementation of nCino in our commercial business. At the same time, we are very focused on working with an expense base that is more aligned with the muted revenue growth expectations over the next few years. We are sizing our targets within that context and approaching this comprehensively, including opportunities in corporate real estate, vendor management, alignment of our sales capacity with market opportunities, the size of our retail branch network and more efficient middle office and back office operations. Some, but not all of these actions, will be based on environmental factors. We are performing a deeper structural review of our business lines and middle office and back-office functions to identify opportunities that improve the profitability of our Company. We plan to share the outcome of our review with you in the next couple of months when we finalize our findings and decisions. As always, you can trust us to be prudent in managing our expenses with utmost flexibility. Slide 11 provides an update on our COVID high-impact portfolios. The amount on this page represent approximately 11% of our total loans and are down 9% from the last quarter, excluding PPP loans. As you can see, the paydowns during the quarter reduced our balances relative to the first quarter in all subcategories, except for leisure travel, where we have a rather small overall exposures, all to larger operators. The total balances on this slide include approximately $1 billion from our leveraged loan portfolio, which is now under $4 billion. The information on this slide lays out the reasons why we believe that our client selection in these portfolios has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that have access to capital in stressed environments and that we have the appropriate credit mitigants in place to limit the ultimate loss content in these portfolios. In addition, on Slide 12, we give you a snapshot of our energy portfolio. This portfolio is less levered and carries a higher hedge position than the portfolio during the last downturn in oil prices. As you can see, the leverage in this portfolio is 2 turns lower with a higher RBL balance and approximately one third of the percentage exposure to oilfield services compared to 2015. Our ongoing stress tests indicate that the level of charge-offs in our energy portfolio under stressed conditions would not meaningfully deviate from the rest of our commercial portfolio. Nearly 80% of the portfolio is in reserve-based structures, and we recently reduced our overall RBL borrowing base approximately 15% as a result of the spring re-determination. On Slide 13, we provide an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios. The FICO scores clearly indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over 55% containing FICO scores of 750 or higher on a balance-weighted basis. Approximately 90% of the consumer portfolio is secured. And as you can see by our FICO band distributions, our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high prime, super prime space. As we have previously discussed, we have taken proactive steps to enhance our underwriting standards, specifically on minimum FICO scores and maximum LTV levels in addition to increasing our efforts in collections. Turning to credit results on Slide 14. Net charge-offs were flat sequentially. The consumer net charge-off ratio declined 14 basis points this quarter, following a 12 basis point decline in the prior quarter. And commercial net charge-offs were relatively stable, resulting in a total net charge-off ratio of 44 basis points, better than the low end of our previous expectations. NPAs continue to be well-behaved at 65 basis points, up just 3 basis points since before the pandemic. The sequential increase was entirely in commercial, predominantly in the energy portfolio. As I just mentioned, we are comfortable with the loss content in our energy portfolio. The consumer nonperforming loans remain low. We added $355 million to our credit reserves this quarter, increasing our ACL ratio by 37 basis points to 2.5%. The incremental reserve build this quarter reflected the continued deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The cumulative increase in our allowance for credit losses since the end of 2019, including the day one impact, is now over $1.5 billion. As a reference point, we compare our current reserve level with a nine-quarter total loss estimates within the recent severe stress test runs - CCAR severe stress test runs. Our current reserves stand over - at over 60% of our Company run losses and nearly 40% of fed losses. The credit models that the Federal Reserve is utilizing still appear to be heavily influenced by our credit results during the last downturn, which results in a wide gap between our expectations and the fed's. Slide 15 provides more information on the allocation of our allowance and the composition of the changes this quarter. Higher levels of reserves in real estate-based portfolios reflect the deteriorated outlook in the economic scenarios related to real estate valuations in future periods. Including the impact of approximately $170 million in remaining discounts associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.64%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.76%. Our thoughts on the need-for-future reserve builds are similar to what you've heard from other banks. Our reserves reflect the current macroeconomic expectations embedded in the scenarios that we deploy in this exercise. If the outlook does not further deteriorate, there should not be a need to increase our reserve coverage beyond the current levels. Any further increases in reserves would result from a higher likelihood of a more severe and prolonged double dip scenario. Turning to Slide 16. Our capital and liquidity positions remained very strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at over 9.7%, exceeding the first quarter level, even as we built reserves. Given the dynamics during the quarter, we are providing you a CET1 reconciliation between net income, risk-weighted assets and the impact of dividends. As you can see, dividend payouts constitute a very small portion of the change in CET1. It is important to note that our capital levels are now well above our targets. As you may recall, our capital target in early 2019 was 9%. We raised that level closer to 9.5% about 1.5 years ago, and we are now above the 9.5% level. As a reminder, we had no buybacks in the first or second quarter, and our decision to extend that to the end of this year has changed the trajectory of our capital ratios. Even with buildup in reserves, we are ahead of our capital plan, and we expect continued strong levels of PPNR to support our current capital levels. We will be resubmitting our stress test sometime in the fall with the rest of the CCAR banks. We have been very consistent in stating our view that given our very strong capital ratios, balance sheet strength, earnings power and relatively modest pre-COVID dividend payout ratio, we expect to fare well. We believe that our performance in this downturn ultimately will prove the resiliency of our model. Despite the difference in projected loss rates between the two models that I just mentioned, we continue to show significant cushion in our forecasted capital ratios under stressed conditions. Our tangible book value per share was $22.66 this quarter, up 13% year-over-year. At the end of the quarter, our unrealized pretax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately $3.9 billion, which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios. From a liquidity perspective, we have over $100 billion in total liquidity sources. Slide 17 provides a summary of our current outlook. Given the uncertain environment, we continue to provide only quarterly expectations until we have more long-term visibility on the economic outlook. For the third quarter, we expect a decline in total average loan balances in the 3.5% to 4% range on a quarter-over-quarter basis, with a 6% to 7% decline in commercial loans and a 3% increase in consumer balances. The decline in commercial balances is a result of the paydowns in commercial credit lines. Net interest income is expected to decline approximately 3% compared to last quarter, assuming no benefits from accelerated amortization of PPP fees. This decline is primarily attributable to the impact of line paydowns in our commercial business as the impact of lower floating rate loans is fully offset by the hedges as well as the funding rate benefits. We expect non-interest income to increase 2 plus percent sequentially and expenses to increase about the same. Part of the expense increase is due to performance-based comp related to mortgage, wealth and asset management and leasing revenues that tend to result in higher dollar payouts. In addition, there are some accelerated expenses in IT that are related to our focus on automation. As I mentioned earlier, we are working on a broader expense reduction target that we will share with you in the coming months that is intended to reduce the pressure on our efficiency ratio, resulting from the weak revenue environment, and will also include longer-term structural targets. Total net charge-offs are expected to be in the 50 to 55 basis point range, continuing to reflect the widening gap between the near-term credit performance and the anticipated deterioration in credit metrics beyond 2020. In summary, our second quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we've made over the past few years, improving our resiliency, diversifying our revenues and proactively managing the balance sheet. With limited forecast visibility, we will continue to rely on the same principles: disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. We fully intend to preserve the optimal level of efficiency of our operations in this weak economic - weak revenue environment, while we maintain the investments that we believe are vital to preserve the earnings power and the operational resiliency of our Company. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. I think the - we believe we've stayed very close to our clients during the past five, six months as we entered this period and our sales force has been in close contact, and our relationships are very strong across the board in both corporate banking as well as middle market banking. And they are clearly showing a preference to bank with us and to increase the size of their relationships. I mean, this is purely a function of their willingness to work with us because we are not offering any significant rates to them that they can't get with rival banks. So we've lowered our deposit rates well below where we were in the first quarter. But I think the strength of our relationships and our sales force coverage is enabling us to maintain this level of liquidity. And we - I mean, our liquidity levels are significantly higher. The 19% deposit growth, I think, exceeds all of our peers and the increase in our liquidity position is significantly higher than others. Look I mean I think it doesn't impact the NII. We reflect the liquidity profile of the balance sheet. And it also gives us many opportunities in coming quarters to continue to deepen our relationships with our clients. That's our perspective. Scott, I don't want to give fourth quarter guidance at this point. But I think what you should rely on is not just for Q4 but also beyond Q4, we believe that 3% level, the 3% NIM, once we are past the PPP and once we are past the impact of the higher cash balances, it's probably a good sort of target for us. Erika, everything that we look at today as well as sort of the outlook that we have in place gives us a lot of confidence that we will have plenty of room. So North Star was a combination of revenue actions as well as expense actions. So we are talking here a focus on expenses only. And with respect to charges, it is way too early. And not necessarily all expense actions would accompany a charge associated with it. So I would not necessarily be too worried about that. I'm not saying that there's not a charge associated with any of the expense actions, but size-wise, at this point, I'm not too worried about it. I will answer the question about the conservative stance. Look, I mean, I think we all recognize that there's a lot of uncertainty and very low level of visibility. Under those circumstances, I think it's natural for us to be a bit more conservative. And with respect to the $3.9 billion gain, it gives us a lot of flexibilities. If there is a need or if we view that the future outlook for rates changes in our perspective such that, that gain is better off harvested and deployed for other purposes, there are some accounting realities that don't necessarily allow you to immediately recognize all of that gain. But it clearly provides a very significant pool of, I would say, capital that we can deploy going forward. At this point, given our view, we're very happy with the portfolios as they stand, and we will continue to harvest, and we have a long maturity date so we were benefited, but as you stated, Mike, it's a rich man's problem, and it gives us a good amount of flexibility. Two comments, Saul. So one is, if you actually normalize the NIM progress from the first quarter into the second quarter with cash positions and the PPP across all banks, you're getting to a much tighter distribution. So if you get to how core NIM has behaved, that volatility goes down significantly. From our perspective, we have $28 billion in cash, and we are choosing not to deploy any of that part just to show a higher NII outcome. Others have done that. Everybody has their own risk profile and risk preferences. I think what needs to be really more instrumental as we look forward, it's a long game and our outlook that the normalized NIM, once we pass-through this PPP period and a more normalized level of cash, is 3%. When you think about it, our NIM was 3.24% in the first quarter. So with where the short-term rates are and where the yield curve is, a 24 basis point movement between the first quarter NIM and our sort of longer-term outlook on NIM is a pretty good performance. And ultimately, again, this is just - we're talking about a few quarters here where things are going to look a little bit choppy, but NIM is just an outcome. And we have a strong preference in not going after NII boosts in the short-term that would put us into a riskier position in the long term. So setting aside the impact of loan balances on reserves. Clearly, if the loan balances decline, there's going to be impact of that. Setting that aside for a moment, what we have so far observed is coming out of the first quarter into May and to June and now into July, there is more stability in the economic scenarios that are being provided by Moody's as well as just overall market expectations. My expectation is that banks will continue to watch that progress over the next quarter or two. Because in order to be able to release reserves, you need to develop a confidence that - on the sustainability of the economic outlook. And if that - if the level of sustainability is truly dependable and if the economic indicators should give us the confidence, the answer to your question is, yes. At one point, we will start releasing reserves. But I do believe that we are a few quarters early on that, assuming that there is stability. We do need time in order to develop that level of confidence. One needs to take into account what happens at the end of period. So you just have to - obviously, it's useful to look at the average loan guidance. But we will - when we get to the end of the third quarter, we will see where the balances are at that point. And if there are zero builds, our reserve position will reflect the end-of-period balances compared to - and the movement will be compared to the end-of-period balances in the second quarter. Yes. I mean, at this point, given the fact that we are spending a lot of time on analyzing the expense base and looking for opportunities for efficiencies. I'd rather not get into the longer-term outlook for expenses, but it is clear that our intent is to lower our expense base from where it is today, so I will make that statement. And as Greg said, we continue to invest in areas where we believe we need to invest in to continue to grow our Company. But our intent is to do it in a way with the utmost efficiency at the rest of the Company. So the focus of this study is going to be lowering the expense base that we are running today and taking it from there. Yes, I think, Gerard, clearly, the inability to use the cash in the short-term is one aspect of why these companies - and it's both individuals as well as companies. So we expect that some of the natural rundown is going to be base that they're going to have to spend that cash within their operating capital. The other one is, I think it is very likely that they - some of our clients have consolidated their deposits into a smaller number of banks, and we have been a beneficiary of that. Because as we look at the distribution, the distribution is extremely granular, which suggests that, again, more of a relationship-based direction in deposit flows than anything else."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "James Leonard",
            "content": "Yes, Peter. It's Jamie. Thanks for the question. On the commercial side, I think you saw on the presentation, if you look at payment deferrals, 6% of the loan balances are in payment deferral and the vast majority, over 80% of the payment deferrals we have were 90 days in duration. But because they started midway through the quarter, not many of them have come off. So, I don't want to give you too much of a false positive. But to date, we've not had any request for the - a second 90-day deferral in the commercial book. I guess, some additional color would be that about 75% of our commercial customers that were on deferral have made payments while in the deferral. And then beyond the payment deferral information that we provided in terms of other types of forbearances, there's about 7% of the commercial book that's received a covenant waiver. Yes. So Mike, it's Jamie. On the commercial side, I think what you see is what you get, it's pretty straightforward, and there was a slight uptick in the charge offs, but it was offset by the improvement we saw on the consumer side. And so I think the heart of your question is how good is the consumer in this environment, given both the government support plus the support we've given customers that have requested it for the forbearance and payment deferrals. So when you look at our portfolio on the consumer side, Tayfun mentioned a couple of items. If you exclude mortgage because those were six months, and you look at the non-mortgage loans, only 12% have re-enrolled in additional hardship relief. And through last Friday, we've had over half of our original deferrals, they've come off the program. So I think that's one good data point. We initially expected that number to be as high as 30%. So the fact that we're experiencing 12% shows us both the government support plus the overall health of the consumer is perhaps a little bit better than we expected. The other data point I would point you to is for Fifth Third, in particular, Moody's published a study July 7th, and they evaluated the MSAs most-impacted by COVID. They used number of COVID cases, population density, tourism, global connectedness, et cetera. And the national average weighted by GDP was 0.31, and this was on a scale-up to 2.0 where we're playing golf, so lower is better. Our score for our consumer portfolio is 0.12. So we're 60% better than the national average. And so I think there's a lot of hard work going on in our consumer portfolio. We stopped the 90-day offers at the end of June. And really, we're working to move to the top of the customer payment priority and I think ultimately, between the geographic diversification we have, the overall credit quality of the book, you see in the FICO scores plus our revamped hardship programs, I think we're getting a good view that the consumer is doing better. And in fact, so much so that the second half of 2020, we expect our consumer charge-offs to be below the second half of 2019. Yes, Gerard, it's Jamie. We do use three scenarios weighted with a baseline and then using Moody's one upside scenario, one downside scenario that Tayfun outlined for you. The major economic variables that have the greatest impact on the reserve levels would be unemployment, GDP, HPI are the ones that have the biggest impact on the models. And as Tayfun mentioned, this quarter, the build of $355 million in the ACL, the vast majority of that build was driven by the deterioration in the outlook, and then you have the net impact of loan portfolio decline and migration and ratings almost offsetting each other. Yes, I would say, in terms of the momentum going forward, the biggest improvement or biggest factor in the second quarter improvement was the paydown of the defensive draws we saw in the first quarter, and that drove a healthy portion of that decline. In terms of the charge-off composition, this quarter, you had a decent amount of the growth driven by energy and leisure and entertainment. As we look ahead to the third quarter, I think you'll see a common theme with entertainment and leisure, perhaps some CRE and then obviously, energy, as it completes its restructure. So I would say it's - a healthy portion of the charge-off expectation is driven by that COVID stress portfolio. But again, we still feel good about our client selection and the fact that, as Richard pointed out, it's a well-managed portfolio. It's just in this environment, there will be losses, but we think they'll be manageable. Yes, Ken. I think the guidance is based on average loan balances. So they really truly reflect what happened, especially sort of second half of May into June. So the second to third quarter guidance truly reflects that speedy paybacks at the end - towards the end of the second quarter. It's been stable so far. Utilization rate is basically back to where it was pre-pandemic. But again, the decline in average commercial balances is more a function of what happened at the end of the second quarter, more so than the third quarter. There's not a lot of customer demand for new loans, Ken. The market is very muted at this point, both for economic reasons as well as for what's going on with sort of the healthcare situation that limits interactions. But so far, we're not seeing a whole lot of activity from our clients. Yes. The provision could go down, clearly. I mean, if loans continue to go down and the charge-offs stay flat, there is a path which would indicate that the provision number on our income statement will be lower, so that could happen. Yes. So of the loans, the consumer portfolio, this was through last Friday, 53% exited, 12% went into a new relief program. And those programs, I think we've got a pretty good approach there where we offer a short-term program of six months at 50% of your normal payment or we offer with certain eligibility criteria and proof of hardship to longer-term loan modification. And so that's 12% of the group. And of the remaining group, the vast, vast majority, I think the number is 79% or so are making payments and are back on track. And so one of the earlier questions was just how do we feel about the consumer loan portfolio and ultimately, how much support is out there? When we look at our growth rates and our delinquency rates on that core book, it is very good, which is why we're confident in our second half of the year outlook on consumer charge-offs."

These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.  This morning, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Risk Officer, Jamie Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.\nGregory Carmichael: Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Given the unprecedented nature of the environment, I will focus most of my commentary on the proactive steps we are taking to navigate this crisis due to the pandemic. And then Tayfun will provide more details related to the quarterly financial results in his remarks.  As all of you are aware, the events over the past couple of months related to the COVID-19 health crisis and resulting economic fallout has led us to reprioritize our focus. We are taking significant and ongoing actions to serve our customers, protect our employees and assist our communities. We believe these proactive steps will ultimately deliver long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.  Starting in early February, the executive team and the Board began actively planning and prioritizing the organization's response efforts. We quickly mobilized our workforce to accommodate remote access for a large number of employees. Currently, more than 50% of our workforce is working remotely across the company. And for many groups, that number is over 95%. For employees who are not able to do their job remotely, we have established social distancing and enhanced cleaning measures based on CDC guidelines. Throughout these uncertain times, we have been proactively communicating with our customers and employees. We have issued more than a dozen press releases, several fact sheets and numerous proactive outreaches to our customers in addition to ongoing updates on our website. We have also significantly increased the frequency of communications with our employees in order to keep them informed of the latest developments, recommendations and health precautions.  From a customer perspective, we are leveraging the strength of our balance sheet to help address the economic challenges many of our customers are facing. We are prudently extending credit to customers where we support economic activity. In March alone, we extended $13 billion of new credit, including approximately $8 billion from C&I line drills. In addition to keeping our traditional lending channels open, we are also participating in government-sponsored programs established as part of the Cares Act such as the SBA PPP and the forthcoming Main Street Lending Program.  With respect to PPP, we assisted approximately 10,000 clients to employ over 300,000 employees totaling nearly $3.5 billion. To maximize our support, we recently announced we suspended share repurchases. And as Tayfun will discuss in greater detail, we continue to have strong capital and equity levels to weather a prolonged downturn. In addition to utilizing our strong balance sheet, we are directly supporting consumers and businesses by keeping 99% of our branches open and fully operational with modified health protocols and amended hours as appropriate. We continue to process over 100,000 branch transactions per day, underpinning our role as an essential service provider. And for many of their banking needs, we continue to encourage our customers to use our highly rated digital platforms in addition to our network of approximately 53,000 fee-free ATMs.  Furthermore, we continue to proactively engage with our customers. Our bankers have personally connected with 2 million customers over the past month to see how they are doing under these circumstances, both personally and financially, and to offer systems as needed under our extensive financial hardship relief programs. In March, we began providing relief in the form of payment deferrals and forbearances to customers across a wide array of lending products. We also suspended vehicle repossessions in home foreclosures. Since the roll of our systems programs, we have processed over 96,000 hardship requests, which represents approximately $1.5 billion in Fifth Third loan balances in addition to $6 billion from our mortgage servicing portfolio.  As I mentioned, taking care of our employees is a top priority. In addition to our safety measures, we have announced special payments of up to $1,000 per employee for those providing essential banking services. These measures have helped maintain call center operations and branch personnel at appropriate levels. For our communities, we recently committed nearly $9 million in philanthropic funds to help address the effects of COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to take proactive and aggressive measures to help mitigate the effects of the downturn. From a macro perspective, while we do not know the duration or severity of the crisis, we have spent many years preparing for a downturn by strengthening our balance sheet through a disciplined approach to credit and by increasing our capital and liquidity levels. We have also improved and diversified our revenue streams in our loan portfolios. Finally, we evaluate our firm-wide resilience through stress testing our balance sheet under a range of conditions worse than the last crisis and more severe than a regulatory run stress test.  Since the financial crisis, we have taken several steps, which have put us in a very strong position. We transformed our overall approach to credit risk management, centralized credit underwriting and added stringent geographics, sector and product level concentration limits. We exited certain commercial real estate segments and have remained disciplined in our existing CRE portfolio. The client selection focused on top-tier developers and virtually no land loans. We also continue to maintain an underweight position relative to our peers.  We exited businesses such as commodity trader lending and mezzanine lending. 3 years ago, we exited $5 billion in commercial loans, given the risk return profile. This has helped reduce our leveraged lending exposures by over 50%. We have also reduced our indirect commercial leasing portfolio by almost $2 billion over the past 2 years, which has significantly lowered our exposure to certain assets such as commercial aircrafts and railcars. Lastly, we have maintained our credit discipline in our consumer portfolio with a weighted average FICO score above 750. We have consistently communicated our through-the-cycle principles of disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and an overall balance sheet managed approach focused on long-term performance horizon.  Our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. Our first quarter operating results reflect the strength of our franchise and the strategic decisions we made in managing our balance sheet, our interest rate risk and our liquidity risk exposures in light of the rapid and widespread economic deterioration we saw towards the end of the quarter.  Net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest income and expenses all performed in line with or better than our January guidance, with a net charge-off ratio also consistent with our previous expectations. Tayfun will discuss the changes in our allowance in more detail.  Similar to what you have seen from many of our peers, our reserves reflect the CECL adoption, the economic impacts of COVID-19, lower oil prices and the impact of loan growth during the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that we are in a very strong position from both a capital and liquidity perspective. We are continuing to evaluate potential economic scenarios, but we currently believe our capital position is strong enough to maintain our current dividend if these conditions persist through the end of the year or remain well capitalized.  Before I turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our results and our outlook, I'd like to once again thank our employees. I am very proud of the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers, our communities and each other as we navigate these unprecedented times. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook.\nTayfun Tuzun: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our company is well positioned to deliver on our pledge to provide financial support to our customers, communities and employees during the current pandemic and the duration of the economic downturn.  It is important to note that despite the unexpected timing and nature of the events that led to the sudden decline in economic activity, we are entering this downturn from a position of balance sheet strength that was built through the actions that we've taken during the past few years. Although it is impossible to predict the timing of inflection points in the economy with precision, since late 2018, we had been anticipating an eventual change in the economic cycle after a record expansion period. Our client selection, capital, interest rate and liquidity risk management decisions have all reflected that expectation.  What makes this downturn more challenging than others is clearly the unexpected nature of the initial trigger and the ensuing low visibility surrounding the depth and duration of the downturn. All parts of the global economy are entering this cycle at the same time, but the unprecedented level of fiscal and monetary actions will undoubtedly provide a level of support to cushion a portion of the economic setback. The actions that we have taken so far and those that we will be taking in the coming months will focus on maintaining and leveraging our strength to support our clients and stand by them as we help them manage through this difficult period.  As always, we incorporate all information that is available to us at the time when we provide commentary about our business and discuss our expectations. Our overall perspective on the next few quarters have been very negative at the end of the first quarter, even before the rapid deterioration in the data and market expectations that we have seen over the past couple of weeks. As we look at the economy today, we do not expect a V-shaped recovery. Our discussions on relevant factors, including credit, will be based on an assumption that it will take a number of quarters before we see visible signs of recovery. What is unclear is the interaction between the fiscal and monetary programs and the pace of the recovery, and what the new run rate will be after that point.  Turning to Slide 4. With respect to the first quarter, we were pleased with our overall financial performance despite the economic disruption. Our performance in January and February was ahead of our expectations. Once again, our net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest income and noninterest expenses for the full quarter all performed in line with or better than our guidance.  Credit quality remained strong during the quarter. Charge-offs were consistent with our prior expectations, and the NPA ratio decreased 2 basis points sequentially. Reported results for the quarter included a negative $0.09 impact from several notable items, including a credit valuation adjustment for client derivatives, a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap, the impact of MB merger-related charges and a mark in our private equity portfolio, in addition to the $0.55 impact of the provision in excess of charge-offs.  Adjusting for those items and the purchase accounting impact shown in our earnings materials, first quarter pre-provision net revenue increased 22% from the prior year. Excluding the first quarter seasonal impacts on compensation and benefits expenses, PPNR increased 2% sequentially. Our core return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, increased from the prior year to nearly 15%, and our efficiency ratio continues to trend towards the top quartile among peers.  Moving to Slide 5. Total average loans increased 1% sequentially with growth balanced between the consumer and commercial portfolios. Prior to the market disruption in March, total loan growth was generally tracking in line with our previous guidance. Growth in average commercial loans was impacted by the line draws of approximately $8 billion in March. Since the end of the quarter, line utilization has remained very stable. Average commercial real estate loans were flat sequentially, with the construction book declining by 4%. Our CRE balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital remained very low, around 80%, which is significantly lower than our exposures prior to the last downturn, which stood at 174%. Average total consumer loans grew 1% from last quarter. In general, our consumer portfolio trends from the past year or so continued again during the first 2 months, with the auto portfolio leading the growth, reflecting strong production of $1.7 billion with healthy spreads and the same risk return parameters as before. Clearly, the origination activity significantly slowed down in March. And in the near term, we expect the weakness to continue.  The quarter-over-quarter growth in auto was partially offset by a decline in home equity balances. Average deposits were up 1%. In addition, our end-of-period deposit growth exceeded our end-of-period loan growth, which enabled us to maintain very strong liquidity levels during the quarter, even when we experienced very high utilization rates. The ability to grow deposits so strongly, while reducing deposit rates by 14 basis points during the quarter shows the strength of our franchise and our relationship-based banking market.  Moving on to Slide 6. Reported net interest income increased $1 million compared to the prior quarter with adjusted NII increasing $3 million. The strong NII performance reflects the impact of our $11 billion cash flow hedge portfolio as well as the wider-than-normal LIBOR/Fed fund spread near the end of the quarter. Purchase accounting adjustments benefited our first quarter net interest margin by 4 basis points this quarter compared to 5 basis points last quarter. Our reported NIM increased 1 basis point, and the adjusted NIM increased 2 basis points sequentially, which was at the upper end of our January guidance. Our NIM performance reflected the benefits of our balance sheet hedges, proactive management of deposit rates and a lower day count. The excess short-term liquidity levels in the first quarter caused a 3 basis point drag on our NIM compared to last quarter. Interest-bearing core deposit rates were down 14 basis points during the quarter, better than our previous guidance range of 8 to 10 basis points. We expect interest-bearing core deposit costs to decline another 35 to 40 basis points over the next 2 quarters and be heavily front-loaded in the second quarter. This forecast, combined with the deposit rate actions we have taken since the third quarter of last year in response to the Fed rate moves, results in a cumulative beta in the mid-30s.  In the near term, we intend to maintain higher-than-normal liquidity as we continue to gauge the duration of the line draws and the corresponding deposit growth that we witnessed over the past month. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, we expect our loan to core deposit ratio to remain stable in the second quarter. As a reminder, our margin is approximately 2/3 sensitive to the front end of the curve, which results in a 3 to 4 basis point reduction in NIM per 25 basis points move in Fed funds and 1/3 to the long end, which results together in a cumulative 4 to 5 basis point impact. It's worth noting once again that our differentiated hedge and securities portfolios are expected to provide strong NIM protection on a relative basis. We executed our hedges early when the 10-year was around 3% and also structured them to provide protection for much longer than most peers with hedge protection against lower rates through 2024. And as we have discussed before, our securities portfolio is also structured in a way that is meaningfully different than peers, which results in significantly lower cash flows and less stress on the portfolio yield. Our net premium amortization was under $1 million during the quarter.  Moving on to Slide 7. We had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided in January. The resilience in our fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved. Adjusted noninterest income increased by 1% sequentially despite the March headwinds compared to our previous expectation of down 3% coming into the quarter. The strong performance was driven by mortgage banking, client financial risk management and wealth and asset management revenues. Mortgage banking revenue of $120 million increased $47 million sequentially, reflecting the widening of primary secondary spreads and strong volumes, combined with the impact of the MSR valuation net of hedges. Origination volume of $4 billion increased 6% sequentially and 145% from the year ago quarter as customers took advantage of the lower rate environment to refinance. We expect second quarter mortgage revenue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19.  In our commercial business, we generated another strong quarter of capital markets revenues, which were up 25% -- over 25% from the year ago quarter. Client financial risk management revenue was very strong this quarter, reflecting investments in talent and technology, the continued focus to deepen client relationships as well as the market volatility during the end of the quarter. Wealth and asset management revenue increased 4% from the prior quarter due to higher brokerage and seasonally strong tax prep fees. We continued the AUM flow momentum again this quarter despite the broader market dynamics. Given the current portfolio allocations, we expect our wealth and asset management revenue to experience approximately a 50 beta relative to the S&P 500 on about a month lag.  Deposit service charges declined slightly this quarter. Commercial deposit fees were positively impacted by deductions in earnings credit rate and solid gross TM revenue, which was offset by seasonal declines in consumer fees.  Moving on to Slide 8. First quarter reported pretax expenses included merger-related items totaling $7 million and intangible amortization expense of $13 million. Adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our materials, noninterest expense increased 2% sequentially, well below our previous guidance of 5%. In line with previous years, our first quarter expenses were impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, our total expenses in the first quarter would have been down approximately 4% sequentially. In the current environment, there will be a natural decline in expense items that are directly tied to business performance and activity. In addition, we recognize that as we navigate this environment, investments and projects with lower returns will need to be reprioritized, which gives us the ability to evaluate a wide range of potential actions. As we develop better visibility on the extent and duration of the downturn, several of these items will be actionable. We will provide more details on our expense management in this environment in the coming months.  In March at the RBC Conference, we provided a snapshot picture of our exposures to COVID-19 high-impact sectors. Slide 9 provides an update for quarter end exposures and also expands our scope of highly impacted industries to include nonessential retail and exposures to health care facilities. We are also adding more information on the utilization rates and the percentage of the portfolio that is described as highly leveraged. The totals on this page represent 12% of our total loans, approximately 1/3 of our total leverage loan portfolio, which at the end of the quarter was just over $4 billion in outstandings. We believe that in these segments, our client selection has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that have access to capital in stressed environments. 75% of our total C&I loans in the industries most stressed by COVID-19 are shared national credits.  In addition, on Slide 10, we give you a snapshot of our energy portfolio. This portfolio is less levered and more hedged than the portfolio before the last downturn in oil prices. Nearly 80% of the portfolio is in reserve-based lending. During the 2015 disruption, we experienced approximately $25 million in losses. In the current environment, we estimate that the production breakeven is about $18 per barrel.  On Slide 11, we give you an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios. The FICO scores clearly indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over 55% of the portfolio containing FICO scores of 750 or higher on a balance-weighted basis. Approximately 90% of the consumer portfolio is secured. And as you can see by our FICO band distributions, our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high prime super prime space. From a hardship perspective, only 10% of the mortgage forbearance requests have LTVs greater than 80%, except for those with guarantees or insurance. Also in February, we further tightened our underwriting standards, specifically on minimum FICO scores and maximum LTV levels.  Turning to credit results on Slide 12. Net charge-offs remained near historically low levels during the quarter. The consumer net charge-off ratio was down 12 basis points, and commercial was up 12 basis points sequentially, resulting in a total net charge-off ratio of 44 basis points, consistent with our previous expectations. NPAs continue to be well behaved, up just 4% sequentially. Given the loan portfolio dynamics I mentioned earlier, the NPA ratio was down 2 basis points sequentially. Obviously, with the adoption of CECL, we substantially increased our reserves at the beginning of the quarter. And given the COVID-19 impact and loan growth, our provision was 525% of charge-offs.  Slide 13 provides an overview of the major changes in our loan. Our day 1 build was $653 million, consistent with our previous guidance and includes $171 million from the MB portfolio, as we discussed previously, which was significantly impacted by the disparate manner in which purchase accounting discounts were treated under the incurred model versus the CECL model.  The post-day one incremental allowance during the quarter was based on several factors: a significantly weaker economic outlook, including a lower oil price, higher funded loan balances and the impact of unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus. The overall approach is a combination of quantitative model-based estimates and qualitative overlays. We use a three year reasonable and supportable period, followed by a two year reversion to historic losses. The quantitative process is based on multiple economic scenarios. The expectation for the two predominant macroeconomic factors is a sharp downturn in GDP and a rise in unemployment in the next two quarters, the impacts of which are partially cushioned by the aggressive levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus, leading to a very weak recovery in the fourth quarter.  The challenge associated with calibrating our expectations is, as other banks have discussed, the speed at which the real-time updates to the economic forecasts are changing. The base scenario assumes that GDP growth will slowly start to recover in the fourth quarter and will reach a year-over-year growth of approximately 3% in 2021, with the unemployment rate remaining above 6% throughout 2021. The more stressful scenario has GDP continuing to decline through the first quarter of 2021 and unemployment staying about 7% for almost the entire 3-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. The oil price under the base case reaches $33 in the fourth quarter, but under the more stressful scenario remains below $30 through 2021.  As a reference point, we compare our current reserve level with a 9-quarter total loss estimates within the 2 most recent severe stress test runs that we ran, including the 2019 stress test that we ran last year despite the fact that we were not required to submit, and the 2020 stress test that we recently submitted to the Fed, in addition to the most recent Fed-run adverse and severe stress tests from 2018. Our current reserves stand at 76% of the 9-quarter cumulative losses projected under the 2018 Fed adverse scenario, 44% of the 9-quarter losses under the 2018 Fed severe scenario, 50% of the 9-quarter losses under the 2019 severe scenario, and 54% of the 9-quarter losses under the 2020 severe scenario that we just submitted. In the absence of better visibility on future levels of economic activity, these reference points give you some guidance on the strength of our current ACL ratio of 2.13%. In addition, we still have approximately $200 million or 17 basis points of our total loans and remaining discounts associated to the MB portfolio.  As other management teams have mentioned during their earnings calls, most of the economic scenarios published since the end of the quarter are forecasting a weaker outlook compared to previous forecasts. As more quantitative and qualitative information becomes available, we will incorporate them into our reserve analysis. As the significant fiscal and monetary support is likely to reduce the impact of both the near-term decline in the GDP and the increase in unemployment, the more meaningful impact on reserve levels will be the shape of the recovery and the level of the economic activity in the post-recovery period.  Turning to Slide 14. Our capital and liquidity positions remained very strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.4%, over 280 basis points above the well-capitalized minimum. Given the various dynamics during the quarter, we are providing you a CET1 reconciliation between net income, RWA growth, CECL adoption and the impact of dividends. As a reminder, we did not repurchase shares during the first quarter. As you can see, the majority of the 39 basis point change in CET1 was attributable to line draws from the commercial book, along with the impact of CECL. Dividend payouts constitute a smaller portion of the change in fees. Understandably, the topic of dividend sustainability is of major interest to our shareholders. We believe that we are similar to other banks in that we are entering this downturn from a position of strength, and that strength will be able to withstand severe downturns. That does not mean that dividends will be sustainable in all scenarios, but at this time, we expect to maintain our dividends, which our Board will continue to evaluate based on the data available.  Our tangible book value per share was $22.02 this quarter, up 18% year-over-year. We have grown our book value for 5 consecutive quarters. At the end of the quarter, our unrealized pretax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately $3.3 billion, which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios. From a liquidity perspective, we have over $80 billion in readily available and contingent liquidity. Although we are no longer subject to the LCR, we have since continued to stress test our positions on a monthly basis under 7 different types of liquidity scenarios, and we then hold ourselves to the most stressful scenario. Our liquid securities positions have not changed since our phase outs of the LCR.  Slide 15 provides a summary of our current outlook. Given the uncertain environment, we are withdrawing our previous full year guidance until we get more visibility on the economic environment. For the second quarter, based on the line draws at the end of the first quarter and PPP activities, we expect low double-digit growth in average commercial loans and relatively stable consumer loans. Net interest income should grow slightly as a result of higher loan outstandings, while NIM tightens based on my earlier discussion on our interest rate sensitivity. In addition to the impact of the rate environment, NIM will also be impacted by the PPP loans and the amount of short-term liquidity on the balance sheet. Noninterest income and expenses are both expected to decline by high single to low double digits from their current levels, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 related impacts. Total net charge-offs are expected to be in the 45 to 50 basis points range.  In summary, our first quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we've made over the past few years, improving our resiliency, diversifying our revenues and proactively managing the balance sheet. That being said, we are in an unprecedented environment right now and have limited visibility with respect to the economic path forward. We will continue to rely on the same principles, disciplined client selection, and service underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChristopher Doll: Thanks, Tayfun. [Operator Instructions]. Laura, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS.\nSaul Martinez: I wanted to ask about the outlook for credit and the interplay there with your reserving. And your reserve -- as you highlighted, Tayfun, your reserve levels are very high versus -- and they're especially high versus peers, so the 213 basis points. It's not only high versus other regionals, but I think even more striking is just within product category, C&I at 168 basis points, way above -- I think anybody who live -- on reserve ratios on resi and home equity despite seeming the high-risk -- high-quality portfolio, sorry. So I know there's a lot -- and you talked about your estimates in your process and your assumptions. But I guess, I just wanted your perspective a little bit on, to what extent your reserving as a function of taking maybe a more conservative stance than others within the confines of plausible scenarios? Or to what extent it actually reflects perhaps a riskier portfolio or at least a portfolio that might be more susceptible to a downturn in terms of the impact on lifetime losses?\nTayfun Tuzun: Thanks, Saul. Good question. Obviously, it is a broad question. And the difficulty here is the environment has changed so quickly it is difficult to compare one bank's ratios and coverage to another. But having said that, what we gave you on Page 12 of the slide presentation, is a similar set of coverage numbers for stress test runs that other banks have. And clearly, our coverage levels are exceeding those losses that we have predicted through our models compared to other banks. What we have done is we have incorporated the -- as the environment continued to deteriorate in March into the end of the quarter, and basically reflected a fairly drastic change in the economic environment, not only in the second or third quarter, but try to project a weaker recovery into the second year and third year because we are looking at a 3-year R&S period here.  And I gave you some statistics around our assumptions. In our minds, the current fiscal and monetary policies are likely to cushion the second and third quarter impacts but are not going to be necessarily providing a significant support to the latter years. So our reserve levels, as conservative as they are at 2.35%, do reflect a slowly recovering economy rather than a V-shaped recovery. Underlying those numbers is also the quality of the portfolio that we have. We shared with you statistics on our consumer and mortgage portfolios, and we are also sharing some details on the commercial. The commercial book -- I think Jamie and Richard can comment on the commercial book, but the portions of the commercials that are exposed to COVID-19 also tend to be the book that has more large corporate exposures, more heavy sick exposures.  So all of those combined, hard to compare our numbers to another, but we do believe that we've appropriately accounted for a weak outlook, slow recovery and the quality of the portfolio that we have in place. Jamie or Richard, I don't know if you guys want to add more.\nJames Leonard: Yes, Saul, so as I stepped into this chair and started looking at the portfolio, the 1 thing that stands out to me is just how intentional we have been about where we do business with the clients that we select, that should be resilient in times of stress. And frankly, the focus for us has been on companies with larger scale that should be able to persevere in this environment. And so our loan book, I would tell you, is comprised of high-quality liquid resilient names, and the best data we could use to prove that point is the shared national credit information that we included on the page. And as you can see, it's a very high percentage of 75%.\nTayfun Tuzun: No, [indiscernible] suggests that this is like -- obviously, we continue to evaluate the data as it comes. We continue to evaluate these new programs. And we -- at the end of this quarter, we'll do that evaluation again just like every other bank will do. And then we'll share you with you the results of our analysis.\nSaul Martinez: And I know this gets into the weeds but some elements of your modeling, 3-year reasonable supportable and why not maybe on the more conservative side than in some other peers. But 1 follow-up question. You did have the second consecutive quarter where you had a pretty elevated amount of nonperforming loan formation in your commercial book. If you can talk to that, and was any of that related to sort of piece of accounting noise with PCI moving to PCD and then getting reclassified into nonaccrual? Or was there actually something underlying that as suggesting some worsening credit trend in some parts of your book?\nJames Leonard: Yes. So on the first part of the question, there is very little impact on the PCI to PCD transition. So the NPA inflows that you see in the deck of about $175 million was driven by several factors. One -- about 1/3 of the inflow was a single real estate mall exposure. About 1/4 of the NPA formation is actually in smaller businesses, business banking, lower middle market. And then the remainder, when you look at what drove it, it's really spread across industries and geographies, but the 1 common thread is that they're all predominantly in the service industry. So professional, medical, education, financial advisory. So pretty widespread there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew O'Connor: I was wondering if you could comment at all in terms of the PPP loans going to, I guess, those small businesses that need them the most. I mean, obviously, this is kind of a broader question than just Fifth Third, but it seems like a little bit of a free for all, and there's just been some articles out there about maybe some bigger companies getting the loans and not really kind of criteria for deciding who gets it and just wondering if you could comment on that, on your thoughts.\nGregory Carmichael: Yes, Matt, this is Greg. As I mentioned, we processed about 10,000 loans for our customers to the tune about $3.5 billion. The average loan size is about $350,000, $370,000. So that -- for our portfolio, I think it was pretty broad-based, but we did a good job, I think, at servicing both the LMI community businesses, small businesses in general, very few of our loans were up for that $9 million to $10 million range. So for our portfolio, I think we did a pretty good job of opportunities much through the system as we could in the short time that we had available -- the system was available to us. Hopefully, that gets refunded tomorrow at the latest.  We've got more resources there because we definitely have a larger pent-up demand for the PPP program. But overall, with respect to Fifth Third, I think we did a nice job on -- the size of our loans indicate that we served a large portion of the smaller businesses that are out there versus the larger business. I've read the headlines. I've seen some of the challenges that other banks are faced with as far as prioritizing loans. We did not do that. We worked as hard as we could to get many loans through the system. A lot of that depends on the complexity of the request itself and the ownership structure of companies, kind of dictated how much we can get through at what pace if your loan got through or not. But once again, we've already input a significant additional number of applications, hopeful that the window will open here shortly, and we'll get those through.\nMatthew O'Connor: And any sense on, call it, what the pipeline is for when there's additional funding?\nGregory Carmichael: Yes. Well, obviously, I think most bankers would agree, and most people would agree that the additional $300 billion is not going to be adequate to serve the total demand that's out there right now. We expect that $300 billion to $350 billion to be absorbed pretty quickly, even faster than the last 350 were absorbed. So we think it's going to be very fast, and we don't think it's going to be adequate. We think the demand is going to continue to outpace the available funds.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America.\nErika Najarian: So just to piggyback off of Saul's question. You took a significant reserve build and still earned $0.04, with the stock at $16.75 and tangible book value per share of $22, so clearly, the market is fearful of tangible book erosion. And I guess my question here is, in the realistic scenarios for economic stress that you see, and it seems like your band of expectations are reasonable, do you see yourself continuing to earn positive earnings during the duration of this downturn?\nTayfun Tuzun: Good question. I will not comment on this [indiscernible] Look, I mean, I think our -- away from reserve builds and loss expectations, I think the underlying PPNR activity is going to continue to look good. We intend to manage our expenses at an appropriate level relative to the environment. We have a strong protection against a lower rate environment, and we have diversified revenue streams. So the company has strong ability to generate capital on earnings in this environment. As I mentioned earlier, it is a little difficult to predict exactly what will happen to the provision and the charge-offs. But clearly, our intent is to continue to outpace the impact of the credit here. And this is one of those environments where, unfortunately, looking longer than beyond 1 or 2 quarters is extremely difficult. So we will give you a better update as we get a better read on the environment. But obviously, we believe strongly in our ability to manage this company at profitable levels.\nErika Najarian: And just my follow-up question is, you noted that there would be a total impact of 4 to 5 basis points on the net interest margin. If we consider each 25 basis point of decline in the short end plus what's happened to the long end. And I'm wondering, does that include the PPP impact? And does that include the reduction in deposit cost that you anticipate? And how do you plan to fund the PPP loans that are coming on balance sheet?\nTayfun Tuzun: Yes. So we did not give any NIM guidance this quarter, and that was on purpose. I think the general dynamics around NIM and the impact of lower short-term rates and a flatter curve at lower rates is pretty set for us. As I mentioned, it's 4 to 5 basis points per move. The reason why we chose not to give guidance this quarter is because there are 3 -- I view the second quarter as a transitionary quarter. There are 3 main impacts. One of them is the very high levels of liquidity that we are carrying on our books. I mentioned that March carried a significantly more liquidity on our balance sheet. Here in early April, we're carrying even more because some of the government programs are starting to throw cash. The second 1 is PPP, as you mentioned. And the third 1 is the LIBOR/Fed fund spread. We expect LIBOR/Fed fund spread to tighten throughout the quarter from the current levels. And what we also believe is the high level of liquidity that we're carrying in our balance sheet is going to give us a better ability to manage the deposit rates down during the quarter.  So all those together, the second quarter is going to be 1 of those quarters that's going to be very busy. But beyond the second quarter, that relationship between rate moves and the curve shape and our NIM impact holds pretty tightly. 4 to 5 basis points is a pretty good number that you can use.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: For the detail on Slide 12, I think it's very helpful. And I acknowledge that similar to the prior comments that your reserves are booked to a level that's higher than peers. Can you discuss your confidence in your reserve relative to the DFAST numbers that you cited? I guess there approximating around 50% of DFAST, severe. Given that you are factoring in a U shape essentially versus a V, why wouldn't you think that those numbers should be higher? Not that I've got a problem with it or anything. I'm just saying if it is factoring in a U, should that warrant possibly a level that's higher than about 50% of the severe DFAST?\nTayfun Tuzun: In order to achieve a better level of precision, we need to know more about this environment. This -- we are giving you these reference points as a comparison. I think the scenarios that underlie the DFAST are known, and they are quite severe. But no stress scenario is like the other one. And this one, in particular, is going to be very different in the sense that these support programs are yet to be evaluated with respect to how they impact the recovery path and where we are going to end up. That's a big difference because in most classic stress tests, usually the economy comes back at 1 point to where it starts. What we don't know today is where this economy is going to end up and the recovery period flattens out to a -- So I'm very hesitant to answer your question because we just don't know enough about the nature of this downturn. But at least showing you the DFAST results gives you the ability to compare us with others. And then as this economy develops, then we have the ability to reshape our expectations.\nJohn Pancari: No. Great. Okay. And then the -- another question on the reserve. Do you have the allocation of the reserve to the high-impact areas that you flagged?\nJames Leonard: So we did not provide that, John. So relative to the 2.1%, one would assume it's north of that number, but we did not disclose that percentage.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. All right. That's fine. And then 1 last question, if I could. Just on the loan modifications. How much of your loan modifications have been done on the commercial side of the portfolio? And do you have any industry concentrations really where you're starting to see those deferrals?\nJames Leonard: Yes. So within the commercial segment, we've actually had a fairly limited number of requests in the commercial side to the consumer side. We've only had about 400 or so, and it's predominantly covenant waivers for terms in 2020, and that's roughly $2 billion of outstandings, and that's led by car dealers, hotels and restaurants. When it comes to restructured or modified actual dollars, that's very small to date, with only $200 million in loan balances. And probably the 1 sector with the most activity would be restaurants. You see that on Slide 9, our $1.9 billion in outstandings. The good news is we're favorably weighted with only 35% is in dining and 65% fast food quick service. So about 80% of the book continues to remain open. Those that are closed are predominantly in the in-dining category. So overall, some activity here in the modifications, but it's still a little early. We'll see how it plays out over the course of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: You gave us very good detail on a number of your different risks that you have on the portfolios today. And in the opening comments, Greg, you mentioned that I think about 96,000 fee waivers have been executed, also deferrals on loans up to $1.5 billion. That, I think, represents just under 5% of the consumer loan portfolio. Do you guys have any expectations of where those deferrals may peak out at as a percentage of your portfolio?\nGregory Carmichael: Yes. Let me start and I'll throw it over to Jamie here. First off, it's 96,000 [indiscernible] requests, not fee waivers. So it's 96,000 requests in total, which a lot of that included, obviously, both forbearances and deferrals in our loan book also, but the fee waiver is actually much smaller now because -- Jamie, number is at 400? Give me that number. Waivers?\nJames Leonard: About $0.5 million in fee waivers.\nGregory Carmichael: Yes.\nJames Leonard: And so Gerard, in terms of the hardship relief to date by product, and this is through the end of last week, so a little bit updated for April activity. What we're seeing is a lot of the fixed rate or fixed payment products have the higher request levels. So autos at 5%. Mortgages in our owned portfolio are at 4% of the portfolio. And then as you see the minimum monthly payments lower in home equity and credit card, they're at 2% and 3%. So as we model, obviously, we expect this to rise as unemployment rises, but the ultimate amount of hardship relief that we give will ultimately depend on where unemployment picks out. And for us, right now on most products, we're offering 90-day loan payment deferrals. And then in mortgage, we offer the 6-month forbearance. So we'll continue to update you as the quarter transpires.\nGerard Cassidy: And then obviously, the focus this quarter for you and others has always been on credit quality, the provisions. Equally as important, Tayfun, as you pointed out, is PPNR, can you share with us your outlook for PPNR from the standpoint that, obviously, the second quarter end-of-period first quarter loans from the industry was extremely high due to the drawdowns and revenues, obviously, will benefit from that in the second quarter. But as we get into the third and fourth quarters and the unemployment rate goes up, underwriting standards tighten, should we anticipate that PPNR revenues start to shrink for you guys just because of the environment we're in?\nTayfun Tuzun: I think, Gerard, here's my take on the year. I do believe that, assuming these drawdowns will stay with us for a while, the higher loan balances will provide a decent amount of support against the lower rate environment, and assuming that we manage the deposit rates down and our liquidity positions optimally, the year, despite the fact that it is a -- the worst-case scenario beyond just negative interest rates for banks, the balance sheet should support a decent healthy level of NII.  In terms of the sequence of quarters from second into third into fourth, I think we will probably see a changing fee picture here because clearly, the economy stopped, and that will have a near-term negative impact on fees in the second quarter from spend levels to asset management based on equity levels and to some capital markets activity. Our expectation is, assuming that things start somehow normalizing either into the second half of the second quarter or the third quarter, we should see a little healthier fee picture in the second half of the year. And then the expense side of it, we clearly are going to benefit from lower expenses that are tied to activity. And then we will start making some decisions on our end based on this environment.  So in general, you are going -- the second quarter definitely is going to be a transition quarter. But I do believe that as we look into the third and fourth quarter, we are going to start seeing some normalizing PPNR activity -- PPNR levels.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan.\nVivek Juneja: Couple of questions. Firstly, on your oil and gas exposure, can you talk a little bit about where you are in your reserve-based redetermination and what that could mean for the loans?\nRichard Stein: Yes, it's Richard. We're about 1/3 of the way through the redeterminations. And at this point, we've seen about a 16% drop in oil-based borrowing basis and about a 12% drop-through those that are gas-based producers.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. And then I think, you said you've got a breakeven, Tayfun, you said of $18 production price?\nRichard Stein: Yes. What Tayfun was describing was we went through the portfolio and looked at the average breakeven lifting cost for our portfolio. So think about what it takes to get it out of the ground, and what it costs and what it would take to service interest for that portfolio. That's about $18 when you benchmark it to NYMEX. What Tayfun didn't give you, and I think this is important for the portfolio, we also say on Slide 10, the portfolio is 80% hedged for 2020. Those hedges give our producers about $14.5 of benefit, net benefit. So if you think about -- you had the hedges to it, it's $4 or $5 breakeven.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. And those hedges, it sounds like a lot of them mature by the end of 2020.\nRichard Stein: What we've described on Slide 10 is the percentage of production that is hedged is 80% in '20, and then it rolls down to 30% in '21.\nVivek Juneja: Okay, okay. And then what happens to those loans as those hedges roll off? Do you get to be done and the borrower has to figure out how to handle the funding? Or how does it work? Can you walk us through that?\nRichard Stein: For those under reserve-based structure, the borrowing base is redetermined every 6 months. So there will be a fall redetermination that will be based on current production, current reserves and the outlook from prices at that time. So the borrowing base and the loan amount that we're willing to lend gets reset every 6 months. So to the extent prices improve, that will change the borrowing base. To the extent they don't, the borrowing base would come down.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. Great. And, Jamie, any color on the casino exposure of $2 billion?\nJames Leonard: The casino exposure on Slide 9, the top part of the page of Slide 9 refers to lending to the operating companies within the casino and then the CRE portion would be, obviously, building the hotel and going along with it. We -- really, the names are large companies, high-quality, resilient. So again, we feel like we're well positioned. And while there may be losses in this portfolio, we feel like the lost content is very manageable.\nRichard Stein: It's Richard again. The only thing I'd add is, in addition to high-quality names, we're diversified by operator types, so global operators. Some native American and some regional. And in each case, high quality operators, usually where they -- to the extent they are regional, they have got a great franchise area that is either given to them by regulation or demographics that give them a ton of resiliency and less competition.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler.\nRobert Siefers: I guess, first of all, I just want to echo some of the prior comments, really good detail and appreciate the disclosure. And I think at this point, just 1 small question, sort of a follow-up on the deferrals. I guess I'm just curious on the commercial side. And even though it's early, I was hoping you might be able to give a little insight as to how you would expect sort of the, I guess, the re-due diligence process to go as we come up on the end of the deferral time period and how will that go? Sort of willingness to defer again? Or how does that entire process work through?\nJames Leonard: Yes. So on the mortgage, are you talking on the consumer side, Scott?\nRobert Siefers: No. Actually, even though it's relatively small, I'm actually more curious about the commercial side.\nJames Leonard: Yes. So the commercial side will just continue on a case-by-case basis with each client. The covenant relief period expire. As we're executing on these covenant waivers, we have been adding some additional liquidity capital retention requirements as well. So we feel like the process has been productive. It's been a good dialogue with clients. And so that will just continue over the course of the year.\nRobert Siefers: Okay. Perfect. And then at what point do you sort of -- I mean, I guess it's all case by case, but at what point do you sort of make the decision as to, okay, we could continue to sort of forbear on this or maybe it needs to be a downgraded charge-off, et cetera?\nRichard Stein: Yes. Hey, it's Richard. So we review the portfolio actively and for the names that are going to be more impacted at least quarterly. But there is active management, active dialogue. And so as new information comes in, we adjust our internal risk ratings. And then as we have financial reporting, that would be the other driver that would change our view on our risk. To the extent that borrowers continue to perform in line with expectations, we would expect to continue the deferrals and the forbearance that we've agreed to.\nOperator: There are no question at this time. You may now continue, Chris.\nChristopher Doll: Thank you, Kyle, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department, and we'll be happy to assist you.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Gregory Carmichael",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Given the unprecedented nature of the environment, I will focus most of my commentary on the proactive steps we are taking to navigate this crisis due to the pandemic. And then Tayfun will provide more details related to the quarterly financial results in his remarks.  As all of you are aware, the events over the past couple of months related to the COVID-19 health crisis and resulting economic fallout has led us to reprioritize our focus. We are taking significant and ongoing actions to serve our customers, protect our employees and assist our communities. We believe these proactive steps will ultimately deliver long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.  Starting in early February, the executive team and the Board began actively planning and prioritizing the organization's response efforts. We quickly mobilized our workforce to accommodate remote access for a large number of employees. Currently, more than 50% of our workforce is working remotely across the company. And for many groups, that number is over 95%. For employees who are not able to do their job remotely, we have established social distancing and enhanced cleaning measures based on CDC guidelines. Throughout these uncertain times, we have been proactively communicating with our customers and employees. We have issued more than a dozen press releases, several fact sheets and numerous proactive outreaches to our customers in addition to ongoing updates on our website. We have also significantly increased the frequency of communications with our employees in order to keep them informed of the latest developments, recommendations and health precautions.  From a customer perspective, we are leveraging the strength of our balance sheet to help address the economic challenges many of our customers are facing. We are prudently extending credit to customers where we support economic activity. In March alone, we extended $13 billion of new credit, including approximately $8 billion from C&I line drills. In addition to keeping our traditional lending channels open, we are also participating in government-sponsored programs established as part of the Cares Act such as the SBA PPP and the forthcoming Main Street Lending Program.  With respect to PPP, we assisted approximately 10,000 clients to employ over 300,000 employees totaling nearly $3.5 billion. To maximize our support, we recently announced we suspended share repurchases. And as Tayfun will discuss in greater detail, we continue to have strong capital and equity levels to weather a prolonged downturn. In addition to utilizing our strong balance sheet, we are directly supporting consumers and businesses by keeping 99% of our branches open and fully operational with modified health protocols and amended hours as appropriate. We continue to process over 100,000 branch transactions per day, underpinning our role as an essential service provider. And for many of their banking needs, we continue to encourage our customers to use our highly rated digital platforms in addition to our network of approximately 53,000 fee-free ATMs.  Furthermore, we continue to proactively engage with our customers. Our bankers have personally connected with 2 million customers over the past month to see how they are doing under these circumstances, both personally and financially, and to offer systems as needed under our extensive financial hardship relief programs. In March, we began providing relief in the form of payment deferrals and forbearances to customers across a wide array of lending products. We also suspended vehicle repossessions in home foreclosures. Since the roll of our systems programs, we have processed over 96,000 hardship requests, which represents approximately $1.5 billion in Fifth Third loan balances in addition to $6 billion from our mortgage servicing portfolio.  As I mentioned, taking care of our employees is a top priority. In addition to our safety measures, we have announced special payments of up to $1,000 per employee for those providing essential banking services. These measures have helped maintain call center operations and branch personnel at appropriate levels. For our communities, we recently committed nearly $9 million in philanthropic funds to help address the effects of COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to take proactive and aggressive measures to help mitigate the effects of the downturn. From a macro perspective, while we do not know the duration or severity of the crisis, we have spent many years preparing for a downturn by strengthening our balance sheet through a disciplined approach to credit and by increasing our capital and liquidity levels. We have also improved and diversified our revenue streams in our loan portfolios. Finally, we evaluate our firm-wide resilience through stress testing our balance sheet under a range of conditions worse than the last crisis and more severe than a regulatory run stress test.  Since the financial crisis, we have taken several steps, which have put us in a very strong position. We transformed our overall approach to credit risk management, centralized credit underwriting and added stringent geographics, sector and product level concentration limits. We exited certain commercial real estate segments and have remained disciplined in our existing CRE portfolio. The client selection focused on top-tier developers and virtually no land loans. We also continue to maintain an underweight position relative to our peers.  We exited businesses such as commodity trader lending and mezzanine lending. 3 years ago, we exited $5 billion in commercial loans, given the risk return profile. This has helped reduce our leveraged lending exposures by over 50%. We have also reduced our indirect commercial leasing portfolio by almost $2 billion over the past 2 years, which has significantly lowered our exposure to certain assets such as commercial aircrafts and railcars. Lastly, we have maintained our credit discipline in our consumer portfolio with a weighted average FICO score above 750. We have consistently communicated our through-the-cycle principles of disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and an overall balance sheet managed approach focused on long-term performance horizon.  Our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. Our first quarter operating results reflect the strength of our franchise and the strategic decisions we made in managing our balance sheet, our interest rate risk and our liquidity risk exposures in light of the rapid and widespread economic deterioration we saw towards the end of the quarter.  Net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest income and expenses all performed in line with or better than our January guidance, with a net charge-off ratio also consistent with our previous expectations. Tayfun will discuss the changes in our allowance in more detail.  Similar to what you have seen from many of our peers, our reserves reflect the CECL adoption, the economic impacts of COVID-19, lower oil prices and the impact of loan growth during the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that we are in a very strong position from both a capital and liquidity perspective. We are continuing to evaluate potential economic scenarios, but we currently believe our capital position is strong enough to maintain our current dividend if these conditions persist through the end of the year or remain well capitalized.  Before I turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our results and our outlook, I'd like to once again thank our employees. I am very proud of the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers, our communities and each other as we navigate these unprecedented times. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook. Yes, Matt, this is Greg. As I mentioned, we processed about 10,000 loans for our customers to the tune about $3.5 billion. The average loan size is about $350,000, $370,000. So that -- for our portfolio, I think it was pretty broad-based, but we did a good job, I think, at servicing both the LMI community businesses, small businesses in general, very few of our loans were up for that $9 million to $10 million range. So for our portfolio, I think we did a pretty good job of opportunities much through the system as we could in the short time that we had available -- the system was available to us. Hopefully, that gets refunded tomorrow at the latest.  We've got more resources there because we definitely have a larger pent-up demand for the PPP program. But overall, with respect to Fifth Third, I think we did a nice job on -- the size of our loans indicate that we served a large portion of the smaller businesses that are out there versus the larger business. I've read the headlines. I've seen some of the challenges that other banks are faced with as far as prioritizing loans. We did not do that. We worked as hard as we could to get many loans through the system. A lot of that depends on the complexity of the request itself and the ownership structure of companies, kind of dictated how much we can get through at what pace if your loan got through or not. But once again, we've already input a significant additional number of applications, hopeful that the window will open here shortly, and we'll get those through. Yes. Well, obviously, I think most bankers would agree, and most people would agree that the additional $300 billion is not going to be adequate to serve the total demand that's out there right now. We expect that $300 billion to $350 billion to be absorbed pretty quickly, even faster than the last 350 were absorbed. So we think it's going to be very fast, and we don't think it's going to be adequate. We think the demand is going to continue to outpace the available funds. Yes. Let me start and I'll throw it over to Jamie here. First off, it's 96,000 [indiscernible] requests, not fee waivers. So it's 96,000 requests in total, which a lot of that included, obviously, both forbearances and deferrals in our loan book also, but the fee waiver is actually much smaller now because -- Jamie, number is at 400? Give me that number. Waivers? Yes."

            "name": "Tayfun Tuzun",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our company is well positioned to deliver on our pledge to provide financial support to our customers, communities and employees during the current pandemic and the duration of the economic downturn.  It is important to note that despite the unexpected timing and nature of the events that led to the sudden decline in economic activity, we are entering this downturn from a position of balance sheet strength that was built through the actions that we've taken during the past few years. Although it is impossible to predict the timing of inflection points in the economy with precision, since late 2018, we had been anticipating an eventual change in the economic cycle after a record expansion period. Our client selection, capital, interest rate and liquidity risk management decisions have all reflected that expectation.  What makes this downturn more challenging than others is clearly the unexpected nature of the initial trigger and the ensuing low visibility surrounding the depth and duration of the downturn. All parts of the global economy are entering this cycle at the same time, but the unprecedented level of fiscal and monetary actions will undoubtedly provide a level of support to cushion a portion of the economic setback. The actions that we have taken so far and those that we will be taking in the coming months will focus on maintaining and leveraging our strength to support our clients and stand by them as we help them manage through this difficult period.  As always, we incorporate all information that is available to us at the time when we provide commentary about our business and discuss our expectations. Our overall perspective on the next few quarters have been very negative at the end of the first quarter, even before the rapid deterioration in the data and market expectations that we have seen over the past couple of weeks. As we look at the economy today, we do not expect a V-shaped recovery. Our discussions on relevant factors, including credit, will be based on an assumption that it will take a number of quarters before we see visible signs of recovery. What is unclear is the interaction between the fiscal and monetary programs and the pace of the recovery, and what the new run rate will be after that point.  Turning to Slide 4. With respect to the first quarter, we were pleased with our overall financial performance despite the economic disruption. Our performance in January and February was ahead of our expectations. Once again, our net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest income and noninterest expenses for the full quarter all performed in line with or better than our guidance.  Credit quality remained strong during the quarter. Charge-offs were consistent with our prior expectations, and the NPA ratio decreased 2 basis points sequentially. Reported results for the quarter included a negative $0.09 impact from several notable items, including a credit valuation adjustment for client derivatives, a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap, the impact of MB merger-related charges and a mark in our private equity portfolio, in addition to the $0.55 impact of the provision in excess of charge-offs.  Adjusting for those items and the purchase accounting impact shown in our earnings materials, first quarter pre-provision net revenue increased 22% from the prior year. Excluding the first quarter seasonal impacts on compensation and benefits expenses, PPNR increased 2% sequentially. Our core return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, increased from the prior year to nearly 15%, and our efficiency ratio continues to trend towards the top quartile among peers.  Moving to Slide 5. Total average loans increased 1% sequentially with growth balanced between the consumer and commercial portfolios. Prior to the market disruption in March, total loan growth was generally tracking in line with our previous guidance. Growth in average commercial loans was impacted by the line draws of approximately $8 billion in March. Since the end of the quarter, line utilization has remained very stable. Average commercial real estate loans were flat sequentially, with the construction book declining by 4%. Our CRE balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital remained very low, around 80%, which is significantly lower than our exposures prior to the last downturn, which stood at 174%. Average total consumer loans grew 1% from last quarter. In general, our consumer portfolio trends from the past year or so continued again during the first 2 months, with the auto portfolio leading the growth, reflecting strong production of $1.7 billion with healthy spreads and the same risk return parameters as before. Clearly, the origination activity significantly slowed down in March. And in the near term, we expect the weakness to continue.  The quarter-over-quarter growth in auto was partially offset by a decline in home equity balances. Average deposits were up 1%. In addition, our end-of-period deposit growth exceeded our end-of-period loan growth, which enabled us to maintain very strong liquidity levels during the quarter, even when we experienced very high utilization rates. The ability to grow deposits so strongly, while reducing deposit rates by 14 basis points during the quarter shows the strength of our franchise and our relationship-based banking market.  Moving on to Slide 6. Reported net interest income increased $1 million compared to the prior quarter with adjusted NII increasing $3 million. The strong NII performance reflects the impact of our $11 billion cash flow hedge portfolio as well as the wider-than-normal LIBOR/Fed fund spread near the end of the quarter. Purchase accounting adjustments benefited our first quarter net interest margin by 4 basis points this quarter compared to 5 basis points last quarter. Our reported NIM increased 1 basis point, and the adjusted NIM increased 2 basis points sequentially, which was at the upper end of our January guidance. Our NIM performance reflected the benefits of our balance sheet hedges, proactive management of deposit rates and a lower day count. The excess short-term liquidity levels in the first quarter caused a 3 basis point drag on our NIM compared to last quarter. Interest-bearing core deposit rates were down 14 basis points during the quarter, better than our previous guidance range of 8 to 10 basis points. We expect interest-bearing core deposit costs to decline another 35 to 40 basis points over the next 2 quarters and be heavily front-loaded in the second quarter. This forecast, combined with the deposit rate actions we have taken since the third quarter of last year in response to the Fed rate moves, results in a cumulative beta in the mid-30s.  In the near term, we intend to maintain higher-than-normal liquidity as we continue to gauge the duration of the line draws and the corresponding deposit growth that we witnessed over the past month. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, we expect our loan to core deposit ratio to remain stable in the second quarter. As a reminder, our margin is approximately 2/3 sensitive to the front end of the curve, which results in a 3 to 4 basis point reduction in NIM per 25 basis points move in Fed funds and 1/3 to the long end, which results together in a cumulative 4 to 5 basis point impact. It's worth noting once again that our differentiated hedge and securities portfolios are expected to provide strong NIM protection on a relative basis. We executed our hedges early when the 10-year was around 3% and also structured them to provide protection for much longer than most peers with hedge protection against lower rates through 2024. And as we have discussed before, our securities portfolio is also structured in a way that is meaningfully different than peers, which results in significantly lower cash flows and less stress on the portfolio yield. Our net premium amortization was under $1 million during the quarter.  Moving on to Slide 7. We had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided in January. The resilience in our fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved. Adjusted noninterest income increased by 1% sequentially despite the March headwinds compared to our previous expectation of down 3% coming into the quarter. The strong performance was driven by mortgage banking, client financial risk management and wealth and asset management revenues. Mortgage banking revenue of $120 million increased $47 million sequentially, reflecting the widening of primary secondary spreads and strong volumes, combined with the impact of the MSR valuation net of hedges. Origination volume of $4 billion increased 6% sequentially and 145% from the year ago quarter as customers took advantage of the lower rate environment to refinance. We expect second quarter mortgage revenue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19.  In our commercial business, we generated another strong quarter of capital markets revenues, which were up 25% -- over 25% from the year ago quarter. Client financial risk management revenue was very strong this quarter, reflecting investments in talent and technology, the continued focus to deepen client relationships as well as the market volatility during the end of the quarter. Wealth and asset management revenue increased 4% from the prior quarter due to higher brokerage and seasonally strong tax prep fees. We continued the AUM flow momentum again this quarter despite the broader market dynamics. Given the current portfolio allocations, we expect our wealth and asset management revenue to experience approximately a 50 beta relative to the S&P 500 on about a month lag.  Deposit service charges declined slightly this quarter. Commercial deposit fees were positively impacted by deductions in earnings credit rate and solid gross TM revenue, which was offset by seasonal declines in consumer fees.  Moving on to Slide 8. First quarter reported pretax expenses included merger-related items totaling $7 million and intangible amortization expense of $13 million. Adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our materials, noninterest expense increased 2% sequentially, well below our previous guidance of 5%. In line with previous years, our first quarter expenses were impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, our total expenses in the first quarter would have been down approximately 4% sequentially. In the current environment, there will be a natural decline in expense items that are directly tied to business performance and activity. In addition, we recognize that as we navigate this environment, investments and projects with lower returns will need to be reprioritized, which gives us the ability to evaluate a wide range of potential actions. As we develop better visibility on the extent and duration of the downturn, several of these items will be actionable. We will provide more details on our expense management in this environment in the coming months.  In March at the RBC Conference, we provided a snapshot picture of our exposures to COVID-19 high-impact sectors. Slide 9 provides an update for quarter end exposures and also expands our scope of highly impacted industries to include nonessential retail and exposures to health care facilities. We are also adding more information on the utilization rates and the percentage of the portfolio that is described as highly leveraged. The totals on this page represent 12% of our total loans, approximately 1/3 of our total leverage loan portfolio, which at the end of the quarter was just over $4 billion in outstandings. We believe that in these segments, our client selection has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that have access to capital in stressed environments. 75% of our total C&I loans in the industries most stressed by COVID-19 are shared national credits.  In addition, on Slide 10, we give you a snapshot of our energy portfolio. This portfolio is less levered and more hedged than the portfolio before the last downturn in oil prices. Nearly 80% of the portfolio is in reserve-based lending. During the 2015 disruption, we experienced approximately $25 million in losses. In the current environment, we estimate that the production breakeven is about $18 per barrel.  On Slide 11, we give you an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios. The FICO scores clearly indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over 55% of the portfolio containing FICO scores of 750 or higher on a balance-weighted basis. Approximately 90% of the consumer portfolio is secured. And as you can see by our FICO band distributions, our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high prime super prime space. From a hardship perspective, only 10% of the mortgage forbearance requests have LTVs greater than 80%, except for those with guarantees or insurance. Also in February, we further tightened our underwriting standards, specifically on minimum FICO scores and maximum LTV levels.  Turning to credit results on Slide 12. Net charge-offs remained near historically low levels during the quarter. The consumer net charge-off ratio was down 12 basis points, and commercial was up 12 basis points sequentially, resulting in a total net charge-off ratio of 44 basis points, consistent with our previous expectations. NPAs continue to be well behaved, up just 4% sequentially. Given the loan portfolio dynamics I mentioned earlier, the NPA ratio was down 2 basis points sequentially. Obviously, with the adoption of CECL, we substantially increased our reserves at the beginning of the quarter. And given the COVID-19 impact and loan growth, our provision was 525% of charge-offs.  Slide 13 provides an overview of the major changes in our loan. Our day 1 build was $653 million, consistent with our previous guidance and includes $171 million from the MB portfolio, as we discussed previously, which was significantly impacted by the disparate manner in which purchase accounting discounts were treated under the incurred model versus the CECL model.  The post-day one incremental allowance during the quarter was based on several factors: a significantly weaker economic outlook, including a lower oil price, higher funded loan balances and the impact of unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus. The overall approach is a combination of quantitative model-based estimates and qualitative overlays. We use a three year reasonable and supportable period, followed by a two year reversion to historic losses. The quantitative process is based on multiple economic scenarios. The expectation for the two predominant macroeconomic factors is a sharp downturn in GDP and a rise in unemployment in the next two quarters, the impacts of which are partially cushioned by the aggressive levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus, leading to a very weak recovery in the fourth quarter.  The challenge associated with calibrating our expectations is, as other banks have discussed, the speed at which the real-time updates to the economic forecasts are changing. The base scenario assumes that GDP growth will slowly start to recover in the fourth quarter and will reach a year-over-year growth of approximately 3% in 2021, with the unemployment rate remaining above 6% throughout 2021. The more stressful scenario has GDP continuing to decline through the first quarter of 2021 and unemployment staying about 7% for almost the entire 3-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. The oil price under the base case reaches $33 in the fourth quarter, but under the more stressful scenario remains below $30 through 2021.  As a reference point, we compare our current reserve level with a 9-quarter total loss estimates within the 2 most recent severe stress test runs that we ran, including the 2019 stress test that we ran last year despite the fact that we were not required to submit, and the 2020 stress test that we recently submitted to the Fed, in addition to the most recent Fed-run adverse and severe stress tests from 2018. Our current reserves stand at 76% of the 9-quarter cumulative losses projected under the 2018 Fed adverse scenario, 44% of the 9-quarter losses under the 2018 Fed severe scenario, 50% of the 9-quarter losses under the 2019 severe scenario, and 54% of the 9-quarter losses under the 2020 severe scenario that we just submitted. In the absence of better visibility on future levels of economic activity, these reference points give you some guidance on the strength of our current ACL ratio of 2.13%. In addition, we still have approximately $200 million or 17 basis points of our total loans and remaining discounts associated to the MB portfolio.  As other management teams have mentioned during their earnings calls, most of the economic scenarios published since the end of the quarter are forecasting a weaker outlook compared to previous forecasts. As more quantitative and qualitative information becomes available, we will incorporate them into our reserve analysis. As the significant fiscal and monetary support is likely to reduce the impact of both the near-term decline in the GDP and the increase in unemployment, the more meaningful impact on reserve levels will be the shape of the recovery and the level of the economic activity in the post-recovery period.  Turning to Slide 14. Our capital and liquidity positions remained very strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.4%, over 280 basis points above the well-capitalized minimum. Given the various dynamics during the quarter, we are providing you a CET1 reconciliation between net income, RWA growth, CECL adoption and the impact of dividends. As a reminder, we did not repurchase shares during the first quarter. As you can see, the majority of the 39 basis point change in CET1 was attributable to line draws from the commercial book, along with the impact of CECL. Dividend payouts constitute a smaller portion of the change in fees. Understandably, the topic of dividend sustainability is of major interest to our shareholders. We believe that we are similar to other banks in that we are entering this downturn from a position of strength, and that strength will be able to withstand severe downturns. That does not mean that dividends will be sustainable in all scenarios, but at this time, we expect to maintain our dividends, which our Board will continue to evaluate based on the data available.  Our tangible book value per share was $22.02 this quarter, up 18% year-over-year. We have grown our book value for 5 consecutive quarters. At the end of the quarter, our unrealized pretax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately $3.3 billion, which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios. From a liquidity perspective, we have over $80 billion in readily available and contingent liquidity. Although we are no longer subject to the LCR, we have since continued to stress test our positions on a monthly basis under 7 different types of liquidity scenarios, and we then hold ourselves to the most stressful scenario. Our liquid securities positions have not changed since our phase outs of the LCR.  Slide 15 provides a summary of our current outlook. Given the uncertain environment, we are withdrawing our previous full year guidance until we get more visibility on the economic environment. For the second quarter, based on the line draws at the end of the first quarter and PPP activities, we expect low double-digit growth in average commercial loans and relatively stable consumer loans. Net interest income should grow slightly as a result of higher loan outstandings, while NIM tightens based on my earlier discussion on our interest rate sensitivity. In addition to the impact of the rate environment, NIM will also be impacted by the PPP loans and the amount of short-term liquidity on the balance sheet. Noninterest income and expenses are both expected to decline by high single to low double digits from their current levels, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 related impacts. Total net charge-offs are expected to be in the 45 to 50 basis points range.  In summary, our first quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we've made over the past few years, improving our resiliency, diversifying our revenues and proactively managing the balance sheet. That being said, we are in an unprecedented environment right now and have limited visibility with respect to the economic path forward. We will continue to rely on the same principles, disciplined client selection, and service underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Thanks, Saul. Good question. Obviously, it is a broad question. And the difficulty here is the environment has changed so quickly it is difficult to compare one bank's ratios and coverage to another. But having said that, what we gave you on Page 12 of the slide presentation, is a similar set of coverage numbers for stress test runs that other banks have. And clearly, our coverage levels are exceeding those losses that we have predicted through our models compared to other banks. What we have done is we have incorporated the -- as the environment continued to deteriorate in March into the end of the quarter, and basically reflected a fairly drastic change in the economic environment, not only in the second or third quarter, but try to project a weaker recovery into the second year and third year because we are looking at a 3-year R&S period here.  And I gave you some statistics around our assumptions. In our minds, the current fiscal and monetary policies are likely to cushion the second and third quarter impacts but are not going to be necessarily providing a significant support to the latter years. So our reserve levels, as conservative as they are at 2.35%, do reflect a slowly recovering economy rather than a V-shaped recovery. Underlying those numbers is also the quality of the portfolio that we have. We shared with you statistics on our consumer and mortgage portfolios, and we are also sharing some details on the commercial. The commercial book -- I think Jamie and Richard can comment on the commercial book, but the portions of the commercials that are exposed to COVID-19 also tend to be the book that has more large corporate exposures, more heavy sick exposures.  So all of those combined, hard to compare our numbers to another, but we do believe that we've appropriately accounted for a weak outlook, slow recovery and the quality of the portfolio that we have in place. Jamie or Richard, I don't know if you guys want to add more. No, [indiscernible] suggests that this is like -- obviously, we continue to evaluate the data as it comes. We continue to evaluate these new programs. And we -- at the end of this quarter, we'll do that evaluation again just like every other bank will do. And then we'll share you with you the results of our analysis. Good question. I will not comment on this [indiscernible] Look, I mean, I think our -- away from reserve builds and loss expectations, I think the underlying PPNR activity is going to continue to look good. We intend to manage our expenses at an appropriate level relative to the environment. We have a strong protection against a lower rate environment, and we have diversified revenue streams. So the company has strong ability to generate capital on earnings in this environment. As I mentioned earlier, it is a little difficult to predict exactly what will happen to the provision and the charge-offs. But clearly, our intent is to continue to outpace the impact of the credit here. And this is one of those environments where, unfortunately, looking longer than beyond 1 or 2 quarters is extremely difficult. So we will give you a better update as we get a better read on the environment. But obviously, we believe strongly in our ability to manage this company at profitable levels. Yes. So we did not give any NIM guidance this quarter, and that was on purpose. I think the general dynamics around NIM and the impact of lower short-term rates and a flatter curve at lower rates is pretty set for us. As I mentioned, it's 4 to 5 basis points per move. The reason why we chose not to give guidance this quarter is because there are 3 -- I view the second quarter as a transitionary quarter. There are 3 main impacts. One of them is the very high levels of liquidity that we are carrying on our books. I mentioned that March carried a significantly more liquidity on our balance sheet. Here in early April, we're carrying even more because some of the government programs are starting to throw cash. The second 1 is PPP, as you mentioned. And the third 1 is the LIBOR/Fed fund spread. We expect LIBOR/Fed fund spread to tighten throughout the quarter from the current levels. And what we also believe is the high level of liquidity that we're carrying in our balance sheet is going to give us a better ability to manage the deposit rates down during the quarter.  So all those together, the second quarter is going to be 1 of those quarters that's going to be very busy. But beyond the second quarter, that relationship between rate moves and the curve shape and our NIM impact holds pretty tightly. 4 to 5 basis points is a pretty good number that you can use. In order to achieve a better level of precision, we need to know more about this environment. This -- we are giving you these reference points as a comparison. I think the scenarios that underlie the DFAST are known, and they are quite severe. But no stress scenario is like the other one. And this one, in particular, is going to be very different in the sense that these support programs are yet to be evaluated with respect to how they impact the recovery path and where we are going to end up. That's a big difference because in most classic stress tests, usually the economy comes back at 1 point to where it starts. What we don't know today is where this economy is going to end up and the recovery period flattens out to a -- So I'm very hesitant to answer your question because we just don't know enough about the nature of this downturn. But at least showing you the DFAST results gives you the ability to compare us with others. And then as this economy develops, then we have the ability to reshape our expectations. I think, Gerard, here's my take on the year. I do believe that, assuming these drawdowns will stay with us for a while, the higher loan balances will provide a decent amount of support against the lower rate environment, and assuming that we manage the deposit rates down and our liquidity positions optimally, the year, despite the fact that it is a -- the worst-case scenario beyond just negative interest rates for banks, the balance sheet should support a decent healthy level of NII.  In terms of the sequence of quarters from second into third into fourth, I think we will probably see a changing fee picture here because clearly, the economy stopped, and that will have a near-term negative impact on fees in the second quarter from spend levels to asset management based on equity levels and to some capital markets activity. Our expectation is, assuming that things start somehow normalizing either into the second half of the second quarter or the third quarter, we should see a little healthier fee picture in the second half of the year. And then the expense side of it, we clearly are going to benefit from lower expenses that are tied to activity. And then we will start making some decisions on our end based on this environment.  So in general, you are going -- the second quarter definitely is going to be a transition quarter. But I do believe that as we look into the third and fourth quarter, we are going to start seeing some normalizing PPNR activity -- PPNR levels."

            "name": "James Leonard",
            "content": "Yes, Saul, so as I stepped into this chair and started looking at the portfolio, the 1 thing that stands out to me is just how intentional we have been about where we do business with the clients that we select, that should be resilient in times of stress. And frankly, the focus for us has been on companies with larger scale that should be able to persevere in this environment. And so our loan book, I would tell you, is comprised of high-quality liquid resilient names, and the best data we could use to prove that point is the shared national credit information that we included on the page. And as you can see, it's a very high percentage of 75%. Yes. So on the first part of the question, there is very little impact on the PCI to PCD transition. So the NPA inflows that you see in the deck of about $175 million was driven by several factors. One -- about 1/3 of the inflow was a single real estate mall exposure. About 1/4 of the NPA formation is actually in smaller businesses, business banking, lower middle market. And then the remainder, when you look at what drove it, it's really spread across industries and geographies, but the 1 common thread is that they're all predominantly in the service industry. So professional, medical, education, financial advisory. So pretty widespread there. So we did not provide that, John. So relative to the 2.1%, one would assume it's north of that number, but we did not disclose that percentage. Yes. So within the commercial segment, we've actually had a fairly limited number of requests in the commercial side to the consumer side. We've only had about 400 or so, and it's predominantly covenant waivers for terms in 2020, and that's roughly $2 billion of outstandings, and that's led by car dealers, hotels and restaurants. When it comes to restructured or modified actual dollars, that's very small to date, with only $200 million in loan balances. And probably the 1 sector with the most activity would be restaurants. You see that on Slide 9, our $1.9 billion in outstandings. The good news is we're favorably weighted with only 35% is in dining and 65% fast food quick service. So about 80% of the book continues to remain open. Those that are closed are predominantly in the in-dining category. So overall, some activity here in the modifications, but it's still a little early. We'll see how it plays out over the course of the year. About $0.5 million in fee waivers. And so Gerard, in terms of the hardship relief to date by product, and this is through the end of last week, so a little bit updated for April activity. What we're seeing is a lot of the fixed rate or fixed payment products have the higher request levels. So autos at 5%. Mortgages in our owned portfolio are at 4% of the portfolio. And then as you see the minimum monthly payments lower in home equity and credit card, they're at 2% and 3%. So as we model, obviously, we expect this to rise as unemployment rises, but the ultimate amount of hardship relief that we give will ultimately depend on where unemployment picks out. And for us, right now on most products, we're offering 90-day loan payment deferrals. And then in mortgage, we offer the 6-month forbearance. So we'll continue to update you as the quarter transpires. The casino exposure on Slide 9, the top part of the page of Slide 9 refers to lending to the operating companies within the casino and then the CRE portion would be, obviously, building the hotel and going along with it. We -- really, the names are large companies, high-quality, resilient. So again, we feel like we're well positioned. And while there may be losses in this portfolio, we feel like the lost content is very manageable. Yes. So on the mortgage, are you talking on the consumer side, Scott? Yes. So the commercial side will just continue on a case-by-case basis with each client. The covenant relief period expire. As we're executing on these covenant waivers, we have been adding some additional liquidity capital retention requirements as well. So we feel like the process has been productive. It's been a good dialogue with clients. And so that will just continue over the course of the year."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nChris Doll: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we\u2019ll be discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third\u2019s performance. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I\u2019m joined by our CEO, Greg Carmichael; President, Tim Spence, CFO, Jamie Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.\nGreg Carmichael: Thanks, Chris, and thank all you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported full year net income of $2.8 billion or $3.73 per share. We delivered strong financial results throughout the year, while fully supporting our customers, our communities and our employees. We generated full-year adjusted ROTCE, excluding AOCI, of 19%. Additionally, excluding the provision benefit in excess of charge-offs, our ROTCE exceeded 16% and improved more than 130 basis points from last year, driven by record financial results throughout the franchise. We generated record revenue of nearly $8 billion in 2021, which increased 4% compared to 2020, highlighted by strength in commercial, retail and wealth and asset management. Our performance was led by record adjusted fee revenue, which increased 8%. Net interest income was stable compared to last year despite the continued environmental headwinds as we have been disciplined deploying excess cash. Full-year adjusted expenses increased just 2.5% compared to last year, reflecting disciplined expense management throughout the company. As a result of our strong financial performance, we achieved positive operating leverage, excluding security gains and losses and generated an adjusted efficiency ratio below 60%. Credit quality remained strong with historically low full-year net charge-offs of just 16 basis points. Additionally, non-performing loans and criticized assets continue to improve throughout the year, including the fourth quarter. Our credit results demonstrate our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and continued benefits from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $662 million or $0.90 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.03 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.93 per share. Our quarterly financial results reflected strong momentum in most of our businesses. We saw that improved revenues compared to the third quarter. We generated record commercial banking revenue, record treasury management revenue and record wealth and asset management revenue in the quarter. We expect the positive momentum in our business to carry forward into 2022 and beyond. In our commercial business, record loan production of $8.2 billion increased approximately 50% sequentially with record performances in both corporate banking and middle market. Despite the ongoing challenges we are hearing from our customers, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, production was broad-based across our regions and verticals. From a regional middle market perspective, we generated strong production this year in several markets, including Chicago, the Carolinas, Indiana, Georgia and our expansion markets. From an industry vertical perspective, health care, renewables, retail, technology and financial institutions all continued to outperform.\\ As result of our record production and record new quality relationships, we generated C&I loan growth, excluding PPP of 7% on an average basis or 11% on a period-end basis compared to last quarter. The acceleration of commercial loan growth at the end of 2021, our strong pipeline, new commitment growth, production anticipated from Provide and continued investments in capabilities and talent will also support accelerated loan growth in 2022. In our retail business, we once again generated consistent peer-leading consumer household growth in excess of 3% year-over-year, highlighted by our Chicago and Southeast markets. We continue to add households in every region, reflecting the ongoing success of momentum banking as well as our branch expansion and digital initiatives. Our success throughout our retail business comes down to three factors. First, we are generating smart scale in our local markets. This quarter, we opened 18 banking centers in our key Southeast MSAs, while consolidating four locations throughout our footprint. We have also closed an additional 40 locations in the month of January, primarily in legacy markets. We will continue to leverage our geospatial analytics to optimize our overall branch network, while taking into account evolving customer preferences. We continue to target a branch network allocation of approximately 35% in the Southeast by 2025. Second, we offer differentiated products and services like Momentum Banking, which includes features that enable customers to avoid overdraft fees and get access to short-term liquidity when needed. I'd like to point out with respect to unit fees we have been the lowest among peers with significant consumer banking operations for several quarters. And third, we are delivering an outstanding customer experience as shown by leading third-party surveys. We have improved in the bottom quartile five years ago to top quartile today. We are recognized as the number one bank out of the top 25 banks taking care of our customers during the pandemic. Our balance sheet earnings power remained very strong. Last night to support continued acceleration of our growth and profitability, we announced the acquisition of Dividend Finance, a leading fintech point-of-sale, consumer lender, providing solutions for a highly attractive and growing renewable energy industry. They have strong relationships with a robust contract network, offer sales and project management solutions through a state-of-the-art technology platform, and have a customer footprint focused on prime and super-prime borrowers. They have a coast-to-coast footprint with targeted growth initiatives in the Southeast. By financing consumer renewable energy solutions, combined with our existing leadership in providing renewable solutions to commercial clients since 2012, we are supporting the country's transition to a more sustainable economy and furthering our ESG leadership position among peers. As the only bank among peers that are earning a leadership score from CDP for three consecutive years, we are intensely focused on leading the transition to a sustainable future. Our focus has been recognized by several prominent ESG providers, including MSCI, which recently gave us a three-notch rating upgrade. Whereas our sustained peer-leading household growth, top quartile key metrics, balance sheet management or strong diversified fee revenues, we have established a track record of doing what we say we're going to do. Our execution ultimately produces superior, consistent and sustainable financial performance. Across all of our businesses, our strategic priorities are unchanged. We remain focused on leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation, investing to drive growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies and maintaining discipline throughout the company. Before turning it over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook, I'd like to once again thank our employees. I very much appreciate the way you have continued to raise to the occasion to support our customers, communities and each other. This is because of our frontline employees that we were able to keep within 99% of our branches opened since the onset of the pandemic. We gave a special bonus to these employees in the quarter in recognition of their extraordinary and ongoing efforts to provide essential banking services for our customers. This marks the second time during the pandemic that we have recognized the work of our frontline employees through a special bonus. In summary, we believe our strong and highly asset-sensitive balance sheet, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined management throughout the company will serve us well this year and beyond. We expect to generate positive operating leverage again for the full year in 2022 without adjusting for PPP or other known headwinds. We remain focused on growing strong relationships and managing the balance sheet with a through-the-cycle perspective to generate sustainable long-term value for our stakeholders and maintaining our position as a top-performing regional bank. With that, I'll turn over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook.\nJames Leonard: Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our strong quarterly financial results reflect focused execution throughout the bank. The reported earnings included a negative $0.03 impact from the two items noted in the release. We generated solid revenue growth, which resulted in record fee income, combined with another quarter of strong credit quality. As a result, we produced an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of over 18%. Improvements in credit quality resulted in an $85 million release to our credit reserves and an ACL ratio of 185 basis points compared to 200 basis points last quarter. Combined with another quarter of historically low net charge-offs, we had a $47 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion increased 1% sequentially, reflecting C&I loan growth, $10 million in seasonal mutual fund dividends and $18 million in prepayment penalties received in the investment portfolio, as well as a reduction in long-term debt. These items were partially offset by lower loan yields and a decline in PPP-related income, which was $36 million this quarter compared to $47 million in the prior quarter. Excluding PPP, NII increased $19 million or 2% sequentially. On the funding side, we reduced our total interest-bearing liabilities cost three basis points this quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, reported net interest margin decreased four basis points, reflecting a $2.6 billion increase in interest-bearing cash and lower loan yields, partially offset by prepayment penalties and mutual fund dividends from our investment portfolio. Excluding the impact of excess cash, NIM was flat sequentially. Total reported noninterest income increased 1% compared to the year ago quarter. As we discussed in early December, reported results included negative valuation marks totaling $22 million, attributable to a $5 million negative MSR valuation as well as a $17 million fintech investment unrealized loss recorded in securities losses that occurred since its October IPO. Similar to our previous holdings of public companies, we will exit our position at the appropriate time. Adjusted noninterest income results exclude the impact of security gains and losses, the Visa swap as well as prior period business disposition gains and losses. Adjusted noninterest income increased 4% sequentially, driven by another quarter of record commercial banking revenue. We generated record M&A advisory fees notably in our healthcare vertical, reflecting successful outcomes from our Coker and H2C teams, combined with strong business lending and syndication revenue. These items were partially offset by lower corporate bond fees. We also generated solid fee revenue growth in treasury management, card and processing and wealth and asset management, where we generated record net AUM inflows in both the fourth quarter and the full year. We were recently recognized as one of the world's best private banks for the third consecutive year by Global Finance Magazine and our results reflected. Additionally, Mortgage banking revenue decreased $51 million compared to the third quarter, which included a $12 million unfavorable impact from our decision to retain $350 million of retail production during the quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income increased 2% with improvement in every single fee caption reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year. Noninterest income represented 40% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Reported noninterest expenses decreased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily driven by lower occupancy expense as well as lower processing expense reflecting contract renegotiations. Adjusted expenses increased 2%, driven by higher performance-based compensation, reflecting strong business results from record AUM inflows and commercial loan production, elevated medical benefits due to pandemic, loan servicing expenses and continued technology investments. Our expenses this quarter included mark-to-market impacts associated with nonqualified deferred compensation of $10 million compared to less than $1 million last quarter. For the full year, total adjusted fees increased 8% compared to just 2.5% expense growth. Commercial Banking revenue increased 21%. Card and processing revenue increased 14%. Wealth and asset management revenue increased 13% and TM revenue increased 9%, offset by a $28 million reduction from lower TRA income and a 16% decline in mortgage banking. On the expense side, the largest contributor of the growth was elevated performance-based compensation, technology investments and loan servicing expenses. These items were partially offset by the actions we took about a year ago to streamline the organization, including process reengineering, vendor renegotiations, and divestitures of noncore businesses such as property and casualty insurance, HSA deposits and 401(k) recordkeeping. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 1% sequentially, including the PPP headwind. Excluding PPP, portfolio loans and leases increased 3% on an average basis and increased 5% on a period end basis. Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 1% compared to the prior quarter has continued to strengthen auto was partially offset by declines in home equity and other consumer loan balances.  Average commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 2% compared to the prior quarter reflecting growth in C&I loans. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased 4% with C&I loans up 7%. As Greg mentioned, commercial loan production was robust across the board up nearly 50% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting strong corporate and middle market banking production, which was well diversified geographically. As a result, period-end C&I loans excluding PPP increased a 11% sequentially. Revolver utilization of 33% increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Average CRE loans were down 3% sequentially with lower balances and mortgage and construction driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted by the pandemic. As we have discussed before, we continue to have the lowest CRE concentration as a percentage of total capital compared to peers.  Given the rate environment towards the end of the fourth quarter, we began investing a small portion of our excess cash with the average securities portfolio balances increasing 1% sequentially. Average other short-term investments, which includes our interest bearing cash remained elevated, reflecting continued growth in core deposits. Compared to the prior quarter commercial transaction deposits increased 5% and consumer transaction deposits increased 2%  Moving to credit, as Greg mentioned, our credit performance this quarter was once again strong, with fourth quarter net charge-offs remaining historically low. Non-performing assets declined 6% sequentially with the NPA ratio declining 5 basis points. Criticized assets declined 13% sequentially, reflecting a significant improvement from COVID high impact industries.  Additionally, criticized assets declined in virtually every region in vertical and also improved in our leverage loan portfolio. From a product standpoint, we continue to closely monitor CRE including office and hospitality exposures, given the ongoing effects of the pandemic.  Moving to the ACL, our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains stable with unemployment and main our three year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.8%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios given the continued uncertainty during the pandemic. Our ACL release this quarter came primarily from commercial reflecting the improved risk profile of the portfolio. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $960 million higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $213 million lower. While the economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to continued strength in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the uncertain environment. In addition to COVID, we continue to monitor the economic and lending implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist. Our December 31 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment.  Moving to capital, our capital levels remained strong with the CET1 ratio ending the quarter at 9.5%. During the quarter, we completed $316 million in share repurchases as part of our capital plan, which reduced our share count by 7.3 million shares. Now that we have reached our 9.5% CET1 goal, we are returning to our 2019 CET1 target of 9% based on our improved credit risk profile and the economic outlook. It is worth noting that combining regulatory capital, credit reserves and unrealized gains we have one of the highest overall loss absorbency rates among peers. As Greg mentioned, last night, we announced the strategic acquisition of Dividend Finance. Strategically, Dividend furthers our existing indirect consumer point-of-sale capabilities with a tech-forward platform. Dividend pioneered the financing model, which improves economic outcomes for customers and contractors. This helps accelerate dividend growth in the solar industry which is expected to continue growing at a double-digit CAGR over the next several years. Dividend will improve Fifth Third's loan portfolio granularity, geographic diversification and balance between consumer and commercial loans. Furthermore, while not modelled we expect to generate synergies over time in our mortgage and home equity business as well as with our existing commercial clients. The transaction is also financially compelling. In 2021, Dividend gained market share and originated over $1 billion in loans, which increased 40% compared to 2019. We expect total origination volume of around $1 billion in 2022 post close. Dividend Finance previously utilized an originate-to-sell model. And as a result, the closing of the acquisition will not include a material transfer of loan losses. However, post close, Fifth Third will retain all loan originations. Given the scalability of the business, we expect a life of loan ROA of 3% plus, ROTCE of 30% plus and an efficiency ratio below 20%. Our modelling conservatively assumes a market share consistent with dividend finances recent history, no extension of the federal solar investment tax credit, an annualized net charge offs around 130 basis points. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter and will utilize approximately 30 basis points of capital. Our long term capital priorities remain unchanged. First, deploy capital into organic growth initiatives. Then evaluate strategic non-bank opportunities, continue paying a strong dividend and finally execute share repurchases with excess capital. Given the strong loan growth and the acquisition of Dividend Finance, we currently expect to resume share repurchases sometime in the second half of the year. Moving to our current outlook, our full year guidance includes the financial impacts from Dividend Finance, which is expected to close in the second quarter. We expect full year average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021, including the expected headwinds from PPP and the Ginnie Mae forbearance loans we added throughout last year. Excluding these items, we expect total average loan growth between 10% and 11%, reflecting robust pipelines, sales force additions the dividend and provide acquisitions and only a 1% improvement in commercial revolver utilization rates over the course of the year. This should result in commercial loan growth of 12% to 13%, excluding PPP. Additionally, we expect total average consumer loan growth between 6% and 7%, excluding the Ginnie Mae loans. On a sequential basis, we expect first quarter average total loan growth of 3% to 4%, excluding PPP and Ginnie Mae loans. Including those impacts, we expect average total loans to increase 1% to 2% compared to the fourth quarter. Our outlook reflects continued strength in commercial given our production and pipelines. We expect 6% average C&I growth in the first quarter, excluding PPP. We expect CRE balances to be stable sequentially in the first quarter, and as a result, expect average total commercial loan growth of 4% to 5% sequentially, excluding PPP. We expect average consumer loan balances to increase around 1% sequentially, excluding the Ginnie Mae impacts. We provide our expectations for this portfolio in our presentation appendix. Given our loan outlook, we expect full year NII to increase 4% to 5%. It is worth noting that our outlook incorporates the impacts from the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios, which will result in a $220 million headwind next year or about 4.5 percentage points. Meaning, we would have expected close to double-digit growth in NII, if not for those portfolios, which have served their purpose to help bridge us to the more productive rate environment. Given that current rate environment, our forecast assumes growth in our securities portfolio of approximately $1 billion per quarter and includes three rate hikes beginning in May. Due to the evolving economic outlook, our forecast and balance sheet management strategies are subject to change. As a reference point, we estimate that a 25 basis point incremental rate hike would increase NII by approximately $30 million to $35 million per quarter or seven basis points of NIM when fully realized. The ultimate impact to NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing of short-term rate movements, balance sheet management strategies, including securities growth and hedging transactions and realized deposit betas. On the topic of deposit betas, our current outlook assumes a deposit beta around 13% over the first 100 basis points of rate hikes, including less than 10% for the first couple of hikes. We have updated our NII sensitivity disclosures in the presentation appendix, which now incorporates a dynamic beta repricing assumption rather than static beta approach previously utilized. The information in the appendix uses modeled approaches to estimate the impacts of various rate scenarios based on decades of historical data. These model betas are 30% for the first 100 basis point scenario and 36% for the plus 200 basis point scenario. For the first quarter, we expect NII to be down 1% sequentially, impacted primarily by day count as well as lower prepayment penalty, PPP and Ginnie Mae income, partially offset by strong loan growth. Given the January 3 forward curve did not consider a March rate hike, if the Fed were to move in March with a run-up in benchmark rates, we would expect first quarter NII to be stable sequentially. We expect adjusted noninterest income to increase 3% to 5% in 2022, reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities resulting in stronger treasury management revenue, capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue. Additionally, we expect strong processing revenue, reflecting both the economic environment and continued household growth. Mortgage revenue should improve modestly in 2022, reflecting elevated servicing revenue from MSR purchases throughout 2021 and moderating asset decay partially offset by a meaningful decrease in production revenue. We expect TRA and private equity income to be stable compared to 2021 levels. We expect first quarter adjusted noninterest income to be stable year-over-year or decline around 8% to 9% compared to the fourth quarter. Excluding the impacts of the TRA, we expect fees to be down approximately 3% sequentially, reflecting seasonal factors, a decline in private equity income and lower leasing revenue. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up around 1%, excluding the impact of dividend finance compared to 2021 or up 2% to 3%, including dividend. We expect compensation expenses to increase around 3% or so, reflecting wage pressures and sales force additions, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation in certain areas such as mortgage given the outlook for lower origination volumes. We also continue to invest in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth of around 10%, consistent with the past several years. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid-single-digits area. Our outlook also assumes we add 20 to 25 new branches in our high-growth markets, which will result in high-single-digit growth of our Southeast branch network. We expect these items to be partially offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives, reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in leasing expense given the revenue outlook and continued overall expense discipline throughout the company. We expect total adjusted expenses in the first quarter of 2022 to be up around 3% to 4% compared to the year ago quarter or up 5% to 6% compared to the prior quarter. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are also impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, we expect first quarter expenses to be down approximately 2% compared to the fourth quarter. Additionally, our first quarter expense outlook is impacted by a broader and larger special equity grant for eligible employees to reward the record performance in 2021 and to provide a retention incentive over the next several years in this competitive labor market. As a result, our full year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in expenses, resulting in more than a 1 point improvement in the efficiency ratio. Our outlook for positive operating leverage reflects continued success growing our fee-based businesses, recent acquisitions, expense discipline and strong balance sheet management. It also considers the known revenue headwinds from PPP and our Ginnie Mae portfolio. We would have guided to positive operating leverage on a stand-alone basis even without any rate hikes. We expect 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis point range and we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be in the 15 to 20 basis points range. In summary, our fourth quarter and full year results were strong. We achieved positive operating leverage in 2021 in a challenging interest rate environment, while maintaining discipline throughout the company. We have a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet, which should perform very well in a rising rate environment, we have over $30 billion of excess cash and continue to grow and diversify our fee revenues, all of which support our through-the-cycle outperformance. We are deploying capital in order to maximize long-term profitability and are committed to generating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChris Doll: Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning. Operator, please open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari: On the loan growth front, clearly, on the commercial side on C&I, very robust on the end-of-period growth, 11% ex the PPP impacts. Can you give us a little more detail on the drivers in terms of the businesses? I know you mentioned corporate and middle market. And then also, do you see any impact from borrowers pulling forward demand for borrowing into the fourth quarter given the change from LIBOR to SOFR? Thanks.\nGreg Carmichael: John, this is Greg. I\u2019ll start off and with those activities prepared with a lot of color to your question we were expecting of course. First off, we've made significant investments over the last five years in our strategic markets in the Southeast, west Coast, Texas on verticals and talent and so forth. So we would expect to see this type of outcome as we go into last year into this year. So we're very pleased with the performance. We're very pleased with the momentum we have going into it. Once again, I think it's a byproduct of the investments we made in talent, our expansion of these geographies and just the way we've approached this business over the last five years. You're starting to see the outcomes. But Tim will give you more as the markets itself and where we're seeing the outcomes.\nTimothySpence: Yes, sure. Happy to do it. So let me anchor it to the numbers. So ex PPP, as you mentioned, C&I loan growth was about 11% or on a dollar basis, it was about $4.9 billion point-to-point in the quarter. So of that, about one-third of it came from an increase in utilization on existing revolver and then a full two-third of the growth were a byproduct either of the record production we had. We had a record quarter in addition to it being a record year in both corporate banking and in the middle market or it was new clients funding up commitments that were extended in earlier quarters this year, consistent with the data we have been sharing on commitment growth. So on the utilization front, the lower end of our book tends to move in terms of utilization faster than the corporate banking side. And we did see that middle market and business banking had the best pickup in utilization rates, which is probably at least in part a byproduct to the manufacturing and logistics centric nature of the Midwest markets. But the drivers there when you talk to clients were really inventory levels. There were some tax distributions or business expansion related, people investing in CapEx or acquisitions. On the corporate banking side, it was really the big vertical, but the draws there were most concentrated in the mortgage servicer segment. On the two-thirds of the growth that came from production. I think, as Greg mentioned, they're literally basically entirely driven by the strategic investments. So on, Corporate Banking, it was industry verticals. In the middle market, it was really the sales force expansion in the Southeast through the additions of California and Texas. And then it was strong performance from Provide as they got into the run rate. In total, it really is new relationships, more than it forwards a transition to SOFR. So we added 551 new relationships in commercial in 2021, so about 30% more than our prior high mark at any one point. And I think what we feel very good about is these really aren't just loan-only relationships. They are the driver of what you saw in the strong growth we had on both treasury management and capital markets. I think if you look forward, I was looking at the bottoms-up pipelines earlier this week, and they are about 75% larger than where they were at the same time last year and almost 90% larger than the first quarter of 2019. So we feel very good about our ability to sustain the robust loan growth. And the drivers there, again, are the strategic investments. Chicago is the biggest year-over-year improver as we continue to see strength and the benefits of the synergies from the MB merger. And then its markets like Tennessee, North Florida, California and Texas in the regions. And then on the vertical side, it's the stalwart verticals for us, health care and TMT along with continued really good growth in renewables. And then as we talked about in the past, the mortgage warehouse segment that we launched recently. I think haven't been out in the market. The energy is really good there. I think there's a strong sense for us that between the investments we've made and the fact that we've really been able to focus on execution and collaboration, having had our people back in the office for longer than most and not having the distractions of merger integration or otherwise, it really has been -- it's been nice to see the pickup.\nJohn Pancari: Thanks, Tim. And then quickly Greg just on M&A, I wanted to get your updated thoughts on deals. I know you indicated that non-bank acquisitions would be more of a priority. And if so, what additional businesses outside of what you just did on the Dividend Finance side? What are the businesses in terms of bolt-ons? And then maybe a quick comment just on whole bank fields. Thanks.\nGreg Carmichael: First, thanks for the questions. Our strategy hasn't changed. It's really, as you said, it's the bolt-ons opportunities non-bank transactions, just like we did with Dividend, which we couldn't be more pleased about that acquisition and how it fits into our portfolio of opportunities strategically. But more of those type of opportunities we're going to continue to look for. So point of sale on the consumer side, in addition to that, we're going to continue to focus on wealth and asset management opportunities that might emerge. Obviously, on the cap market side, on the advisory side of the house there's other verticals that we're looking for partners in that space from an advisory perspective. So we'll continue to focus on those opportunities, the fintech plays and the advisory that fits to some of the additional verticals, wealth and asset management will be the areas of opportunity we continue to stay focused on. And when you think about a bank acquisition right now, especially given all the challenges and complexity of what we're seeing in on the regulatory front in Washington with some of the movements that are underway right now and the challenge to get a large transaction done or a bank transaction for banks over $100 billion that's out there. So it's on your mind as you think about the timing to get a transaction done. But once again, at this point right now, our focus is to be relevant in the strategic markets that we're already banking in. There's not many of these opportunities that exist right now. So once again, it's not a primary focus of ours today, and I don't see that in the near future also as we think about the rest of this year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian: My first question is for Jamie. Jamie, you have been vocal in the past in terms of guiding or giving us a sense of what kind of deposit attrition we could expect in a rising rate backdrop. One of your biggest competitors mentioned that we don't expect negative deposit growth at all. In fact, they expect positive deposit growth through this rate cycle. And I'm wondering, especially in light of your commentary that you're deploying about $1 billion of cash per quarter, if you have changed your tune as to the duration of the excess deposits that you gathered during the pandemic?\nJames Leonard: Thanks, Erika, and welcome back to the coverage of Fifth Third. So I appreciate the question. Let me take it in two parts. So first, when it comes to the macro view and for the industry, you go back over the last 100 years, I think there's only been two years where deposits didn't grow in the industry. So I do believe that there can be deposit growth as the Fed tightens and history proves that. So when it comes to Fifth Third, the more idiosyncratic view that we have is that, we would be comfortable having up to one-third of our excess cash migrate away from Fifth Third deposit products and into more productive vehicles for those customers. So with that said, when we look at our deposit betas, our deposit pricing outlook for the rate hikes on the horizon, we're going to be very disciplined on those deposit rates. And therefore, if deposits leave, it's a very manageable outcome for us. However, I will tell you, given our strong commercial client acquisition, our strong treasury management growth and our strong household growth as we sit here today, even with balance and disciplined deposit betas, we still expect deposit growth this year at Fifth Third and that's even with continuing to run down our CD portfolio. As much as I would be comfortable with a little bit of deposit outflow, I think given our sales success, we will have deposit growth this year.\nErika Najarian: And my second question is for Greg. I thought it was very striking and telling that Jamie said during his prepared remarks that you would have generated positive operating leverage without rates. And the earnings season has really put CEOs in two camps. One, the CEOs that are spending the rate hikes and second, those that are more allowing it to fall to the bottom line. As we think about Fifth Third and Fifth Third in the middle of a normalizing rate cycle, what is your view of reinvesting later years, right, after the PPP headwinds dissipate versus taking that rate generated additional income and reinvesting it.\nGreg Carmichael: First of all, we're always going to continue, Erika, invest in the future of this company. We're in it for the long haul. We never do anything focused on the quarter or even for a full year. So we'll continue to invest. Look at our technology investments. It's been running around 10%. You can expect we're going to continue to do that. We're also going to continue to invest in our ability to expand this franchise both geography, product sets through our verticals, capabilities, in our talent capabilities. So we'll continue to invest in those areas. Obviously, wages are another area we're going to have to continue to step up on and be aggressive on which we have been as a leader in the minimum wage going from 12% to 15% to 15% to 18%, we took that pain before most of our peers did. We saw the need to do that. So, as you think about our investment, we're going to continue to invest. But we also believe a lot of the guidance we're giving right now this year, when you think about the first 3, 4 ,5 increases on the rate side of the house, most of that will fall to the bottom line as we already got our investment structure put in place for 2022. Beyond that, we'll continue to think about our investments necessary. You can expect some of that then will start to continue to turn into future investments. But I think as you look at this year, the guidance we provided most of that would fall to the bottom line.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKen Usdin: Hi, Jamie, you've been steadfast in your view of holding back on the liquidity deployment, and we see that again this quarter. Just wanted -- as we've seen quite a change in what the potential outlook for rates looks like, any different views here about how you expect to use excess liquidity and look at the securities book going forward?\nJamie Leonard: So in the prepared remarks, we talked about deploying $1 billion per quarter into the investment portfolio, a little more detail around our thinking there is that we've been patient. We were fortunate to be able to be patient. We have a very well positioned portfolio heading into the pandemic. And so it's afforded us this opportunity to wait. We've always said we wanted to get to the 2% entry points. And we got that visibility at the back half of December. And so we put some money to work in December, and then we've continued to do that here in January and expect to do it as the year progresses. Should rates continue, the curve continues to steepened, we perhaps could choose to move a little bit faster. And if they dip back down, we may choose to step off the gas a little bit in terms of the investment. But what we're investing in, we're really focused on structure right now. We finished the year with the bullet and locked-out cash flows at 59%. I would expect that number to get a little bit higher as we deploy a portion of the excess cash. So let's call it 40% to 50% of the allotment that we have for the security portfolio currently of $10 billion. So we'll reinvest cash flows. We'll add a little bit of leverage during the course of the year and look for us to do that in more structured product.\nKen Usdin: Great. And my follow-up is just 275 exit on your securities portfolio yields. And following on that point you just made about the locked-out cash flows. Can you help us understand how you see that 275 trajecting inside your overall NII outlook in the moment? Thanks.\nJamie Leonard: Thanks. Very good question. We expect yields for the portfolio to be in the 260 to 270 range this year, and that's with reinvesting and adding the additional leverage. The one component to the portfolio yield that is a little bit lumpy is the prepayment penalties. It's one of the advantages you get from the bullet structure that we have, and we were the beneficiaries of it in the fourth quarter. We've had a little bit thus far in January, and we would expect some of that as the year progresses. But that's the one item that makes it a little more challenging. But I would expect call it, 5 to 8 basis points of erosion as the year progresses, but then some prepayment penalties bolstering the yield so that we end up in that 260 to 270 range for the year.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open. \nGerard Cassidy: Jamie, can you elaborate. You gave some interesting numbers on the Dividend acquisition. When you talk about the life of loans in terms of the ROAs and profitability, can you give us some more information or just elaborate on how you're going to grow that business and why the profitability appears to be so high in that business.\nJames Leonard: I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Tim to add a little more color, but thanks for the question, Gerard. In terms of the loans and why they scream so profitably. Right now, it's offered as a 20 to 25-year term, the coupon, the customer is paying is in the 3% range. But the tax incentives are significant and allows a merchant discount to be paid and that merchant discount could add as much as 5 percentage points to the yield given that the loans end up being about a five year life. So you end up in the 22%, 23% type of federal benefit as part of the energy tax credit program. So there are some moving parts here. The yield will ebb and flow as a result of how that merchant discount plays out in the ultimate weighted average life, but that is why on the surface. It is a very profitable business more so than some of the other consumer origination channels that we have. And this is an area that we even talked about at several of the conferences in 2021 as a key challenge for Fifth Third is really improving the technology and the distribution around home equity lending and other consumer point-of-sale origination channel.\nTimothy Spence: Yes. I think to Jamie's point, I mean, point one, Gerard, as it relates to the way that you grow it is it's easier to grow when you have a strong tailwind, and there's no question when you look at the level of investment that's going to go into home improvement over the course of the next five to 10 years focused on sustainability. There is a really significant opportunity. I mean the Dividend's business today has been primarily on the solar panel side of the business. But in addition to that, there's storage, which is a fast-growing sector. There's energy efficiency-related investments, whether that's HVAC or Windows or green landscaping or otherwise. And then I think as we continue to see this push towards electric vehicles, there's a dynamic as it relates to high voltage currency into different parts of the homes than you needed previously. So all those categories are going to be big drivers of secular growth in the broader home improvement sector. And with dividends positioning, and the investments that have been made in this end-to-end technology platform, I think we believe they're pretty uniquely positioned to benefit and to continue to gain share there. I mean this is to call it a point-of-sale platform is almost to understate what it is. It's a fully integrated end-to-end solution that allows contractors to drive quoting to specify the sort of technical details around the installation itself. They're third-party data checks on the appropriateness of what is being installed, given the weather environment and the power generation potential and the local utility rates, which are obviously very customer-friendly, but also a good guardrail for the contractors themselves. They have APIs directly into the largest contractors CRM system. So in many cases, there isn't a third-party point of sale at all. It's just generated out of the iPad application that the contractor is using to begin with. And then all manner of downstream capabilities, including not funding loans until there's actually power coming off of the panels today that provide a really excellent customer experience. So as they come into Fifth Third, they obviously have the benefit of our balance sheet. That's one less thing that these fintech credit mono-lines otherwise would need to do in terms of recruiting bank funding partners. So we should be able to improve the product innovation velocity the way that we have with Provide bluntly. Provide's launched more products in the last six months than they had in the three years prior, okay, on the financing side. I think the other obvious benefit is while we are not believers in the way that some are and the opportunities associated with indirect lending to checking account cross-sell, they are very obvious loan-to-loan opportunities here, whether it's the Fifth Third mortgage servicing portfolio and providing an extension of credit there. We're leveraging our ability to underwrite and manage home equity and to connect that with a replenishable open to buy against what's an instalment alone or otherwise. So I think that is how we -- the first point of growth here is going to be make sure we get the talent. And we'll continue to make investments in the technology platform benefit from the secular growth. And then we're going to add capabilities that a bank can have in this case.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good, and then as a follow-up, Jamie, when looking at your balance sheet, obviously, quite low, as for the industry because of the deposit growth you touched on what you think deposits could do. What do you think is an optimal loan-to-deposit ratio for Fifth Third? And how long would it take to reach that level considering the puts and takes of what's going on in the marketplace today?\nJames Leonard: Yes. As you pointed out, it's certainly a low loan-to-deposit ratio in the mid-60s right now. It's certainly far better than I think our -- at least in my career, our highest number was back in 2005. It looks like 120%. So I think the optimal ratio is probably somewhere in between. I'd like to operate the balance sheet in the 85% or so range, which is why we would be willing to have some of the more rate-sensitive deposits run off during the tightening cycle, but also and more importantly is that we do expect significant loan growth as we talked about $10-plus billion could be $13 billion to $14 billion next year. And so that's going to help give a nice notch up in the loan-to-deposit ratio, but it probably takes us a couple of years to get back to the number that we would, I think, like to operate and that would be indicative of a very productive balance sheet.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Jamie, can you speak to whether there's a risk that some of the upward pressure you're seeing on expenses maybe out of your control. If you could just frame your confidence level and being able to manage [technical difficulty] environment such that you continue to achieve positive operating leverage even under different inflation scenarios?\nJames Leonard: Yes. We feel very confident in our ability to manage expenses. It's one of the things that's been a hallmark of the company under Greg's leadership is the expectation that every year, every area has to get more efficient. It's just a base expectation when we go through our planning and you see it in the results. So heading into this year, there's $125 million of savings that I'm highly confident we will achieve through the lean process, automation, through the branch consolidations and the vendor savings. But then as Greg pointed out, we do want to invest in our employees and in our franchise to really drive that revenue growth. So I think we've got a good approach here where we're balancing the revenue growth and sales expansion of the company while leaning out the support functions. And then to your main point of the question when it comes to inflation, wages, we have a stronger merit pool this year, and we have the special equity grant that we mentioned earlier to help improve retention, but that comes at a cost, and that is baked into our guide. And our guide was to be up 1% on a stand-alone basis. The Dividend acquisition adds 1.5 or so to the expense number, which is how we ended up in the 2% to 3% range. But as Greg said, we're really focused on the long-term performance doing the right thing in the long run. And I think our expense discipline helps drive that and it may appear to an outsider when you look at the numbers, that there's not a lot of activity there because things are fairly stable. The reality is we are driving a lot of savings, but we're choosing to reinvest those savings to improve the company for the long run.\nBill Carcache: That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up for Greg, I wanted to ask a strategic question. When you look at the success you've had with some of the bolt-on deals you've done, do you see a time where you'll want to continue to expand into new markets beyond those you're already in through digital channels without the need for traditional M&A and all the disruption that they can bring? Or are the -- I guess, the focus of -- focusing on your digital investments on serving customers in your existing markets?\nGregory Carmichael: First off, every CEO says a relationship bank, but we really live and breathe being a relationship bank as evidenced by our commitment to have our employees back in the office, focus on taking care of the customer. So we think our digital channels. It's really about how we reach our customers and how we service our customers and doing that best-in-class. So right now, we're pleased with the expansion markets that we're focused on right now. As we look at those, there's probably a couple of other markets that we're interested in. If we buy the right talent, we will go into those markets, but it's all based on the talent. I don't see us necessarily leading with a digital play at this point on the consumer side in markets that we're not in today from a brick-and-mortar perspective. I don't see that happening in the near term. I don't think we need to do that. I don't think it's a good business for us. As we mentioned before, we're flushed liquidity. We got strong household growth. The profitability of our retail franchise has never been stronger. So we think the model we have right now which provide the brick-and-mortar services, call center services, both our digital capabilities is the best model for us today. Now obviously, we're not going to be naive and are a barrier ahead to seen as what the future might hold. But if that opportunity presents all that makes sense, we have our capabilities to do those expansions with our technology and they're designed for that. But we'll take advantage of that opportunity if it makes sense at some point in the future if it materializes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMike Mayo: Set off the starting gun for loan growth. So what you grew, that 44% annualized commercial loans were up $9 billion. And what you described, I guess, what, one-third drawdown and roughly split on middle market, large corporate. You talked about inventory build and capital expenditures. So I think you gave a nice summary of all that. But what had happened to the supply chain disruptions and the delay in loan growth later when the supply chain disruption go away. Really, the question is why now?\nTimothy Spence: Yes. I mean, Mike, it's Tim Spence. Hello. No, I think the supply chain issues are still real. We have many clients who say they'd like to be running at inventory levels that are above where they're at. I just think we took share this year. I mean that's the reason I anchor back to this point about our having record new relationship growth, new quality relationship growth into the commercial bank. Anecdotally, when you get into the ground, there wasn't a geographic market that didn't add double-digit new relationships this year, then you go out and you talk to those clients. And then literally, they were house relationships at other places who either associated with the disruption or who felt like they were not getting what they needed in terms of the breadth of capabilities or who follow the banker that we managed to attract into our franchise over time, who chose to move from another financial institution to Fifth Third. So, I think that is the reason that we managed to grow at the rate that we did despite the fact that there are still natural constraints to inventory building. And then we haven't yet seen the pop quite at the level that we expect to see, although we did get some benefit of that associated with the M&A activity. I think the one other thing I would tell you is there was an inflection point this year in our pipelines, when we got people back into the office and we started seeing clients in person, in April of this past year. And the level of activity that we generate through our One Bank model, which is the relationship management model that's been in place here for more than a decade, is really core to the way that we grow business. And I think we saw the outcomes of that over the course of the year in terms of the acceleration of loan growth and production in particular.\nMike Mayo: So, not to put words in your mouth, I'm looking for validation. As it relates to loan growth, the pandemic is over.\nGreg Carmichael: [indiscernible].\nTimothy Spence: We're all looking at each other trying to figure out what who is going to take that one.\nGreg Carmichael: But I do think the supply chain constraints. I think the labor shortages and so forth are here to stay for a while. I don't see that add at all as we go into the year. But I think people are adjusting. I think corporations are adjusting, I think they're figuring out ways to do things more efficiently. As Tim said, there's not a customer we talk to where labor is not an issue. There's not a customer we talked to where they would like to build more inventory faster. But I think we've just done a good job of banking these customers and taking those relationships. But it will still be a challenging environment as we move forward. But we're very optimistic in investments we've made in the geographies and people and capabilities. And we just feel like we've got -- we get the right formula right now.\nJames Leonard: Yes, Mike, I would say that while the pandemic is not over, we're navigating it quite well with all of the strategies that Tim and Greg have laid out and that we're very bullish on that loan growth for 2022 in addition to the Provide acquisition now adding Dividend Finance to the Fifth Third family.\nMike Mayo: And then just one clarification. So clearly, you're pursuing build not buy, but part of that decision not to pursue bank deals, you said it's because of the communication of Washington to see about the regulatory scrutiny or mergers over $100 billion. That typically is holding you back some even if you wanted to.\nGreg Carmichael: Yes, we tell you if we wanted to and if we thought there was a right opportunity, another if that's out there that makes sense that's actionable, I would be very concerned as a CEO to try to introduce an opportunity right now into the regulatory environment with some of the constraints that are out there. I think on how they're thinking about mergers until I get some of those items addressed, dealt with, figured out. I just think it's going to be problematic for a period of time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Connor: You talked about how overdraft or NSF fee is lower for you guys than peers. I think it was last month and rolled out some changes. Just remind us what the impact to revenues might be this year and kind of longer term? And then is there any kind of additional changes you're thinking of making given some announcements from bigger banks as well? Thanks.\nTimothy Spence: Yes. Matt, it's Tim. Thanks. So just to recap, I mean, we talked a lot about the fact that we've been among the least reliant banks on punitive fees for a while now and about the fact that, that really was a part of about a three to four year journey that we have been on to improve the checking value proposition and then really to get out of the business of charging customers when something went wrong as opposed to charging them because we've added value and giving them the tools to manage liquidity more effectively. And it was because of all the forces you see people reacting to today.  So yes, I think we've been very clear about what's in the Momentum banking proposition. The fact that it offers the broadest suite of tools to avoid an overdraft that we talked a little bit about in the fourth quarter, the fact that we made changes in October including things like changing posting orders, increasing the de minimis negative balance threshold, lowering the limit on the number of daily occurrences. I think essentially the same things you're hearing from others today. Lastly, the -- one other item that has been on the road map that we are moving forward with is eliminating NSF fees, and we do intend to do that at the end of the second quarter, all those changes are incorporated into the 2022 fee outlook. So you should not expect an incremental negative from Fifth Third associated with the evolution of the way that we think about helping customers manage short-term liquidity.\nMatt O'Connor: And then separately, a bit of a random question. But you're a very big auto lending bank to consumers. And as we think about car prices being up so much, especially used cars. Have you thought about kind of underwriting a bit different? You've got really good disclosures in your appendix, the LTVs have come down a little bit, might go up a little bit. When I read about used car prices up 40%, 45%, I just think for myself, underwriting to that may not be a great idea. I don't know how you're thinking about that but just being a big player on that.\nRichard Stein: Yes. Thanks for the question. It's Richard. From an underwriting standpoint, we do think about how values have changed. But I think it's important to understand, we look at supply-demand dynamics for autos. I don't -- we don't think that's going to change in the near-term, certainly. And I think the dynamics around how the OEMs actually produce and sell cars are going to create a continued tightness, if you will, in terms of supply. I don't -- I think the days of the OEMs filling the factory and flooding the market with cars are done they're are going to be more discipline, that' kind of give us -- that' kind of give us more certainty around used car prices overtime. The other thing I'll add is we are a prime and super prime underwriter from an auto perspective. And so while the collateral value is important, it's the quality of the borrower that really stands to all for us, and that hasn't changed for us at all. And we continue to see the tailwinds around the consumer from a quality perspective to be strong. So, no real changes in terms of the underwriting criteria. We were mindful of supply demand dynamics and do consider what car prices will do in the future.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. And remind me the mix of new versus used car lending that you did.\nGreg Carmichael: It's 58-42 used in 2021.\nTimothy Spence: And I don't think it's ever been outside of the 60-40 one way or the other.\nMatt O'Connor: Yes.\nTimothy Spence: We live in the sort of roughly evenly balanced range.\nOperator: Now we have reached the end of our Q&A session, I would like to hand the conference back to Mr. Chris Doll for the closing remarks.\nChris Doll: Thank you, Ludy. And thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the IR department if you have any further questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "TimothySpence",
            "content": "Yes, sure. Happy to do it. So let me anchor it to the numbers. So ex PPP, as you mentioned, C&I loan growth was about 11% or on a dollar basis, it was about $4.9 billion point-to-point in the quarter. So of that, about one-third of it came from an increase in utilization on existing revolver and then a full two-third of the growth were a byproduct either of the record production we had. We had a record quarter in addition to it being a record year in both corporate banking and in the middle market or it was new clients funding up commitments that were extended in earlier quarters this year, consistent with the data we have been sharing on commitment growth. So on the utilization front, the lower end of our book tends to move in terms of utilization faster than the corporate banking side. And we did see that middle market and business banking had the best pickup in utilization rates, which is probably at least in part a byproduct to the manufacturing and logistics centric nature of the Midwest markets. But the drivers there when you talk to clients were really inventory levels. There were some tax distributions or business expansion related, people investing in CapEx or acquisitions. On the corporate banking side, it was really the big vertical, but the draws there were most concentrated in the mortgage servicer segment. On the two-thirds of the growth that came from production. I think, as Greg mentioned, they're literally basically entirely driven by the strategic investments. So on, Corporate Banking, it was industry verticals. In the middle market, it was really the sales force expansion in the Southeast through the additions of California and Texas. And then it was strong performance from Provide as they got into the run rate. In total, it really is new relationships, more than it forwards a transition to SOFR. So we added 551 new relationships in commercial in 2021, so about 30% more than our prior high mark at any one point. And I think what we feel very good about is these really aren't just loan-only relationships. They are the driver of what you saw in the strong growth we had on both treasury management and capital markets. I think if you look forward, I was looking at the bottoms-up pipelines earlier this week, and they are about 75% larger than where they were at the same time last year and almost 90% larger than the first quarter of 2019. So we feel very good about our ability to sustain the robust loan growth. And the drivers there, again, are the strategic investments. Chicago is the biggest year-over-year improver as we continue to see strength and the benefits of the synergies from the MB merger. And then its markets like Tennessee, North Florida, California and Texas in the regions. And then on the vertical side, it's the stalwart verticals for us, health care and TMT along with continued really good growth in renewables. And then as we talked about in the past, the mortgage warehouse segment that we launched recently. I think haven't been out in the market. The energy is really good there. I think there's a strong sense for us that between the investments we've made and the fact that we've really been able to focus on execution and collaboration, having had our people back in the office for longer than most and not having the distractions of merger integration or otherwise, it really has been -- it's been nice to see the pickup. Yes. I think to Jamie's point, I mean, point one, Gerard, as it relates to the way that you grow it is it's easier to grow when you have a strong tailwind, and there's no question when you look at the level of investment that's going to go into home improvement over the course of the next five to 10 years focused on sustainability. There is a really significant opportunity. I mean the Dividend's business today has been primarily on the solar panel side of the business. But in addition to that, there's storage, which is a fast-growing sector. There's energy efficiency-related investments, whether that's HVAC or Windows or green landscaping or otherwise. And then I think as we continue to see this push towards electric vehicles, there's a dynamic as it relates to high voltage currency into different parts of the homes than you needed previously. So all those categories are going to be big drivers of secular growth in the broader home improvement sector. And with dividends positioning, and the investments that have been made in this end-to-end technology platform, I think we believe they're pretty uniquely positioned to benefit and to continue to gain share there. I mean this is to call it a point-of-sale platform is almost to understate what it is. It's a fully integrated end-to-end solution that allows contractors to drive quoting to specify the sort of technical details around the installation itself. They're third-party data checks on the appropriateness of what is being installed, given the weather environment and the power generation potential and the local utility rates, which are obviously very customer-friendly, but also a good guardrail for the contractors themselves. They have APIs directly into the largest contractors CRM system. So in many cases, there isn't a third-party point of sale at all. It's just generated out of the iPad application that the contractor is using to begin with. And then all manner of downstream capabilities, including not funding loans until there's actually power coming off of the panels today that provide a really excellent customer experience. So as they come into Fifth Third, they obviously have the benefit of our balance sheet. That's one less thing that these fintech credit mono-lines otherwise would need to do in terms of recruiting bank funding partners. So we should be able to improve the product innovation velocity the way that we have with Provide bluntly. Provide's launched more products in the last six months than they had in the three years prior, okay, on the financing side.

So I think that is how we -- the first point of growth here is going to be make sure we get the talent. And we'll continue to make investments in the technology platform benefit from the secular growth. And then we're going to add capabilities that a bank can have in this case. Yes. I mean, Mike, it's Tim Spence. Hello. No, I think the supply chain issues are still real. We have many clients who say they'd like to be running at inventory levels that are above where they're at. I just think we took share this year. I mean that's the reason I anchor back to this point about our having record new relationship growth, new quality relationship growth into the commercial bank.

            "name": "James Leonard",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our strong quarterly financial results reflect focused execution throughout the bank. The reported earnings included a negative $0.03 impact from the two items noted in the release. We generated solid revenue growth, which resulted in record fee income, combined with another quarter of strong credit quality. As a result, we produced an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of over 18%. Improvements in credit quality resulted in an $85 million release to our credit reserves and an ACL ratio of 185 basis points compared to 200 basis points last quarter. Combined with another quarter of historically low net charge-offs, we had a $47 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion increased 1% sequentially, reflecting C&I loan growth, $10 million in seasonal mutual fund dividends and $18 million in prepayment penalties received in the investment portfolio, as well as a reduction in long-term debt. These items were partially offset by lower loan yields and a decline in PPP-related income, which was $36 million this quarter compared to $47 million in the prior quarter. Excluding PPP, NII increased $19 million or 2% sequentially. On the funding side, we reduced our total interest-bearing liabilities cost three basis points this quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, reported net interest margin decreased four basis points, reflecting a $2.6 billion increase in interest-bearing cash and lower loan yields, partially offset by prepayment penalties and mutual fund dividends from our investment portfolio. Excluding the impact of excess cash, NIM was flat sequentially. Total reported noninterest income increased 1% compared to the year ago quarter. As we discussed in early December, reported results included negative valuation marks totaling $22 million, attributable to a $5 million negative MSR valuation as well as a $17 million fintech investment unrealized loss recorded in securities losses that occurred since its October IPO. Similar to our previous holdings of public companies, we will exit our position at the appropriate time. Adjusted noninterest income results exclude the impact of security gains and losses, the Visa swap as well as prior period business disposition gains and losses. Adjusted noninterest income increased 4% sequentially, driven by another quarter of record commercial banking revenue. We generated record M&A advisory fees notably in our healthcare vertical, reflecting successful outcomes from our Coker and H2C teams, combined with strong business lending and syndication revenue. These items were partially offset by lower corporate bond fees. We also generated solid fee revenue growth in treasury management, card and processing and wealth and asset management, where we generated record net AUM inflows in both the fourth quarter and the full year. We were recently recognized as one of the world's best private banks for the third consecutive year by Global Finance Magazine and our results reflected. Additionally, Mortgage banking revenue decreased $51 million compared to the third quarter, which included a $12 million unfavorable impact from our decision to retain $350 million of retail production during the quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income increased 2% with improvement in every single fee caption reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year. Noninterest income represented 40% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Reported noninterest expenses decreased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily driven by lower occupancy expense as well as lower processing expense reflecting contract renegotiations. Adjusted expenses increased 2%, driven by higher performance-based compensation, reflecting strong business results from record AUM inflows and commercial loan production, elevated medical benefits due to pandemic, loan servicing expenses and continued technology investments. Our expenses this quarter included mark-to-market impacts associated with nonqualified deferred compensation of $10 million compared to less than $1 million last quarter. For the full year, total adjusted fees increased 8% compared to just 2.5% expense growth. Commercial Banking revenue increased 21%. Card and processing revenue increased 14%. Wealth and asset management revenue increased 13% and TM revenue increased 9%, offset by a $28 million reduction from lower TRA income and a 16% decline in mortgage banking. On the expense side, the largest contributor of the growth was elevated performance-based compensation, technology investments and loan servicing expenses. These items were partially offset by the actions we took about a year ago to streamline the organization, including process reengineering, vendor renegotiations, and divestitures of noncore businesses such as property and casualty insurance, HSA deposits and 401(k) recordkeeping. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 1% sequentially, including the PPP headwind. Excluding PPP, portfolio loans and leases increased 3% on an average basis and increased 5% on a period end basis. Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 1% compared to the prior quarter has continued to strengthen auto was partially offset by declines in home equity and other consumer loan balances.  Average commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 2% compared to the prior quarter reflecting growth in C&I loans. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased 4% with C&I loans up 7%. As Greg mentioned, commercial loan production was robust across the board up nearly 50% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting strong corporate and middle market banking production, which was well diversified geographically. As a result, period-end C&I loans excluding PPP increased a 11% sequentially. Revolver utilization of 33% increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Average CRE loans were down 3% sequentially with lower balances and mortgage and construction driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted by the pandemic. As we have discussed before, we continue to have the lowest CRE concentration as a percentage of total capital compared to peers.  Given the rate environment towards the end of the fourth quarter, we began investing a small portion of our excess cash with the average securities portfolio balances increasing 1% sequentially. Average other short-term investments, which includes our interest bearing cash remained elevated, reflecting continued growth in core deposits. Compared to the prior quarter commercial transaction deposits increased 5% and consumer transaction deposits increased 2%  Moving to credit, as Greg mentioned, our credit performance this quarter was once again strong, with fourth quarter net charge-offs remaining historically low. Non-performing assets declined 6% sequentially with the NPA ratio declining 5 basis points. Criticized assets declined 13% sequentially, reflecting a significant improvement from COVID high impact industries.  Additionally, criticized assets declined in virtually every region in vertical and also improved in our leverage loan portfolio. From a product standpoint, we continue to closely monitor CRE including office and hospitality exposures, given the ongoing effects of the pandemic.  Moving to the ACL, our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains stable with unemployment and main our three year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.8%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios given the continued uncertainty during the pandemic. Our ACL release this quarter came primarily from commercial reflecting the improved risk profile of the portfolio. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $960 million higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $213 million lower. While the economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to continued strength in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the uncertain environment. In addition to COVID, we continue to monitor the economic and lending implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist. Our December 31 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment.  Moving to capital, our capital levels remained strong with the CET1 ratio ending the quarter at 9.5%. During the quarter, we completed $316 million in share repurchases as part of our capital plan, which reduced our share count by 7.3 million shares. Now that we have reached our 9.5% CET1 goal, we are returning to our 2019 CET1 target of 9% based on our improved credit risk profile and the economic outlook. It is worth noting that combining regulatory capital, credit reserves and unrealized gains we have one of the highest overall loss absorbency rates among peers. As Greg mentioned, last night, we announced the strategic acquisition of Dividend Finance. Strategically, Dividend furthers our existing indirect consumer point-of-sale capabilities with a tech-forward platform. Dividend pioneered the financing model, which improves economic outcomes for customers and contractors. This helps accelerate dividend growth in the solar industry which is expected to continue growing at a double-digit CAGR over the next several years. Dividend will improve Fifth Third's loan portfolio granularity, geographic diversification and balance between consumer and commercial loans. Furthermore, while not modelled we expect to generate synergies over time in our mortgage and home equity business as well as with our existing commercial clients. The transaction is also financially compelling. In 2021, Dividend gained market share and originated over $1 billion in loans, which increased 40% compared to 2019. We expect total origination volume of around $1 billion in 2022 post close. Dividend Finance previously utilized an originate-to-sell model. And as a result, the closing of the acquisition will not include a material transfer of loan losses. However, post close, Fifth Third will retain all loan originations. Given the scalability of the business, we expect a life of loan ROA of 3% plus, ROTCE of 30% plus and an efficiency ratio below 20%. Our modelling conservatively assumes a market share consistent with dividend finances recent history, no extension of the federal solar investment tax credit, an annualized net charge offs around 130 basis points. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter and will utilize approximately 30 basis points of capital. Our long term capital priorities remain unchanged. First, deploy capital into organic growth initiatives. Then evaluate strategic non-bank opportunities, continue paying a strong dividend and finally execute share repurchases with excess capital. Given the strong loan growth and the acquisition of Dividend Finance, we currently expect to resume share repurchases sometime in the second half of the year. Moving to our current outlook, our full year guidance includes the financial impacts from Dividend Finance, which is expected to close in the second quarter. We expect full year average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021, including the expected headwinds from PPP and the Ginnie Mae forbearance loans we added throughout last year. Excluding these items, we expect total average loan growth between 10% and 11%, reflecting robust pipelines, sales force additions the dividend and provide acquisitions and only a 1% improvement in commercial revolver utilization rates over the course of the year. This should result in commercial loan growth of 12% to 13%, excluding PPP. Additionally, we expect total average consumer loan growth between 6% and 7%, excluding the Ginnie Mae loans. On a sequential basis, we expect first quarter average total loan growth of 3% to 4%, excluding PPP and Ginnie Mae loans. Including those impacts, we expect average total loans to increase 1% to 2% compared to the fourth quarter. Our outlook reflects continued strength in commercial given our production and pipelines. We expect 6% average C&I growth in the first quarter, excluding PPP. We expect CRE balances to be stable sequentially in the first quarter, and as a result, expect average total commercial loan growth of 4% to 5% sequentially, excluding PPP. We expect average consumer loan balances to increase around 1% sequentially, excluding the Ginnie Mae impacts. We provide our expectations for this portfolio in our presentation appendix. Given our loan outlook, we expect full year NII to increase 4% to 5%. It is worth noting that our outlook incorporates the impacts from the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios, which will result in a $220 million headwind next year or about 4.5 percentage points. Meaning, we would have expected close to double-digit growth in NII, if not for those portfolios, which have served their purpose to help bridge us to the more productive rate environment. Given that current rate environment, our forecast assumes growth in our securities portfolio of approximately $1 billion per quarter and includes three rate hikes beginning in May. Due to the evolving economic outlook, our forecast and balance sheet management strategies are subject to change. As a reference point, we estimate that a 25 basis point incremental rate hike would increase NII by approximately $30 million to $35 million per quarter or seven basis points of NIM when fully realized. The ultimate impact to NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing of short-term rate movements, balance sheet management strategies, including securities growth and hedging transactions and realized deposit betas. On the topic of deposit betas, our current outlook assumes a deposit beta around 13% over the first 100 basis points of rate hikes, including less than 10% for the first couple of hikes. We have updated our NII sensitivity disclosures in the presentation appendix, which now incorporates a dynamic beta repricing assumption rather than static beta approach previously utilized. The information in the appendix uses modeled approaches to estimate the impacts of various rate scenarios based on decades of historical data. These model betas are 30% for the first 100 basis point scenario and 36% for the plus 200 basis point scenario. For the first quarter, we expect NII to be down 1% sequentially, impacted primarily by day count as well as lower prepayment penalty, PPP and Ginnie Mae income, partially offset by strong loan growth. Given the January 3 forward curve did not consider a March rate hike, if the Fed were to move in March with a run-up in benchmark rates, we would expect first quarter NII to be stable sequentially. We expect adjusted noninterest income to increase 3% to 5% in 2022, reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities resulting in stronger treasury management revenue, capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue. Additionally, we expect strong processing revenue, reflecting both the economic environment and continued household growth. Mortgage revenue should improve modestly in 2022, reflecting elevated servicing revenue from MSR purchases throughout 2021 and moderating asset decay partially offset by a meaningful decrease in production revenue. We expect TRA and private equity income to be stable compared to 2021 levels. We expect first quarter adjusted noninterest income to be stable year-over-year or decline around 8% to 9% compared to the fourth quarter. Excluding the impacts of the TRA, we expect fees to be down approximately 3% sequentially, reflecting seasonal factors, a decline in private equity income and lower leasing revenue. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up around 1%, excluding the impact of dividend finance compared to 2021 or up 2% to 3%, including dividend. We expect compensation expenses to increase around 3% or so, reflecting wage pressures and sales force additions, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation in certain areas such as mortgage given the outlook for lower origination volumes. We also continue to invest in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth of around 10%, consistent with the past several years. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid-single-digits area. Our outlook also assumes we add 20 to 25 new branches in our high-growth markets, which will result in high-single-digit growth of our Southeast branch network. We expect these items to be partially offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives, reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in leasing expense given the revenue outlook and continued overall expense discipline throughout the company. We expect total adjusted expenses in the first quarter of 2022 to be up around 3% to 4% compared to the year ago quarter or up 5% to 6% compared to the prior quarter. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are also impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, we expect first quarter expenses to be down approximately 2% compared to the fourth quarter. Additionally, our first quarter expense outlook is impacted by a broader and larger special equity grant for eligible employees to reward the record performance in 2021 and to provide a retention incentive over the next several years in this competitive labor market. As a result, our full year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in expenses, resulting in more than a 1 point improvement in the efficiency ratio. Our outlook for positive operating leverage reflects continued success growing our fee-based businesses, recent acquisitions, expense discipline and strong balance sheet management. It also considers the known revenue headwinds from PPP and our Ginnie Mae portfolio. We would have guided to positive operating leverage on a stand-alone basis even without any rate hikes. We expect 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis point range and we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be in the 15 to 20 basis points range. In summary, our fourth quarter and full year results were strong. We achieved positive operating leverage in 2021 in a challenging interest rate environment, while maintaining discipline throughout the company. We have a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet, which should perform very well in a rising rate environment, we have over $30 billion of excess cash and continue to grow and diversify our fee revenues, all of which support our through-the-cycle outperformance. We are deploying capital in order to maximize long-term profitability and are committed to generating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Thanks, Erika, and welcome back to the coverage of Fifth Third. So I appreciate the question. Let me take it in two parts. So first, when it comes to the macro view and for the industry, you go back over the last 100 years, I think there's only been two years where deposits didn't grow in the industry. So I do believe that there can be deposit growth as the Fed tightens and history proves that. So when it comes to Fifth Third, the more idiosyncratic view that we have is that, we would be comfortable having up to one-third of our excess cash migrate away from Fifth Third deposit products and into more productive vehicles for those customers. So with that said, when we look at our deposit betas, our deposit pricing outlook for the rate hikes on the horizon, we're going to be very disciplined on those deposit rates. And therefore, if deposits leave, it's a very manageable outcome for us. However, I will tell you, given our strong commercial client acquisition, our strong treasury management growth and our strong household growth as we sit here today, even with balance and disciplined deposit betas, we still expect deposit growth this year at Fifth Third and that's even with continuing to run down our CD portfolio. As much as I would be comfortable with a little bit of deposit outflow, I think given our sales success, we will have deposit growth this year. I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Tim to add a little more color, but thanks for the question, Gerard. In terms of the loans and why they scream so profitably. Right now, it's offered as a 20 to 25-year term, the coupon, the customer is paying is in the 3% range. But the tax incentives are significant and allows a merchant discount to be paid and that merchant discount could add as much as 5 percentage points to the yield given that the loans end up being about a five year life. So you end up in the 22%, 23% type of federal benefit as part of the energy tax credit program. So there are some moving parts here. The yield will ebb and flow as a result of how that merchant discount plays out in the ultimate weighted average life, but that is why on the surface. It is a very profitable business more so than some of the other consumer origination channels that we have. And this is an area that we even talked about at several of the conferences in 2021 as a key challenge for Fifth Third is really improving the technology and the distribution around home equity lending and other consumer point-of-sale origination channel. Yes. As you pointed out, it's certainly a low loan-to-deposit ratio in the mid-60s right now. It's certainly far better than I think our -- at least in my career, our highest number was back in 2005. It looks like 120%. So I think the optimal ratio is probably somewhere in between. I'd like to operate the balance sheet in the 85% or so range, which is why we would be willing to have some of the more rate-sensitive deposits run off during the tightening cycle, but also and more importantly is that we do expect significant loan growth as we talked about $10-plus billion could be $13 billion to $14 billion next year. And so that's going to help give a nice notch up in the loan-to-deposit ratio, but it probably takes us a couple of years to get back to the number that we would, I think, like to operate and that would be indicative of a very productive balance sheet. Yes. We feel very confident in our ability to manage expenses. It's one of the things that's been a hallmark of the company under Greg's leadership is the expectation that every year, every area has to get more efficient. It's just a base expectation when we go through our planning and you see it in the results. So heading into this year, there's $125 million of savings that I'm highly confident we will achieve through the lean process, automation, through the branch consolidations and the vendor savings. But then as Greg pointed out, we do want to invest in our employees and in our franchise to really drive that revenue growth. So I think we've got a good approach here where we're balancing the revenue growth and sales expansion of the company while leaning out the support functions. And then to your main point of the question when it comes to inflation, wages, we have a stronger merit pool this year, and we have the special equity grant that we mentioned earlier to help improve retention, but that comes at a cost, and that is baked into our guide. And our guide was to be up 1% on a stand-alone basis. The Dividend acquisition adds 1.5 or so to the expense number, which is how we ended up in the 2% to 3% range. But as Greg said, we're really focused on the long-term performance doing the right thing in the long run. And I think our expense discipline helps drive that and it may appear to an outsider when you look at the numbers, that there's not a lot of activity there because things are fairly stable. The reality is we are driving a lot of savings, but we're choosing to reinvest those savings to improve the company for the long run. Yes, Mike, I would say that while the pandemic is not over, we're navigating it quite well with all of the strategies that Tim and Greg have laid out and that we're very bullish on that loan growth for 2022 in addition to the Provide acquisition now adding Dividend Finance to the Fifth Third family."

            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank all you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported full year net income of $2.8 billion or $3.73 per share. We delivered strong financial results throughout the year, while fully supporting our customers, our communities and our employees. We generated full-year adjusted ROTCE, excluding AOCI, of 19%. Additionally, excluding the provision benefit in excess of charge-offs, our ROTCE exceeded 16% and improved more than 130 basis points from last year, driven by record financial results throughout the franchise. We generated record revenue of nearly $8 billion in 2021, which increased 4% compared to 2020, highlighted by strength in commercial, retail and wealth and asset management. Our performance was led by record adjusted fee revenue, which increased 8%. Net interest income was stable compared to last year despite the continued environmental headwinds as we have been disciplined deploying excess cash. Full-year adjusted expenses increased just 2.5% compared to last year, reflecting disciplined expense management throughout the company. As a result of our strong financial performance, we achieved positive operating leverage, excluding security gains and losses and generated an adjusted efficiency ratio below 60%. Credit quality remained strong with historically low full-year net charge-offs of just 16 basis points. Additionally, non-performing loans and criticized assets continue to improve throughout the year, including the fourth quarter. Our credit results demonstrate our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and continued benefits from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $662 million or $0.90 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.03 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.93 per share. Our quarterly financial results reflected strong momentum in most of our businesses. We saw that improved revenues compared to the third quarter. We generated record commercial banking revenue, record treasury management revenue and record wealth and asset management revenue in the quarter. We expect the positive momentum in our business to carry forward into 2022 and beyond. In our commercial business, record loan production of $8.2 billion increased approximately 50% sequentially with record performances in both corporate banking and middle market. Despite the ongoing challenges we are hearing from our customers, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, production was broad-based across our regions and verticals. From a regional middle market perspective, we generated strong production this year in several markets, including Chicago, the Carolinas, Indiana, Georgia and our expansion markets. From an industry vertical perspective, health care, renewables, retail, technology and financial institutions all continued to outperform.\\ As result of our record production and record new quality relationships, we generated C&I loan growth, excluding PPP of 7% on an average basis or 11% on a period-end basis compared to last quarter. The acceleration of commercial loan growth at the end of 2021, our strong pipeline, new commitment growth, production anticipated from Provide and continued investments in capabilities and talent will also support accelerated loan growth in 2022. In our retail business, we once again generated consistent peer-leading consumer household growth in excess of 3% year-over-year, highlighted by our Chicago and Southeast markets. We continue to add households in every region, reflecting the ongoing success of momentum banking as well as our branch expansion and digital initiatives. Our success throughout our retail business comes down to three factors. First, we are generating smart scale in our local markets. This quarter, we opened 18 banking centers in our key Southeast MSAs, while consolidating four locations throughout our footprint. We have also closed an additional 40 locations in the month of January, primarily in legacy markets. We will continue to leverage our geospatial analytics to optimize our overall branch network, while taking into account evolving customer preferences. We continue to target a branch network allocation of approximately 35% in the Southeast by 2025. Second, we offer differentiated products and services like Momentum Banking, which includes features that enable customers to avoid overdraft fees and get access to short-term liquidity when needed. I'd like to point out with respect to unit fees we have been the lowest among peers with significant consumer banking operations for several quarters. And third, we are delivering an outstanding customer experience as shown by leading third-party surveys. We have improved in the bottom quartile five years ago to top quartile today. We are recognized as the number one bank out of the top 25 banks taking care of our customers during the pandemic. Our balance sheet earnings power remained very strong. Last night to support continued acceleration of our growth and profitability, we announced the acquisition of Dividend Finance, a leading fintech point-of-sale, consumer lender, providing solutions for a highly attractive and growing renewable energy industry. They have strong relationships with a robust contract network, offer sales and project management solutions through a state-of-the-art technology platform, and have a customer footprint focused on prime and super-prime borrowers. They have a coast-to-coast footprint with targeted growth initiatives in the Southeast. By financing consumer renewable energy solutions, combined with our existing leadership in providing renewable solutions to commercial clients since 2012, we are supporting the country's transition to a more sustainable economy and furthering our ESG leadership position among peers. As the only bank among peers that are earning a leadership score from CDP for three consecutive years, we are intensely focused on leading the transition to a sustainable future. Our focus has been recognized by several prominent ESG providers, including MSCI, which recently gave us a three-notch rating upgrade. Whereas our sustained peer-leading household growth, top quartile key metrics, balance sheet management or strong diversified fee revenues, we have established a track record of doing what we say we're going to do. Our execution ultimately produces superior, consistent and sustainable financial performance. Across all of our businesses, our strategic priorities are unchanged. We remain focused on leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation, investing to drive growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies and maintaining discipline throughout the company. Before turning it over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook, I'd like to once again thank our employees. I very much appreciate the way you have continued to raise to the occasion to support our customers, communities and each other. This is because of our frontline employees that we were able to keep within 99% of our branches opened since the onset of the pandemic. We gave a special bonus to these employees in the quarter in recognition of their extraordinary and ongoing efforts to provide essential banking services for our customers. This marks the second time during the pandemic that we have recognized the work of our frontline employees through a special bonus. In summary, we believe our strong and highly asset-sensitive balance sheet, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined management throughout the company will serve us well this year and beyond. We expect to generate positive operating leverage again for the full year in 2022 without adjusting for PPP or other known headwinds. We remain focused on growing strong relationships and managing the balance sheet with a through-the-cycle perspective to generate sustainable long-term value for our stakeholders and maintaining our position as a top-performing regional bank. With that, I'll turn over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook. John, this is Greg. I'll start off and with those activities prepared with a lot of color to your question we were expecting of course. First off, we've made significant investments over the last five years in our strategic markets in the Southeast, west Coast, Texas on verticals and talent and so forth. So we would expect to see this type of outcome as we go into last year into this year. So we're very pleased with the performance. We're very pleased with the momentum we have going into it. Once again, I think it's a byproduct of the investments we made in talent, our expansion of these geographies and just the way we've approached this business over the last five years. You're starting to see the outcomes. But Tim will give you more as the markets itself and where we're seeing the outcomes. First, thanks for the questions. Our strategy hasn't changed. It's really, as you said, it's the bolt-ons opportunities non-bank transactions, just like we did with Dividend, which we couldn't be more pleased about that acquisition and how it fits into our portfolio of opportunities strategically. But more of those type of opportunities we're going to continue to look for. So point of sale on the consumer side, in addition to that, we're going to continue to focus on wealth and asset management opportunities that might emerge. Obviously, on the cap market side, on the advisory side of the house there's other verticals that we're looking for partners in that space from an advisory perspective. So we'll continue to focus on those opportunities, the fintech plays and the advisory that fits to some of the additional verticals, wealth and asset management will be the areas of opportunity we continue to stay focused on. And when you think about a bank acquisition right now, especially given all the challenges and complexity of what we're seeing in on the regulatory front in Washington with some of the movements that are underway right now and the challenge to get a large transaction done or a bank transaction for banks over $100 billion that's out there. So it's on your mind as you think about the timing to get a transaction done. But once again, at this point right now, our focus is to be relevant in the strategic markets that we're already banking in. There's not many of these opportunities that exist right now. So once again, it's not a primary focus of ours today, and I don't see that in the near future also as we think about the rest of this year. First of all, we're always going to continue, Erika, invest in the future of this company. We're in it for the long haul. We never do anything focused on the quarter or even for a full year. So we'll continue to invest. Look at our technology investments. It's been running around 10%. You can expect we're going to continue to do that. We're also going to continue to invest in our ability to expand this franchise both geography, product sets through our verticals, capabilities, in our talent capabilities. So we'll continue to invest in those areas. Obviously, wages are another area we're going to have to continue to step up on and be aggressive on which we have been as a leader in the minimum wage going from 12% to 15% to 15% to 18%, we took that pain before most of our peers did. We saw the need to do that. So, as you think about our investment, we're going to continue to invest. But we also believe a lot of the guidance we're giving right now this year, when you think about the first 3, 4 ,5 increases on the rate side of the house, most of that will fall to the bottom line as we already got our investment structure put in place for 2022. Beyond that, we'll continue to think about our investments necessary. You can expect some of that then will start to continue to turn into future investments. But I think as you look at this year, the guidance we provided most of that would fall to the bottom line. [indiscernible]. But I do think the supply chain constraints. I think the labor shortages and so forth are here to stay for a while. I don't see that add at all as we go into the year. But I think people are adjusting. I think corporations are adjusting, I think they're figuring out ways to do things more efficiently. As Tim said, there's not a customer we talk to where labor is not an issue. There's not a customer we talked to where they would like to build more inventory faster. But I think we've just done a good job of banking these customers and taking those relationships. But it will still be a challenging environment as we move forward. But we're very optimistic in investments we've made in the geographies and people and capabilities. And we just feel like we've got -- we get the right formula right now. Yes, we tell you if we wanted to and if we thought there was a right opportunity, another if that's out there that makes sense that's actionable, I would be very concerned as a CEO to try to introduce an opportunity right now into the regulatory environment with some of the constraints that are out there. I think on how they're thinking about mergers until I get some of those items addressed, dealt with, figured out. I just think it's going to be problematic for a period of time. It's 58-42 used in 2021."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question, please press star, one on your telephone keypad. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you require further assistance, please press star, zero. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nChris Doll: Thank you Operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we\u2019ll be discussing our financial results for the third quarter of 2021. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third\u2019s performance. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning I\u2019m joined by our CEO Greg Carmichael, CFO Jamie Leonard, President Tim Spence, and Chief Credit Officer Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. I\u2019ll turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.\nGreg Carmichael: Thanks Chris, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported third quarter net income of $704 million or $0.97 per share. On a core basis, we earned $0.94 per share. Once again, we delivered strong and steady financial results while fully supporting our customers, communities and employees. During the quarter, we generated adjusted ROTCE of nearly 19%, which represents the fifth straight quarter exceeding 18%. We generated period-end C&I loan growth of 4% compared to the prior quarter, excluding the impact of PPP. Commercial loan production increased 5% from last quarter, representing the strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019. We generated strong consumer household growth of 3% compared to last year with growth in every region in our footprint, reflected in the continued success of our branch and digital initiatives, and as expected, we generated positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Our performance this quarter reflected strong business outcomes across our franchise, resulting in improved and diversified revenues. This was combined with disciplined balance sheet management, expense management, and yet another quarter of benign credit results. We closed the Provide acquisition and the sale of HSA deposits during the quarter to improve long-term growth and profitability. Provide, a leading fintech company serving healthcare practices, will further accelerate profitable relationship growth. The sale of our HSA deposits is part of our multi-year strategy to simplify the organization and prioritize investments in order to generate differentiated outcomes for our customers and shareholders. Despite continued pressure from low interest rates, adjusted PP&R increased 4% compared to the year-ago quarter, highlighting the strong results from our fee-based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial, and wealth and asset management. Excluding the impact of PPP, average total loans increased 4% compared to last quarter, reflecting strong commercial loan production as well as strength in our indirect auto and residential mortgage portfolios. Commercial loan production increased 5% sequentially with record quarters in corporate banking and middle markets. Despite some of the challenges we have been hearing from our customers, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, the strong production was led by our healthcare, renewable energy, and retail verticals, and was well diversified geographically. Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines, and retention of the client relationship all support continued loan growth. As it relates to Provide, we are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve seen so far and we are even more excited about the opportunities for continued growth. As we have previously mentioned, we expect strong origination volumes in 2022, reflecting a robust pipeline, added product capabilities, and key talent hires. Provide supports a relationship approach with approximately two-thirds of customers having either a deposit account or a payments relationship with Fifth Third. During the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses as well as historically low net charge-offs of 8 basis points, reflecting continued improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. In addition to historical low credit losses, we experienced another quarter of improvement in criticized assets and NPAs. Our criticized assets declined nearly 20%. Our NPA ratio declined 9 basis points sequentially. Our NPA and NPL ratios this quarter have reverted back to pre-pandemic levels. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs.  Our balance sheet and earnings power remain very strong. As we have said before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic non-bank opportunities, paying a strong dividend, and share repurchases. Bank acquisitions remain a lower priority.  I\u2019d like to once again thank our employees. I very much appreciate the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers, communities, and each other. I am very proud that in addition to producing strong financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and wellbeing of our communities. For our customers, we are excited to roll out Genie [ph], our new AI-driven digital assistant in the fourth quarter. This will drive targeted marketing capabilities, digital engagement, and improved customer retention. For our communities, we made a $15 million contribution to our foundation this quarter as part of our $2.8 billion commitment to accelerate racial equity, equality and inclusion in our communities.  In total, we have contributed $40 million in philanthropic support since the end of last year. We continue to make targeted investments to accelerate economic revitalization, as you may have seen in last week\u2019s announcement of Fifth Third\u2019s Neighborhood Investment Program. This innovative initiative further demonstrates our commitment to being an ESG leader in addition to other recent proof points, including [indiscernible] over $600 billion towards our $8 billion renewable energy goal to be achieved by 2025, announcing a new position as climate risk to focus on identifying, measuring and managing the physical and transition risk of our clients, and a robust transparent and peer-leading ESG disclosure. In summary, we believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues, and continued focus on disciplined management through the company will serve us well into 2022 and beyond. We expect to generate positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and also for the full year in 2021. We remain committed to generating sustainable long term value and consistently producing through the cycle top quartile results. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook.\nJames Leonard: Thank you Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today.  We are very pleased with our financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported earnings included a $21 million after-tax benefit, or $0.03 per share from the three items noted on Page 2 of the release. Our strong business performance throughout the bank is reflected in our return metrics. We\u2019ve produced an adjusted ROA of 1.32% and an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of 18.7%. Improvements in our loan portfolio credit quality resulted in a $63 million release to our credit reserves and an ACL ratio of 200 basis points compared to 206 last quarter. Combined with our historically low net charge-offs, we had a $42 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement, net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion increased 2% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefits of our balance sheet positioning, continuing benefits from PPP income, and income from our Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases. Our NII results relative to the second quarter included a $6 million reduction in PPP income, a $4 million decline in prepayment penalties in our investment portfolio, and the impact of lower earning asset yields partially offset by a higher day count and a reduction in long term debt. Our allocation to bullet and locked-out structures is currently 60% of the total investment portfolio, which is expected to continue to provide ongoing NII protection in this low rate environment. On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs another basis point this quarter to 4 basis points. With a highly asset sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion of excess liquidity, we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise while also remaining well hedged if rates remain low, given our securities portfolio and derivatives. Total reported non-interest income increased 13% sequentially, impacted by a $60 million gain associated with the disposition of HSA deposits as previously communicated. Adjusted non-interest income increased 3%, driven by strong mortgage banking, treasury management, leasing, and wealth and asset management revenues. Commercial banking revenue, which achieved record results the past two quarters, remained solid as strength in M&A advisory fees, particularly in our healthcare vertical, was more than offset by lower corporate bond fees.  Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted non-interest income increased 13% with improvement in every single caption, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year. Our total non-interest revenue was 41% of total revenue in the third quarter.  Reported non-interest expense increased 2% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the $15 million foundation contribution. Adjusted expenses were flat sequentially as an increase in marketing expense associated with Momentum banking and increased T&E expense were offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expense. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted non-interest expense increased 2% primarily driven by an increase in performance-based compensation, reflecting strong business results, servicing expenses associated with Ginnie Mae loan purchases, and the impact of the Provide acquisition. These items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiation and lower net occupancy expense. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 13% compared to just 2% expense growth.  Moving to the balance sheet, total average portfolio loans and leases declined half of a percent sequentially, including the headwind from PPP loans. Excluding PPP, average loans and leases increased 1% with period-end loans up 1.5%, pointing to positive momentum as we head into the fourth quarter.  Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 2% as continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage balances were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances. While we did not retain incremental conforming mortgage originations in the third quarter, we have elected to retain approximately $400 million of our retail mortgage production for the balance sheet in the fourth quarter and will continue to evaluate the economic trade-offs, given our balance sheet capacity in this environment.  Average commercial loans declined 2% compared to the prior quarter, due entirely to PPP forgiveness. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased around half of a percent with C&I loans up 2%. Production was robust across the board, up 5% compared to the prior quarter with both corporate and middle market banking generating record production, which was well diversified geographically. As a result, period-end C&I loans excluding PPP increased 4%. Revolver utilization of 31% was stable compared to the prior quarter; however, it is worth noting that total commitments have increased approximately $5 billion since the end of last year, driven by new client acquisition and an increase in demand from existing clients in anticipation of future business growth.  Average CRE loans were down 3% sequentially with lower balances in mortgage and construction, driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted by the pandemic, reflecting our cautious approach to those sectors.  Our securities portfolio was stable sequentially. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows but will remain patient on deploying the excess liquidity. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to begin our excess cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point level. We remain optimistic that continued GDP growth and the Fed\u2019s eventual tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive risk-return opportunities in the future.  Average other short term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, remain elevated, reflecting growth in core deposits since the onset of the pandemic, which are up 6% year-over-year.  Moving to credit, our strong credit performance this quarter once again reflects our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, prudent balance sheet management, and the continued benefit of fiscal and monetary stimulus programs and improvement in the broader economy. As Greg mentioned, the third quarter net charge-off ratio of 8 basis points was historically low and improved 8 basis points sequentially. Non-performing assets declined 15% with the NPA ratio declining 9 basis points sequentially to 52 basis points.  The decline in criticized assets reflected significant improvements in retail non-essential and leisure, consistent with the reopening of the economy and higher activity in those sectors as well as improvements in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios. We continue to focus on segments of non-owner occupied commercial real estate, particularly central business district hotels as activity has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.  Moving to the ACL, our base case macroeconomic scenario is relatively similar to last quarter, which assumes the labor market continues to improve and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% in the first quarter of 2022 and ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios; however, our ACL release was lower this quarter as the improvement in the underlying economic forecast decelerated from the second quarter. Additionally, the ACL requirement in the downside scenario worsened compared to the second quarter due to a forecasted slower pace of recovery and a larger increase in unemployment. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $788 million higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $176 million lower.  While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out, given the uncertain environment. In addition to COVID, we continue to monitor the economic and [indiscernible] implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist. Our September 30 incorporates our best estimate for the economic environment with lower unemployment and continued improvement in credit quality.  Moving to capital, our capital levels remain strong in the third quarter. Our CET-1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%. During the quarter, we completed $550 million in share repurchases which reduced our share count by 14.5 million shares compared to the second quarter. We also raised our common dividend $0.03 or 11% to $0.30 per share. Our capital plans support approximately $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021, and we continue to target a 9.5% CET-1 by June 2022.  Moving to our fourth quarter outlook, we expect average total loan balances to increase 2% sequentially, excluding the PPP headwind. Including the PPP impact, we expect average total loans to increase approximately 1%. Our outlook reflects half a point of improvement from commercial revolving line utilization, continued strength in commercial production given our record pipeline, and a continued stabilization in pay downs based on activity that we are seeing so far in October.  We expect average C&I growth of 4% to 5% excluding PPP in the fourth quarter, and CRE balances to decline around 1% or so primarily due to construction constraints. As a result, we anticipate total average commercial loan growth of around 3% sequentially, excluding PPP. We expect average total consumer loan balances to increase around 1% sequentially, including the impacts of Ginnie Mae forbearance pool purchases in our held-for-sale portfolio. We purchased $300 million during the third quarter and an additional $700 million in early October. Given our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter, assuming stable securities balances and a $17 million reduction in PPP income. Excluding PPP, we expect fourth quarter NII to be up slightly relative to the third quarter. Our guidance indicates full year 2021 NII declines less than 1% compared to full year 2020, despite no meaningful growth in investment securities balances throughout the year and an average decline in one-month LIBOR of approximately 40 basis points. We expect NIM to decline 3 to 4 basis points in the fourth quarter primarily due to loan yield compression. We expect fourth quarter fees to increase around 6% compared to the third quarter and to be up around 8% on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impacts of the TRA. This results in full-year 2021 fee growth excluding the impacts of the TRA of approximately 10% compared to 2020.  Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy resulting in a record full-year commercial banking revenue led by 20% growth in capital markets fees, record wealth and asset management revenue up double digits, and double digit growth in card and processing revenue. We expect private equity income to be in the $40 million area in the fourth quarter. Our outlook assumes a sequential decline in top line mortgage revenue of approximately 40% with roughly half of that decline due to seasonally lower fourth quarter volumes and declining spreads, and half to our decision to retain $400 million in retail production that I mentioned earlier. We expect fourth quarter expenses to be stable to up 1% compared to the third quarter, reflecting continued growth in technology investments, servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae loan purchases, and continued marketing support related to our roll-out of Momentum, offset by disciplined expense management throughout the company and initial savings beginning from our process automation program. As a result, our full-year 2021 total core revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in core expenses despite the rate environment. We will have achieved positive operating leverage in a year in which the vast majority of the industry will likely experience an erosion in efficiency.  We expect total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter to be in the 10 to 15 basis points range, which would result in full-year 2021 charge-offs of 15 basis points or so. In summary, our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long term performance horizon which has served us well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChris Doll: Thanks Jamie. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning. Operator, please open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers: Morning guys, thanks for taking the question.\nGreg Carmichael: Morning.\nScott Siefers: Just wanted to ask a couple questions on loan growth, which looks like it\u2019s coming back nicely. First, I was hoping you could talk about any differences you\u2019re seeing in demand between your larger and smaller customers. Jamie, I think you had mentioned that production, it sounded pretty strong in both corporate and middle markets, any additional color there? Then second, was just wondering if you could speak to the dynamics you\u2019re seeing in terms of book pricing and structure; in other words, changes to the competitive environment. \nGreg Carmichael: This is Greg. Let me start off, and then I\u2019ll flip over to Tim and maybe Jamie. First off, we\u2019re very encouraged with what we\u2019re seeing from a production perspective. We\u2019ve got commercial production in third quarter [indiscernible] was strong at $5.4 billion - that was up from $5.1 billion in second quarter and $5.2 billion in third quarter 2019. We expect that production to continue to be stable going into the fourth quarter, so that\u2019s encouraging. We expect average loans up 1% with PPP and 2% up without PPP, so that\u2019s some strength there. We\u2019re also seeing line utilization tick up a little bit more in our core middle market, which is nice to see that for a change.  When you think about our geographies and what we\u2019re seeing right now, from a geography perspective, North Carolina, Texas, Cincinnati, Columbus were our top four markets for commercial loan growth in Q3, which is encouraging. If you look at six regions that had all-time highs, which were very encouraging, with Chicago, Grand Rapids, Columbus, Kentucky, North Carolina and Texas, so that felt really good and we\u2019re starting to see once again some good momentum out there. Net new relationships, something we watch very carefully, brought in 419 new commercial relationships year-to-date. Most of that was in core middle market and some of that in large core, so net-net we\u2019re seeing good progress out there, good performance, encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing to date as we go into the fourth quarter and then into 2022.\nTimothy Spence: Yes, to add a few points to what Greg mentioned, I had the chance to be out in eight of our 14 regions this past quarter. I think you get really excellent color when you have an opportunity to sit with clients and with bankers. They\u2019re all feeling the shortages as it relates to labor and supply chain. We have hotel operators who are now only cleaning rooms when people leave, as an example. I visited an electronics client out west and asked to see their demo room, and there was nothing but holes in the wall. I said, where\u2019s the equipment, and they had sold all the inventory because they are struggling to get the parts in to be able to fill orders, so all those issues are still real. I think the good news is we are seeing M&A as a catalyst, we\u2019re seeing capex now as a catalyst in particular for businesses that are able to substitute equipment and automation for manual processes, and then bluntly, as Greg mentioned, I think we feel pretty confident that a lot of the improvement we\u2019re seeing is just coming from taking share. The relationship count Greg mentioned would be higher than where we were at prior to the pandemic, so we\u2019ll have taken more new relationships on board this year through nine months than we had in all of 2018 or 2019, just as an example. So there\u2019s good general pick-up there. It would be great to continue to see a little bit more activity as it relates to utilization as folks try to build inventories, and otherwise that\u2019s going to be the wildcard for us.\nGreg Carmichael: Jamie, let me add one thing. Scott, also if you look at our verticals, which I should have mentioned this, our largest production, the areas we\u2019re seeing the largest strength in right now is technology and media telecom. Our retailers and financial institutions are all doing well, so we\u2019re seeing some good momentum in those spaces. \nJames Leonard: Then Scott, to answer the second part of your question in terms of the segments, I think Greg and Tim did a nice summary there. What we\u2019re seeing from a line utilization perspective is that the middle market line utilizations are up almost 1%, whereas corporate banking continues to trend down, so quarter-over-quarter that utilization was stable, and if we want to go into the decimals, it was 31.3 at the end of June and 31.1 as we sat here on September 30, but we are starting to see more borrowing demand and pick-up in the middle market space as opposed to the corporate banking. Then in terms of pricing, while NIM came in as expected, in line with our July guide, we do have the headwind in the C&I yield portfolio because it is very competitive out there. I think for the most part, banks are competing on price and non-banks are competing on structure, so for us, the price headwind comes in just a little bit tighter spreads but also some of the reduction in the LIBOR floor, so you lose some of that excess earnings in this environment but you can perhaps recapture the yield benefit as the Fed starts to move on the front end of the curve, hopefully in the next year to 18 months, so as expected but certainly a headwind when it comes to pricing.\nScott Siefers: Yes, okay. Good, thank you very much for all the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. \nPeter Winter: Good morning. You guys have done a phenomenal job on the securities yields with the rate locks on the cash flows and the bullets, but I\u2019m wondering is this type of securities yield sustainable into next year with the rate locks continuing?\nJames Leonard: I would say, Peter, we\u2019re inoculated from the rate environment but we\u2019re not immune to it, so as you saw in the numbers this quarter and as we look out even next quarter, it is a steady grind down as we reinvest the cash flows, so that hurts the yield a bit, 10, 15 basis points or so.  If you look out on the bullets themselves, they\u2019re at a 2.65 yield with cash flows--I think we\u2019re projecting about $7 billion of cash flows in that portfolio over the next five years, so there will be a step down should rates stay where they are today. Reinvestment yields right now, I think are in the 1.70 to 1.80 range, so barring a curve steepener, it will be a slow but definitely downward trend on the portfolio yield. The good news for us is we\u2019re very well positioned and it is pretty insulated from the environment relative to how the peers have positioned their portfolios. \nPeter Winter: Okay, thanks. If I could just follow up on expenses, you\u2019ve had the benefit of those expense initiatives this year, which clearly benefited when looking at the fee income growth relative to the expense growth. Can you just talk about some of the expense opportunities going forward as we go into next year, or has a lot of the low-hanging fruit been realized, and if you could also talk about any inflation pressures looking into next year.\nJames Leonard: Sure, thanks for the question. One update we have on expense savings in our program for 2022 is that we are targeting $125 million in savings for 2022, and that\u2019s a combination of the lean process automation and intelligent operations, the branch closures - we have 42 branches closing in the first quarter of 2022, and then some smaller vendor savings bundled together, so we\u2019ve tightened the range on that bundle of savings from $100 million to $150 million to $125 million, and then obviously we\u2019re not getting into expense guide for 2022 because we\u2019ll continue to evaluate how much of those savings will be reinvested into sales force expansion on commercial, as well as wealth and asset management.  But we feel good about the progress we\u2019re making on the LPA program; in fact, if you look in the press release, buried, I think, at the bottom of Page 14 is an FTE count, and we\u2019re down a couple hundred FTE, even with adding about 100 from the Provide acquisition, and that\u2019s starting to show the benefit of that LPA savings.  We\u2019ve made progress, we\u2019ve had some success. There\u2019s about $6 million of savings in our fourth quarter forecast tied into that program, but then the $125 million for next year.\nTimothy Spence: And the headcount there doesn\u2019t even reflect the benefit from the offshore, right - the automation savings on offshore processes that were completed by JV partners, where we\u2019re, I think, north of 20% at this point of the processes that were offshore now fully automated.\nJames Leonard: The other part of your question on inflation, in terms of wage inflation and other things, we\u2019ve been able to manage through the environment from an employee and cost structure and still deliver fairly stable expenses this quarter. We continue to see opportunity to do the same while there is the wage inflation and other pressures. We do have those other opportunities ahead of us, and so perhaps some of the $125 million would be absorbed by some inflationary pressure but ultimately a moderate amount of inflation would ultimately be very positive for the bank in terms of PP&R and interest income capabilities.\nPeter Winter: That\u2019s great, thanks Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning everyone. \nGreg Carmichael: Morning Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Greg, when you look at your CET-1 ratio, you\u2019re targeting to bring it down to 9.5% by June of next year. It looks like, if I recall correctly, your required number is 7% by the Fed. What would it take for you guys to bring it down from 9.5% to something lower, or is it no, the 9.5% is set in stone and you\u2019re just not going to budge off of that?\nGreg Carmichael: Well, there\u2019s nothing set in stone, Gerard, but at the end of the day, we think that\u2019s the prudent place to be. It\u2019s multi-faceted as we think about that level. Obviously we believe we could run the bank at a much lower level, but also we watch what the market\u2019s doing, the environment we\u2019re operating in, what our peers are doing. We just think that\u2019s the prudent target point to shoot for at this point.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good, and then maybe Richard, we could talk about credit quality. Obviously your numbers, similar to some of your peers, are quite strong, particularly in the net charge-off area, and I suspect that this is unusually good and it\u2019s not sustainable, just due to normal seasoning of portfolios. How long do you think you guys could see net charge-offs stay at this extremely low level, and when do you think they start creeping up to a more normal level? I know normal is hard to define, but when do they start to creep up?\nRichard Stein: Yes Gerard, thanks for the question. Clearly we\u2019re pleased with the 8 basis points this quarter, and like you said, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to repeat. But given the economic outlook, we do expect charge-offs to be better than our through-the-cycle average, and probably certainly into \u201922 and into \u201923 for a couple reasons.  One, it\u2019s going to be simply the amount of liquidity that\u2019s out there. Two, inflation, collateral values continue to be strong, and when we run our mid-cycle stress tests, we\u2019re seeing 25 to 35 basis points as a charge-off range for the bank through \u201922 and \u201923. Now, that graph, as I said, it\u2019s a little bit lower than what we think the long term average is. If you recall, we think through-the-cycle average is somewhere between 35 and 45 basis points, but given our approach, given the way we manage the balance sheet, the way we think about client selection and underwriting, we think it\u2019s a grind through \u201922 and \u201923 back to something that feels a little bit more normal. \nGerard Cassidy: Great, appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin : Hi, thanks. Good morning.  Hey Jamie, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the portfolio structure. When you talk about the $7 billion that\u2019s going to run off over the next several years, how high are you on that part of the book, and when you\u2019re reinvesting the cash flows to keep the book flat, are you also buying back some new type of bullet structures or are you just more investing in plain vanilla today?\nJames Leonard: We\u2019ve been buying a little bit of everything when we\u2019re reinvesting. Portfolio cash flows have been running about $1.5 billion a quarter - you know, second quarter, third quarter, so depending on the day, we\u2019ve added some level 1s, we\u2019ve added some level 2s, but in total the mix hasn\u2019t really changed a whole lot. Then in terms of the bullets, over the next couple years it\u2019s a very small number in terms of total cash flow, maybe a couple hundred million, and then over years 3, 4, 5, then you start to have cash flow portfolioing. But right now, the total book of bullets, as well as the cash flowing securities, we\u2019re in a 2.75 yield, give or take, and then for the fourth quarter, yields should be a little bit better than that with a little bit of seasonal, mutual fund dividends in the N2DC [ph], plus a little bit of prepayment penalties that have occurred thus far in October.\nKen Usdin: Okay, got it. Thank you. Just a follow-up, you guys have been really taking down the long term debt footprint, which is still even outsized the majority of your interest-bearing liability costs. Just wonder, where is the level that you need to keep it at and what\u2019s the trade-offs versus the deposit base, the mix of deposits, and how much more could you potentially reduce that footprint? Thanks.\nJames Leonard: You know, we\u2019re probably at the low point in terms of the long term debt outstanding. We had a maturity in September, $850 million that we\u2019re perhaps look to replenish in the next quarter or two, but I think we\u2019re at a good spot and we\u2019re well positioned. We\u2019ve been able to utilize the excess liquidity and take advantage of the environment to deliver some savings from a cost standpoint, both from long term debt as well as running off some of the CD book that certainly behaves more like wholesale funding than the core deposit book.  I think we\u2019re in a good spot and we\u2019ve probably reached the end of the line on the long term debt, but probably have a little bit more room on the CD book to run it down a little bit more.\nKen Usdin: Okay, got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.\nJohn Pancari: Morning. Greg, you mentioned some key talent hires that should help drive loan production into 2022. Can you provide a little bit of color on the areas where you\u2019re hiring, particularly within the lending areas, and if that hiring is continuing? Thanks. \nGreg Carmichael: Absolutely, thanks for your question. Obviously the southeast markets, we\u2019ve been adding to our relationship management bankers in that market with a lot of success there. We\u2019re real pleased with the production we\u2019re seeing in that market, so we\u2019ll continue to add in that market. There\u2019s great opportunities and we run a good franchise down there, and that\u2019s obviously a focal point for our expansion. In addition to that, I would say Texas, the west coast, California, the talent we\u2019ve been able to acquire in those markets, the bankers that we\u2019ve brought on, a significant increase in bankers in those markets over the last two or three years, and we\u2019re seeing great progress from a production perspective, outstanding perspective.  Listen those were the strategies, we watch them very carefully. We invest when we see opportunities, and those areas continue to be great opportunities for us. More to come. Let me just throw it over to Tim to see if he has any color he wants to add to that.\nTimothy Spence: Yes, I think a couple other. I think Greg hit the geographic points. We also are in the process of building out a mortgage warehouse vertical - that\u2019s a good business for us. It\u2019s a business we\u2019ve been in historically but it hasn\u2019t been a point of focus, and we saw an opportunity there with some talent to go out and take some market share, so I think that\u2019s an area.  We continue to add to the renewables team and are focused on how we expand what is already, I think, a pretty strong capability there and a good track record, and then we were pleased to be able to land some really important talent into Provide post the Provide acquisition, and have now formally launched the vet vertical there for veterinarians, which I think is going to be a really good source of growth to complement the strength we already had in medical, dental, and that business line.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. All right, thank you. Then secondly, if you could just update us where you stand on your core system upgrade. Can you maybe remind us of the timing of the project and the cost that you see tied to it, and then separately, do you see any risk to the cost that you had budgeted for the upgrade, given the wage inflation dynamics? Thanks.\nJames Leonard: First off, our tech budget, let me take that first, is about $700 million, and that\u2019s been growing about 10% per year for the last five years. When you think about our core platforms, when we talk about the modernization effort, that\u2019s been going on for a couple years. You saw that with our mortgage loan origination system, the resiliency platforms we put in place, the data architecture strategy that we rolled out. Next coming up is obviously FYS core deposits. We\u2019re in the midst right now of turning on Encino, that\u2019s going extremely well and something we\u2019re very pleased with, so this is an ongoing effort. If you asked me, if it was a baseball analogy, we\u2019re probably in mid-innings here, but it\u2019s a long game and we\u2019ll continue to invest prudently.  In addition to that, if you think about our tech spend, a lot of that tech spend is focused on being able to take cost out, so lean process automation has been a great focus of our business and an area we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in. We\u2019ll continue to invest for those opportunities, we\u2019ll continue to stay focused on core platform replacement, our partnership with FIS, in fact we\u2019re their largest processing customer. If you think about how we think about that business and the integration, what we\u2019ve done with our core platform, we\u2019ve been able to manage costs very efficiently and effectively through that exercise, so we\u2019re very comfortable with what we think the new operating environment will look like from a cost perspective. But if you think about our tech spend and how we think about our business, it\u2019s really 50% keeping the business running, so to speak, 35% advancing the business, and then 15% protecting the business.\nTimothy Spence: John, it\u2019s Tim. One small point to add to that, and it came up earlier, there was a question about inflation and wages. Jamie said earlier we were immune but not inoculated on a--I\u2019m sorry, inoculated but not immune on a different point. I think here again, we raised our minimum wage to $18 an hour in 2019 - I think we were the first of the regional banks, certainly of our peer group, to have made that move, and the by-product of that is we are watching, as I\u2019m sure you are, the announcements coming out of many of our peers that they\u2019re raising their minimum wage, but they\u2019re getting to $18 an hour in nearly all cases, which is where Fifth Third is already at, and the by-product of that is a lot of that near term impact is kind of in our run rate.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. All right, thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research\nBill Carcache: Thanks, good morning. I\u2019d like to follow up on your net charge-off rate commentary. As you think about the normalization of your NCO rates off these low levels to the 25, 35 basis points in \u201922, \u201923 that you mentioned, is the level of your reserve rate currently high enough such that the trajectory is also likely to be flat to down, even as NCO rates normalize higher? Any color that you could give on that dynamic would be helpful.\nJames Leonard: Yes, I think it\u2019s a little tough to take a life of loan expected loss rate of the ACL and compare it to short term forecasts, because the loan maturities certainly are a swing factor in that. Obviously we\u2019re comfortable with our ACL at 200 basis points - it\u2019s 204 basis points excluding PPP, so yes, I\u2019m comfortable that the ACL is adequate to cover the expected losses over the life of the loans. Then when Richard\u2019s talking about those periodic charge-off levels for a point in time and with a fairly shorter duration portfolio throwing off some of those losses in the consumer side - you know, card and auto, I think we\u2019re at a good spot.\nBill Carcache: Very helpful, thank you. Then following up on the utilization commentary, to the extent that supply chain problems were to extend further into next year, how much do you think that weighs on--you know, just given the make-up of your client base, how much would that weigh on the normalization of utilization rates versus the potential for those utilization rates to continue to improve, even if those supply chain problems were to extend a bit longer?\nJames Leonard: Yes, I think we\u2019re seeing stable line utilization because of those supply chain constraints, so hopefully the worst case scenario would be stable. As we talked about in our guide, we expect a little bit of an uptick both from a seasonal and year-end positioning with our customers of about half a percent, so we\u2019ve reduced our outlook on utilization because of the supply chain and labor constraints.  From a next year perspective, hopefully they get resolved and we\u2019ll start to see inventory builds, and that should provide a little bit of a tailwind to our loan growth expectations. \nBill Carcache: Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you could dig a little bit more into some of the loan yield pressure that you were talking about earlier, and if you kind of just hold rates constant, when does that eventually flatten out?\nJames Leonard: Yes Matt, for our quarter, if you look in the tables and you look at the gross yield decline 2Q to 3Q, it\u2019s really driven by three factors. One, 2Q had elevated prepayment loan fees that get recorded in the NII, so 2Q was high, so that was a portion. You have regular re-pricing front book, back book phenomenon, and I would characterize it as three basis points or so of NIM from that. I expect that should continue into the fourth quarter. Then the other phenomenon on the LIBOR floor is more a consequence of getting through renewal season and some of the other things happening out of the second quarter, so that should dissipate, but that was, call it, a third half of that yield compression you see in the tables in the earnings release. As we look ahead, I would expect a couple BP, 2 to 3 BP headwind from C&I loan yield compression for all of those factors into the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re guiding the reported NIM down as well for the fourth quarter, similar to what we saw in the third quarter.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Then I guess beyond 4Q, is there still a fair amount of re-pricing between the back book and the front book and all that, or are you getting close to--sorry, go ahead?\nJames Leonard: No, thanks for the question. I think from a front book, back book perspective, the tailwind is the curve steepening we\u2019ve seen in the third quarter, and should that continue we\u2019ll hit that intersection. But until we get a little more lift, you do have the re-pricing effect continuing, where new loans are coming on at lower yields than the runoff and paydowns in the back book.  I think on top of that, we have done a nice job managing NII and the balance sheet through this environment, and we certainly have dry powder, whether it\u2019s through the asset sensitivity or the $33 billion of excess cash, that we could choose to deploy to mitigate those effects if need be. But for now, we still think patience is still the way to go, and therefore if there\u2019s a little bit of NIM compression along the way, that\u2019s fine. Our focus is more on the long term and delivering the best performance we can over the next five years. \nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.\nMike Mayo: Hi. You mentioned positive operating leverage in 2021 even while you spend 10% more on tech, and that you\u2019re in kind of the fourth or fifth inning of your tech transformation, so I guess the question is do you intend to continue to spend around 10% more on tech each year, and how is that changing, especially as you move off-premise as much as you are? Is there going to be a period where you have to run somewhat parallel systems and then you\u2019ll get the benefit a few years out, and more generally, how do you think about the number of tech partners that you have, and if you can quantify the number, I\u2019ll take that too.\nGreg Carmichael: Yes Mike, this is Greg. I think 10% is probably the right number for us. It\u2019s not cast in stone. As you mentioned, operating leverage, positive operating leverage, that\u2019s something we\u2019re very focused on. We delivered it, we\u2019ll deliver it in 2021. As we go into our planning process for 2022, our focus is on positive operating leverage. As I mentioned earlier, some of that tech spend is going right to process efficiencies, where we\u2019re able to take our 200-plus additional people and so forth, branch closures and things that we\u2019re working on right now on the other expense side of the house that supports that positive operating leverage, and we continue to grow fees at a really robust rate, close to 10% CAGR over the last couple years.  Net-net, positive operating leverage, something we\u2019re very focused on, believe we can continue to deliver on. In addition to that, the tech spend will roughly run around 10%-plus. If you think about the core platform modernization, we talked about the fourth or fifth inning. I think of it more as a cricket test match - it\u2019s been going on, it\u2019s going to continue to go on for quite some time. We\u2019re going to have to deal with that, but at the end of the day, I think as we put these new platforms in, we\u2019re able to do it in a very systematic way with respect to how we turn these platforms in, so it\u2019s not the big bang approach. We\u2019re able to turn it on by geography, by product line, so we\u2019re very insulated if we\u2019re having to do a big bang impact. With that said, you\u2019d have some dual system platforms that are going to be run simultaneously until we get all markets, all products converted over in the case of some of our major implementations coming up, like our core deposit platform. That\u2019s going to take a little bit of time, but at the end of the day we should be a lot more efficient, we should be able to bring through more enhancements at a different cage forward to our business. We should be able to continue to take out costs through our lean process automation and our investments in AI technology, so net-net tech is going to be a source of spend for us, in that range that I mentioned before as we go forward, but then I think we\u2019re getting very well for it. Our objective is to go head-to-head with the fintech players, the large bank competitors that we have to deal with, and be very successful, and we\u2019ve been able to do that and demonstrate that. When you think about the fintech players that are out there, we\u2019ve got the same capabilities if you look at our products like Momentum, but we\u2019ve also got 53,000 free ATMs, 1,100 banking centers, and 10,000 service personnel that they don\u2019t have, and we\u2019ve got the core relationships.  So net-net, we\u2019ll continue to stay focused, but that\u2019s kind of the range we\u2019re going to operate in. \nMike Mayo: That\u2019s helpful. Just one more follow-up. One simple thought - I mean, there\u2019s a debate of how much banks should keep on premise versus off-premise. Clearly you\u2019re going more in the off-premise direction, and it seems like you\u2019re accelerating that. What was the tipping point, what was the biggest factor to say, you know what, we want to have more of the open architecture be off-premise, even though some other banks are saying we want to keep a lot on-premise?\nGreg Carmichael: You know, I think we intend to transition. Basically, we shed 90% on-premise, and you think about that, sort of the next five years as we look at this, that\u2019s going to shift, as you mentioned before, so 90% on-premise is going to shift to roughly 90% off-premise. Seventy percent of that will be hosted in a private cloud. When you think about platforms like FYS and C&F are all going to be private clouds, in the public cloud AWS about 20%, so you think about the shift, 90% will be an off-premise model and roughly 70% private, 20% public.\nMike Mayo: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW.\nDavid Konrad: Hey, I was hoping you could help us out with if there\u2019s any constraint limitations on the balance sheet, meaning as we look at our earnings models over the next couple years and redeploy a lot of the excess liquidity, just wondering, some of your peers have mentioned maybe 30% of earning assets would be the limit of securities, regardless of rate. Just wondering if you thought about a constraint on the securities book, and then also embedded in the securities book, the CMBS portfolio has kind of crept up - now it\u2019s just under 60% of the available for sale. Didn\u2019t know if there--you know, it\u2019s all agency or predominantly agency, but didn\u2019t know if there\u2019s a concentration limit that you\u2019d have on that portfolio as well. Thank you.\nJames Leonard: Yes, thanks for the question, David. The short answer is that when we look at the excess liquidity, call it $30 billion, we expect a third of it to go into the securities portfolio, a third of it into loans, a third of it, we think while the deposits in the banking system may not decline, we do expect those deposits to find a more productive home, perhaps money market funds or other investment vehicles. For us, we\u2019re running at 18% or so in the securities book as a percent of total assets, so if we take, call it $10 billion of the excess liquidity and put it into the book, we\u2019re at 23, 24%. That\u2019s where I\u2019d like to operate, is somewhere 23 to 25% of total assets, but it\u2019s not a capacity constraint. It\u2019s more--I think given the environment, that\u2019s a more productive place to be. In terms of the CMBS, I think the heart of your question is what is the non-agency CMBS portion of the portfolio, and that\u2019s $3.8 billion or so, and again for us it\u2019s super senior tranches. We feel very good about the credit enhancement, 30%-plus there, so not a large credit risk position to have, whereas the rest of the CMBS book would be agency guaranteed. \nDavid Konrad: Great, thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nA - Greg Carmichael: Thank you Angie, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any further questions. \nOperator: Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Timothy Spence",
            "content": "Yes, to add a few points to what Greg mentioned, I had the chance to be out in eight of our 14 regions this past quarter. I think you get really excellent color when you have an opportunity to sit with clients and with bankers. They're all feeling the shortages as it relates to labor and supply chain. We have hotel operators who are now only cleaning rooms when people leave, as an example. I visited an electronics client out west and asked to see their demo room, and there was nothing but holes in the wall. I said, where's the equipment, and they had sold all the inventory because they are struggling to get the parts in to be able to fill orders, so all those issues are still real. I think the good news is we are seeing M&A as a catalyst, we're seeing capex now as a catalyst in particular for businesses that are able to substitute equipment and automation for manual processes, and then bluntly, as Greg mentioned, I think we feel pretty confident that a lot of the improvement we're seeing is just coming from taking share. The relationship count Greg mentioned would be higher than where we were at prior to the pandemic, so we'll have taken more new relationships on board this year through nine months than we had in all of 2018 or 2019, just as an example. So there's good general pick-up there. It would be great to continue to see a little bit more activity as it relates to utilization as folks try to build inventories, and otherwise that's going to be the wildcard for us. And the headcount there doesn't even reflect the benefit from the offshore, right - the automation savings on offshore processes that were completed by JV partners, where we're, I think, north of 20% at this point of the processes that were offshore now fully automated. Yes, I think a couple other. I think Greg hit the geographic points. We also are in the process of building out a mortgage warehouse vertical - that's a good business for us. It's a business we've been in historically but it hasn't been a point of focus, and we saw an opportunity there with some talent to go out and take some market share, so I think that's an area.  We continue to add to the renewables team and are focused on how we expand what is already, I think, a pretty strong capability there and a good track record, and then we were pleased to be able to land some really important talent into Provide post the Provide acquisition, and have now formally launched the vet vertical there for veterinarians, which I think is going to be a really good source of growth to complement the strength we already had in medical, dental, and that business line. John, it's Tim. One small point to add to that, and it came up earlier, there was a question about inflation and wages. Jamie said earlier we were immune but not inoculated on a--I'm sorry, inoculated but not immune on a different point. I think here again, we raised our minimum wage to $18 an hour in 2019 - I think we were the first of the regional banks, certainly of our peer group, to have made that move, and the by-product of that is we are watching, as I'm sure you are, the announcements coming out of many of our peers that they're raising their minimum wage, but they're getting to $18 an hour in nearly all cases, which is where Fifth Third is already at, and the by-product of that is a lot of that near term impact is kind of in our run rate."

            "content": "Yes Gerard, thanks for the question. Clearly we're pleased with the 8 basis points this quarter, and like you said, we don't think that's going to repeat. But given the economic outlook, we do expect charge-offs to be better than our through-the-cycle average, and probably certainly into '22 and into '23 for a couple reasons.  One, it's going to be simply the amount of liquidity that's out there. Two, inflation, collateral values continue to be strong, and when we run our mid-cycle stress tests, we're seeing 25 to 35 basis points as a charge-off range for the bank through '22 and '23. Now, that graph, as I said, it's a little bit lower than what we think the long term average is. If you recall, we think through-the-cycle average is somewhere between 35 and 45 basis points, but given our approach, given the way we manage the balance sheet, the way we think about client selection and underwriting, we think it's a grind through '22 and '23 back to something that feels a little bit more normal."

            "name": "James Leonard",
            "content": "Thank you Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today.  We are very pleased with our financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported earnings included a $21 million after-tax benefit, or $0.03 per share from the three items noted on Page 2 of the release. Our strong business performance throughout the bank is reflected in our return metrics. We've produced an adjusted ROA of 1.32% and an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of 18.7%. Improvements in our loan portfolio credit quality resulted in a $63 million release to our credit reserves and an ACL ratio of 200 basis points compared to 206 last quarter. Combined with our historically low net charge-offs, we had a $42 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement, net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion increased 2% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefits of our balance sheet positioning, continuing benefits from PPP income, and income from our Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases. Our NII results relative to the second quarter included a $6 million reduction in PPP income, a $4 million decline in prepayment penalties in our investment portfolio, and the impact of lower earning asset yields partially offset by a higher day count and a reduction in long term debt. Our allocation to bullet and locked-out structures is currently 60% of the total investment portfolio, which is expected to continue to provide ongoing NII protection in this low rate environment. On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs another basis point this quarter to 4 basis points. With a highly asset sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion of excess liquidity, we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise while also remaining well hedged if rates remain low, given our securities portfolio and derivatives. Total reported non-interest income increased 13% sequentially, impacted by a $60 million gain associated with the disposition of HSA deposits as previously communicated. Adjusted non-interest income increased 3%, driven by strong mortgage banking, treasury management, leasing, and wealth and asset management revenues. Commercial banking revenue, which achieved record results the past two quarters, remained solid as strength in M&A advisory fees, particularly in our healthcare vertical, was more than offset by lower corporate bond fees.  Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted non-interest income increased 13% with improvement in every single caption, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year. Our total non-interest revenue was 41% of total revenue in the third quarter.  Reported non-interest expense increased 2% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the $15 million foundation contribution. Adjusted expenses were flat sequentially as an increase in marketing expense associated with Momentum banking and increased T&E expense were offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expense. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted non-interest expense increased 2% primarily driven by an increase in performance-based compensation, reflecting strong business results, servicing expenses associated with Ginnie Mae loan purchases, and the impact of the Provide acquisition. These items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiation and lower net occupancy expense. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 13% compared to just 2% expense growth.  Moving to the balance sheet, total average portfolio loans and leases declined half of a percent sequentially, including the headwind from PPP loans. Excluding PPP, average loans and leases increased 1% with period-end loans up 1.5%, pointing to positive momentum as we head into the fourth quarter.  Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 2% as continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage balances were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances. While we did not retain incremental conforming mortgage originations in the third quarter, we have elected to retain approximately $400 million of our retail mortgage production for the balance sheet in the fourth quarter and will continue to evaluate the economic trade-offs, given our balance sheet capacity in this environment.  Average commercial loans declined 2% compared to the prior quarter, due entirely to PPP forgiveness. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased around half of a percent with C&I loans up 2%. Production was robust across the board, up 5% compared to the prior quarter with both corporate and middle market banking generating record production, which was well diversified geographically. As a result, period-end C&I loans excluding PPP increased 4%. Revolver utilization of 31% was stable compared to the prior quarter; however, it is worth noting that total commitments have increased approximately $5 billion since the end of last year, driven by new client acquisition and an increase in demand from existing clients in anticipation of future business growth.  Average CRE loans were down 3% sequentially with lower balances in mortgage and construction, driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted by the pandemic, reflecting our cautious approach to those sectors.  Our securities portfolio was stable sequentially. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows but will remain patient on deploying the excess liquidity. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to begin our excess cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point level. We remain optimistic that continued GDP growth and the Fed's eventual tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive risk-return opportunities in the future.  Average other short term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, remain elevated, reflecting growth in core deposits since the onset of the pandemic, which are up 6% year-over-year.  Moving to credit, our strong credit performance this quarter once again reflects our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, prudent balance sheet management, and the continued benefit of fiscal and monetary stimulus programs and improvement in the broader economy. As Greg mentioned, the third quarter net charge-off ratio of 8 basis points was historically low and improved 8 basis points sequentially. Non-performing assets declined 15% with the NPA ratio declining 9 basis points sequentially to 52 basis points.  The decline in criticized assets reflected significant improvements in retail non-essential and leisure, consistent with the reopening of the economy and higher activity in those sectors as well as improvements in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios. We continue to focus on segments of non-owner occupied commercial real estate, particularly central business district hotels as activity has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.  Moving to the ACL, our base case macroeconomic scenario is relatively similar to last quarter, which assumes the labor market continues to improve and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% in the first quarter of 2022 and ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios; however, our ACL release was lower this quarter as the improvement in the underlying economic forecast decelerated from the second quarter. Additionally, the ACL requirement in the downside scenario worsened compared to the second quarter due to a forecasted slower pace of recovery and a larger increase in unemployment. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $788 million higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $176 million lower.  While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out, given the uncertain environment. In addition to COVID, we continue to monitor the economic and [indiscernible] implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist. Our September 30 incorporates our best estimate for the economic environment with lower unemployment and continued improvement in credit quality.  Moving to capital, our capital levels remain strong in the third quarter. Our CET-1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%. During the quarter, we completed $550 million in share repurchases which reduced our share count by 14.5 million shares compared to the second quarter. We also raised our common dividend $0.03 or 11% to $0.30 per share. Our capital plans support approximately $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021, and we continue to target a 9.5% CET-1 by June 2022.  Moving to our fourth quarter outlook, we expect average total loan balances to increase 2% sequentially, excluding the PPP headwind. Including the PPP impact, we expect average total loans to increase approximately 1%. Our outlook reflects half a point of improvement from commercial revolving line utilization, continued strength in commercial production given our record pipeline, and a continued stabilization in pay downs based on activity that we are seeing so far in October.  We expect average C&I growth of 4% to 5% excluding PPP in the fourth quarter, and CRE balances to decline around 1% or so primarily due to construction constraints. As a result, we anticipate total average commercial loan growth of around 3% sequentially, excluding PPP. We expect average total consumer loan balances to increase around 1% sequentially, including the impacts of Ginnie Mae forbearance pool purchases in our held-for-sale portfolio. We purchased $300 million during the third quarter and an additional $700 million in early October. Given our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter, assuming stable securities balances and a $17 million reduction in PPP income. Excluding PPP, we expect fourth quarter NII to be up slightly relative to the third quarter. Our guidance indicates full year 2021 NII declines less than 1% compared to full year 2020, despite no meaningful growth in investment securities balances throughout the year and an average decline in one-month LIBOR of approximately 40 basis points. We expect NIM to decline 3 to 4 basis points in the fourth quarter primarily due to loan yield compression. We expect fourth quarter fees to increase around 6% compared to the third quarter and to be up around 8% on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impacts of the TRA. This results in full-year 2021 fee growth excluding the impacts of the TRA of approximately 10% compared to 2020.  Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy resulting in a record full-year commercial banking revenue led by 20% growth in capital markets fees, record wealth and asset management revenue up double digits, and double digit growth in card and processing revenue. We expect private equity income to be in the $40 million area in the fourth quarter. Our outlook assumes a sequential decline in top line mortgage revenue of approximately 40% with roughly half of that decline due to seasonally lower fourth quarter volumes and declining spreads, and half to our decision to retain $400 million in retail production that I mentioned earlier. We expect fourth quarter expenses to be stable to up 1% compared to the third quarter, reflecting continued growth in technology investments, servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae loan purchases, and continued marketing support related to our roll-out of Momentum, offset by disciplined expense management throughout the company and initial savings beginning from our process automation program. As a result, our full-year 2021 total core revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in core expenses despite the rate environment. We will have achieved positive operating leverage in a year in which the vast majority of the industry will likely experience an erosion in efficiency.  We expect total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter to be in the 10 to 15 basis points range, which would result in full-year 2021 charge-offs of 15 basis points or so. In summary, our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long term performance horizon which has served us well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Then Scott, to answer the second part of your question in terms of the segments, I think Greg and Tim did a nice summary there. What we're seeing from a line utilization perspective is that the middle market line utilizations are up almost 1%, whereas corporate banking continues to trend down, so quarter-over-quarter that utilization was stable, and if we want to go into the decimals, it was 31.3 at the end of June and 31.1 as we sat here on September 30, but we are starting to see more borrowing demand and pick-up in the middle market space as opposed to the corporate banking. Then in terms of pricing, while NIM came in as expected, in line with our July guide, we do have the headwind in the C&I yield portfolio because it is very competitive out there. I think for the most part, banks are competing on price and non-banks are competing on structure, so for us, the price headwind comes in just a little bit tighter spreads but also some of the reduction in the LIBOR floor, so you lose some of that excess earnings in this environment but you can perhaps recapture the yield benefit as the Fed starts to move on the front end of the curve, hopefully in the next year to 18 months, so as expected but certainly a headwind when it comes to pricing. I would say, Peter, we're inoculated from the rate environment but we're not immune to it, so as you saw in the numbers this quarter and as we look out even next quarter, it is a steady grind down as we reinvest the cash flows, so that hurts the yield a bit, 10, 15 basis points or so.  If you look out on the bullets themselves, they're at a 2.65 yield with cash flows--I think we're projecting about $7 billion of cash flows in that portfolio over the next five years, so there will be a step down should rates stay where they are today. Reinvestment yields right now, I think are in the 1.70 to 1.80 range, so barring a curve steepener, it will be a slow but definitely downward trend on the portfolio yield. The good news for us is we're very well positioned and it is pretty insulated from the environment relative to how the peers have positioned their portfolios. Sure, thanks for the question. One update we have on expense savings in our program for 2022 is that we are targeting $125 million in savings for 2022, and that's a combination of the lean process automation and intelligent operations, the branch closures - we have 42 branches closing in the first quarter of 2022, and then some smaller vendor savings bundled together, so we've tightened the range on that bundle of savings from $100 million to $150 million to $125 million, and then obviously we're not getting into expense guide for 2022 because we'll continue to evaluate how much of those savings will be reinvested into sales force expansion on commercial, as well as wealth and asset management.  But we feel good about the progress we're making on the LPA program; in fact, if you look in the press release, buried, I think, at the bottom of Page 14 is an FTE count, and we're down a couple hundred FTE, even with adding about 100 from the Provide acquisition, and that's starting to show the benefit of that LPA savings.  We've made progress, we've had some success. There's about $6 million of savings in our fourth quarter forecast tied into that program, but then the $125 million for next year. The other part of your question on inflation, in terms of wage inflation and other things, we've been able to manage through the environment from an employee and cost structure and still deliver fairly stable expenses this quarter. We continue to see opportunity to do the same while there is the wage inflation and other pressures. We do have those other opportunities ahead of us, and so perhaps some of the $125 million would be absorbed by some inflationary pressure but ultimately a moderate amount of inflation would ultimately be very positive for the bank in terms of PP&R and interest income capabilities. We've been buying a little bit of everything when we're reinvesting. Portfolio cash flows have been running about $1.5 billion a quarter - you know, second quarter, third quarter, so depending on the day, we've added some level 1s, we've added some level 2s, but in total the mix hasn't really changed a whole lot. Then in terms of the bullets, over the next couple years it's a very small number in terms of total cash flow, maybe a couple hundred million, and then over years 3, 4, 5, then you start to have cash flow portfolioing. But right now, the total book of bullets, as well as the cash flowing securities, we're in a 2.75 yield, give or take, and then for the fourth quarter, yields should be a little bit better than that with a little bit of seasonal, mutual fund dividends in the N2DC [ph], plus a little bit of prepayment penalties that have occurred thus far in October. You know, we're probably at the low point in terms of the long term debt outstanding. We had a maturity in September, $850 million that we're perhaps look to replenish in the next quarter or two, but I think we're at a good spot and we're well positioned. We've been able to utilize the excess liquidity and take advantage of the environment to deliver some savings from a cost standpoint, both from long term debt as well as running off some of the CD book that certainly behaves more like wholesale funding than the core deposit book.  I think we're in a good spot and we've probably reached the end of the line on the long term debt, but probably have a little bit more room on the CD book to run it down a little bit more. First off, our tech budget, let me take that first, is about $700 million, and that's been growing about 10% per year for the last five years. When you think about our core platforms, when we talk about the modernization effort, that's been going on for a couple years. You saw that with our mortgage loan origination system, the resiliency platforms we put in place, the data architecture strategy that we rolled out. Next coming up is obviously FYS core deposits. We're in the midst right now of turning on Encino, that's going extremely well and something we're very pleased with, so this is an ongoing effort. If you asked me, if it was a baseball analogy, we're probably in mid-innings here, but it's a long game and we'll continue to invest prudently.  In addition to that, if you think about our tech spend, a lot of that tech spend is focused on being able to take cost out, so lean process automation has been a great focus of our business and an area we've made a lot of progress in. We'll continue to invest for those opportunities, we'll continue to stay focused on core platform replacement, our partnership with FIS, in fact we're their largest processing customer. If you think about how we think about that business and the integration, what we've done with our core platform, we've been able to manage costs very efficiently and effectively through that exercise, so we're very comfortable with what we think the new operating environment will look like from a cost perspective. But if you think about our tech spend and how we think about our business, it's really 50% keeping the business running, so to speak, 35% advancing the business, and then 15% protecting the business. Yes, I think it's a little tough to take a life of loan expected loss rate of the ACL and compare it to short term forecasts, because the loan maturities certainly are a swing factor in that. Obviously we're comfortable with our ACL at 200 basis points - it's 204 basis points excluding PPP, so yes, I'm comfortable that the ACL is adequate to cover the expected losses over the life of the loans. Then when Richard's talking about those periodic charge-off levels for a point in time and with a fairly shorter duration portfolio throwing off some of those losses in the consumer side - you know, card and auto, I think we're at a good spot. Yes, I think we're seeing stable line utilization because of those supply chain constraints, so hopefully the worst case scenario would be stable. As we talked about in our guide, we expect a little bit of an uptick both from a seasonal and year-end positioning with our customers of about half a percent, so we've reduced our outlook on utilization because of the supply chain and labor constraints.  From a next year perspective, hopefully they get resolved and we'll start to see inventory builds, and that should provide a little bit of a tailwind to our loan growth expectations. Yes Matt, for our quarter, if you look in the tables and you look at the gross yield decline 2Q to 3Q, it's really driven by three factors. One, 2Q had elevated prepayment loan fees that get recorded in the NII, so 2Q was high, so that was a portion. You have regular re-pricing front book, back book phenomenon, and I would characterize it as three basis points or so of NIM from that. I expect that should continue into the fourth quarter. Then the other phenomenon on the LIBOR floor is more a consequence of getting through renewal season and some of the other things happening out of the second quarter, so that should dissipate, but that was, call it, a third half of that yield compression you see in the tables in the earnings release. As we look ahead, I would expect a couple BP, 2 to 3 BP headwind from C&I loan yield compression for all of those factors into the fourth quarter, and that's why we're guiding the reported NIM down as well for the fourth quarter, similar to what we saw in the third quarter. No, thanks for the question. I think from a front book, back book perspective, the tailwind is the curve steepening we've seen in the third quarter, and should that continue we'll hit that intersection. But until we get a little more lift, you do have the re-pricing effect continuing, where new loans are coming on at lower yields than the runoff and paydowns in the back book.  I think on top of that, we have done a nice job managing NII and the balance sheet through this environment, and we certainly have dry powder, whether it's through the asset sensitivity or the $33 billion of excess cash, that we could choose to deploy to mitigate those effects if need be. But for now, we still think patience is still the way to go, and therefore if there's a little bit of NIM compression along the way, that's fine. Our focus is more on the long term and delivering the best performance we can over the next five years. Yes, thanks for the question, David. The short answer is that when we look at the excess liquidity, call it $30 billion, we expect a third of it to go into the securities portfolio, a third of it into loans, a third of it, we think while the deposits in the banking system may not decline, we do expect those deposits to find a more productive home, perhaps money market funds or other investment vehicles. For us, we're running at 18% or so in the securities book as a percent of total assets, so if we take, call it $10 billion of the excess liquidity and put it into the book, we're at 23, 24%. That's where I'd like to operate, is somewhere 23 to 25% of total assets, but it's not a capacity constraint. It's more--I think given the environment, that's a more productive place to be. In terms of the CMBS, I think the heart of your question is what is the non-agency CMBS portion of the portfolio, and that's $3.8 billion or so, and again for us it's super senior tranches. We feel very good about the credit enhancement, 30%-plus there, so not a large credit risk position to have, whereas the rest of the CMBS book would be agency guaranteed."

            "name": "Greg Carmichael",
            "content": "Thanks Chris, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported third quarter net income of $704 million or $0.97 per share. On a core basis, we earned $0.94 per share. Once again, we delivered strong and steady financial results while fully supporting our customers, communities and employees. During the quarter, we generated adjusted ROTCE of nearly 19%, which represents the fifth straight quarter exceeding 18%. We generated period-end C&I loan growth of 4% compared to the prior quarter, excluding the impact of PPP. Commercial loan production increased 5% from last quarter, representing the strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019. We generated strong consumer household growth of 3% compared to last year with growth in every region in our footprint, reflected in the continued success of our branch and digital initiatives, and as expected, we generated positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Our performance this quarter reflected strong business outcomes across our franchise, resulting in improved and diversified revenues. This was combined with disciplined balance sheet management, expense management, and yet another quarter of benign credit results. We closed the Provide acquisition and the sale of HSA deposits during the quarter to improve long-term growth and profitability. Provide, a leading fintech company serving healthcare practices, will further accelerate profitable relationship growth. The sale of our HSA deposits is part of our multi-year strategy to simplify the organization and prioritize investments in order to generate differentiated outcomes for our customers and shareholders. Despite continued pressure from low interest rates, adjusted PP&R increased 4% compared to the year-ago quarter, highlighting the strong results from our fee-based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial, and wealth and asset management. Excluding the impact of PPP, average total loans increased 4% compared to last quarter, reflecting strong commercial loan production as well as strength in our indirect auto and residential mortgage portfolios. Commercial loan production increased 5% sequentially with record quarters in corporate banking and middle markets. Despite some of the challenges we have been hearing from our customers, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, the strong production was led by our healthcare, renewable energy, and retail verticals, and was well diversified geographically. Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines, and retention of the client relationship all support continued loan growth. As it relates to Provide, we are very pleased with the progress we've seen so far and we are even more excited about the opportunities for continued growth. As we have previously mentioned, we expect strong origination volumes in 2022, reflecting a robust pipeline, added product capabilities, and key talent hires. Provide supports a relationship approach with approximately two-thirds of customers having either a deposit account or a payments relationship with Fifth Third. During the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses as well as historically low net charge-offs of 8 basis points, reflecting continued improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. In addition to historical low credit losses, we experienced another quarter of improvement in criticized assets and NPAs. Our criticized assets declined nearly 20%. Our NPA ratio declined 9 basis points sequentially. Our NPA and NPL ratios this quarter have reverted back to pre-pandemic levels. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs.  Our balance sheet and earnings power remain very strong. As we have said before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic non-bank opportunities, paying a strong dividend, and share repurchases. Bank acquisitions remain a lower priority.  I'd like to once again thank our employees. I very much appreciate the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers, communities, and each other. I am very proud that in addition to producing strong financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and wellbeing of our communities. For our customers, we are excited to roll out Genie [ph], our new AI-driven digital assistant in the fourth quarter. This will drive targeted marketing capabilities, digital engagement, and improved customer retention. For our communities, we made a $15 million contribution to our foundation this quarter as part of our $2.8 billion commitment to accelerate racial equity, equality and inclusion in our communities.  In total, we have contributed $40 million in philanthropic support since the end of last year. We continue to make targeted investments to accelerate economic revitalization, as you may have seen in last week's announcement of Fifth Third's Neighborhood Investment Program. This innovative initiative further demonstrates our commitment to being an ESG leader in addition to other recent proof points, including [indiscernible] over $600 billion towards our $8 billion renewable energy goal to be achieved by 2025, announcing a new position as climate risk to focus on identifying, measuring and managing the physical and transition risk of our clients, and a robust transparent and peer-leading ESG disclosure. In summary, we believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues, and continued focus on disciplined management through the company will serve us well into 2022 and beyond. We expect to generate positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and also for the full year in 2021. We remain committed to generating sustainable long term value and consistently producing through the cycle top quartile results. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook. Morning. This is Greg. Let me start off, and then I'll flip over to Tim and maybe Jamie. First off, we're very encouraged with what we're seeing from a production perspective. We've got commercial production in third quarter [indiscernible] was strong at $5.4 billion - that was up from $5.1 billion in second quarter and $5.2 billion in third quarter 2019. We expect that production to continue to be stable going into the fourth quarter, so that's encouraging. We expect average loans up 1% with PPP and 2% up without PPP, so that's some strength there. We're also seeing line utilization tick up a little bit more in our core middle market, which is nice to see that for a change.  When you think about our geographies and what we're seeing right now, from a geography perspective, North Carolina, Texas, Cincinnati, Columbus were our top four markets for commercial loan growth in Q3, which is encouraging. If you look at six regions that had all-time highs, which were very encouraging, with Chicago, Grand Rapids, Columbus, Kentucky, North Carolina and Texas, so that felt really good and we're starting to see once again some good momentum out there. Net new relationships, something we watch very carefully, brought in 419 new commercial relationships year-to-date. Most of that was in core middle market and some of that in large core, so net-net we're seeing good progress out there, good performance, encouraged by what we're seeing to date as we go into the fourth quarter and then into 2022. Jamie, let me add one thing. Scott, also if you look at our verticals, which I should have mentioned this, our largest production, the areas we're seeing the largest strength in right now is technology and media telecom. Our retailers and financial institutions are all doing well, so we're seeing some good momentum in those spaces. Morning Gerard. Well, there's nothing set in stone, Gerard, but at the end of the day, we think that's the prudent place to be. It's multi-faceted as we think about that level. Obviously we believe we could run the bank at a much lower level, but also we watch what the market's doing, the environment we're operating in, what our peers are doing. We just think that's the prudent target point to shoot for at this point. Absolutely, thanks for your question. Obviously the southeast markets, we've been adding to our relationship management bankers in that market with a lot of success there. We're real pleased with the production we're seeing in that market, so we'll continue to add in that market. There's great opportunities and we run a good franchise down there, and that's obviously a focal point for our expansion. In addition to that, I would say Texas, the west coast, California, the talent we've been able to acquire in those markets, the bankers that we've brought on, a significant increase in bankers in those markets over the last two or three years, and we're seeing great progress from a production perspective, outstanding perspective.  Listen those were the strategies, we watch them very carefully. We invest when we see opportunities, and those areas continue to be great opportunities for us. More to come. Let me just throw it over to Tim to see if he has any color he wants to add to that. Yes Mike, this is Greg. I think 10% is probably the right number for us. It's not cast in stone. As you mentioned, operating leverage, positive operating leverage, that's something we're very focused on. We delivered it, we'll deliver it in 2021. As we go into our planning process for 2022, our focus is on positive operating leverage. As I mentioned earlier, some of that tech spend is going right to process efficiencies, where we're able to take our 200-plus additional people and so forth, branch closures and things that we're working on right now on the other expense side of the house that supports that positive operating leverage, and we continue to grow fees at a really robust rate, close to 10% CAGR over the last couple years.  Net-net, positive operating leverage, something we're very focused on, believe we can continue to deliver on. In addition to that, the tech spend will roughly run around 10%-plus. If you think about the core platform modernization, we talked about the fourth or fifth inning. I think of it more as a cricket test match - it's been going on, it's going to continue to go on for quite some time. We're going to have to deal with that, but at the end of the day, I think as we put these new platforms in, we're able to do it in a very systematic way with respect to how we turn these platforms in, so it's not the big bang approach. We're able to turn it on by geography, by product line, so we're very insulated if we're having to do a big bang impact. With that said, you'd have some dual system platforms that are going to be run simultaneously until we get all markets, all products converted over in the case of some of our major implementations coming up, like our core deposit platform. That's going to take a little bit of time, but at the end of the day we should be a lot more efficient, we should be able to bring through more enhancements at a different cage forward to our business. We should be able to continue to take out costs through our lean process automation and our investments in AI technology, so net-net tech is going to be a source of spend for us, in that range that I mentioned before as we go forward, but then I think we're getting very well for it. Our objective is to go head-to-head with the fintech players, the large bank competitors that we have to deal with, and be very successful, and we've been able to do that and demonstrate that. When you think about the fintech players that are out there, we've got the same capabilities if you look at our products like Momentum, but we've also got 53,000 free ATMs, 1,100 banking centers, and 10,000 service personnel that they don't have, and we've got the core relationships.  So net-net, we'll continue to stay focused, but that's kind of the range we're going to operate in. You know, I think we intend to transition. Basically, we shed 90% on-premise, and you think about that, sort of the next five years as we look at this, that's going to shift, as you mentioned before, so 90% on-premise is going to shift to roughly 90% off-premise. Seventy percent of that will be hosted in a private cloud. When you think about platforms like FYS and C&F are all going to be private clouds, in the public cloud AWS about 20%, so you think about the shift, 90% will be an off-premise model and roughly 70% private, 20% public."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nChris Doll: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will be discussing our financial results for the second quarter of 2021. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, as well as information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined by our CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Jamie Leonard; President, Tim Spence; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Jamie, we will open the call for questions. Let me turn the call over to Greg now for his comments.\nGreg Carmichael: Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported second quarter net income of $709 million or $0.94 per share. On an adjusted basis, we earned $0.98 per share. Once again, our financial results were very strong, continuing the positive momentum from the past several quarters. During the quarter, we generated sequential PPNR growth of 15% on an adjusted basis, a growth of 6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Commercial loan production increased 10% from last quarter, with strength in middle-market across our footprint, as well as in corporate banking. We generated strong consumer household growth of 4% compared to last year, and we also experienced historically low net charge-offs of 16 basis points, reflecting improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. We generated an adjusted ROTCE of nearly 20% for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting strong business and credit results across the franchise. Our results were supported by our continued improvement in our diversified businesses. In fact, we achieved record results in several of our fee-based businesses, including commercial banking and wealth and asset management. Despite continued pressure from low interest rates, net interest income increased 3% sequentially and the underlying NIM increased 2 basis points. We believe that our disciplined approach to managing the balance sheet, including our securities and hedge portfolios, will continue to generate differentiated performance relative to peers. We also continue to maintain our expense discipline, while still investing for long-term outperformance. As a result of our strong revenue growth combined with our expense management, we generated positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 58%. We are prioritizing investments to drive further operational efficiencies to improve our resiliency, generate household growth, and improve the customer experience. To that end, we recently announced and expanded partnership with FIS to modernize our core deposit and wealth systems to the cloud, which will enable us to further our digital transformation. This will significantly improve the flexibility and scalability of our technology infrastructure and accelerate us in the market. Combining this agreement with the renegotiation of our existing payment processing relationship allows us to modernize our platforms, while maintaining an efficient overall cost structure. From a commercial standpoint, loan production this quarter was the highest since before the pandemic, with significant sequential improvement in technology, renewable energy, and manufacturing. However, our strong production was once again offset by elevated pay downs and PPP forgiveness. While we continue to retain the customer and their core banking relationship, loan growth remains muted due to the environment. Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines, and retention of the client relationship, all continue to support the potential for improved loan growth once supply and labor constraints normalize. We currently expect our 31% commercial revolver utilization rate to increase 1% by year-end. On the consumer side, as I mentioned, we once again generated robust household growth. This strong performance reflects our ability to acquire new customers, combined with low attrition, both of which were supported by our branch and digital investments. Our recent Southeast de novo branches have helped contribute to our household growth. On the digital side, we continue to leverage technology and data analytics to deliver solutions that improve the customer experience, increase revenue, and drive efficiencies. We recently launched Fifth Third Momentum Banking across our footprint, a banking value proposition unparalleled in our industry. Momentum combines the best of a traditional bank offering with several leading fintech capabilities, including Early Pay, which gives customers free access to their paycheck up to two days early; Extra Time, which allows customers to cure an overdraft until midnight the following business day without a fee; MyAdvance, which gives customers short-term on-demand liquidity advances, smart savings, and other features, all provided with no monthly fee. Our strategy to keep the customer at the center has significantly reduced our reliance on punitive consumer deposit fees, including overdrafts and ATM fees, where Fifth Third has been among the lowest compared to peers for several years. Fifth Third Momentum Banking has put efforts to help customers avoid unnecessary fees. As I mentioned, during the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses, reflecting historically low net charge-offs, combined with a stronger economic outlook. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs. In addition to historically low credit losses, our criticized assets and NPAs once again improved this quarter. Criticized assets declined another 16% and our NPA ratio declined 11 basis points sequentially. Our balance sheet and earnings power remain very strong. Our CET1 ratio of 10.4% was relatively stable compared to last quarter, despite share repurchases of $347 million in the second quarter. As we have said before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic non-bank opportunities, dividend increases, and share repurchases. Additionally, our capital position and earnings capacity support an increase in our common dividend, starting in the third quarter. We currently expect to request a $0.03 increase to our quarterly dividend in September, subject to Board approval and economic conditions. We also expect to execute share repurchases totaling approximately $850 million in the second half of 2021, and continue to target a 9.5% CET1 by June 2022. We recently announced the strategic acquisition of Provide, a fintech healthcare practice finance firm. Provide focuses on the dental, veterinarian, and vision segments and delivers digital capabilities, which support a best-in-class experience and speed to close. Provide previously utilized an originate to sell model. As a result, the closing of the acquisition will not include a transfer of loan balances. However, post close, Fifth will retain all loan originations. We currently hold around $400 million in loans generated by Provide and have non-credit relationships with over 70% of these borrowers through deposit in our treasury management products. The acquisition is expected to close in early August and will utilize approximately 20 basis points of capital. In summary, we believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues, and continued focus on discipline throughout the company will serve us well this year and beyond. We remain committed to generating sustainable long-term value and consistently producing top-quartile results. I once again like to thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers. Our commitment to generate sustainable value for stakeholders is evident in our second annual ESG report published in June. This expands our last year's report with increased transparency, including enhanced disclosures of priority topics such as inclusion and diversity, our climate strategy, and our commitment to fair and responsible banking. We remain guided by our purpose, vision, and core values and expect to continue delivering strong results over the long term. With that, I will turn it over to Jamie to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook.\nJamie Leonard: Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We are very pleased with the financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported results for the quarter included a $37 million reduction in fee income for the negative mark related to the Visa total return swap. Our improved business performance throughout the bank resulted in strong return metrics. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.43% and an adjusted ROTCE, excluding AOCI, of 19.7%. Our adjusted earnings per share were a record for the Bancorp. We generated healthy PPNR results, the strongest since before the pandemic, with net interest income growing 3% sequentially, continued success growing and diversifying non-interest income, and diligent expense management. Improvements in credit quality this quarter resulted in a $159 million release to our credit reserve, resulting in an ACL ratio of 206 basis points compared to 219 basis points last quarter. With historically low charge-offs of just 16 basis points this quarter and an improved economic outlook, we recorded a $115 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement, net interest income increased $32 million sequentially, reflecting our ability to effectively manage the balance sheet despite the environmental headwinds from low-interest rates and elevated paydowns, given capital market conditions. Our NII growth was driven by average loan growth of 1% and $11 million of incremental prepayment penalty benefits from our bullet and locked-out cash flow strategy in our investment portfolio, which that position remains a 58% at quarter-end. Our loan balances benefited from the additional $1 billion of Ginnie Mae forbearance loan buyout purchases in early April, bringing the total third-party purchases to $3.7 billion. The other NII benefits were from a higher day count and not replacing long-term debt maturities, partially offset by the impact of declining average commercial loan balances and lower loan yields. PPP related interest income was $53 million this quarter, unchanged relative to the prior quarter. On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs by another basis point this quarter to 5 basis points and also have maturities of approximately $2.3 billion of long-term debt. With most deposit products at or near their assumed floors, the remaining liability management benefits going forward will likely be limited to CDs and reductions in long-term debt balances due to maturities. Reported NIM increased 1 basis point compared to the prior quarter, as the aforementioned investment portfolio, long-term debt, and Ginnie Mae loan buyout impacts were partially offset by the decline in commercial loan balances and lower loan yields. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash, increased 2 basis points to 312 basis points. With a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion in excess liquidity, we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise, while also remaining well hedged if rates remain low, given our securities portfolio and derivatives. Total reported non-interest income decreased just 1% sequentially. Adjusted non-interest income increased 1%, driven by record commercial banking revenue, with strength in loan syndications and financial risk management products, solid card and processing revenue from higher credit and debit interchange revenue reflecting the robust economic rebound, and an increase in both commercial and consumer deposit fees. These increases were partially offset by sequential declines in mortgage and lease syndications. Top line mortgage banking revenue decreased $8 million sequentially, reflecting incremental margin pressure. Production was strong during the quarter in both the retail and correspondent channels, with second quarter originations of $5 billion, up 7% sequentially. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted non-interest income increased 15%, with strength in deposit service charges, commercial banking revenue, wealth and asset management, and card and processing revenue, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business and the robust economic rebound over the past year. The performance and resilience of our fee income levels over the past several quarters highlight the benefit of the revenue diversification that we have achieved. Non-interest expense decreased 5% compared to the first quarter, reflecting declines in compensation and benefits expenses, lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiations, and disciplined expense management throughout the bank. This was partially offset by expenses linked to strong business performance, as well as servicing expenses associated with loan purchases, and a $12 million mark-to-market impact from our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, which had a corresponding offset in security gains. For the full year, we expect to incur around $50 million in third-party servicing expense for purchased loans. Our compensation-related expense growth this year continues to be proportionate to the success we are seeing in our fee-based businesses. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 15% compared to 4% expense growth. Additionally, compared to the pre-pandemic levels of the second quarter of 2019, total adjusted fees have increased 14% compared to expense growth of just 3%. Moving to the balance sheet, total average loans and leases were up 1% sequentially, as consumer loan growth was partially offset by a decline in commercial loans. Additionally, period-end loans were up 1%, excluding PPP. Average total consumer loans increased 4%, as ongoing strength in the auto portfolio and the impact of Ginnie Mae loans purchased were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances, reflecting the continued impacts of government stimulus. Average commercial loans declined 1% compared to the prior quarter, largely driven by PPP forgiveness and elevated payoffs, which were partially offset by strong production across most of our verticals and throughout our middle market footprint. Production was up 10% compared to the prior quarter and up over 20% compared to the pre-pandemic levels of the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of PPP, our end of period C&I loans were up slightly sequentially, as client sentiment and business activities in several industries are showing signs of stabilization. Revolver utilization of 31% was flat compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the market liquidity and capital markets conditions. We are encouraged by the fact that we have successfully retained virtually all clients throughout the pandemic, which will enable us to further deepen and grow these relationships going forward. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially with end of period balances declining 3%. Our securities portfolio increased 1% this quarter. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows, but we'll remain patient on deploying the excess cash. We will continue to be opportunistic as the economic environment evolves. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to increase our cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point level. We remain optimistic that strong economic growth in the second half of 2021 and an eventual Fed tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive risk-return opportunities in the future. Average short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, remain elevated due to continued strength in core deposit balances, which have grown 10% year-over-year. We are seeing strength in both consumer and commercial deposits. Compared to the prior quarter, average core deposits increased 3%. About two-thirds of the balance growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis has come from consumer, reflecting continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and strong household growth. Moving to credit, our strong credit performance once again this quarter reflects our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and prudent balance sheet management, while also benefiting from continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and improvement in the broader economy. The second quarter net charge-off ratio of 16 basis points was historically low and improved 11 basis points sequentially. Non-performing assets declined 16% or $126 million. The NPA ratio declined 11 basis points sequentially to 61 basis points, which is comparable to the fourth quarter of 2019. Also, our criticized assets declined 16%, with significant improvements in retail non-essential, leisure and healthcare, as well as in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios. However, we continue to focus on non-owner occupied commercial real estate, particularly central business district hotels. Moving to the ACL, our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes that labor market continues to improve and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% by the first quarter of 2022 and ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $169 million reserve release. Conversely, applying 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $763 million build. Inclusive of the impact of approximately $108 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.15%. Additionally, excluding the $3.7 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.22%. While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out, given the uncertain environment. We continue to monitor the COVID situation, which could still impact many businesses, particularly those we have identified as being in highly impacted industries, or reverse, the rising consumer confidence trends. Our June 30th allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment with lower unemployment and continued improving credit quality. Moving to capital, our capital levels remained strong in the second quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.4%, which is $1.3 billion above our stated target of 9.5%. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 3% during the quarter. As a Category Four institution, Fifth Third was not subject to the latest Federal Reserve stress test and we did not opt-in. At the end of June, the Fed notified us that our FCB would be 2.5% effective July 1st, which is the floor under the regulatory capital rules. Without the floor, a buffer would have been approximately 2.1%. During the quarter, we completed $347 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by approximately 9 million shares compared to the first quarter. As Greg mentioned, we expect to repurchase approximately $850 million of shares in the second half of 2021, while also increasing our common dividend in September. We also announced our acquisition of Provide this quarter. We will utilize approximately 20 basis points of CET1 upon closing. This financially compelling acquisition of an asset generation engine dovetails perfectly with our existing strategic focus on digital enablement and generating profitable growth on our balance sheet. We believe in Provide's strong growth prospects. From an origination standpoint, they have produced $300 million in the first half of 2021, of which Fifth Third purchased approximately 80%. We expect second half originations to be around $400 million, and given the expected early August closing, virtually all of that will go on our balance sheet. We expect over $1 billion in originations in 2022 and could grow to over $2 billion annually within a few years. Moving to our current outlook, for the full year, we expect average total loan balances to be stable compared to last year, reflecting continued pressure from PPP forgiveness and paydowns in commercial, combined with low double-digit growth in consumer. We continue to expect CRE balances to remain stable in this environment. We continue to expect our underlying NIM to be in the 305 basis point area for the full year. Combined with our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% this year, assuming stable security balances and incorporating all PPP impacts. On a sequential basis, we expect NII to decline around 2%, given the impacts of the securities portfolio prepayment income we experienced in the second quarter that we do not assume will repeat in our outlook, as well as an assumed decline in PPP income. Within our NII guidance, we expect approximately $165 million in PPP related interest income for 2021, of which $106 million was realized in the first half of the year compared to $100 million in 2020 and approximately $50 million expected in 2022. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect approximately $40 million in PPP income. Therefore, excluding PPP impacts, we would expect third quarter NII to decline around 1% compared to the second quarter, or up over 2% from the third quarter of 2020. Given the continued strength throughout our businesses, we expect full year fees to increase 7% to 8% compared to 2020 or 8% to 9%, excluding the impact of the TRA. Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy, as well as our ongoing success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger processing revenue, capital markets fees, and wealth and asset management revenue, which will be partially offset by mortgage declines. Additionally, as we discussed in January, we expect to generate private equity gains from several of our direct investments in venture capital funds throughout 2021, potentially exceeding the 2020 level of $75 million. We have recognized around $30 million in gains through the first half of 2021, which we expect to double in the second half of 2021. We expect third quarter total fees to be relatively stable from the second quarter, and would be up mid to high-single digits year-over-year. In the mortgage business, we expect revenue throughout the second half of the year to benefit from lower asset decay and higher servicing fees. The top-line revenue is expected to decline high single-digits year-over-year due to continued headwinds from margin compression. Our fee outlook does not incorporate a pre-tax gain of approximately $60 million associated with the sale of our HSA business that is expected to close in the third quarter. We do plan to redeploy half of that gain in the third quarter, split evenly between a $15 million donation to the Fifth Third Foundation that will complete our previously announced philanthropy commitment to accelerating racial equality and inclusion in our communities and a $15 million additional marketing program, supporting momentum given the upside potential we see in that product. We expect full-year expenses to be up 2% to 3%, given our strong revenue outlook and the continued servicing costs from the loan portfolio purchases, as well as the incremental expenses associated with the Provide acquisition. On a sequential basis, we expect expenses to be down 1%, excluding the redeployment of half of the HSA gain. As we recently discussed, we expect to consolidate 42 branches, primarily in our legacy Midwest footprint, which we expect to complete in early 2022. Additionally, we've opened five branches so far this year and plan to add approximately 25 more Southeast in market de novo branches in the second half of 2021. All run rate branch impacts are included in our outlook. We've generated year-over-year positive operating leverage this quarter and we expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage for the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses, and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be 20 basis points to 25 basis points, given the strong first half performance and assuming our base case scenario continues to play out. Third quarter losses are likely to be in the 15 basis point to 20 basis point range. In summary, our second quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChris Doll: Thanks, Jamie. Before we start the Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. Operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.\nKen Zerbe: Now, you guys are doing a lot to make Fifth Third more consumer friendly, like Early Pay and Extra Time. If we expect that trend to continue, what's the total amount of fees or revenue that might be at risk as the broader industry really continues to wean itself off of consumer fees?\nJamie Leonard: Yes, Ken, it's, Jamie. Thanks for the question. The one thing we are proud of at Fifth Third is how much we've reduced our exposure on the consumer side, from a unit a punitive fee standpoint and how we are, I would say, a very consumer-focused and consumer-friendly bank. I think 3% or so of our revenue was in consumer overdrafts and our peers are significantly higher than those levels. We expect to continue to improve upon that with the Momentum bank offering and some of the features that Greg talked about in his prepared remarks. So I think you can continue to expect that from us and that if we were to have any future changes on overdraft policies or fees would only be to the positive and that we would more than make up for it with the incremental volume from Momentum. I don't know, Tim, if there's anything else you want to add?\nTim Spence: Yes. No, I just want to emphasize that. I mean, whenever you launch a new product, the trade-off you have to evaluate is what you think you can produce as it relates to total franchise growth relative to any sort of cannibalization, right? So the fact that we have been deliberate about driving revenue growth through value-added services as opposed to maintenance and punitive fees means that for us, we're going to get the benefit of the franchise growth and more households from Momentum with comparatively substantially less impact than any of our large competitors would have, to the extent that they would attempt to follow us here.\nKen Zerbe: And then just maybe a second question. In terms of the Ginnie Mae buyouts, I think some of the other banks this quarter have mentioned they just didn't see the opportunity or they didn't have - or they couldn't find the opportunity relative to do a lot - the Ginnie Mae buyouts. But it feels like you guys got a fairly decent benefit from that this quarter. Was that - are you seeing the same trends or do you still see opportunity to continue that going forward?\nJamie Leonard: Very good question actually, because what we've seen is that, given we were a first mover in this product and it's far back as the third quarter of 2020 when we bought our own pools and then helped structure these additional purchases that we've done, totaling $3.7 billion thus far to date, I would say that the economics were certainly more attractive if you were in the first mover stage, and the economics have really waned to the point that we would not be pursuing additional purchases at these levels.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers: Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask sort of a top level on sort of the eventuality of a commercial recovery. What's your best guess as to what that will look like for larger regionals like yourself? It's sort of unclear to the degree to which capital markets competition will abate if there are questions regarding the sustainability of the sort of the sugar high that consumers are on right now, meaning demand couldn't decrease - the further we go and then you've got all this excess liquidity that's getting worked through. So just curious to hear your top-level thoughts on what that recovery will ultimately look like in your eyes.\nGreg Carmichael: Well, let me start, then I'll forward to Jamie or Tim for additional color. First off, it's - right now, there's a lot of uncertainty out here right now as we're dealing with the labor shortage and the supply chain disruptions, which are extremely real and you see it across the Board in all conversation with our customers. But that said, we back to pretty much pre-pandemic global production numbers, but payoffs continue to be stout, and obviously you got something like PPP. So when you think about the environment in front of us, I think loan growth, as we continue to beat the challenge as we go through the rest of the year. I think we offset that by our strengths in our fee businesses, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, that compensate for some of those challenges, but I do think this changes over time [technical difficulty] every 1% to $750 million. So there's a lot of upside opportunity there. At some point, labor shortage and supply chain constraints start to abate, if we pick up the benefit of that. We also added about $2.4 million new commitments since the beginning of the year and continue to acquire new households in commercial relationships. We're very, very positive. As to what the future might hold, we've got some economic and some environmental challenges in front of us that we have to continue to deal with.\nTim Spence: Yes. I think when we announced NorthStar, we talked about pivoting the return profile of the bank to be good through the cycle. A portion of the focus there was on business mix, right? It was about constructing a business portfolio that had balance. So in an environment where utilization is down like that now and where rates are low, we have fee businesses that are firing and are providing nice support, and some countercyclical businesses in particular on the consumer side, like autos and mortgages, which are doing very, very well. I think as some of the tailwind from those businesses abates, what you would expect to see is a benefit both, as Greg mentioned, relates to line utilization and ultimately some benefit from rates, which provides a lot of support for the through-the-cycle focus.\nScott Siefers: Thank you for those thoughts. And then maybe just a thought on overall reserving levels. You guys still maintain a very high and conservative overall reserve. How are you sort of thinking about the steady state? Is it back to where we were CECL day 1 or just given the backdrop and what we've already gone through, can we blow through that a little bit on when you go lower than that? How do you think about those dynamics?\nJamie Leonard: It's Jamie, I'll take that one. When you look at the quarter, with the ACL release of $159 million, we had that split fairly evenly between the consumer portfolio and the commercial portfolio, and the decline was essentially driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook versus the prior quarter. When you look ahead, we continue to overweight non-baseline scenarios at 20%. So the upside is 20%, the base is 60%, and the downside is 20%. And that's really driven by the uncertainty in the environment, including the vaccine efficacy and frankly this week's concerns highlight that risk. So when you look at the asymmetrical nature of the upside and downside scenarios, that weighting versus the 80%, 10%, 10% on CECL day 1 generates about a $90 million higher reserve. So I guess the first part to your fairly complicated question is that the scenario weightings do matter, and we expect to maintain the 60%, 20%, 20%, while this period of uncertainty continues to exist. And then relative to Day 1, it really is a tale of two portfolios. So when you look at the commercial side, to get back to those Day 1 adoption reserve rates, you really do need to see a sustained strengthening in the credit characteristics of the borrowers that are most at risk to the longer-term negative impacts from the pandemic. And so that would have to occur in conjunction with improving economic forecasts above our current expectations. But then when you look at the consumer side, we're actually already below the CECL day 1 level. We're at 1.99% at the end of the second quarter versus the 2.46% on CECL Day 1, and that's driven by the combination of the loan mix, as well as improvements in real estate and auto collateral values experienced since the adoption of CECL, as well as the economic forecasts for the - at the end of the second quarter, and then we've had an improvement in credit quality in auto and card, as well as in the delinquency rate. So consumer is already there, but commercial, again, we have to have things play out differently than what we - better than what we currently expect.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Securities.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I just wanted to go back, Greg, on your announcement partnering with FIS on the modern core and on the wealth management side. If you could give us some visibility on three things, one, what that means for near-term expense impact, what it means for longer-term efficiency as you kind of do go through that process, if you could tell us what the timeline would be. And then finally, we are hearing from other banks talking about moving to a modern core and that being a competitive advantage. Do you see that as a competitive advantage for Fifth Third when you get to that point, or is it table stakes given where the industry is moving?\nGreg Carmichael: Okay, that's a lot there. So let me try and dissect that a little bit for you. First off, the FIS announcement we just made is a continuation of a relationship that's been in place for quite some time, this replacement of our [indiscernible] core deposit platforms. But we've been on this journey to re-engineer our technical infrastructure, focusing on the actual resiliency, the skills of our businesses, replace our HR platform Workday. We completed our enterprise data strategy, we completely re-platformed mortgage FIS environment. So the FIS is the natural extension of the continuation of the modernization of those activities. We also re-engineered and restructured pricing agreement of our legacy relationship with FIS that could help make that - the cost associated with that implementation of the new FIS components, a lot more reasonable but guess for us, we will manage our costs going forward. So we're pretty pleased with the way that came out. As far as a competitive advantage, listen, I think at the end of the day, this is a long game. We have to continue to refresh our platforms, we got to continue to modernize our platforms to the cloud. I think every bank is trying to get this right. So whether it becomes a competitive advantage or not, I think it's a requirement, I mean it basic table stakes to be the business to be a digital bank. Our customers expect the bank anywhere anytime, we have to have platforms that are always on. So that's just a re-transformation of our business. We have to repurpose our expense dollars from the legacy brick-and-mortar infrastructure and we got to continue to reinvest in technology. So we're going to continue to do that, and I think the banks that don't do that are going to be at a competitive disadvantage. But many banks, as you've already heard, are continuing to focus on core modernization, and we're going to be just doing the same thing. We're think we have a great strategy for that monetization and for bringing in new technologies. We have a buy-partner-build strategy that we work on very hard. If the technology is already out there, we buy it. If we can't buy it, can partner. And if we can't partner, we build it. Momentum is an example of that. You have partnerships like GreenSky and Exchange thanks systems covered bond due to her list and our recent acquisition of Provide. So we - I think we've got a good strategy for moving quickly, but it is going to take time to get all the legacy stuff re-platformed, but net-net, once again, I think it may not be a competitive advantage at the end of the day, but definitely will be a requirement to be in this business in the future.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's good color, appreciate it. And just as a follow-up on - to that, when you think about acquisition of Provide, healthcare is obviously a very hot sector. Do you see more opportunities like that across different verticals where you might be - we should expect similar kind of deals which become tools for client acquisitions?\nTim Spence: Yes, sure. This is Tim. I'm happy to take that one. So healthcare was the right starting point for us. It's a diverse industry vertical that we launched here over a decade ago and we have a vertically integrated strategy on that front across our corporate banking group, our middle market banking group out in the regions, and now also business banking. I think Provide with an important next step for us in the strategy because it gave us the opportunity to provide a differentiated value proposition to independent medical practices, like Greg mentioned, with a big focus on dentists that's - and otherwise. And Provide was a little bit unique in that it had, as a fintech company, actually already grown into one of the largest lenders into that market, driven primarily by their technology and their expertise. And just as a point of example there, the digital experience that they offer enables them to get loans approved and closed about 70% faster than a typical lending process would - it would in that market. And in addition, because of the sector focus, they have a growing digital marketplace that actually allows existing practice owners who would like to transition into retirement to post their practices for sale and to get connected with folks who are interested in buying an established practice, and so it functions, I guess, a little bit like the Craigslist or the eBay of dental practices today. Are there opportunities in other verticals? Yes, we do think there are, and we have been pretty active, as Greg mentioned, in partnering with many of those firms. Whether those relationships evolve from a partnership into an outright acquisition, I think it depends a lot on the circumstances business in a given point in time. But in the case of Provide, their next leg of the growth journey was going to be about the delivery of the broad - the full set of products and services and it absolutely makes sense for them to be part of the bank as opposed to a stand-alone entity on that journey.\nOperator: Your next question comes the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Jamie, this question is for you. On the securities portfolio, can you share with us - I saw the yield, as you presented in your deck, increased sequentially, and I was wondering how you achieve that in this rate environment. Was it due to the derivatives and hedges you have on the books? And then second, I think you said that obviously, you're going to keep the liquidity in the portfolio until rates start to rise. I think you may have mentioned the 2% rate. Would you lean into it as rates were to go 2%, if they do, or would you wait until we actually got to 2% before you really move?\nJamie Leonard: I think if you look back at our actions in the first quarter, to answer the second part of your question, if you look back at our first quarter actions, we did leg into a little bit of additional investment portfolio buildup at that point in time. We pre-invested $1 billion of our second quarter cash flows, and then given the entry points and - of rally in the bond market, decided to maintain that additional leverage throughout the quarter. So we did grow the book a little bit in the second quarter. Our guide assumes we hold it fairly stable as the year progresses, because we don't expect to get to those 2% or a better entry point, but should the market get there, we would leg into the trade and not do everything all at once. But when you look at our additional $30 billion of excess liquidity that we're sitting on, we've earmarked about a third of that to go into the investment portfolio. So to get $10 billion of purchases done would certainly take some time and we've ramped that up over time. And our goal here is, we sit through peer results and actions versus ours and we certainly are an outlier in terms of being, I think, more prudent and more cautious to deploying at these low rates, our goal is, let's maximize our NII over the next five years, not over the next 12 months. And we think ultimately this is the better outcome and the Fed will eventually taper, not sure when that will be, but when the largest bond buyer in the world is price indiscriminate in their purchases every month, it certainly distorts the market. So eventually, that distortion is going to end and we think we'll get better entry points than what we see today. And then in terms of the first part of your question, the growth in the yield this quarter in the investment portfolio is really the benefit of what we did five years ago with structuring the portfolio to be more weighted to bullet and locked-out cash flows so that to the extent there are prepayments in the portfolio, the make-whole provisions provide a nice pickup in investment yield. And as we - we never include those in our outlook, so that - the guide on NII might look soft on the surface, but if things continue to be the same then obviously NII will outperform the guide, should those prepayment penalties continue to occur. We're sitting on almost $2 billion of gains in the investment portfolio.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good, thank you for the color. And then, Greg, I've asked this question in the past, but I'll ask it again, which is when you sit down with your senior management team and you guys look out over the risks that you foresee in the horizon and if we take the delta variant and the COVID risk off the table, since that's an obvious one, what are some of the risks that you guys wrestle with as you look out over the next 12 months that we just have to keep our eye on and looking around the corner so that we're not surprised a year from now?\nGreg Carmichael: Yes, it's a good question, and honestly, I wouldn't respond immediately with the variant of COVID and what that could mean to the slowing down the economy and not getting the robust recovery we're all hoping for in credit risk. But I think right now, as I mentioned earlier, Gerard, I think about every customer I sit down with since that we have a conversation. I mean, you're seeing it in various ways, labor shortage, supply chain constraints, significant issues out there right now. You're seeing that in backlogs, order delays, restaurants not being able to open, small businesses not open full time, can't get labor. So it's a big challenge right now. And when does that start to abate? When does that start to correct itself? I'm not sure when that is. I believe it will have to, obviously, but to - when is that, later this year, is that the next year. So I think that's going to put a lot of pressure, inventory levels are extremely low compared with the demand that is out there, we're not seeing that tick up right now. Line utilization, it looks kind of flat right now, but we are not seeing that tick-up that we were hoping to see. So those are all kind of concerns that I have right now. Obviously, inflation is another concern out there, we've been watching that, how the Fed manages through that complexity, and more to come on that. But now, I think, overall the economy is fairly healthy. We just got some challenges still in front of us that haven't been understood yet.\nTim Spence: And on that\u2026\nGerard Cassidy: I'm sorry, go ahead.\nGreg Carmichael: Tim has\u2026\nTim Spence: No, I just was going to say, just to add a little bit of color, Greg and I together were out. We spent a full day in 12 of our 13 regions this quarter, which made for a busy travel schedule, but a lot of good input in terms of what we're actually hearing from clients on the ground, and I mean, some of the stories that you hear about how people are dealing with the labor shortages or inventory supply issues are wild. I mean, we have a client, a fuels marketer who had to open their own driving school so that they can get people - enough folks with qualified commercial driver's licenses to do fuel deliveries. You have hospitals who are operating at 50% capacity on the elective portions of their business, which are a really important driver, right, when you think about the revenues who can't get enough skilled nursing staff on hand to be able to operate at levels above that, and we had folks who had been sending employees out to a local CVS or a Walgreens and buying out all of the Gorilla Glue because the adhesives that are used to seal together their cardboard packaging are backlogged, owing to the hard freak in Texas this last winter and - it really these - they are not theoretical concepts when you get out and you talk to our middle market clients. They are really hard realities that they are grappling with. And I think as Greg said, we all hope that especially if the enhanced unemployment benefits weigh in and as we work through some of these supply chain challenges that our clients are able to invest in their business, but if you can't get the people, you can't the materials, you can't invest to grow\nGerard Cassidy: Is there any risk, just to follow up quickly, that is a permanent change in the way these companies will manage themselves, which would lead to a lesser need from borrowing from banks like yours because of what they're going through, have you heard that at all from your customers?\nTim Spence: No, not yet. I think we hear them exploring opportunities to be less reliant on manual labor and to drive automation, but that drives CapEx, right, so that helps us. We hear them exploring opportunities to secure more captive supply and otherwise through M&A, but that also drives borrowing in terms of the way that they operate, and ironically, actually we hear many of them say, hey, we have been pushing for decades now to run more asset-light, which meant less liquidity on hand and maybe we don't want to do that going forward and we're willing to absorb slightly higher debt service costs in favor of being a little bit more liquid, and that would be helpful to us in terms of the borrowing. So I don't think so, Gerard. It just - we got to see our way through to the other side of this, because you can't get labor, you can't get inventory. It's hard to grow.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBill Carcache: Can you relate the fee income strength that you saw this quarter to the growth you're seeing in the Southeast region? Are you leading in the Southeast with your fee-based products like treasury management rather than credit as you grow into that region, and if you could discuss the longer-term growth outlook across your other fee-based products in the Southeast?\nTim Spence: Yes, sure. Bill, it's Tim. I'll take that. I think the growth, if you look at new client relationships and otherwise, is very strong in the commercial business in the Southeast. So they are contributing just disproportionately to that incremental fee income, but I wouldn't tell you that it is focused exclusively on the Southeast. If you look at our new commercial relationships, about 30% of them this year are lead with treasury management, and then there's another percentage, which I don't have off the top of my head, but which has come to us primarily through the capital markets business. So we are having good success using those products as wedge opportunities to drive new relationships. If you look forward, I think we're trying to build what is a really nicely diversified capital markets business with low activities like rates and commodities hedging and otherwise to complement the M&A advisory business and what we do on equities with what we do on the bond market. I mean, what we continue to anticipate is at some point here, the capital markets will be a little bit less accommodative. We'll get the benefit of that in loan balances, but you'll see some lightening on bond fees. But the other side of it is, we're sitting on an M&A pipeline now, which is almost double what it was in January 1 of this year. So we do have a nice M&A advisory pipeline that should come behind it. On the treasury management side, we've pretty consistently grown at the rate of the industry plus two to three percentage points. I am of the belief that we can do better than that, but it's definitely better to be taking share there over time than it is to have the alternative situations. We feel good about both of those fee lines over the near to medium term.\nBill Carcache: And Greg, you mentioned GreenSky when talking about your partnerships there. Can you give us an update on how you're thinking about indirect lending partnerships more broadly and the opportunity to leverage these partnerships to continue to grow nationally beyond your footprint credits of that model, or do you really need to own the relationship and are at a disadvantage when all you're doing is putting up your balance sheet and somebody else has the relationship with the customer, but we'd love to hear your thoughts.\nGreg Carmichael: First off, there's not a lot of these opportunities out there. We - the economics of the GreenSky relationship as we went in as an investor have made a lot of sense for us. This is not how we grow our business over time, we're much more relationship business. That's why the Provide acquisition was extremely important. You think about Provide, that was a partnership originally, we had about $400 million in asset, the 70% of those relationships, we had additional relationship outside the credit facility, whether it be TM or deposit relationship. So that was important, the relationship type of opportunity for us, and that's what we're looking for to continue to enhance our business and grow our businesses. GreenSky created another channel for us, but yes, that's a non-relationship business for us. And those opportunities that makes sense to us are a very few out there, but the GreenSky one does for the economics of the transaction in place.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Couple of quick ones. First of all, the third quarter Momentum marketing program that you mentioned where you had used part of that benefit, is that just to get it kick-started, and then would you have ongoing expenses related to marketing built into your forward outlook past 3Q?\nJamie Leonard: Yes. It's Jamie. The - Yes, the $15 million incremental spend over the second quarter marketing spend level of $20 million, and we expect to spend $35 million of marketing in the third quarter, that should abate going forward. However, if it is successful, then we'll continue to program at that elevated level and until we've really captured as much of the first-mover advantage with the product as we can.\nKen Usdin: Okay, got it. Understood. And then do you have any plan to or thoughts on re-securitizing those Ginnie Mae loans that you - the $3.7 billion that you mentioned, I know some of them are newer, so they might not have quite gotten to that seasoning point yet, but is that added all in your outlook in terms of whether they stay in loans or move to mortgage banking over time?\nJamie Leonard: So for the $3.7 billion of loans that we purchased from other third-party servicers, we have a - there is a nominal amount of fees assumed in the outlook related to that as they get resold to the servicer. The bigger economic opportunity is on the $750 million forbearance loans that we bought going back from Ginnie Mae on our own production, as well as within our resi mortgage portfolio to the extent that there are any on non-accrual or delinquents that cure, we do have - we have had sales this year that generate several million dollars in fees and we expect to do that over the next 6, 7 quarters as well. So I think it\u2019s more of a run rate normal course of business than it is any one-time top.\nKen Usdin: That makes sense. Last one, you redeemed a bunch of debt mostly at the banks, some at the parents. Is there any more room to do that as that's, obviously, still the highest cost of funding, but again, you have all the excess deposits? What's the balancing act in terms of where you want that long-term debt footprint to settle over time? Thanks, guys.\nJamie Leonard: Yes, given the excess liquidity that we have, there is clearly not a need to maintain the higher unsecured debt levels that we have. We have an additional maturity in the third quarter we'll most likely not replace that's about $850 million, almost 3% rate. So there is a little bit left to go in terms of improvement along with running down the wholesale CD book, but those benefits are baked into our outlook. So I would not expect it to get better than what we've guided to from the right-hand side of the sheet. I think the opportunity for us, from an NII improvement standpoint, will be on the left-hand side of the sheet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari: On the loan growth side, on the utilization, I know you expect it to improve by about 1% through the year-end. Can you just help out with what is your pre-pandemic utilization level and expected timing where you think you can get back to that level on that front?\nGreg Carmichael: Yes, it's a great question. I wish I knew the answer to that. I do know we would typically - run at 36%, 37% as I mentioned, every 1% of our $750 million assets. So, we're running at 31% kind of flat line rate there. I can't really - we're hopeful, but I - like I tell my team, hope is not a strategy, we're hopeful we'll start to see that tick up a little bit based on the production levels that we're seeing out there right now. Hope we can get some of these challenges that are in front us on a supply chain and labor front maybe abating a little later this year, but when to get it is a tough thing to say. When do we get back to a normalized run rate? It's going to be awhile. I mean, it's going to be in quarters, not - maybe a year plus before we get there, I believe.\nJohn Pancari: That's helpful. And on that same topic, on the loan growth guide, I know you indicated a double-digit consumer growth, stable CRE, you got PPP impact in commercial. What would be your growth expectation for commercial with PPP and ex-PPP on that full year guide?\nJamie Leonard: Relatively stable on commercial. I would say John, I would say, full year commercial average loans would be down mid-single digits, and ex-PPP a little bit more than that, but ending the year with a little bit of a - a little closer to stable. And then PPP is - we've been running steadily down as the year as the year has progressed, where on an end of period basis, we finished the first quarter at 5.4 billion, we finished the second quarter at $3.7 billion. That will continue to drift down to $2.1 billion at the end of the third, and then a $1.7 billion at year-end is our current projection on PPP.\nJohn Pancari: And then lastly on the M&A front, as you look at the incremental opportunities there. Greg, I just wanted to get your thoughts on potential incremental bank and non-bank, and more importantly curious where you think of President Biden's executive order and the implied added scrutiny around bank deals. Do you believe that could impact the bank of your size, looking at a potential whole bank deal?\nGreg Carmichael: Yes. I think, first off, I would respond by saying our focus is on non-bank transactions that enhance our product and service capabilities like Provide, would be a great example of that. So we'll stay focused there for the most part. If the right opportunity presents itself in a market that's attractive to us, that consoles would be financial [indiscernible] Chicago, obviously, we always consider those types of opportunities, but the [indiscernible] another focus to the organization. As far as Biden's executive order, listen, it's still a lot of work to be done. The agencies, the OCC, Fed, FERC, and DOJ are trying to figure out what that means. So more to come on that, but you can believe as I do that transactions - the economics of transactions could be more challenging going forward. It is an executive order and the timeline to get those transactions approved, they take a little bit longer, but good transactions will get done.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Just talk a bit more about the path for the 9.5% CET1 target. Obviously, you talked about the dividend increase, the buybacks back half of this year, the 20 basis point drag. But if you put it all out together, just still about the, it seems like kind of treading water on the capital, just given the good earnings generation and probably not a lot of balance sheet growth the next few quarters or so. Do you think you'll get that target? Are you going to hold back for the loan growth and maybe to flush it out a little bit think about the first half of the next year?\nJamie Leonard: Yes, our goal is certainly to get to the 9.5% by June of 2022. And yes, it is certainly a large amount of repurchases. I think the two factors to bake into it would be, there's 20 basis points of CET1 erosion from the Provide acquisition in the third quarter and then 9 basis points of CECL transition in the first quarter of 2022, so that - a little bit of capital gets spent there. But yes, to your point, we have a lot of capital deployment opportunity ahead of us to get to the 9.5%. And certainly if loan growth doesn't materialize, then we'll look to continue it at the 9.5%. And then we do feel that should loan growth accelerate, we certainly have a buffer from where we think we need to run the company from a capital perspective. Clearly, from the credit outcomes you're seeing we could run the balance sheet, I think, at 9% or so if loan growth were to accelerate, but for now, our focus is just getting to the 9.5% by midyear next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Winter with Wedbush.\nPeter Winter: I wanted to ask just on the middle market and small business, are you seeing any willingness of them maybe to top their lines of credit while maintaining higher levels of cash on hand, or is it just an issue of supply and labor shortages that's holding it all back?\nTim Spence: Peter, it's Tim. I would tell you it's primarily issues with supply chain and labor, like Greg said, and not liquidity. If you're looking for green shoots, I think that borrowers who are either smaller or who will rely on structures that look more like asset-based lending structures are starting to tap their lines. So we are seeing modest improvements in utilization in that sector. Now, in aggregate, that's not a large segment of our balance sheet, which is the reason that you see utilization, overall, Fifth Third being stable. But generally as these things happen, they happen at the lower end of the book first and they migrate upward into the larger borrowers. So I at least, when I feel like finding a positive signal, that's where I'm going these days.\nPeter Winter: Okay. And then, Jamie, just to ask about the outlook for the margin in the second half of the year, some of the puts and takes?\nJamie Leonard: Sure. The second quarter was obviously very strong from a margin perspective, and we're pleased with how our balance sheet has been performing. But given the high levels of PPP, as well as the investment securities prepayment penalties that we don't expect to recur or at least don't forecast to recur, we would expect to see the NIM decline a bit to a more normalized level, which is that 305 basis point areas what we've talked about. But I think, pretty much all year in terms of what we think this balance sheet should stabilize that certainly for the foreseeable future. So NIM should come down, call it 5 basis points or so in the third quarter. I would say the big drivers there, certainly the PPP, the prepayment penalties, a little bit of day count, and otherwise still maintain that floor of 305 basis point or better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW.\nDavid Konrad: Quick follow-up on the securities portfolio. Maybe, Jamie, can you remind us what the remaining duration is for the bullet structured product?\nJamie Leonard: So the total portfolio is of 4.9 duration and so the bullet - when we quote the 58% number, we're saying it's bullet and locked-out for at least the next two years, but the duration of that portfolio is not that different from the portfolio in total.\nDavid Konrad: I guess the locked-out is two additional years?\nJamie Leonard: Correct, but there's not a step-down. For a while, we had quoted a 12-month and then we got the questions, so we expanded to 24, but there's not a cliff here. It's just a slow erosion over time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott.\nChristopher Marinac: I just wanted to go back to the regulatory question before, Greg. Is the environment any different than it would have been six or nine months ago, whether it's a CFPB or any of the agencies?\nGreg Carmichael: Well, listen, obviously, with the picture changing right now, there is still a process on the CFPB front from a nomination perspective. So is the changed - this has been - it's - I don't believe it's changed to be honest with you. I think the agencies have a job to do and a role to play, and I think the focus of the CFPB and the OCC and the FDIC are going to be making sure that there is the safety and soundness, but also the way that - the way the banks handle themselves and operate are going to be extremely important. So I haven't sensed a big shift in - with the new administration on requirements and demands of the other bank in the totality, so to speak, from the top as to what they expect from us. So it's not something that keeps me up at night. Let's put it that way.\nChristopher Marinac: Okay, Greg. Thank you for that, and thanks for all of the background this morning.\nGreg Carmichael: Thank you.\nOperator: Those are all the questions we have at this time. Are there any closing remarks?\nChris Doll: Yes. Thank you, Christy, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department and we will be happy to assist you. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tim Spence",
            "content": "Yes. No, I just want to emphasize that. I mean, whenever you launch a new product, the trade-off you have to evaluate is what you think you can produce as it relates to total franchise growth relative to any sort of cannibalization, right? So the fact that we have been deliberate about driving revenue growth through value-added services as opposed to maintenance and punitive fees means that for us, we're going to get the benefit of the franchise growth and more households from Momentum with comparatively substantially less impact than any of our large competitors would have, to the extent that they would attempt to follow us here. Yes. I think when we announced NorthStar, we talked about pivoting the return profile of the bank to be good through the cycle. A portion of the focus there was on business mix, right? It was about constructing a business portfolio that had balance. So in an environment where utilization is down like that now and where rates are low, we have fee businesses that are firing and are providing nice support, and some countercyclical businesses in particular on the consumer side, like autos and mortgages, which are doing very, very well. I think as some of the tailwind from those businesses abates, what you would expect to see is a benefit both, as Greg mentioned, relates to line utilization and ultimately some benefit from rates, which provides a lot of support for the through-the-cycle focus. Yes, sure. This is Tim. I'm happy to take that one. So healthcare was the right starting point for us. It's a diverse industry vertical that we launched here over a decade ago and we have a vertically integrated strategy on that front across our corporate banking group, our middle market banking group out in the regions, and now also business banking. I think Provide with an important next step for us in the strategy because it gave us the opportunity to provide a differentiated value proposition to independent medical practices, like Greg mentioned, with a big focus on dentists that's - and otherwise. And Provide was a little bit unique in that it had, as a fintech company, actually already grown into one of the largest lenders into that market, driven primarily by their technology and their expertise. And just as a point of example there, the digital experience that they offer enables them to get loans approved and closed about 70% faster than a typical lending process would - it would in that market. And in addition, because of the sector focus, they have a growing digital marketplace that actually allows existing practice owners who would like to transition into retirement to post their practices for sale and to get connected with folks who are interested in buying an established practice, and so it functions, I guess, a little bit like the Craigslist or the eBay of dental practices today. Are there opportunities in other verticals? Yes, we do think there are, and we have been pretty active, as Greg mentioned, in partnering with many of those firms. Whether those relationships evolve from a partnership into an outright acquisition, I think it depends a lot on the circumstances business in a given point in time. But in the case of Provide, their next leg of the growth journey was going to be about the delivery of the broad - the full set of products and services and it absolutely makes sense for them to be part of the bank as opposed to a stand-alone entity on that journey. And on that... No, I just was going to say, just to add a little bit of color, Greg and I together were out. We spent a full day in 12 of our 13 regions this quarter, which made for a busy travel schedule, but a lot of good input in terms of what we're actually hearing from clients on the ground, and I mean, some of the stories that you hear about how people are dealing with the labor shortages or inventory supply issues are wild. I mean, we have a client, a fuels marketer who had to open their own driving school so that they can get people - enough folks with qualified commercial driver's licenses to do fuel deliveries. You have hospitals who are operating at 50% capacity on the elective portions of their business, which are a really important driver, right, when you think about the revenues who can't get enough skilled nursing staff on hand to be able to operate at levels above that, and we had folks who had been sending employees out to a local CVS or a Walgreens and buying out all of the Gorilla Glue because the adhesives that are used to seal together their cardboard packaging are backlogged, owing to the hard freak in Texas this last winter and - it really these - they are not theoretical concepts when you get out and you talk to our middle market clients. They are really hard realities that they are grappling with. And I think as Greg said, we all hope that especially if the enhanced unemployment benefits weigh in and as we work through some of these supply chain challenges that our clients are able to invest in their business, but if you can't get the people, you can't the materials, you can't invest to grow No, not yet. I think we hear them exploring opportunities to be less reliant on manual labor and to drive automation, but that drives CapEx, right, so that helps us. We hear them exploring opportunities to secure more captive supply and otherwise through M&A, but that also drives borrowing in terms of the way that they operate, and ironically, actually we hear many of them say, hey, we have been pushing for decades now to run more asset-light, which meant less liquidity on hand and maybe we don't want to do that going forward and we're willing to absorb slightly higher debt service costs in favor of being a little bit more liquid, and that would be helpful to us in terms of the borrowing. So I don't think so, Gerard. It just - we got to see our way through to the other side of this, because you can't get labor, you can't get inventory. It's hard to grow. Yes, sure. Bill, it's Tim. I'll take that. I think the growth, if you look at new client relationships and otherwise, is very strong in the commercial business in the Southeast. So they are contributing just disproportionately to that incremental fee income, but I wouldn't tell you that it is focused exclusively on the Southeast. If you look at our new commercial relationships, about 30% of them this year are lead with treasury management, and then there's another percentage, which I don't have off the top of my head, but which has come to us primarily through the capital markets business. So we are having good success using those products as wedge opportunities to drive new relationships. If you look forward, I think we're trying to build what is a really nicely diversified capital markets business with low activities like rates and commodities hedging and otherwise to complement the M&A advisory business and what we do on equities with what we do on the bond market. I mean, what we continue to anticipate is at some point here, the capital markets will be a little bit less accommodative. We'll get the benefit of that in loan balances, but you'll see some lightening on bond fees. But the other side of it is, we're sitting on an M&A pipeline now, which is almost double what it was in January 1 of this year. So we do have a nice M&A advisory pipeline that should come behind it. On the treasury management side, we've pretty consistently grown at the rate of the industry plus two to three percentage points. I am of the belief that we can do better than that, but it's definitely better to be taking share there over time than it is to have the alternative situations. We feel good about both of those fee lines over the near to medium term. Peter, it's Tim. I would tell you it's primarily issues with supply chain and labor, like Greg said, and not liquidity. If you're looking for green shoots, I think that borrowers who are either smaller or who will rely on structures that look more like asset-based lending structures are starting to tap their lines.

            "name": "Jamie Leonard",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We are very pleased with the financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported results for the quarter included a $37 million reduction in fee income for the negative mark related to the Visa total return swap. Our improved business performance throughout the bank resulted in strong return metrics. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.43% and an adjusted ROTCE, excluding AOCI, of 19.7%. Our adjusted earnings per share were a record for the Bancorp. We generated healthy PPNR results, the strongest since before the pandemic, with net interest income growing 3% sequentially, continued success growing and diversifying non-interest income, and diligent expense management. Improvements in credit quality this quarter resulted in a $159 million release to our credit reserve, resulting in an ACL ratio of 206 basis points compared to 219 basis points last quarter. With historically low charge-offs of just 16 basis points this quarter and an improved economic outlook, we recorded a $115 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement, net interest income increased $32 million sequentially, reflecting our ability to effectively manage the balance sheet despite the environmental headwinds from low-interest rates and elevated paydowns, given capital market conditions. Our NII growth was driven by average loan growth of 1% and $11 million of incremental prepayment penalty benefits from our bullet and locked-out cash flow strategy in our investment portfolio, which that position remains a 58% at quarter-end. Our loan balances benefited from the additional $1 billion of Ginnie Mae forbearance loan buyout purchases in early April, bringing the total third-party purchases to $3.7 billion. The other NII benefits were from a higher day count and not replacing long-term debt maturities, partially offset by the impact of declining average commercial loan balances and lower loan yields. PPP related interest income was $53 million this quarter, unchanged relative to the prior quarter. On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs by another basis point this quarter to 5 basis points and also have maturities of approximately $2.3 billion of long-term debt. With most deposit products at or near their assumed floors, the remaining liability management benefits going forward will likely be limited to CDs and reductions in long-term debt balances due to maturities. Reported NIM increased 1 basis point compared to the prior quarter, as the aforementioned investment portfolio, long-term debt, and Ginnie Mae loan buyout impacts were partially offset by the decline in commercial loan balances and lower loan yields. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash, increased 2 basis points to 312 basis points. With a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion in excess liquidity, we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise, while also remaining well hedged if rates remain low, given our securities portfolio and derivatives. Total reported non-interest income decreased just 1% sequentially. Adjusted non-interest income increased 1%, driven by record commercial banking revenue, with strength in loan syndications and financial risk management products, solid card and processing revenue from higher credit and debit interchange revenue reflecting the robust economic rebound, and an increase in both commercial and consumer deposit fees. These increases were partially offset by sequential declines in mortgage and lease syndications. Top line mortgage banking revenue decreased $8 million sequentially, reflecting incremental margin pressure. Production was strong during the quarter in both the retail and correspondent channels, with second quarter originations of $5 billion, up 7% sequentially. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted non-interest income increased 15%, with strength in deposit service charges, commercial banking revenue, wealth and asset management, and card and processing revenue, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business and the robust economic rebound over the past year. The performance and resilience of our fee income levels over the past several quarters highlight the benefit of the revenue diversification that we have achieved. Non-interest expense decreased 5% compared to the first quarter, reflecting declines in compensation and benefits expenses, lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiations, and disciplined expense management throughout the bank. This was partially offset by expenses linked to strong business performance, as well as servicing expenses associated with loan purchases, and a $12 million mark-to-market impact from our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, which had a corresponding offset in security gains. For the full year, we expect to incur around $50 million in third-party servicing expense for purchased loans. Our compensation-related expense growth this year continues to be proportionate to the success we are seeing in our fee-based businesses. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 15% compared to 4% expense growth. Additionally, compared to the pre-pandemic levels of the second quarter of 2019, total adjusted fees have increased 14% compared to expense growth of just 3%. Moving to the balance sheet, total average loans and leases were up 1% sequentially, as consumer loan growth was partially offset by a decline in commercial loans. Additionally, period-end loans were up 1%, excluding PPP. Average total consumer loans increased 4%, as ongoing strength in the auto portfolio and the impact of Ginnie Mae loans purchased were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances, reflecting the continued impacts of government stimulus. Average commercial loans declined 1% compared to the prior quarter, largely driven by PPP forgiveness and elevated payoffs, which were partially offset by strong production across most of our verticals and throughout our middle market footprint. Production was up 10% compared to the prior quarter and up over 20% compared to the pre-pandemic levels of the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of PPP, our end of period C&I loans were up slightly sequentially, as client sentiment and business activities in several industries are showing signs of stabilization. Revolver utilization of 31% was flat compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the market liquidity and capital markets conditions. We are encouraged by the fact that we have successfully retained virtually all clients throughout the pandemic, which will enable us to further deepen and grow these relationships going forward. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially with end of period balances declining 3%. Our securities portfolio increased 1% this quarter. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows, but we'll remain patient on deploying the excess cash. We will continue to be opportunistic as the economic environment evolves. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to increase our cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point level. We remain optimistic that strong economic growth in the second half of 2021 and an eventual Fed tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive risk-return opportunities in the future. Average short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, remain elevated due to continued strength in core deposit balances, which have grown 10% year-over-year. We are seeing strength in both consumer and commercial deposits. Compared to the prior quarter, average core deposits increased 3%. About two-thirds of the balance growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis has come from consumer, reflecting continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and strong household growth. Moving to credit, our strong credit performance once again this quarter reflects our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and prudent balance sheet management, while also benefiting from continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and improvement in the broader economy. The second quarter net charge-off ratio of 16 basis points was historically low and improved 11 basis points sequentially. Non-performing assets declined 16% or $126 million. The NPA ratio declined 11 basis points sequentially to 61 basis points, which is comparable to the fourth quarter of 2019. Also, our criticized assets declined 16%, with significant improvements in retail non-essential, leisure and healthcare, as well as in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios. However, we continue to focus on non-owner occupied commercial real estate, particularly central business district hotels. Moving to the ACL, our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes that labor market continues to improve and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% by the first quarter of 2022 and ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $169 million reserve release. Conversely, applying 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $763 million build. Inclusive of the impact of approximately $108 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.15%. Additionally, excluding the $3.7 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.22%. While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out, given the uncertain environment. We continue to monitor the COVID situation, which could still impact many businesses, particularly those we have identified as being in highly impacted industries, or reverse, the rising consumer confidence trends. Our June 30th allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment with lower unemployment and continued improving credit quality. Moving to capital, our capital levels remained strong in the second quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.4%, which is $1.3 billion above our stated target of 9.5%. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 3% during the quarter. As a Category Four institution, Fifth Third was not subject to the latest Federal Reserve stress test and we did not opt-in. At the end of June, the Fed notified us that our FCB would be 2.5% effective July 1st, which is the floor under the regulatory capital rules. Without the floor, a buffer would have been approximately 2.1%. During the quarter, we completed $347 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by approximately 9 million shares compared to the first quarter. As Greg mentioned, we expect to repurchase approximately $850 million of shares in the second half of 2021, while also increasing our common dividend in September. We also announced our acquisition of Provide this quarter. We will utilize approximately 20 basis points of CET1 upon closing. This financially compelling acquisition of an asset generation engine dovetails perfectly with our existing strategic focus on digital enablement and generating profitable growth on our balance sheet. We believe in Provide's strong growth prospects. From an origination standpoint, they have produced $300 million in the first half of 2021, of which Fifth Third purchased approximately 80%. We expect second half originations to be around $400 million, and given the expected early August closing, virtually all of that will go on our balance sheet. We expect over $1 billion in originations in 2022 and could grow to over $2 billion annually within a few years. Moving to our current outlook, for the full year, we expect average total loan balances to be stable compared to last year, reflecting continued pressure from PPP forgiveness and paydowns in commercial, combined with low double-digit growth in consumer. We continue to expect CRE balances to remain stable in this environment. We continue to expect our underlying NIM to be in the 305 basis point area for the full year. Combined with our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% this year, assuming stable security balances and incorporating all PPP impacts. On a sequential basis, we expect NII to decline around 2%, given the impacts of the securities portfolio prepayment income we experienced in the second quarter that we do not assume will repeat in our outlook, as well as an assumed decline in PPP income. Within our NII guidance, we expect approximately $165 million in PPP related interest income for 2021, of which $106 million was realized in the first half of the year compared to $100 million in 2020 and approximately $50 million expected in 2022. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect approximately $40 million in PPP income. Therefore, excluding PPP impacts, we would expect third quarter NII to decline around 1% compared to the second quarter, or up over 2% from the third quarter of 2020. Given the continued strength throughout our businesses, we expect full year fees to increase 7% to 8% compared to 2020 or 8% to 9%, excluding the impact of the TRA. Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy, as well as our ongoing success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger processing revenue, capital markets fees, and wealth and asset management revenue, which will be partially offset by mortgage declines. Additionally, as we discussed in January, we expect to generate private equity gains from several of our direct investments in venture capital funds throughout 2021, potentially exceeding the 2020 level of $75 million. We have recognized around $30 million in gains through the first half of 2021, which we expect to double in the second half of 2021. We expect third quarter total fees to be relatively stable from the second quarter, and would be up mid to high-single digits year-over-year. In the mortgage business, we expect revenue throughout the second half of the year to benefit from lower asset decay and higher servicing fees. The top-line revenue is expected to decline high single-digits year-over-year due to continued headwinds from margin compression. Our fee outlook does not incorporate a pre-tax gain of approximately $60 million associated with the sale of our HSA business that is expected to close in the third quarter. We do plan to redeploy half of that gain in the third quarter, split evenly between a $15 million donation to the Fifth Third Foundation that will complete our previously announced philanthropy commitment to accelerating racial equality and inclusion in our communities and a $15 million additional marketing program, supporting momentum given the upside potential we see in that product. We expect full-year expenses to be up 2% to 3%, given our strong revenue outlook and the continued servicing costs from the loan portfolio purchases, as well as the incremental expenses associated with the Provide acquisition. On a sequential basis, we expect expenses to be down 1%, excluding the redeployment of half of the HSA gain. As we recently discussed, we expect to consolidate 42 branches, primarily in our legacy Midwest footprint, which we expect to complete in early 2022. Additionally, we've opened five branches so far this year and plan to add approximately 25 more Southeast in market de novo branches in the second half of 2021. All run rate branch impacts are included in our outlook. We've generated year-over-year positive operating leverage this quarter and we expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage for the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses, and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be 20 basis points to 25 basis points, given the strong first half performance and assuming our base case scenario continues to play out. Third quarter losses are likely to be in the 15 basis point to 20 basis point range. In summary, our second quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Yes, Ken, it's, Jamie. Thanks for the question. The one thing we are proud of at Fifth Third is how much we've reduced our exposure on the consumer side, from a unit a punitive fee standpoint and how we are, I would say, a very consumer-focused and consumer-friendly bank. I think 3% or so of our revenue was in consumer overdrafts and our peers are significantly higher than those levels. We expect to continue to improve upon that with the Momentum bank offering and some of the features that Greg talked about in his prepared remarks. So I think you can continue to expect that from us and that if we were to have any future changes on overdraft policies or fees would only be to the positive and that we would more than make up for it with the incremental volume from Momentum. I don't know, Tim, if there's anything else you want to add? Very good question actually, because what we've seen is that, given we were a first mover in this product and it's far back as the third quarter of 2020 when we bought our own pools and then helped structure these additional purchases that we've done, totaling $3.7 billion thus far to date, I would say that the economics were certainly more attractive if you were in the first mover stage, and the economics have really waned to the point that we would not be pursuing additional purchases at these levels. It's Jamie, I'll take that one. When you look at the quarter, with the ACL release of $159 million, we had that split fairly evenly between the consumer portfolio and the commercial portfolio, and the decline was essentially driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook versus the prior quarter. When you look ahead, we continue to overweight non-baseline scenarios at 20%. So the upside is 20%, the base is 60%, and the downside is 20%. And that's really driven by the uncertainty in the environment, including the vaccine efficacy and frankly this week's concerns highlight that risk. So when you look at the asymmetrical nature of the upside and downside scenarios, that weighting versus the 80%, 10%, 10% on CECL day 1 generates about a $90 million higher reserve. So I guess the first part to your fairly complicated question is that the scenario weightings do matter, and we expect to maintain the 60%, 20%, 20%, while this period of uncertainty continues to exist. And then relative to Day 1, it really is a tale of two portfolios. So when you look at the commercial side, to get back to those Day 1 adoption reserve rates, you really do need to see a sustained strengthening in the credit characteristics of the borrowers that are most at risk to the longer-term negative impacts from the pandemic. And so that would have to occur in conjunction with improving economic forecasts above our current expectations. But then when you look at the consumer side, we're actually already below the CECL day 1 level. We're at 1.99% at the end of the second quarter versus the 2.46% on CECL Day 1, and that's driven by the combination of the loan mix, as well as improvements in real estate and auto collateral values experienced since the adoption of CECL, as well as the economic forecasts for the - at the end of the second quarter, and then we've had an improvement in credit quality in auto and card, as well as in the delinquency rate. So consumer is already there, but commercial, again, we have to have things play out differently than what we - better than what we currently expect. I think if you look back at our actions in the first quarter, to answer the second part of your question, if you look back at our first quarter actions, we did leg into a little bit of additional investment portfolio buildup at that point in time. We pre-invested $1 billion of our second quarter cash flows, and then given the entry points and - of rally in the bond market, decided to maintain that additional leverage throughout the quarter. So we did grow the book a little bit in the second quarter. Our guide assumes we hold it fairly stable as the year progresses, because we don't expect to get to those 2% or a better entry point, but should the market get there, we would leg into the trade and not do everything all at once. But when you look at our additional $30 billion of excess liquidity that we're sitting on, we've earmarked about a third of that to go into the investment portfolio. So to get $10 billion of purchases done would certainly take some time and we've ramped that up over time. And our goal here is, we sit through peer results and actions versus ours and we certainly are an outlier in terms of being, I think, more prudent and more cautious to deploying at these low rates, our goal is, let's maximize our NII over the next five years, not over the next 12 months. And we think ultimately this is the better outcome and the Fed will eventually taper, not sure when that will be, but when the largest bond buyer in the world is price indiscriminate in their purchases every month, it certainly distorts the market. So eventually, that distortion is going to end and we think we'll get better entry points than what we see today. And then in terms of the first part of your question, the growth in the yield this quarter in the investment portfolio is really the benefit of what we did five years ago with structuring the portfolio to be more weighted to bullet and locked-out cash flows so that to the extent there are prepayments in the portfolio, the make-whole provisions provide a nice pickup in investment yield. And as we - we never include those in our outlook, so that - the guide on NII might look soft on the surface, but if things continue to be the same then obviously NII will outperform the guide, should those prepayment penalties continue to occur. We're sitting on almost $2 billion of gains in the investment portfolio. Yes. It's Jamie. The - Yes, the $15 million incremental spend over the second quarter marketing spend level of $20 million, and we expect to spend $35 million of marketing in the third quarter, that should abate going forward. However, if it is successful, then we'll continue to program at that elevated level and until we've really captured as much of the first-mover advantage with the product as we can. So for the $3.7 billion of loans that we purchased from other third-party servicers, we have a - there is a nominal amount of fees assumed in the outlook related to that as they get resold to the servicer. The bigger economic opportunity is on the $750 million forbearance loans that we bought going back from Ginnie Mae on our own production, as well as within our resi mortgage portfolio to the extent that there are any on non-accrual or delinquents that cure, we do have - we have had sales this year that generate several million dollars in fees and we expect to do that over the next 6, 7 quarters as well. So I think it's more of a run rate normal course of business than it is any one-time top. Yes, given the excess liquidity that we have, there is clearly not a need to maintain the higher unsecured debt levels that we have. We have an additional maturity in the third quarter we'll most likely not replace that's about $850 million, almost 3% rate. So there is a little bit left to go in terms of improvement along with running down the wholesale CD book, but those benefits are baked into our outlook. So I would not expect it to get better than what we've guided to from the right-hand side of the sheet. I think the opportunity for us, from an NII improvement standpoint, will be on the left-hand side of the sheet. Relatively stable on commercial. I would say John, I would say, full year commercial average loans would be down mid-single digits, and ex-PPP a little bit more than that, but ending the year with a little bit of a - a little closer to stable. And then PPP is - we've been running steadily down as the year as the year has progressed, where on an end of period basis, we finished the first quarter at 5.4 billion, we finished the second quarter at $3.7 billion. That will continue to drift down to $2.1 billion at the end of the third, and then a $1.7 billion at year-end is our current projection on PPP. Yes, our goal is certainly to get to the 9.5% by June of 2022. And yes, it is certainly a large amount of repurchases. I think the two factors to bake into it would be, there's 20 basis points of CET1 erosion from the Provide acquisition in the third quarter and then 9 basis points of CECL transition in the first quarter of 2022, so that - a little bit of capital gets spent there. But yes, to your point, we have a lot of capital deployment opportunity ahead of us to get to the 9.5%. And certainly if loan growth doesn't materialize, then we'll look to continue it at the 9.5%. And then we do feel that should loan growth accelerate, we certainly have a buffer from where we think we need to run the company from a capital perspective. Clearly, from the credit outcomes you're seeing we could run the balance sheet, I think, at 9% or so if loan growth were to accelerate, but for now, our focus is just getting to the 9.5% by midyear next year. Sure. The second quarter was obviously very strong from a margin perspective, and we're pleased with how our balance sheet has been performing. But given the high levels of PPP, as well as the investment securities prepayment penalties that we don't expect to recur or at least don't forecast to recur, we would expect to see the NIM decline a bit to a more normalized level, which is that 305 basis point areas what we've talked about. But I think, pretty much all year in terms of what we think this balance sheet should stabilize that certainly for the foreseeable future. So NIM should come down, call it 5 basis points or so in the third quarter. I would say the big drivers there, certainly the PPP, the prepayment penalties, a little bit of day count, and otherwise still maintain that floor of 305 basis point or better. So the total portfolio is of 4.9 duration and so the bullet - when we quote the 58% number, we're saying it's bullet and locked-out for at least the next two years, but the duration of that portfolio is not that different from the portfolio in total. Correct, but there's not a step-down. For a while, we had quoted a 12-month and then we got the questions, so we expanded to 24, but there's not a cliff here. It's just a slow erosion over time."

            "name": "Greg Carmichael",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported second quarter net income of $709 million or $0.94 per share. On an adjusted basis, we earned $0.98 per share. Once again, our financial results were very strong, continuing the positive momentum from the past several quarters. During the quarter, we generated sequential PPNR growth of 15% on an adjusted basis, a growth of 6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Commercial loan production increased 10% from last quarter, with strength in middle-market across our footprint, as well as in corporate banking. We generated strong consumer household growth of 4% compared to last year, and we also experienced historically low net charge-offs of 16 basis points, reflecting improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. We generated an adjusted ROTCE of nearly 20% for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting strong business and credit results across the franchise. Our results were supported by our continued improvement in our diversified businesses. In fact, we achieved record results in several of our fee-based businesses, including commercial banking and wealth and asset management. Despite continued pressure from low interest rates, net interest income increased 3% sequentially and the underlying NIM increased 2 basis points. We believe that our disciplined approach to managing the balance sheet, including our securities and hedge portfolios, will continue to generate differentiated performance relative to peers. We also continue to maintain our expense discipline, while still investing for long-term outperformance. As a result of our strong revenue growth combined with our expense management, we generated positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 58%. We are prioritizing investments to drive further operational efficiencies to improve our resiliency, generate household growth, and improve the customer experience. To that end, we recently announced and expanded partnership with FIS to modernize our core deposit and wealth systems to the cloud, which will enable us to further our digital transformation. This will significantly improve the flexibility and scalability of our technology infrastructure and accelerate us in the market. Combining this agreement with the renegotiation of our existing payment processing relationship allows us to modernize our platforms, while maintaining an efficient overall cost structure. From a commercial standpoint, loan production this quarter was the highest since before the pandemic, with significant sequential improvement in technology, renewable energy, and manufacturing. However, our strong production was once again offset by elevated pay downs and PPP forgiveness. While we continue to retain the customer and their core banking relationship, loan growth remains muted due to the environment. Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines, and retention of the client relationship, all continue to support the potential for improved loan growth once supply and labor constraints normalize. We currently expect our 31% commercial revolver utilization rate to increase 1% by year-end. On the consumer side, as I mentioned, we once again generated robust household growth. This strong performance reflects our ability to acquire new customers, combined with low attrition, both of which were supported by our branch and digital investments. Our recent Southeast de novo branches have helped contribute to our household growth. On the digital side, we continue to leverage technology and data analytics to deliver solutions that improve the customer experience, increase revenue, and drive efficiencies. We recently launched Fifth Third Momentum Banking across our footprint, a banking value proposition unparalleled in our industry. Momentum combines the best of a traditional bank offering with several leading fintech capabilities, including Early Pay, which gives customers free access to their paycheck up to two days early; Extra Time, which allows customers to cure an overdraft until midnight the following business day without a fee; MyAdvance, which gives customers short-term on-demand liquidity advances, smart savings, and other features, all provided with no monthly fee. Our strategy to keep the customer at the center has significantly reduced our reliance on punitive consumer deposit fees, including overdrafts and ATM fees, where Fifth Third has been among the lowest compared to peers for several years. Fifth Third Momentum Banking has put efforts to help customers avoid unnecessary fees. As I mentioned, during the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses, reflecting historically low net charge-offs, combined with a stronger economic outlook. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs. In addition to historically low credit losses, our criticized assets and NPAs once again improved this quarter. Criticized assets declined another 16% and our NPA ratio declined 11 basis points sequentially. Our balance sheet and earnings power remain very strong. Our CET1 ratio of 10.4% was relatively stable compared to last quarter, despite share repurchases of $347 million in the second quarter. As we have said before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic non-bank opportunities, dividend increases, and share repurchases. Additionally, our capital position and earnings capacity support an increase in our common dividend, starting in the third quarter. We currently expect to request a $0.03 increase to our quarterly dividend in September, subject to Board approval and economic conditions. We also expect to execute share repurchases totaling approximately $850 million in the second half of 2021, and continue to target a 9.5% CET1 by June 2022. We recently announced the strategic acquisition of Provide, a fintech healthcare practice finance firm. Provide focuses on the dental, veterinarian, and vision segments and delivers digital capabilities, which support a best-in-class experience and speed to close. Provide previously utilized an originate to sell model. As a result, the closing of the acquisition will not include a transfer of loan balances. However, post close, Fifth will retain all loan originations. We currently hold around $400 million in loans generated by Provide and have non-credit relationships with over 70% of these borrowers through deposit in our treasury management products. The acquisition is expected to close in early August and will utilize approximately 20 basis points of capital. In summary, we believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues, and continued focus on discipline throughout the company will serve us well this year and beyond. We remain committed to generating sustainable long-term value and consistently producing top-quartile results. I once again like to thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers. Our commitment to generate sustainable value for stakeholders is evident in our second annual ESG report published in June. This expands our last year's report with increased transparency, including enhanced disclosures of priority topics such as inclusion and diversity, our climate strategy, and our commitment to fair and responsible banking. We remain guided by our purpose, vision, and core values and expect to continue delivering strong results over the long term. With that, I will turn it over to Jamie to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook. Well, let me start, then I'll forward to Jamie or Tim for additional color. First off, it's - right now, there's a lot of uncertainty out here right now as we're dealing with the labor shortage and the supply chain disruptions, which are extremely real and you see it across the Board in all conversation with our customers. But that said, we back to pretty much pre-pandemic global production numbers, but payoffs continue to be stout, and obviously you got something like PPP. So when you think about the environment in front of us, I think loan growth, as we continue to beat the challenge as we go through the rest of the year. I think we offset that by our strengths in our fee businesses, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, that compensate for some of those challenges, but I do think this changes over time [technical difficulty] every 1% to $750 million. So there's a lot of upside opportunity there. At some point, labor shortage and supply chain constraints start to abate, if we pick up the benefit of that. We also added about $2.4 million new commitments since the beginning of the year and continue to acquire new households in commercial relationships. We're very, very positive. As to what the future might hold, we've got some economic and some environmental challenges in front of us that we have to continue to deal with. Okay, that's a lot there. So let me try and dissect that a little bit for you. First off, the FIS announcement we just made is a continuation of a relationship that's been in place for quite some time, this replacement of our [indiscernible] core deposit platforms. But we've been on this journey to re-engineer our technical infrastructure, focusing on the actual resiliency, the skills of our businesses, replace our HR platform Workday. We completed our enterprise data strategy, we completely re-platformed mortgage FIS environment. So the FIS is the natural extension of the continuation of the modernization of those activities. We also re-engineered and restructured pricing agreement of our legacy relationship with FIS that could help make that - the cost associated with that implementation of the new FIS components, a lot more reasonable but guess for us, we will manage our costs going forward. So we're pretty pleased with the way that came out. As far as a competitive advantage, listen, I think at the end of the day, this is a long game. We have to continue to refresh our platforms, we got to continue to modernize our platforms to the cloud. I think every bank is trying to get this right. So whether it becomes a competitive advantage or not, I think it's a requirement, I mean it basic table stakes to be the business to be a digital bank. Our customers expect the bank anywhere anytime, we have to have platforms that are always on. So that's just a re-transformation of our business. We have to repurpose our expense dollars from the legacy brick-and-mortar infrastructure and we got to continue to reinvest in technology. So we're going to continue to do that, and I think the banks that don't do that are going to be at a competitive disadvantage. But many banks, as you've already heard, are continuing to focus on core modernization, and we're going to be just doing the same thing. We're think we have a great strategy for that monetization and for bringing in new technologies. We have a buy-partner-build strategy that we work on very hard. If the technology is already out there, we buy it. If we can't buy it, can partner. And if we can't partner, we build it. Momentum is an example of that. You have partnerships like GreenSky and Exchange thanks systems covered bond due to her list and our recent acquisition of Provide. So we - I think we've got a good strategy for moving quickly, but it is going to take time to get all the legacy stuff re-platformed, but net-net, once again, I think it may not be a competitive advantage at the end of the day, but definitely will be a requirement to be in this business in the future. Yes, it's a good question, and honestly, I wouldn't respond immediately with the variant of COVID and what that could mean to the slowing down the economy and not getting the robust recovery we're all hoping for in credit risk. But I think right now, as I mentioned earlier, Gerard, I think about every customer I sit down with since that we have a conversation. I mean, you're seeing it in various ways, labor shortage, supply chain constraints, significant issues out there right now. You're seeing that in backlogs, order delays, restaurants not being able to open, small businesses not open full time, can't get labor. So it's a big challenge right now. And when does that start to abate? When does that start to correct itself? I'm not sure when that is. I believe it will have to, obviously, but to - when is that, later this year, is that the next year. So I think that's going to put a lot of pressure, inventory levels are extremely low compared with the demand that is out there, we're not seeing that tick up right now. Line utilization, it looks kind of flat right now, but we are not seeing that tick-up that we were hoping to see. So those are all kind of concerns that I have right now. Obviously, inflation is another concern out there, we've been watching that, how the Fed manages through that complexity, and more to come on that. But now, I think, overall the economy is fairly healthy. We just got some challenges still in front of us that haven't been understood yet. Tim has... First off, there's not a lot of these opportunities out there. We - the economics of the GreenSky relationship as we went in as an investor have made a lot of sense for us. This is not how we grow our business over time, we're much more relationship business. That's why the Provide acquisition was extremely important. You think about Provide, that was a partnership originally, we had about $400 million in asset, the 70% of those relationships, we had additional relationship outside the credit facility, whether it be TM or deposit relationship. So that was important, the relationship type of opportunity for us, and that's what we're looking for to continue to enhance our business and grow our businesses. GreenSky created another channel for us, but yes, that's a non-relationship business for us. And those opportunities that makes sense to us are a very few out there, but the GreenSky one does for the economics of the transaction in place. Yes, it's a great question. I wish I knew the answer to that. I do know we would typically - run at 36%, 37% as I mentioned, every 1% of our $750 million assets. So, we're running at 31% kind of flat line rate there. I can't really - we're hopeful, but I - like I tell my team, hope is not a strategy, we're hopeful we'll start to see that tick up a little bit based on the production levels that we're seeing out there right now. Hope we can get some of these challenges that are in front us on a supply chain and labor front maybe abating a little later this year, but when to get it is a tough thing to say. When do we get back to a normalized run rate? It's going to be awhile. I mean, it's going to be in quarters, not - maybe a year plus before we get there, I believe. Yes. I think, first off, I would respond by saying our focus is on non-bank transactions that enhance our product and service capabilities like Provide, would be a great example of that. So we'll stay focused there for the most part. If the right opportunity presents itself in a market that's attractive to us, that consoles would be financial [indiscernible] Chicago, obviously, we always consider those types of opportunities, but the [indiscernible] another focus to the organization. As far as Biden's executive order, listen, it's still a lot of work to be done. The agencies, the OCC, Fed, FERC, and DOJ are trying to figure out what that means. So more to come on that, but you can believe as I do that transactions - the economics of transactions could be more challenging going forward. It is an executive order and the timeline to get those transactions approved, they take a little bit longer, but good transactions will get done. Well, listen, obviously, with the picture changing right now, there is still a process on the CFPB front from a nomination perspective. So is the changed - this has been - it's - I don't believe it's changed to be honest with you. I think the agencies have a job to do and a role to play, and I think the focus of the CFPB and the OCC and the FDIC are going to be making sure that there is the safety and soundness, but also the way that - the way the banks handle themselves and operate are going to be extremely important. So I haven't sensed a big shift in - with the new administration on requirements and demands of the other bank in the totality, so to speak, from the top as to what they expect from us. So it's not something that keeps me up at night. Let's put it that way. Thank you."

[Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations.\nChris Doll: Thank you, Melissa. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing Fifth Third's financial results for the first quarter of 2020. Please review the cautionary statements and our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to the non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined by our CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Jamie Leonard; President, Tim Spence; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg to his comment.\nGreg Carmichael: Thanks Chris. And thank all of you for joining us this morning. Hope you're all well and staying healthy. Earlier today, we reported first quarter net income of $694 million from $0.93 per share. We continued our positive momentum from the past several quarters and once again deliver strong financial results in the first quarter. These strong results reflect record commercial bank and fee revenue, continued success generating consumer household growth and a strong underlying net interest margin. Our performance reflects focused execution on our key strategic priorities. We continue to benefit from the diversification, resilience of our fee based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial and wealth and asset management which are generating strong results in helping to cushion the impact of lower short-term rates. We have maintained our discipline clients selection and conservative underwriting, which are evident in our credit metrics. For the quarter, we recorded a benefit in our provision for credit losses, reflecting a stronger economic outlook, as well as historically low net charge-offs, which included improvements in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. In addition to muted credit, losses, our criticize assets and NPLs also improved sequentially. Nonperforming loans decreased 11% from the prior quarter with NPL inflows at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2019. Our balance sheet earnings power remained very strong. As a result, our robust CET1 ratio further improved to 10.5% this quarter. Our CET1 target remains at 9.5%. As we have stated many times before, we are focused on deploying capital for organic growth opportunities, evaluating nonbank opportunities where it fits our strategy, and share repurchases. Based on our current dividend and trailing four quarters of net income, we have the capacity to repurchase shares up to $347 million in the second quarter. After that, we have more flexibility in terms of how and when returning capital to shareholders under the SCD framework. Jamie will provide more details on our capital plan. The improved macroeconomic data and outlook are aligned with our strongest overall commercial loan production since before the pandemic. Furthermore, we have seen our pipeline strengthened considerably over the past 90 days with significant strength in manufacturing, renewables, healthcare and technology, partially offset by new demand in leisure and hospitality and CRE. Production was offset by elevated payoffs and pay downs combined with another 1% decline in line utilization. We retained the customer and their core banking relationship as virtually none of our commercial payoffs during the quarter were the result of client attrition. Additionally, pay downs on our corporate bank larger reflected clients tapping the capital markets, where we benefited significantly from additional capital market fees. Given the strong production trends, firming pipeline and retention of the client relationship, we remain well positioned to take advantage of a more favorable economic backdrop to clients execute their growth plans in the second half of 2021. We will continue to assess the implications of client supply chain constraints as we progress through the year. Consumer employment, savings and spend trends also remained favorable, given the fiscal stimulus, pumped demand and a gradual reopening of the economy throughout our footprint. Despite the overall economic recovery over the past several quarters, I recognize that not everyone in our society has benefited equally. This is why I'm very proud that in addition to producing strong financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. I am particularly pleased that we exceeded our five-year $32 billion commitment to invest in low and moderate income communities by more than $9 billion. We also recently announced a $2.8 billion commitment in support of racial equality focused on lending, investing and financial accessibility. We also announced the new banking practice called Momentum Banking, which competes with the fintechs and is now our flagship mass market banking offering. Momentum Banking provides customers with liquidity solutions in our newly enhanced mobile app to help them avoid unnecessary fees, including immediate access to funds from digital deposits, short term on demand borrowing options, simple goal based savings targets, free customer access to their paycheck to two days earlier, with a qualified direct deposit starting in June, and no monthly service fees. In addition, we were honored to once again be named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere also reflecting our strong corporate culture, compliance program and ESG actions. We were one of just five banks globally to receive this accolade this year. We believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve as well in 2021 and beyond. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value for shareholders, anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top regional bank.  I would like to once again thank our employees. I am very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers in each other over the past year. You have enabled Fifth Third to continue to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities. With that I'll turn over to Jamie to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook.\nJamie Leonard: Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We generated strong returns this quarter, reflecting our solid operating performance and continued improvement in credit quality. We produced an adjusted ROE of 1.4% and an ROTCE excluding AOCI of 19.8%. PPNR results were also strong driven by strength in both NII and fees. Consequently, expenses were elevated relative to our previous guidance due to performance and market linked compensation expenses. We recorded a $244 million release to our credit reserves this quarter, which lowered our ACL ratio from 2.41% to 2.19%. Our historically low charge -offs which came in better than expected, combined with an improving economic outlook versus previous expectations resulted in a $173 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. Continuing with the income statement performance; net interest income declined just 1% sequentially due to the lower date count and a reduction in prepayment penalties received in the securities portfolio compared to the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by the impact of $2.1 billion in government guaranteed residential mortgage forbearance loans purchased from a third party servicer in December and another $600 million in March. We have continued to take action to prudently deploy excess liquidity in order to improve our NII trajectory for 2021. And these loans provided a more attractive risk adjusted return relative to other alternatives. Our first quarter NII results also included approximately $12 million in incremental PPP fees reflecting loan forgiveness, compared to the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we discussed previously, our prior quarter NII results included prepayment penalty income for our investment portfolio, which declined $10 million sequentially. From a liability management perspective, we reduced our interest bearing core deposit costs, another two basis points this quarter, resulting in a cost of only six basis points. Reported NIM increased four basis points sequentially, reflecting a decline in excess cash incremental PPP forgiveness fees and day count, partially offset by the aforementioned securities prepayment penalty income decline. Underlying NIM excluding PPP and excess cash decreased just four basis points to 310 basis points. With a top quartile margin relative to peers and asset sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion in excess liquidity, we believe that we remain well positioned for a higher rate environment while also benefiting from structural protection against lower rates given our securities and hedge portfolios.  Additionally, we have updated our interest rate risk disclosures to reflect a 38% deposit beta to better align with our future expectations based on the last rate hike cycle experience. In a plus 100 basis points scenario where we invest about 1/3 of our excess liquidity over a 12 month period, we would expect annual NII to be about 15% higher compared to a static rate environment. Total reported noninterest income decreased 5%. Adjusted noninterest income excluding the TRA impact increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Our fee performance reflected strength throughout our lines of business, including record commercial banking fees led by robust debt capital markets revenue, mortgage banking revenue driven by strong production, and strong leasing business revenue.  Top line mortgage banking revenue increased $42 million sequentially, reflecting improved execution and strong production in both retail and correspondent which was partially offset by incremental margin pressure. Also, as we discussed in January, our fourth quarter results included a $12 million headwind from our decision to retain a portion of our retail production. Mortgage servicing fees of $59 million and MSR net valuation gains of $18 million were more than offset by asset decay of $81 million. If primary mortgage rates were to move higher, we would expect to see some servicing revenue improvement which would likely be more than offset by production and margin pressures in that environment.  As a result, we currently expect full year mortgage revenue to decline low to mid single digits given our rate outlook. Reported noninterest expenses decreased 2% relative to the fourth quarter. Adjusted expenses were up 3% driven by seasonal items in the first quarter in addition to elevated compensation related expenses linked to strong fee performance, as well as the mark-to-market impact on nonqualified deferred comp plans. Current quarter expenses included $10 million in servicing expenses from our purchase loan portfolios. For the full year, we expect to incur $50 million to $55 million in servicing expenses for purchase loans, including the impact of an additional $1 billion in forbearance pool purchases in April. Moving to the balance sheet; total average loans and leases were flat sequentially. C&I results continued to reflect stronger production levels offset by pay downs. Additionally, revolver utilization rates decreased another 1% this quarter to a record low 31% due to the extraordinary levels of market liquidity and robust capital markets. The sequential decline in utilization came primarily from COVID High Impact industries and our energy vertical. Also, our leverage loan outstandings declined more than 10% sequentially. As Greg mentioned, we are encouraged by the fact that we are retaining customer relationships throughout this environment and are benefiting from the fee opportunities. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially with end of period balances up 2% reflecting draw amounts on prior commitments which were paused during the pandemic. Average total consumer loans were flat sequentially as continued strength in the auto portfolio was offset by declines in home equity, credit card and residential mortgage balances. Auto production in the quarter was strong at $2.2 billion with an average FICO score around 780 with lower advanced rates, higher internal credit scores and better spreads compared to last year. Our securities portfolio increased approximately 1% this quarter as we opportunistically pre invested expected second quarter cash flows of approximately $1 billion during March. With respect to broader securities portfolio positioning, we remain patient, but we will continue to be opportunistic as the environment evolves. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to increase our cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point range. We are optimistic that strong economic growth in the second half of 2021 will present more attractive risk return opportunities. We continue to feel very good about our investment portfolio positioning with 57% of the investment portfolio invested in bullet and locked out cash flows at quarter end. Our securities portfolio had $2 million of net discount accretion in the first quarter and our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained strong at $2.4 billion pretax. Average other short term investments which includes interest bearing cash decreased $2 billion sequentially and increase $30 billion compared to the year ago quarter. The unprecedented excess cash levels are the result of record deposit growth over the past year. Core deposits were flat compared to the fourth quarter as growth in consumer transaction deposits impacted by the fiscal stimulus was offset by seasonal declines in commercial transaction deposits, and a reduction in consumer CD balances. We are experiencing strong deposit growth so far in April and expect low single digit growth in the second quarter from both consumer and commercial customers. Moving to credit. Our overall credit quality continues to reflect our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting, prudent management of our balance sheet exposures, and the continued improvement of the macroeconomic environment. The first quarter net charge-off ratio of 27 basis points improved 16 basis points sequentially. Nonperforming assets declined $81 million, or 9%, with the resulting NPA ratio of 72 basis points, declining seven basis points sequentially. Also, our criticized assets declined 8% with considerable improvements in casinos, restaurants and leisure travel, as well as in our energy and leverage loan portfolios, partially offset by continued pressure in commercial real estate particularly central business district hotels. Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes the labor market continues to improve with unemployment reaching 5% by the middle of next year, and ending our three year RNS period in this low 4% range. As a result, this scenario assumes most of the labor market disruption created by the pandemic and resulting government programs is resolved by 2024, but still leaves a persistent employment gap of a few million jobs compared to pre COVID expectations. Additionally, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from the administration's recent fiscal stimulus and assumes an infrastructure package over a $1 trillion is passed this year. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and down side scenarios, applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $169 million released to our reserve.  Conversely, applying 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $788 million bill, inclusive of the impact of approximately $109 million and remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.29%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserves, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.4%. With the recent economic recovery and our base case expectations point to further improvement, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out given the uncertain environment. Like all of you, we continue to closely watch COVID case and vaccination trends, which could impact the timing of reopening of local economies and reverse the strengthening consumer confidence trends. Our March 31 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth, lower unemployment and improving credit quality, including the expected benefits of government programs. Moving to capital; our capital remains strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio grew during the quarter ending at 10.5% above our stated target of 9.5%, which amounts to approximately $1.4 billion of excess capital. Our tangible book value per share excluding AOCI is up 8% since the year ago quarter. During the quarter, we completed $180 million in buybacks, which reduced our share count by approximately 5 million shares compared to the fourth quarter. As Greg mentioned, we have the capacity to repurchase up to $347 million in the second quarter based on our current dividend and the Federal Reserve's average trailing four quarters of net income framework. As a category four bank, we expect to have additional flexibility with respect to capital distributions starting in the third quarter. As prudent stewards of capital we expect to get closer to our CET1 target by mid-2022. While we did not participate in CCAR 2021, we are required to submit our board approved capital plan to the Fed. Those plans support the potential to raise our dividend in the third quarter and repurchase over $800 million in the second half of 2021. Moving to our current outlook; for the full year, we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up a bit compared to last year reflecting relative stability in commercial combined with low single digit growth in consumer, which includes the additional $1 billion in Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases in April. We continue to expect CRE to remain stable in this environment. Our loan outlook assumes commercial revolver utilization rates migrate closer to 33% by year end, and also includes the impact of $2 billion in loan balances we expect to add from the latest round of PPP, including the $1.7 billion we've generated to date, which will continue to be offset by forgiveness throughout the year. We expect our underlying NIM to be in the 305 area for the full year. Combined with our loan outlook, we expect NII to decline just 1% this year, assuming stable securities balances. On a sequential basis, we expect NII to be stable to up 1%. Within our NII guidance, we assume we generate approximately $150 million in PPP related interest income in 2021, of which $53 million was realized in the first quarter compared to $100 million in the full year of 2020. We expect full year fees to increase 4% to 5% compared to 2020, or 5% to 6% excluding the impact of the TRA. Improvement from our previous guide reflects a more robust economic rebound as well as our continued success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger processing revenue, capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue, which will be partially offset by mortgage.  We expect second quarter fees to decline 3% to 5% reflecting lower mortgage and leasing revenues, partially offset by low single digit growth in card and processing and treasury management revenue. We expect relatively stable commercial banking revenues sequentially. Given both our stronger fee and NII outlook combined with the servicing costs from the loan portfolio purchases, we expect full year expenses to be up 1% driven by volume based compensation and other expenses. On a sequential basis, we expect expenses to decline 5% to 7%.  We expect to generate positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021 reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee based businesses, and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 30 to 40 basis point range given the strong first quarter performance, and assuming our base case scenario continues to play out. Second quarter losses are likely to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range. In summary, our first quarter results were strong and continued to demonstrate the progress we made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of discipline client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us very well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChris Doll: Before we start Q&A as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. Operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first response is from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research.\nBillCarcache: Thank you and good morning. I wanted to ask about your investments specifically in the southeast. You're obviously managing expenses for the revenue environment. But can you talk about the priorities with the investment dollars were allocated to the southeast? Where are those investments being made? And have we started to see the returns from those investments come through already in loan growth NII and fee trends that we saw this quarter? Just a little bit more color on the return timeline would be helpful.\nGregCarmichael: Fantastic. This is Greg, first of all, thanks for the question. Listen, we continue to be bullish on our investments and our strength and our southeast markets. To remind you, these are markets we're already in. That we have a presence, it's really about being a better provider of products and services in those markets and really taking advantage of the opportunities this market create for us. We couldn't be more pleased to date with the progress we've seen in that market, especially if you look at household growth, new customer acquisition, strength of our commercial businesses, and those in the southeast markets. So the progress we made to date, we're going to continue to invest in those markets, as it makes sense. From other investment perspective, obviously, we balance our investments for the greatest return for our shareholders. But right now, we think the southeast is still a good place for us to continue to invest until we get to the scale and take advantage of the opportunities that are out there. And, Tim, you may want to add a few things on the progress. \nTimSpence: Yes. So good question. Just to add to what Greg said, when we announced the build out of the de novo strategy in the markets in the southeast, we announced that we were going to build about 120 branches only about 30 of those have come online. But those 30 branches collectively are contributing almost 10% of our new household production this year. So we're seeing some benefit there. But a lot still to come as we add another 30 plus branches in the southeast this year and another 35 next year. On the commercial banking and wealth management side of the equation, I think we've talked in the past about the additions we have made in the southeast on the fee income side of the business; both Coker Capital and HTC are headquartered down there and have strong southeast presences. But we also talked about adding 30 additional middle market bankers to the southeast. And only about seven of those positions were filled in the first quarter with another 10 offers outstanding. So very clearly those benefits are not yet in the run rate. But we've been very pleased with the quality and talent that we are able to attract. We expect that to continue to further accelerate the shift in the business mix between the Midwest and the southeast markets.\nBillCarcache: That's really helpful. Thank you. As a follow up, can you speak to your asset sensitivity and any plans to alter it from here and then maybe just discuss how you're thinking about the potential for layering any swaps from where we are currently?\nJamieLeonard: Yes, it's Jamie. Thanks for the question. We did, as I said in our prepared remarks, update our asset sensitivity disclosures to, I think be a little more transparent and give you our views of how we see the next rate hike cycle playing out. So we did change our deposit betas from 70% down to 38%. So with that in mind, obviously that reflects a very asset sensitive balance sheet as you can see in the disclosures, and how we look at it right now is that given our view on the economy, we believe there's still momentum and bias for higher rates, as 2021 plays out, and even 2022, so for us we can afford to be patient. And fortunately our investment portfolio is running off at a pretty slow pace, the hedges aren't running off at all, we still have two and a half more years before, we have that headwind. So we're really not forced into trades today that would sacrifice future NII levels just to make income now. So I think we'll continue to be patient, we'll be opportunistic, but we would certainly like to see entry points a little bit better. And our focus would be more on just extension of protection, as opposed to laying on net new notional amounts to where we are today.\nOperator: Your next response is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.\nGerardCassidy: Thank you. Good morning. How are you guys? Jamie can you share with us and may be Greg too. We all have seen in the banking industry, and you guys certainly are showing it as well, this incredible deposit growth year-over-year, and clearly the quantitative easing from the Fed is a major contributor to the industry's deposit growth, as well as the deficit spending by the US government. Obviously, you're not a wholesale bank, like some of our money center banks that might be gathering some of these deposits from this quantitative easing. Can you share with us where is the, or kind of give us a timeline or a trail of where is this deposit growth coming from in terms of via customer base, and what's going to eventually bring it down so that your short-term investments will eventually be utilized by your customers basically drawing down those deposits?\nJamieLeonard: Thanks Gerard. Great question and a difficult to answer. But I'll start with the easy parts. In terms of where our deposit growth has come from, we're up 27% year-over-year $30 plus billion, 70% of that has come from our commercial customer base, and 30% has come out of the consumer book. In terms of the consumer book, the growth has really driven, as we've talked about the 3% household growth, but also just the consumers deleveraging. And when you slice the consumer deposit book, just March over March, average DDA and IVTs per account are up about 30%, savings are up 15%. So we're seeing that consumer behavior being a little more conservative plus the additional stimulus and all the other liquidity programs available are just adding significant balances to these consumer accounts. I think that will come down as consumer spending picks up and we should expect that excess liquidity of about $2,000 per account start to wane in the back half of the year. But for the second quarter, we do expect consumer deposit growth to continue. We've seen that with the stimulus payments, with tax refunds. And so we see a portion of that excess liquidity being applied to paying down unsecured loans but for the most part, sticking. From a commercial perspective, I think clients are just being more conservative, and I expect the commercial deposit balances, perhaps stick down a little bit slower in over a period of years as folks, while we see strong pipelines and encouragement for loan growth, I think corporations will can hold a little bit extra liquidity given what we've just been through. And so I think you might see the ability to grow loans without really seeing a lot of runoff in the commercial deposits. But I think consumer spending will drive a decline in the consumer book, perhaps sooner than commercial.\nGerardCassidy: Very good. I know you gave us some good color Jamie on the loan loss reserves relative to loans and credit quality for you and your peers has been extraordinarily good through a cycle that was pretty dramatic as we all know. What do you think and I know it's a moving target with CECL, but what do you think about getting the reserves down to that day one CECL level in January of 2020. What would it take and how long would it take for, do you think for you guys to bring it down to that level?\nJamieLeonard: So our day one reserves were 182 basis points, and on an apples-to-apples basis today, if you exclude PPP, let's call it a 230 level. So when you look at our process at the end of each quarter, we have a robust process that estimate fee allowance based on the credit risk in the portfolio. And that's driven by the economic forecasts over the three year reasonable and supportable horizon that we use. So while we feel very positive about our credit performance to date, through the pandemic, there are still segments of the economy and our loan book that have not returned to those pre pandemic levels of health. So we do think full normalization will take time and will not occur over a period of just a few quarters. And I guess the answer, the heart of your question, to get back to those adoption level reserve rates, we would need to see a sustained strengthening in the credit characteristics of those borrowers that are most at risk for the longer term negative impacts from the pandemic in concert with improving economic forecasts, and most importantly, those forecasts need to improve above our current expectations. So I think it will take some time.\nOperator: Your next response is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMikeMayo: Hi. Can you size the level of your investments? You expect positive operating leverage in the second half of the year; this must be taking some sort of a toll. And I guess we've heard a lot of investments, you have the southeast expansion where you're opening 70 branches, that's one category. Second category would be other expansion markets like Texas and California. And the third category would be the loan process automation. So when you add it all up what sort of impact does this have when do these investments peak? If you think of J curve as investing and hurting your profits, then improving later when you get to that inflection point.\nJamieLeonard: Yes, Mike, it's Jamie, thanks for the question. It really, when you look at our expense outlook for the year, yes, as you mentioned, we do expect the operating cost, cost of operating leverage second half of the year, the second quarter of 2021 is probably going to be the highest year-over-year growth rate on expenses. And the IT investments will be year-over-year up double digits; we expect marketing to accelerate in the second quarter. And then we have the investments from the loan servicing costs for some of the loan pool purchases. So really, when we look out at the expense guide, each quarter should be better and better in terms of expenses. Whereas NII grows we're at the trough now, NII should grow every quarter. And then as we talked about before fees from the second quarter trough should then build throughout the rest of the year. So that's how we see the year playing out. Obviously, we've got some flexibility to change that expense progression, should it not play out and deliver that extra revenue. But that's really how we see the year playing out.\nMikeMayo: And just a separate question for the southeast expansion strategy. What is the end game? In terms of where do you want to be in terms of market share where you are today? Or other metrics that you're monitoring?\nGregCarmichael: Now, my guess is, this is Greg, I mean, listen, as we said many times before, we like the southeast markets for all the reasons you would expect. It's also been one of our strongest performing, the strongest performing sector of our business. So on the retail side, and on the commercial side, and on the wealth side, so it's really been a strong performance for us. So for the end game we want to be just call it top five banks end up of market from a deposit perspective, will be objective of ours. That's pretty much what we search for, we think that makes us relevant allows us to serve the community the best. So top five retail deposits that we're thinking about it. And then from a banker perspective on the commercial side, just making sure we have the talent in the market to take advantage of the opportunities down there that are presented to us. So that's kind of what we're focused on. Tim, anything you want to add to that?\nTimSpence: No, I think that's right. We're a little bit unique. If you look at the southeast footprint and the most of the growth in the southeast is happening on the Atlantic coast side in the Mid Atlantic and then on both sides in Florida, and we really have a metro market strategy down there. So the focus is on places like Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, Nashville, Naples, Tampa, the high growth mid-size markets and as Greg said, top five in those markets would get you to call it 8% to 10% market share in those stated metro areas as opposed to, including the micropolitan markets elsewhere in the state. \nOperator: The next response is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.\nKenUsdin: Thanks. Good morning. Just to follow up on the Ginnie Mae and the mortgage banking businesses. Do you still see room to find and repurchase more of those Ginnie Mae buyouts? And you mentioned on the mortgage side that you're retaining a little bit more of your production? Can you give us an understanding of how much of that production you're now planning to retain? And then and how much that's changed over time? Thanks.\nJamieLeonard: Yes, thanks, Ken. In terms of the Ginnie Mae pools, they're becoming more and more difficult to locate, I think, as everybody's been executing on that play for their own portfolio. And, as we talked about, we bought back our $750 million in the third quarter of 2020. So that combined with the fact that we're over $3 billion of product now, I think that's a healthy and appropriate allocation for our balance sheet. So I'm not looking to add more there. In terms of the mortgage retention, we did retain in the fourth quarter, a $0.25 billion or so of our retail production. This quarter, we did not elect to retain anything that was saleable. So we're currently selling everything that is saleable, and then retaining jumbo nonconforming and other items. So I think that's in that for now would be our intention for the rest of this year.\nKenUsdin: Okay. And Jamie, one follow up on mortgage, you guys have been taking long -- a little bit longer to get kind of the pipeline through and we saw the originations up, can you just give us a an update there on just your outlook for origination volumes? And have you kind of gotten that to the right spot in terms of you being able to get the production through and in terms of that opportunity set? Thanks.\nJamieLeonard: Yes, for as disappointing as the fourth quarter was in mortgage, the first quarter was just as exciting. So, we feel very good about how the team performed, the first quarter was very strong. And we've got the trains running on time and everything is in a good spot, as you can tell from the first quarter results. So, in terms of the outlook for the year, we expect the mortgage originations to be up a bit, call it mid-single digits, second quarter volumes, mid-single digits. But the headwind is going to be margin compression.  So, while we transition to more of a purchase environment here over the summer months, volumes should be strong, margins will compress. And then as those prepayments refi slow down, we expect to see a little bit of a lift in the servicing portfolio. So it's less of a headwind and perhaps even a positive in the back half of the year. But net-net, I think on a year-over-year basis, we're looking at a slight decline in both top line and bottom line, mortgage fees.\nOperator: Your next response is from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.\nKenZerbe: I apologize. I was on mute. In terms of getting to the 9.5% CET1 target, how much of that comes from being at the very high end of your allowable stock buybacks like $800 million in the back half of the year versus balance sheet growth later in the year.\nJamieLeonard: The balance sheet growth is fairly stable in terms I guess of the year-over-year, we do have, I guess the dynamic of C&I growth, but PPP pay downs but I don't see the balance sheet at least in 2021 being that big of a driver. I guess there's a nine basis points of erosion with the CECL transition that kicks in in the first quarter of 2022. But overall, our income levels are more than sufficient to cover the balance sheet growth. So the real benefit for us is just buying back the $347 million in the second quarter and then $800 million or more in the back half of the year to try to bring that down to 9.5% by mid-year 2022. That's our goal and then also has a dividend increase here in the third quarter. \nKenZerbe: Got it. Okay, perfect. And then just as a follow up in terms of your net charge-offs guidance, I think you're 27 basis points this quarter. Your guidance for next quarter is sort of call it maybe 30 basis points at the midpoint. But your full year guidance is the 30 to 40 basis points. Are you implying that second half should see noticeably higher charge offs? Or is that just being more conservative?\nGregCarmichael: Yes, I think it's an element of conservatism given the uncertainty in the environment, we certainly could experience charge-offs at the very low end of that range. But at this point in time, I feel like it's prudent to guide to a 30 to 40 basis point range.\nOperator: Your next response is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMattO'Connor: Good morning. So to just ask a liquidity question a little bit different. You actually had a more modest increase in both deposits and the cash this quarter than what we were seeing for the overall industry. And just wondering how you'd reconcile that difference?\nJamieLeonard: Yes, it's really driven by our commercial clients. And in particular, our focus on retailers where you typically have seasonal run off in the first quarter of every year from elevated fourth quarter balances. I think on a year-over-year basis, our growth is certainly at the high end. And I think we've done a very nice job of capturing more than our fair share of the excess liquidity in the commercial book. And then obviously, the household growth on the consumer side has contributed. So, I feel good about how we're positioned from a deposit gathering perspective, and it's just more about when is the right time to start putting the money to work.\nMattO'Connor: Okay, and then, just separately, the incremental costs related to the mortgage servicing for the loans that you purchase. There's obviously a lot more revenue that you're getting than the $50 million of additional costs. But I guess I was a little surprised that there's that much incremental cost, that is if not more scalable, or is it a bit of a kind of more intensive product to service given the nature of the Ginnie Mae's?\nJamieLeonard: No, very good question. The answer is actually far simpler, which is we don't service the loans. And therefore, we pay a servicing fee. And that servicing fee is certainly on the high side, given the yield on the securities. And so it ends up being almost a 2% servicing fee paid to the servicer, but the flip side is you get more than that benefit, but it does show up in NII. So when you look at our expense guide, as diligent as we are and as focused as we are on expenses. At the end of the day, we did raise the expense guide to two points. Half of that is from the volume related compensation expense and fee growth and then half is from these additional loan servicing costs that are more than offset by the improvement in NII.\nMattO'Connor: And what's the related pickup in revenue that you get from those loans? Or the yield, if you up at percent?\nJamieLeonard: Yes, high 3% yield. \nMattO'Connor: Okay.\nJamieLeonard: And then there's additional fee income that comes as the loans are resold. So all in it's an ROA of roughly 2%, which is very attractive in this environment, and certainly better than just buying MBS in the portfolio.\nOperator: Your next response is from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler.\nScottSiefers: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just I guess when we talk about the line utilization, improving potentially from 31%, up to 33% by the end of the year, maybe just a reminder of what you would consider sort of a typical number for you guys. And then just as the follow up, I'm not sure anyone has a great answer for it but maybe just best guesses or thoughts on why utilization isn't already improving, kind of broadly for the industry, given that we all have what seems like pretty good visibility into the likely trajectory of the economy, vaccination rates, et cetera. Just would be curious to hear your thoughts there.\nGregCarmichael: Scott, good question. This is Greg. I'll start it and maybe throw it back over to Tim, for some more color. And first off, we normalize line utilization for us going into the pandemic would have been 36%, 37% on average. So obviously with the pandemic, we saw a spike up the 40 plus percent, but think about normalized rates 36%, we're running about 31% right now. So hopefully second half the year is little stronger as we anticipate, look at our bonds up forecast. We can pick up another 2% lift. That's a stretch out there. But we think that's doable, given we're seeing in our pipelines. Just back up to 33%, which is still not the normalized level. You think about each 1% is about $750 million outstanding for us. So the impact of the 2% uplift by year end is less than 1% on total loan growth for 2021, given the ramp up throughout the year, so it's possible but once again, I think there's a lot of a variable out there, we're watching. But we are encouraged by the pipeline strength that we're seeing right now at our production levels, and commercial in the first quarter, we have pre pandemic level. So we're encouraged by that.  If you look at the pipeline are going forward and the forecast right now we will be about 30% up in production over 2020, but slightly below pre pandemic levels. And we're seeing good strength in manufacturing and healthcare, TMT and renewables right now. If you look at our markets, we're seeing some good progress, Indiana, Michigan, California, and the Carolinas would jump out as a source of strength from an asset perspective. So production is strong, pipeline look good. We're hopeful we'll see the second -- back half of this year and improvement in line utilization. And once again, there is a lot of liquidity out there. So it's something we're watching.\nTimSpence: I think just to add to what Greg said, I mean, Scott, we're asking the same question to ourselves, right, in terms of what the visibility we have into the economy and some of the signals we're seeing about a pickup and inflation and input costs. I have the chance since the beginning of the year to be out in 12, of our 15 different regions, and to spend time with clients there. So we've been asking that question. And what we're hearing from them primarily are either supply chain disruptions. Some of that, obviously, is the some of the global dynamics that we have talked about whether it was stuck in the canal, or shortages in semiconductors, but it also is just -- get access to materials. And then on the other side of the equation, labor shortages, in particular as it relates to the skilled trades. And the byproduct of that is we're not seeing the inventory building that you might otherwise expect to see yet. So we're watching inventory levels closely. We're watching the IFM Index closely as leading indicators to when we may see a pickup in utilization. I think one positive note which is reflected in the results in the first quarter is we are seeing increased demand on the equipment side of the business. And that is encouraging because that obviously would be the other precondition to an expansion.\nOperator: And your last question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.\nErikaNajarian: Hey, good morning. My first question is for Jamie. Jamie, thank you so much for slide 5. I love it. Most investors have started to talk about normalized ROTCE as they think about valuing banks with a two to three year forward look and even though you deployed some excess liquidity what stunning and how significant it still is relative to 4Q, 2019. And as investors contemplate what normalized returns are for Fifth Third, where do short term investments normalize to?\nJamieLeonard: So your question, are you from a total return perspective, ROTCE? Or are you just asking on what do we do? How much excess cash do we end up holding?\nErikaNajarian: Yes, so do you ever go back to $3 billion or we redefine what excess liquidity is for you guys?\nJamieLeonard: Yes, because we've, obviously, we debate daily, when is the right time to put the money to work? And how do we see the environment playing out? Right now, I think the easiest way to consider the excess liquidity would be a third of it runs off a third of it we'd love to invest in organic loan growth, and a third of it ultimately gets invested in the investment portfolio. And so in terms of what that return profile looks like, with regard to the investment portfolio. We want to wait for the right time to put the money to work. But when we do put it to work we're at 18% right now as securities as a percent of total assets. We're comfortable running that number at 23% or so. So that means about $10 billion or so of that additional liquidity we would deploy into the investment portfolio over a period of time.\nErikaNajarian: Got it. And just one last question on Momentum Banking, how should we think about how Momentum Banking can potential impact long-term consumer deposit growth versus whether or not that renormalize service charges on deposits lower.\nTimSpence: Sure, Erika, it's Tim. Good question. So I think we are very focused. Our strategy, as I think we've discussed quite frequently as a primary relationship strategy. It's a focus on primary banking. It's a focus on being the place where you get paid on where you pay your bills, and how you build up liquidity. And the byproduct of that, obviously, as Jamie mentioned earlier, is we did see really positive trends on the consumer side of the business because the liquidity that consumers have built up really is in the transaction accounts as opposed to somewhere else. So our deposit growth on the consumer side has been underpinned by call it 2% to 3% household growth over a period of several years now. We would like to continue to bump that number up. And we think that the Momentum Banking products coupled with the expansion in the southeast gives us a path to doing that, in terms of the overall household growth rates that we experienced, which will support noninterest bearing deposit growth. I think on the other side of the equation, yes, when somebody elects to use a short-term liquidity product, take our early access product, the deposit advanced product that we've had in the market for several years now, that is a lower cost way to cover cash flow shortfall than an overdraft fee. But it's also a very sustainable way. And owing to the fact that we have had those products in our product set for several years now, our overdraft charges as a percentage of total consumer deposits are lower than all but one of the large, US banks already. So I think from our perspective, we're giving the consumer the widest possible range of options to avoid fees. We're getting the benefit of that in the form of household growth, and of primacy, which is the entry point for us to the broadest range of products and services that we offer. And because of our position on the overdraft side of the equation and the low reliance on that feeling we have left to give up there and we're going to be able to outgrow any sort of an impact on the fees per household measure.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further responses at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Chris Doll.\nChris Doll: Thank you all for your interest Fifth Third. If you have any follow up questions, please contact the IR department and we will be happy to assist you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes. So good question. Just to add to what Greg said, when we announced the build out of the de novo strategy in the markets in the southeast, we announced that we were going to build about 120 branches only about 30 of those have come online. But those 30 branches collectively are contributing almost 10% of our new household production this year. So we're seeing some benefit there. But a lot still to come as we add another 30 plus branches in the southeast this year and another 35 next year. On the commercial banking and wealth management side of the equation, I think we've talked in the past about the additions we have made in the southeast on the fee income side of the business; both Coker Capital and HTC are headquartered down there and have strong southeast presences. But we also talked about adding 30 additional middle market bankers to the southeast. And only about seven of those positions were filled in the first quarter with another 10 offers outstanding. So very clearly those benefits are not yet in the run rate. But we've been very pleased with the quality and talent that we are able to attract. We expect that to continue to further accelerate the shift in the business mix between the Midwest and the southeast markets. No, I think that's right. We're a little bit unique. If you look at the southeast footprint and the most of the growth in the southeast is happening on the Atlantic coast side in the Mid Atlantic and then on both sides in Florida, and we really have a metro market strategy down there. So the focus is on places like Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, Nashville, Naples, Tampa, the high growth mid-size markets and as Greg said, top five in those markets would get you to call it 8% to 10% market share in those stated metro areas as opposed to, including the micropolitan markets elsewhere in the state. I think just to add to what Greg said, I mean, Scott, we're asking the same question to ourselves, right, in terms of what the visibility we have into the economy and some of the signals we're seeing about a pickup and inflation and input costs.

            "name": "Jamie Leonard",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We generated strong returns this quarter, reflecting our solid operating performance and continued improvement in credit quality. We produced an adjusted ROE of 1.4% and an ROTCE excluding AOCI of 19.8%. PPNR results were also strong driven by strength in both NII and fees. Consequently, expenses were elevated relative to our previous guidance due to performance and market linked compensation expenses. We recorded a $244 million release to our credit reserves this quarter, which lowered our ACL ratio from 2.41% to 2.19%. Our historically low charge -offs which came in better than expected, combined with an improving economic outlook versus previous expectations resulted in a $173 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. Continuing with the income statement performance; net interest income declined just 1% sequentially due to the lower date count and a reduction in prepayment penalties received in the securities portfolio compared to the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by the impact of $2.1 billion in government guaranteed residential mortgage forbearance loans purchased from a third party servicer in December and another $600 million in March. We have continued to take action to prudently deploy excess liquidity in order to improve our NII trajectory for 2021. And these loans provided a more attractive risk adjusted return relative to other alternatives. Our first quarter NII results also included approximately $12 million in incremental PPP fees reflecting loan forgiveness, compared to the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we discussed previously, our prior quarter NII results included prepayment penalty income for our investment portfolio, which declined $10 million sequentially. From a liability management perspective, we reduced our interest bearing core deposit costs, another two basis points this quarter, resulting in a cost of only six basis points. Reported NIM increased four basis points sequentially, reflecting a decline in excess cash incremental PPP forgiveness fees and day count, partially offset by the aforementioned securities prepayment penalty income decline. Underlying NIM excluding PPP and excess cash decreased just four basis points to 310 basis points. With a top quartile margin relative to peers and asset sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion in excess liquidity, we believe that we remain well positioned for a higher rate environment while also benefiting from structural protection against lower rates given our securities and hedge portfolios.  Additionally, we have updated our interest rate risk disclosures to reflect a 38% deposit beta to better align with our future expectations based on the last rate hike cycle experience. In a plus 100 basis points scenario where we invest about 1/3 of our excess liquidity over a 12 month period, we would expect annual NII to be about 15% higher compared to a static rate environment. Total reported noninterest income decreased 5%. Adjusted noninterest income excluding the TRA impact increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Our fee performance reflected strength throughout our lines of business, including record commercial banking fees led by robust debt capital markets revenue, mortgage banking revenue driven by strong production, and strong leasing business revenue.  Top line mortgage banking revenue increased $42 million sequentially, reflecting improved execution and strong production in both retail and correspondent which was partially offset by incremental margin pressure. Also, as we discussed in January, our fourth quarter results included a $12 million headwind from our decision to retain a portion of our retail production. Mortgage servicing fees of $59 million and MSR net valuation gains of $18 million were more than offset by asset decay of $81 million. If primary mortgage rates were to move higher, we would expect to see some servicing revenue improvement which would likely be more than offset by production and margin pressures in that environment.  As a result, we currently expect full year mortgage revenue to decline low to mid single digits given our rate outlook. Reported noninterest expenses decreased 2% relative to the fourth quarter. Adjusted expenses were up 3% driven by seasonal items in the first quarter in addition to elevated compensation related expenses linked to strong fee performance, as well as the mark-to-market impact on nonqualified deferred comp plans. Current quarter expenses included $10 million in servicing expenses from our purchase loan portfolios. For the full year, we expect to incur $50 million to $55 million in servicing expenses for purchase loans, including the impact of an additional $1 billion in forbearance pool purchases in April. Moving to the balance sheet; total average loans and leases were flat sequentially. C&I results continued to reflect stronger production levels offset by pay downs. Additionally, revolver utilization rates decreased another 1% this quarter to a record low 31% due to the extraordinary levels of market liquidity and robust capital markets. The sequential decline in utilization came primarily from COVID High Impact industries and our energy vertical. Also, our leverage loan outstandings declined more than 10% sequentially. As Greg mentioned, we are encouraged by the fact that we are retaining customer relationships throughout this environment and are benefiting from the fee opportunities. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially with end of period balances up 2% reflecting draw amounts on prior commitments which were paused during the pandemic. Average total consumer loans were flat sequentially as continued strength in the auto portfolio was offset by declines in home equity, credit card and residential mortgage balances. Auto production in the quarter was strong at $2.2 billion with an average FICO score around 780 with lower advanced rates, higher internal credit scores and better spreads compared to last year. Our securities portfolio increased approximately 1% this quarter as we opportunistically pre invested expected second quarter cash flows of approximately $1 billion during March. With respect to broader securities portfolio positioning, we remain patient, but we will continue to be opportunistic as the environment evolves. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to increase our cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point range. We are optimistic that strong economic growth in the second half of 2021 will present more attractive risk return opportunities. We continue to feel very good about our investment portfolio positioning with 57% of the investment portfolio invested in bullet and locked out cash flows at quarter end. Our securities portfolio had $2 million of net discount accretion in the first quarter and our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained strong at $2.4 billion pretax. Average other short term investments which includes interest bearing cash decreased $2 billion sequentially and increase $30 billion compared to the year ago quarter. The unprecedented excess cash levels are the result of record deposit growth over the past year. Core deposits were flat compared to the fourth quarter as growth in consumer transaction deposits impacted by the fiscal stimulus was offset by seasonal declines in commercial transaction deposits, and a reduction in consumer CD balances. We are experiencing strong deposit growth so far in April and expect low single digit growth in the second quarter from both consumer and commercial customers. Moving to credit. Our overall credit quality continues to reflect our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting, prudent management of our balance sheet exposures, and the continued improvement of the macroeconomic environment. The first quarter net charge-off ratio of 27 basis points improved 16 basis points sequentially. Nonperforming assets declined $81 million, or 9%, with the resulting NPA ratio of 72 basis points, declining seven basis points sequentially. Also, our criticized assets declined 8% with considerable improvements in casinos, restaurants and leisure travel, as well as in our energy and leverage loan portfolios, partially offset by continued pressure in commercial real estate particularly central business district hotels. Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes the labor market continues to improve with unemployment reaching 5% by the middle of next year, and ending our three year RNS period in this low 4% range. As a result, this scenario assumes most of the labor market disruption created by the pandemic and resulting government programs is resolved by 2024, but still leaves a persistent employment gap of a few million jobs compared to pre COVID expectations. Additionally, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from the administration's recent fiscal stimulus and assumes an infrastructure package over a $1 trillion is passed this year. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and down side scenarios, applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $169 million released to our reserve.  Conversely, applying 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $788 million bill, inclusive of the impact of approximately $109 million and remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.29%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserves, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.4%. With the recent economic recovery and our base case expectations point to further improvement, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out given the uncertain environment. Like all of you, we continue to closely watch COVID case and vaccination trends, which could impact the timing of reopening of local economies and reverse the strengthening consumer confidence trends. Our March 31 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth, lower unemployment and improving credit quality, including the expected benefits of government programs. Moving to capital; our capital remains strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio grew during the quarter ending at 10.5% above our stated target of 9.5%, which amounts to approximately $1.4 billion of excess capital. Our tangible book value per share excluding AOCI is up 8% since the year ago quarter. During the quarter, we completed $180 million in buybacks, which reduced our share count by approximately 5 million shares compared to the fourth quarter. As Greg mentioned, we have the capacity to repurchase up to $347 million in the second quarter based on our current dividend and the Federal Reserve's average trailing four quarters of net income framework. As a category four bank, we expect to have additional flexibility with respect to capital distributions starting in the third quarter. As prudent stewards of capital we expect to get closer to our CET1 target by mid-2022. While we did not participate in CCAR 2021, we are required to submit our board approved capital plan to the Fed. Those plans support the potential to raise our dividend in the third quarter and repurchase over $800 million in the second half of 2021. Moving to our current outlook; for the full year, we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up a bit compared to last year reflecting relative stability in commercial combined with low single digit growth in consumer, which includes the additional $1 billion in Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases in April. We continue to expect CRE to remain stable in this environment. Our loan outlook assumes commercial revolver utilization rates migrate closer to 33% by year end, and also includes the impact of $2 billion in loan balances we expect to add from the latest round of PPP, including the $1.7 billion we've generated to date, which will continue to be offset by forgiveness throughout the year. We expect our underlying NIM to be in the 305 area for the full year. Combined with our loan outlook, we expect NII to decline just 1% this year, assuming stable securities balances. On a sequential basis, we expect NII to be stable to up 1%. Within our NII guidance, we assume we generate approximately $150 million in PPP related interest income in 2021, of which $53 million was realized in the first quarter compared to $100 million in the full year of 2020. We expect full year fees to increase 4% to 5% compared to 2020, or 5% to 6% excluding the impact of the TRA. Improvement from our previous guide reflects a more robust economic rebound as well as our continued success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger processing revenue, capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue, which will be partially offset by mortgage.  We expect second quarter fees to decline 3% to 5% reflecting lower mortgage and leasing revenues, partially offset by low single digit growth in card and processing and treasury management revenue. We expect relatively stable commercial banking revenues sequentially. Given both our stronger fee and NII outlook combined with the servicing costs from the loan portfolio purchases, we expect full year expenses to be up 1% driven by volume based compensation and other expenses. On a sequential basis, we expect expenses to decline 5% to 7%.  We expect to generate positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021 reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee based businesses, and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 30 to 40 basis point range given the strong first quarter performance, and assuming our base case scenario continues to play out. Second quarter losses are likely to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range. In summary, our first quarter results were strong and continued to demonstrate the progress we made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of discipline client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us very well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Yes, it's Jamie. Thanks for the question. We did, as I said in our prepared remarks, update our asset sensitivity disclosures to, I think be a little more transparent and give you our views of how we see the next rate hike cycle playing out. So we did change our deposit betas from 70% down to 38%. So with that in mind, obviously that reflects a very asset sensitive balance sheet as you can see in the disclosures, and how we look at it right now is that given our view on the economy, we believe there's still momentum and bias for higher rates, as 2021 plays out, and even 2022, so for us we can afford to be patient. And fortunately our investment portfolio is running off at a pretty slow pace, the hedges aren't running off at all, we still have two and a half more years before, we have that headwind. So we're really not forced into trades today that would sacrifice future NII levels just to make income now. So I think we'll continue to be patient, we'll be opportunistic, but we would certainly like to see entry points a little bit better. And our focus would be more on just extension of protection, as opposed to laying on net new notional amounts to where we are today. Thanks Gerard. Great question and a difficult to answer. But I'll start with the easy parts. In terms of where our deposit growth has come from, we're up 27% year-over-year $30 plus billion, 70% of that has come from our commercial customer base, and 30% has come out of the consumer book. In terms of the consumer book, the growth has really driven, as we've talked about the 3% household growth, but also just the consumers deleveraging. And when you slice the consumer deposit book, just March over March, average DDA and IVTs per account are up about 30%, savings are up 15%. So we're seeing that consumer behavior being a little more conservative plus the additional stimulus and all the other liquidity programs available are just adding significant balances to these consumer accounts. I think that will come down as consumer spending picks up and we should expect that excess liquidity of about $2,000 per account start to wane in the back half of the year. But for the second quarter, we do expect consumer deposit growth to continue. We've seen that with the stimulus payments, with tax refunds. And so we see a portion of that excess liquidity being applied to paying down unsecured loans but for the most part, sticking. From a commercial perspective, I think clients are just being more conservative, and I expect the commercial deposit balances, perhaps stick down a little bit slower in over a period of years as folks, while we see strong pipelines and encouragement for loan growth, I think corporations will can hold a little bit extra liquidity given what we've just been through. And so I think you might see the ability to grow loans without really seeing a lot of runoff in the commercial deposits. But I think consumer spending will drive a decline in the consumer book, perhaps sooner than commercial. So our day one reserves were 182 basis points, and on an apples-to-apples basis today, if you exclude PPP, let's call it a 230 level. So when you look at our process at the end of each quarter, we have a robust process that estimate fee allowance based on the credit risk in the portfolio. And that's driven by the economic forecasts over the three year reasonable and supportable horizon that we use. So while we feel very positive about our credit performance to date, through the pandemic, there are still segments of the economy and our loan book that have not returned to those pre pandemic levels of health. So we do think full normalization will take time and will not occur over a period of just a few quarters. And I guess the answer, the heart of your question, to get back to those adoption level reserve rates, we would need to see a sustained strengthening in the credit characteristics of those borrowers that are most at risk for the longer term negative impacts from the pandemic in concert with improving economic forecasts, and most importantly, those forecasts need to improve above our current expectations. So I think it will take some time. Yes, Mike, it's Jamie, thanks for the question. It really, when you look at our expense outlook for the year, yes, as you mentioned, we do expect the operating cost, cost of operating leverage second half of the year, the second quarter of 2021 is probably going to be the highest year-over-year growth rate on expenses. And the IT investments will be year-over-year up double digits; we expect marketing to accelerate in the second quarter. And then we have the investments from the loan servicing costs for some of the loan pool purchases. So really, when we look out at the expense guide, each quarter should be better and better in terms of expenses. Whereas NII grows we're at the trough now, NII should grow every quarter. And then as we talked about before fees from the second quarter trough should then build throughout the rest of the year. So that's how we see the year playing out. Obviously, we've got some flexibility to change that expense progression, should it not play out and deliver that extra revenue. But that's really how we see the year playing out. Yes, thanks, Ken. In terms of the Ginnie Mae pools, they're becoming more and more difficult to locate, I think, as everybody's been executing on that play for their own portfolio. And, as we talked about, we bought back our $750 million in the third quarter of 2020. So that combined with the fact that we're over $3 billion of product now, I think that's a healthy and appropriate allocation for our balance sheet. So I'm not looking to add more there. In terms of the mortgage retention, we did retain in the fourth quarter, a $0.25 billion or so of our retail production. This quarter, we did not elect to retain anything that was saleable. So we're currently selling everything that is saleable, and then retaining jumbo nonconforming and other items. So I think that's in that for now would be our intention for the rest of this year. Yes, for as disappointing as the fourth quarter was in mortgage, the first quarter was just as exciting. So, we feel very good about how the team performed, the first quarter was very strong. And we've got the trains running on time and everything is in a good spot, as you can tell from the first quarter results. So, in terms of the outlook for the year, we expect the mortgage originations to be up a bit, call it mid-single digits, second quarter volumes, mid-single digits. But the headwind is going to be margin compression.  So, while we transition to more of a purchase environment here over the summer months, volumes should be strong, margins will compress. And then as those prepayments refi slow down, we expect to see a little bit of a lift in the servicing portfolio. So it's less of a headwind and perhaps even a positive in the back half of the year. But net-net, I think on a year-over-year basis, we're looking at a slight decline in both top line and bottom line, mortgage fees. The balance sheet growth is fairly stable in terms I guess of the year-over-year, we do have, I guess the dynamic of C&I growth, but PPP pay downs but I don't see the balance sheet at least in 2021 being that big of a driver. I guess there's a nine basis points of erosion with the CECL transition that kicks in in the first quarter of 2022. But overall, our income levels are more than sufficient to cover the balance sheet growth. So the real benefit for us is just buying back the $347 million in the second quarter and then $800 million or more in the back half of the year to try to bring that down to 9.5% by mid-year 2022. That's our goal and then also has a dividend increase here in the third quarter. Yes, it's really driven by our commercial clients. And in particular, our focus on retailers where you typically have seasonal run off in the first quarter of every year from elevated fourth quarter balances. I think on a year-over-year basis, our growth is certainly at the high end. And I think we've done a very nice job of capturing more than our fair share of the excess liquidity in the commercial book. And then obviously, the household growth on the consumer side has contributed. So, I feel good about how we're positioned from a deposit gathering perspective, and it's just more about when is the right time to start putting the money to work. No, very good question. The answer is actually far simpler, which is we don't service the loans. And therefore, we pay a servicing fee. And that servicing fee is certainly on the high side, given the yield on the securities. And so it ends up being almost a 2% servicing fee paid to the servicer, but the flip side is you get more than that benefit, but it does show up in NII. So when you look at our expense guide, as diligent as we are and as focused as we are on expenses. At the end of the day, we did raise the expense guide to two points. Half of that is from the volume related compensation expense and fee growth and then half is from these additional loan servicing costs that are more than offset by the improvement in NII. Yes, high 3% yield. And then there's additional fee income that comes as the loans are resold. So all in it's an ROA of roughly 2%, which is very attractive in this environment, and certainly better than just buying MBS in the portfolio. So your question, are you from a total return perspective, ROTCE? Or are you just asking on what do we do? How much excess cash do we end up holding? Yes, because we've, obviously, we debate daily, when is the right time to put the money to work? And how do we see the environment playing out? Right now, I think the easiest way to consider the excess liquidity would be a third of it runs off a third of it we'd love to invest in organic loan growth, and a third of it ultimately gets invested in the investment portfolio. And so in terms of what that return profile looks like, with regard to the investment portfolio. We want to wait for the right time to put the money to work. But when we do put it to work we're at 18% right now as securities as a percent of total assets. We're comfortable running that number at 23% or so. So that means about $10 billion or so of that additional liquidity we would deploy into the investment portfolio over a period of time."

            "content": "Thanks Chris. And thank all of you for joining us this morning. Hope you're all well and staying healthy. Earlier today, we reported first quarter net income of $694 million from $0.93 per share. We continued our positive momentum from the past several quarters and once again deliver strong financial results in the first quarter. These strong results reflect record commercial bank and fee revenue, continued success generating consumer household growth and a strong underlying net interest margin. Our performance reflects focused execution on our key strategic priorities. We continue to benefit from the diversification, resilience of our fee based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial and wealth and asset management which are generating strong results in helping to cushion the impact of lower short-term rates. We have maintained our discipline clients selection and conservative underwriting, which are evident in our credit metrics. For the quarter, we recorded a benefit in our provision for credit losses, reflecting a stronger economic outlook, as well as historically low net charge-offs, which included improvements in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. In addition to muted credit, losses, our criticize assets and NPLs also improved sequentially. Nonperforming loans decreased 11% from the prior quarter with NPL inflows at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2019. Our balance sheet earnings power remained very strong. As a result, our robust CET1 ratio further improved to 10.5% this quarter. Our CET1 target remains at 9.5%. As we have stated many times before, we are focused on deploying capital for organic growth opportunities, evaluating nonbank opportunities where it fits our strategy, and share repurchases. Based on our current dividend and trailing four quarters of net income, we have the capacity to repurchase shares up to $347 million in the second quarter. After that, we have more flexibility in terms of how and when returning capital to shareholders under the SCD framework. Jamie will provide more details on our capital plan. The improved macroeconomic data and outlook are aligned with our strongest overall commercial loan production since before the pandemic. Furthermore, we have seen our pipeline strengthened considerably over the past 90 days with significant strength in manufacturing, renewables, healthcare and technology, partially offset by new demand in leisure and hospitality and CRE. Production was offset by elevated payoffs and pay downs combined with another 1% decline in line utilization. We retained the customer and their core banking relationship as virtually none of our commercial payoffs during the quarter were the result of client attrition. Additionally, pay downs on our corporate bank larger reflected clients tapping the capital markets, where we benefited significantly from additional capital market fees. Given the strong production trends, firming pipeline and retention of the client relationship, we remain well positioned to take advantage of a more favorable economic backdrop to clients execute their growth plans in the second half of 2021. We will continue to assess the implications of client supply chain constraints as we progress through the year. Consumer employment, savings and spend trends also remained favorable, given the fiscal stimulus, pumped demand and a gradual reopening of the economy throughout our footprint. Despite the overall economic recovery over the past several quarters, I recognize that not everyone in our society has benefited equally. This is why I'm very proud that in addition to producing strong financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. I am particularly pleased that we exceeded our five-year $32 billion commitment to invest in low and moderate income communities by more than $9 billion. We also recently announced a $2.8 billion commitment in support of racial equality focused on lending, investing and financial accessibility. We also announced the new banking practice called Momentum Banking, which competes with the fintechs and is now our flagship mass market banking offering. Momentum Banking provides customers with liquidity solutions in our newly enhanced mobile app to help them avoid unnecessary fees, including immediate access to funds from digital deposits, short term on demand borrowing options, simple goal based savings targets, free customer access to their paycheck to two days earlier, with a qualified direct deposit starting in June, and no monthly service fees. In addition, we were honored to once again be named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere also reflecting our strong corporate culture, compliance program and ESG actions. We were one of just five banks globally to receive this accolade this year. We believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve as well in 2021 and beyond. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value for shareholders, anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top regional bank.  I would like to once again thank our employees. I am very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers in each other over the past year. You have enabled Fifth Third to continue to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities. With that I'll turn over to Jamie to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook. Fantastic. This is Greg, first of all, thanks for the question. Listen, we continue to be bullish on our investments and our strength and our southeast markets. To remind you, these are markets we're already in. That we have a presence, it's really about being a better provider of products and services in those markets and really taking advantage of the opportunities this market create for us. We couldn't be more pleased to date with the progress we've seen in that market, especially if you look at household growth, new customer acquisition, strength of our commercial businesses, and those in the southeast markets. So the progress we made to date, we're going to continue to invest in those markets, as it makes sense. From other investment perspective, obviously, we balance our investments for the greatest return for our shareholders. But right now, we think the southeast is still a good place for us to continue to invest until we get to the scale and take advantage of the opportunities that are out there. And, Tim, you may want to add a few things on the progress. Now, my guess is, this is Greg, I mean, listen, as we said many times before, we like the southeast markets for all the reasons you would expect. It's also been one of our strongest performing, the strongest performing sector of our business. So on the retail side, and on the commercial side, and on the wealth side, so it's really been a strong performance for us. So for the end game we want to be just call it top five banks end up of market from a deposit perspective, will be objective of ours. That's pretty much what we search for, we think that makes us relevant allows us to serve the community the best. So top five retail deposits that we're thinking about it. And then from a banker perspective on the commercial side, just making sure we have the talent in the market to take advantage of the opportunities down there that are presented to us. So that's kind of what we're focused on. Tim, anything you want to add to that? Yes, I think it's an element of conservatism given the uncertainty in the environment, we certainly could experience charge-offs at the very low end of that range. But at this point in time, I feel like it's prudent to guide to a 30 to 40 basis point range. Scott, good question. This is Greg. I'll start it and maybe throw it back over to Tim, for some more color. And first off, we normalize line utilization for us going into the pandemic would have been 36%, 37% on average. So obviously with the pandemic, we saw a spike up the 40 plus percent, but think about normalized rates 36%, we're running about 31% right now. So hopefully second half the year is little stronger as we anticipate, look at our bonds up forecast. We can pick up another 2% lift. That's a stretch out there. But we think that's doable, given we're seeing in our pipelines. Just back up to 33%, which is still not the normalized level. You think about each 1% is about $750 million outstanding for us. So the impact of the 2% uplift by year end is less than 1% on total loan growth for 2021, given the ramp up throughout the year, so it's possible but once again, I think there's a lot of a variable out there, we're watching. But we are encouraged by the pipeline strength that we're seeing right now at our production levels, and commercial in the first quarter, we have pre pandemic level. So we're encouraged by that.  If you look at the pipeline are going forward and the forecast right now we will be about 30% up in production over 2020, but slightly below pre pandemic levels. And we're seeing good strength in manufacturing and healthcare, TMT and renewables right now. If you look at our markets, we're seeing some good progress, Indiana, Michigan, California, and the Carolinas would jump out as a source of strength from an asset perspective. So production is strong, pipeline look good. We're hopeful we'll see the second -- back half of this year and improvement in line utilization. And once again, there is a lot of liquidity out there. So it's something we're watching."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Chris Doll, Head of Investor Relations, Fifth Third Bancorp you may begin your conference.\nChris Doll: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard will provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein; and Treasurer, Bryan Preston have also joined the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of January 19, 2023 and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\nTimothy Spence: Thanks Chris and good morning, everyone. To start, I would like to thank our employees for the job they did, supporting our customers, communities, and shareholders in 2022. You really held true to our core values and our vision to be the one bank people most value and trust. JUST Capital and CNBC recently released their annual study of America's Most JUST Companies, a comprehensive ranking that recognizes companies who do right by all stakeholders has defined by the American public. Fifth Third ranked 23rd out of the roughly 1000 companies covered in the study and was the highest ranked category four bank. It's a great achievement. Thank you for it. Earlier today, we reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. The strength and quality of our franchise are evident in the numbers. We generated record full year revenue of $8.4 billion, up 6% over the prior year. We managed expenses down 1% year-over-year, producing positive operating leverage of 700 basis points and an efficiency ratio of 56%. Net charge-offs for the year were below 20 basis points. As a result, we achieved a full year return on tangible common equity ex AOCI of 16.5%, which places us in the top quartile of our peer group. Just as importantly, we did what we said we were going to do. We have a culture of accountability Fifth Third, and it makes me proud that our full year results exceeded the guidance we provided you last January in every major caption, including total revenue, expenses, and net charge-offs. As a result, PPNR increased 18% compared to our original guide of 7%. We also made important progress on our growth strategies in 2022. We grew consumer households at a peer leading organic growth rate of around 2.5%, led by our Southeast markets at 7% and surpassed last year's record for new quality relationships in our Commercial segment. We opened 18 new branches in the Southeast in 2022, bringing our three-year total to over 70 new branches in those markets. During the year we also made meaningful progress in our technology modernization initiatives and enhanced our peer leading, digitally enabled treasury management managed services, and our momentum banking product offerings. You may have seen that most recently we extended momentum's early pay feature to include income tax refunds. Our FinTech platforms, dividend finance, and provide continue to scale and achieve top national market shares with dividend ranking third and provide ranking second in their respective markets. Our fee generating businesses are better diversified than most peers and continue to be a key focus for investment. Strong performance in our capital markets business related to helping client hedging activities, mortgage servicing and treasury management, all helped to offset market headwinds that all banks faced as did continued net AUM and flows in our wealth management business. During 2022 we remained focused on delivering stable long-term results instead of chasing short-term earnings. We maintained our discipline in our credit underwriting with continued focus on granularity and diversification. The outcomes of this are evident in our NPA, NPL and early stage delinquency ratios, all of which have remained well behaved and well below normalized levels. Our balance sheet management approach remains centered on providing strong and stable NII performance across various rate environments. We extended our advantage in our securities yield by waiting to deploy excess liquidity until we were able to earn positive real yields and we added derivatives to provide hedge protection through 2031. These actions will provide significant long-term benefits in the event of a lower rate environment. With respect to capital, given our strong PPNR growth and benign credit losses, we exceeded our target CET1 ratio in the fourth quarter and resumed share repurchases. Our capital priorities for 2023 are to maintain a 9.25% CET1 ratio and support organic balance sheet growth, pay a strong dividend, and continue our share of purchase program. We expect repurchases to steadily increase each quarter for a total of approximately $1 billion during the year. Jamie will provide you with the detail on our financial outlook for 2023, but it is a strong one that is consistent with our priorities of stability, profitability, and organic growth. We expect to produce another year of strong revenue growth and operating leverage with full year PPNR growth in the mid to high teens, a return on tangible common equity ex AOCI exceeding 17% and an efficiency ratio below 53%. We will continue to invest in organic growth and efficiency initiatives. We'll add another 30 to 35 branches in our Southeast markets, including our first three in Charleston, South Carolina, and several more in the Greenville, Spartanburg, South Carolina corridor. We'll continue to increase investments in marketing and product innovation to accelerate household growth and we'll invest in scaling dividend and provide. Lastly, we'll make significant progress on our tech modernization journey and begin to realize savings and improve the client experience by leveraging these investments to drive automation into our most labor intensive processes. You have my commitment that we will continue to make decisions with the long-term in mind to invest where we can strengthen the value and resiliency of our franchise and to hold ourselves accountable for doing what we say we will do. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our fourth quarter financial results and our current outlook for 2023.\nJames Leonard: Thank you, Tim and thank all of you for joining us today. Our quarterly and full year financial performance reflect focused execution and resiliency throughout the bank. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories and generated record revenue. NII was positively impacted by higher market rates as deposit repricing has lagged the repricing of our earning assets, combined with the benefits of fixed rate asset generation at higher rates. Fee income has remained resilient despite the market related headwinds and expenses were well controlled while we continue to reinvest in our businesses. We achieved a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of 56%, which improved throughout the year with the fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio below 52%. Our fourth quarter PPNR grew 12% compared to last quarter and 40% compared to last year. Net interest income of approximately $1.6 billion was a record for the bank and increase 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Our NIM expanded 13 basis points for the quarter. While interest-bearing core deposit costs increased 64 basis points to 105 basis points, reflecting a cycle to date interest-bearing core deposit beta of 24% in the fourth quarter. Total non-interest income increased 9% sequentially driven by our TRA revenue and commercial banking fees. That growth in commercial banking fee income was primarily driven by higher M&A advisory revenue and client financial risk management revenue, and it was partially offset by softer results in mortgage banking origination fees. Non-interest expense increased just 1% compared to the year ago quarter. This expense growth was driven by our acquisition of Dividend Finance during the year combined with continued investments in Provide compensation associated with our minimum wage hike, as well as higher technology and communications expense, reflecting our focus on platform modernization initiatives. Excluding the impacts of Dividend and Provide, total expenses would've been down 1% year-over-year. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increase 1% sequentially. Average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 1% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting an increase in C&I balances. Growth was led by our corporate bank and robust in almost all of our industry verticals. Among our verticals, production was strongest in energy, including renewables, which increased over 50% year-over-year. Healthcare growth was led by Provide with Provide balances up 150% year-over-year. The period end commercial revolver utilization rate remains stable compared to last quarter at 37%. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increase 1% compared to the prior quarter, led by Dividend Finance as well as growth in home equity. This was partially offset by a decline in indirect secured consumer loans. Average total deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter as an increase in commercial deposits was partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits. Period end deposits increase 1% compared to the prior quarter. After the deliberate runoff of surge deposits in the middle of the year, we have achieved solid deposit outcomes throughout the second-half of 2022 reflecting our strong core deposit franchise. Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends remain healthy and our key credit metrics remained well below normalized levels. The MPA ratio of 44 basis points was down two basis points sequentially, and our commercial MPA ratio has now declined for nine consecutive quarters. The net charge-off ratio increased just one basis point sequentially to 22 basis points within our guidance range. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due also increased only two basis points sequentially and remains below 2019 levels. From a balance sheet management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on high quality relationships. In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We also have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in non-prime consumer borrowers among our peers. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in CRE. Across all commercial portfolios, we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress and continue to closely watch the leverage loan portfolio and office CRE. We have focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong stable NII through the cycle. Our strong deposit franchise, our investment portfolio positioning, and our cash flow hedge portfolios will provide protection against lower rates well beyond just the next few years, as well as the addition of the fixed rate lending capabilities from both Dividend and Provide should continue to support our strong through the cycle outcomes. Moving to the ACL. Our ACL built this quarter was $112 million, primarily reflecting loan growth. Dividend Finance loans contributed $96 million to the ACL build. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the unemployment rate reaches 4.2%, while the downside scenario underlying our allowance coverage incorporates a peak unemployment rate of 7.8%. Given our expected period end loan growth, including continued strong production from Dividend Finance, we currently expect a first quarter build to the ACL of approximately $100 million, assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios. Moving to capital. Our CET1 grew from 9.1% to 9.3% during the quarter. The increase in capital reflects our strong earnings generation, which was partially offset by the impact of a $100 million share repurchase completed in December. Moving to our current outlook. We expect full-year average total loan growth between 3% and 4% compared to 2022. We expect most of the growth to come from the commercial loan portfolio, which is expected to increase in the mid-single-digits in 2023. We expect line utilization to be stable in the first-half of 2023, but then decline slightly to 36% as capital markets conditions improve a bit in the second-half of the year. We expect total consumer loans to increase modestly as an expected increase from Dividend Finance and modest growth from home equity and card will be mostly offset by a decline in auto and mortgage reflecting the environment. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to be stable sequentially. We expect commercial loans to increase 1% reflecting strong pipelines in middle market and corporate banking, and assuming commercial revolver utilization rates remain generally stable. We expect consumer balances to be stable to down 1%, reflecting lower auto and residential mortgage balances, partially offset by dividend loan originations of $1 billion or so in the first quarter. From a funding perspective, we expect average core deposits to be stable to down a 1% sequentially, reflecting seasonal factors before resuming modest growth in the subsequent quarters of 2023. We expect continued migration from DDA into interest-bearing products throughout 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits ending the year in the low 30s. Shifting to the income statement. Given our loan outlook and the benefits of our balance sheet management, we expect full year NII to increase 13% to 14%. Our forecast assumes our securities portfolio remains relatively stable from the second-half of 2022 levels and reflects the forward curve as of early January with Fed funds increasing to 5% in the first quarter and the first 25 basis point rate cut occurring in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our current outlook assumes total interest-bearing deposit costs, which were 112 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2022 to increase in the first-half of 2023 before settling in around 2% or so in the second-half of 2023. Our outlook contemplates an environment of continued deposit competition, which would result in a cumulative deposit beta by the end of 2023 of around 42%, given the two additional rate hikes in our forecast over our October guidance. The future impacts of deposit repricing lag combined with the dynamics of our loan portfolio should result in our full year 2023 net interest margin, increasing five basis points or so relative to the fourth quarter of 2022 NIM. We expect NII in the first quarter to be down 1% to 2% sequentially reflecting the impact of a lower day count in the quarter combined with stable loan balances. We expect adjusted non-interest income to be relatively stable in 2023, reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments and talent and capabilities resulting in stronger gross treasury management revenue, capital markets fees, wealth and asset management revenue and mortgage servicing to be offset by the market headwinds impacting top line mortgage revenue and higher earnings credit rates on treasury management, as well as subdued leasing remarketing revenue. If capital markets conditions do not improve, we would expect to generate improved NII and lowered expenses in the second-half of 2023. We expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from $46 million in 2022 to $22 million in 2023. Our guidance also assumes a minimal amount of private equity income in 2023 compared to around $70 million in the prior year. We expect first quarter adjusted non-interest income to be down 6% to 7% compared to the fourth quarter, excluding the impacts of the TRA, largely reflecting seasonal factors. Additionally, we expect to continue generating strong financial risk management revenue, which we expect will be offset by slowdown in M&A advisory revenue and the impacts of higher earnings credits and software top line mortgage banking revenue given the rate environment. We expect full year adjusted non-interest expense to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022. Our expense outlook includes a one point headwind each from the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on January 1st, the mark-to-market impact on non-qualified deferred compensation plans, which was a reduction in 2022 expenses and the full year expense impact of Dividend Finance. We also continue to invest in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth of around 10% consistent with the past several years. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid-single-digits area. Our outlook assumes we close 25 branches in the first-half of 2023 that will deliver in year expense savings and also add 30 to 35 new branches in our high growth markets, which will result in high-single-digits growth of our Southeast branch network. We expect first quarter total adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 6% to 7% compared to the fourth quarter. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal expenses associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, expenses will be down approximately 2% in the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 9% to 10%, resulting in PPNR growth in the 15% to 17% range. This would result in a sub 53% efficiency ratio for the full year, a three point improvement from 2022. We expect 2023 net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range with first quarter net charge-offs in the 25 to 30 basis point range. In summary, with our strong PPNR growth engine, discipline credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees, and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChris Doll: Thanks Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, guys. How are you?\nTimothy Spence: Morning Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you share with us, Tim, when you talk to your business customers, it seems like there's a real disconnect between everybody's outlook for loan loss reserve building. We understand, of course, at CECL, and you're going to be proactive life of loan losses. And you and your peers are building up the reserves, but then you look at the spreads in the high yield market, they're coming in. One of your competitors yesterday pointed out that the commercial loan spreads haven't widened out. Where is the disconnect? Or are we just going to fall off a cliff possibly in the second-half of the year? But can you share with us what are your commercial customers seeing in their day-to-day business? And are they seeing the weakness that everybody is projecting that will happen later this year?\nTimothy Spence: Yes. Sure, Gerard and thanks for the question. I don't think we're going to fall off a cliff in the second-half of the year. That's certainly not consistent with what I hear. I was out and went and looked at the calendar the other day. I got to get into eight of our 15 markets in the fourth quarter of this past year. And I think I probably saw 40 or 50 clients while I was out there. I mean, here's what I hear. Like if you look at the manufacturing clients as an example, they're all feeling much more optimistic about moderation as it relates to raw materials. And I think by and large, they solved the supply chain issues that they were facing either through inventory builds or through restructuring the supply chain or because the overseas suppliers that they were relying on to come back online or there isn't an issue in the ports or otherwise. I think the issues they're running into are twofold. One, labor continues to be a challenge and it's labor cost, but it's also just labor availability. Two, because they solved their supply chain challenges through building inventory. When you think about lower inventory turns, you add in rising interest rates, now debt service costs to revenue or higher proportion. And so, while they got the costs associated with raw materials through this last year in price increases, they're all looking to the next 18 to 24 months to try to figure out how they pass on just this sort of continued slow grind on labor, and debt service costs. The services clients are having no problem pushing through costs, which I think is like evident in the inflation data and personally to anybody that took a vacation over the holidays this year. And they continue to be optimistic because demand has remained strong. I think what I hear more than anything else is that we're going to have a little bit of a slow grind down here in terms of growth, and that if anything, the thing I'm more worried about is not do we end up with plus 5%, 0.5% GDP or minus 0.5% GDP, but rather that the market may be overly optimistic about how quickly the Fed is going to be able to bring rates down. And that the byproduct of that is from an operating standpoint, you have to be thinking a lot more about how you position the balance sheet for the next three to five years and for more tepid growth and higher rates than worrying about the next, call it, 12 months in terms of the outlook.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Very helpful. Jamie, circling back to you on one of your favorite topics, AOCI. Can you share with us two things? One, what does the accretion look like coming into 2023 for the AOCI number? And second, in your securities portfolio, I think you showed in your release that the taxable securities are yielding 3% today. What are you guys seeing in new yields as you put money to work?\nJames Leonard: Yes. Thanks Gerard. And yes, I knew when we put you in the queue, I was going to get an AOCI question, so, thanks for living up to that. In terms of the AOCI, if you look at year-end levels with the 10-year at roughly 387, the AOCI, earns back with our duration at 5.4. It earns back pretty evenly across that time period. So, a billion or so of TCE earn back per year. Obviously, no capital impact given that we're category four. If you fast forward to today and where the 10-year is, certainly we've had a significant improvement in the AOCI just in the first 19 days of January. So that would be helpful to the TCE as well. In terms of the securities yields, obviously, we're very pleased with how the portfolio is positioned at a 3% yield. I would expect that what's going to happen with the investment portfolio is that it will continue to grind higher each quarter and finish the year at a 310 level. So, the average for the year is probably in the 305 range, because as we're reinvesting cash flows or seeing opportunities on new investments, we're looking at entry points in that 475 area right now.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from a line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Mayo: Hi. I know you guys walk -- I think it was your phrase that how the maturity securities were like being in the ROTCE motel, if I got that right. And you have hard -- what it's like hardly any securities held to maturity, which gives you flexibility and I'm not sure how much that matters. And maybe just gives you more flexibility as you look ahead, but you're also one of the few banks that are -- if you take the midpoint of your guidance, you're guiding for higher NII off fourth quarter levels. And I'm -- is there a connection between how you're managing your securities book and that guidance, or are they separate? But really the question is, NII guide as it relates to your securities.\nJames Leonard: Yes. Mike, it's Jamie. Yes, I did reference the ROTCE motel few quarters back. And I guess today's theme, it's -- the held to maturity is more like a hide the maturity. And it certainly helps having that flexibility to reposition as environments change. But really there's no one thing that's driving the strong NII outlook and NIM expansion for us. It really is the result of years of hard work of deliberately positioning the balance sheet for really what is a range of outcomes that still could play out given all of the uncertainty. And it really is a total company effort. And that comes from the household growth, new commercial relationships, product innovation, the FinTech acquisitions, and ultimately sales execution both on loan pricing and deposit generations. So that's really what is giving us the ability to grow NII during the course of 2023, as well as expanding NIM at the same time. And I think it's one of those capabilities of Fifth Third that we've proven over the past decade that's perhaps underappreciated by the market. And like you said, the securities are certainly going to be a higher level of gross income over the course of 2023, in part because we were patient in deploying the excess cash that we had and not buying securities when the 10-year was below 2% or even below 1% like some of the other banks. I think one of the bigger differentiators for us will be the fixed rate loan businesses that we have in our ability to emphasize or deemphasize those businesses. And right now, we have a little bit of an emphasis on auto being able to generate roughly $6 billion this year. And then dividend where the gross income on dividend will exceed over $200 million of growth in 2023 relative to 2022. And so really when you package it all together with an investment portfolio that's in a net discount position of about $1 billion, a dividend portfolio that by the end of 2023 will have unamortized fees, that will roll through NII of about $1 billion. We've got a lot of downside protection and a core franchise that with its ability to grow loans and deposits really is helpful. And within all of this guide, we do not assume spread widening. So to the extent that were to happen is, Tim mentioned, that would only be upside to our guide.\nMichael Mayo: And then, Tim, just a broader level. I mean, do you see a recession based on your bottom up analysis based on all the markets you're visiting, based on the clients you're talking to? I mean, we hear so much recession talk and then we hear about your loan growth and everything else. What do you just think from a high level standpoint? And then what are your assumptions for reserves in terms of unemployment?\nTimothy Spence: Yes. I'll let Jamie fill the question on the specific assumptions on reserves, Mike. But I probably lost my crystal ball when I moved offices earlier this past year. So, I have to rely on what I hear from clients or what we get from our friends at Moody's and otherwise. If you asked me today, I would tell you we're going to have a shallow recession, I think. But I don't know that there's a big difference between a half a percent of growth and a half a percent of GDP decline in particular, given the amount of derisking that's been done inside the banking sector and certainly inside Fifth Third over the course of the past decade. I think the more interesting dynamic really is going to be this question about the duration of a recession if we see it, and what happens if we don't get a typical recovery, right? If you have several years of below trend growth and inflation that sits above the historic, certainly above the historic 2% target. But Jamie, you want to fill the question on the inputs on the reserves?\nJames Leonard: Yes. Mike, as you know, we used the Moody scenarios of -- their baseline scenario, and that drives 80% weighting and we maintained our weightings at 80.10% with the upside, and the S3 their adverse scenario or 10% probability scenario. So in the adverse, the unemployment gets -- almost up to 8% in the baseline unemployment ratchets is up to 4.2%. And then we blend those scenarios together to drive the ACL. So, I think it meshes well with what Tim's comments were of a shallow or mild downturn in the economy and then a recovery.\nMichael Mayo: So that's 20% for the 8% unemployment, and 80% for the 4.2% unemployment.\nJames Leonard: 10% on the upside, which is the upside scenario is that the Fed delivers a soft landing, so unemployment stays in the high threes. So 10% in the high threes a baseline at 4.2% peak, and then a downside at 10%, at a 7.8% unemployment.\nMichael Mayo: Got it. All right. Thank you.\nJames Leonard: Yep.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers: Good morning everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Jamie, I guess it doesn't -- based on what you said, it doesn't feel like you would get there anytime soon. But in the past, you talked about sort of the 330 margin floor in the event of low rates. Just curious, given all the sort of the ebbs and flows we've had in expectations and just the own -- pardon me -- the moves you've made with your own balance sheet, how are you thinking about that lower bound kind of as we go forward in that 330 level?\nJames Leonard: Yes. We feel very good about the ability to have a floor on the NIM at that 330 level and a 200 down scenario should that play out, given all the work we've done on the investment portfolio with the bullet locked out cash flows along with being in a fairly sizable net discount position and the duration that we have combined with the fixed rate loan origination platforms with auto, Dividend and Provide, those should all provide yields. And then as we've talked in the past, we've layered in $15 billion of received fixed swaps that will also provide additional protection from 2025 through 2032. And that may be one other differentiator for us relative to peers is that we've been focused more on protecting that downside over a longer period of time and therefore, the duration of our swap book as well as our investment portfolio maybe a little better positioned should that downturn occur at the end of the decade.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Thank you. And then switching gears just a bit. Maybe some thoughts on kind of the trajectory of fees as we go through the year. You guys always have the seasonality that helps fourth quarter -- hurts the first. But it will be, I think a pretty substantial ramp up starting in the 2Q. Just curious, I think you alluded to capital markets kind of normalizing or recovering in the second-half of the year. Just maybe your thoughts on main drivers as the year plays out.\nJames Leonard: Sure. Thanks. When it comes to the fee income, we did say relatively stable over the course of the year and probably is helpful to look at it from two components. The first would be a category I'll call the factors in our control that do deliver nice growth, both from a strong customer acquisition perspective as well as overall fee generation from a combination of the branch network, our wealth business, the commercial business. That will drive both credit card income as well as wealth and asset management fees in the mid-single-digit area and top line fee equivalent growth in the treasury management area in the high-single-digit area given our strong product lineup. From there, transitioning to mortgage, that's actually going to be the largest growth item for us in 2023. And it really goes back to all the work that we put into growing the servicing business in 2020 and 2021 when levels were more depressed. It was a good buying opportunity. And so, given our strong mortgage servicing platform, we'll increase those fees from $125 million in 2022 to the $160 million area. So that's a growth of almost 30%, whereas top line mortgage should be relatively stable off very low levels. So, we feel good about those items. Capital markets, certainly the wildcard in our guide, given that we do expect mid to high-single-digits growth in the first-half of the year relative to the first-half of 2022. And then we assume a little bit of additional growth in the back half of the year under the assumption that the capital markets disruption should abate once the Fed reaches its terminal Fed fund level. And again, as I said in the prepared remarks, if that were to not happen, then we would expect a little bit better loan growth, a little bit better NII and lower expenses. So, in terms of PPNR on a relative basis, I feel confident in that should the capital markets improvement not occur. And then the other category when it comes to fees, it would be the headwinds facing us. So, they're really environmental given the increase in interest rates, and that's on the earnings credit. We're managing earnings credits to about a 20 beta, which is a little bit better than what we thought as we entered the cycle. But even with that, service charges ultimately will be down mid-single-digits for the year, which more than offset that strong top line fee equivalent growth. On the consumer overdraft and NSF side, we probably do a little bit better relative to peers, just given that we move sooner on some of those fee and structural changes. But overall, the first-half of the year will be a little bit softer as we lap those changes that occurred mid year 2022. And then as we said in the prepared remarks, the TRA will decline in 2023 as well our expectations on lower private equity income so that other fees will be down 20%, 25% or so.\nTimothy Spence: I think if there's one thing I might add there, it's -- while we expect capital markets to improve this year, I would not say we expect them to normalize or recover with the investments that have been made in that business. A full recovery in capital markets would result in a substantially larger business and revenue footprint than we're anticipating this year. We just don't expect it to be as bad or as locked up as we saw in 2022.\nScott Siefers: Excellent. That\u2019s terrific color. Thank you guys very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nManan Gosalia: Hey, good morning.\nTimothy Spence: Good morning.\nManan Gosalia: I was wondering, can you just walk through the puts and takes around deposit growth in 2023? I mean, it seems like the expansion in the Southeast is definitely a tailwind here. So, how are you thinking about deposit growth, especially given the more challenging macro backdrop?\nBryan Preston: Yes. This is Bryan. Certainly, we feel good about our franchise and the improvements that we've made over the years. We have a very strong new customer origination engine, both across consumer and commercial. We've got strong new consumer household growth, strong in QRs from a commercial perspective. We have a very high performing treasury management business that provides a lot of deposit support as well as growth. And as you mentioned, our Southeast branch expansion, obviously, is going to create a tailwind for us as well. And finally, we have proven and analytically driven customer offers that have done a really nice job through the cycle and driving the balances when we need them. So, we continue to maintain a lot of confidence in the environment that we're going to be able to deliver and gain our fair share of deposits as the environment changes. Obviously, we can't grow in all environments, but we are cautiously optimistic and well positioned.\nTimothy Spence: Yes. And just to put a number on the -- narrowly on the Southeast, like we grew consumer deposits by over 6% in the Southeast this past year to Bryan's point. That is anti has been a tailwind for us.\nManan Gosalia: Got it. Helpful. And then, maybe the flip side of that is the wholesale funding. We saw you had some wholesale funding earlier in the year. So, are those balances where you'd like them to be for now? And how does that fit into the overall funding strategy?\nBryan Preston: Yes. We're very comfortable with where we are from a wholesale funding perspective. We continue to have very significant contingent liquidity sources that help us manage through uncertainty in the environment. If we see decent deposit growth, we could see those wholesale funding balances come down over time. But we have a lot of flexibility across our funding base to help us manage through both liquidity needs as well as net interest income.\nManan Gosalia: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning. I guess, I just had one follow-up question on the credit comments earlier, Tim. You mentioned about the resiliency of the bank. But when you think about your scenario of higher for longer rates, do you think that begins to weigh on your customers when you look at either on C&I or on the CRE book that the longer the Fed has to stay at the five-plus rate, their cost of equity, capital is going higher, demand is falling off? And does that lead to a lot more pain on credit, maybe not in later in the year into 2024 absent Fed rate cuts?\nTimothy Spence: Yes. Let me give you the quick answer, and then I'll let Richard comment. Absolutely. I think that is our view is that it's more of a slow growing dynamic here than a cliff, right, as Gerard mentioned earlier. And that the longer that we go with rates at elevated levels, the more pressure that it places on business -- commercial borrowers, in particular. I think our consumer borrower is a little bit different because such a significant share of our consumer lending is done to homeowners that they've had the ability to inoculate themselves a little bit from inflation because they locked in these historically low fixed rate cost of housing. Richard, do you want to talk a little bit about where specifically you think that grind may take a toll?\nRichard Stein: Yes. Ebrahim, I think there's a couple of things here. To your question specifically, clearly higher interest rates for longer is going to put pressure across the board. And I think that's, frankly, by design from a Fed standpoint to get things to slow down. The biggest impact is going to be in the leverage lending portfolio. We're starting with higher levels of leverage. Clearly, higher interest rates impact free cash flow. One of the things that we do is when we do our underwriting, and frankly our quarterly monitoring is we will go back and look at the rate curve. And in fact, we look at -- we underwrite the rate curve, forward curve plus 200 basis points to make sure that there's enough cushion in free cash flow so that when we're underwriting and taking on these loans, we can -- we believe these borrowers can withstand the pressure of higher rates through their margins and free cash flow. I think the other thing we're watching for, and as we think about the economy and Tim referenced labor, both cost and availability that in certain segments continues to put pressure on margins, particularly for those industries that have a mismatch between the revenue management and their expense management. So, maybe they've got long-term fixed price sales contracts they've got to manage through with short-term labor. And probably the most acute example of where this is happening is in pockets of healthcare, senior living. We've talked about not-for-profit hospitals, which have low margins. The cost to deliver care and service has gone up pretty dramatically. You can look at nursing availability and wages is a really good example. And there's a lag there in the revenue cycle in terms of reimbursement rates, whether it's public or private, where these companies -- for these companies to maintain margins, profitability. And so, in those cases, we're looking at other things the quality of the balance sheet, liquidity and liquidity burn rates. But no question that the higher -- as rates are higher for longer, it puts pressure on businesses. I think the last thing, and this is part of client selection is understanding the ability of our borrowers to adapt and the resilience to these things. So, it's not just a situation where rates are higher, and companies don't adapt or consumers don't adapt. And it's part of the relationship model and part of the way we go to market in terms of the advice and counsel with our customers, understanding what's happening, looking for alternatives, finding new ways to finance these customers. So that resilience through the cycle will continue to endure.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That was helpful. And I guess, just one quick follow-up, Jamie, on Dividend Finance. About $100 million of provisioning. Anything else around Dividend Finance in terms of growth outlook this year versus last year that we should be aware of? Are things picking up or slowing down as we think about just the underlying growth in the business?\nJames Leonard: Yes. We feel very good about the business that Dividend is doing, especially on the solar side of the aisle. And for us, we're expecting roughly $4.5 billion of originations in 2023 with a weighting of 90% solar, 10% home improvement. Home improvement we're less enamored with. But again, it's a good product offering for other points in the cycle. So, it's being deemphasized, and solar continues to do incredibly well. And if anything, there's perhaps a little bit of upside to our NII guide on Dividend for 2023, just given the strength of the business as well as the pricing power.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Noted. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari: Morning.\nTimothy Spence: Morning.\nJohn Pancari: On the credit front, I know you gave us really good detail on delinquencies and non-accruals. Do you have what criticized assets did in the quarter? And what areas of criticized they have migrated negatively?\nRichard Stein: Yes. This is Richard. Thanks for the question. Criticized assets were flat for the quarter, both nominally. I think we had a little bit loan growth, so about three basis points of commercial improvement across the board. I would also point out that in addition to credit being stable, delinquencies 30 to 89, 90 and above, NPAs charge-offs were all down for the quarter on the commercial side. I think the things we're watching, and I hit on it a little bit, healthcare, specifically not-for-profit hospitals and senior living for the reasons we just talked about, we've seen some pressure there because of the mismatch between the revenue management and expense management. A little bit of pressure in watching in commercial specialty products, consumer specialty products, right? That's a function of consumers shifting from durables and discretionaries to consumables and non-discretionary and supply chain and inventory management issues. That's the trading down issue. And that's where we've seen most of the movement. The leverage portfolio from an asset quality standpoint has been stable and operating within our expectations.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then sticking to credit, just my follow-up is around both commercial real estate and home equity. In commercial real estate, it looks like you did see pretty noteworthy move up in delinquencies as well as the non-accruals. And so, can you guys talk a little bit about property types within commercial real estate where you're seeing the distress and where your loan to value ratios are? And then in home equity, it looks like you also saw a pretty noteworthy increase in delinquencies there. Just want to get color around that portfolio. Thanks.\nRichard Stein: Let me take commercial real estate. I think when you think about the delinquencies, if you look at the delinquencies and this is on the slide deck on slide 30, 90 plus is still zero. We've got none. Movements in 30 to 89, six basis points, it's off a really, really low, low base. So, it's not something that we're concerned about from a commercial real estate perspective. I think the thing we're watching for -- we're watching -- I know a lot of people got questions on office. We're watching office. That's a small number for us. In fact, our performance in office is actually in line with or better than the rest of the commercial bank. But there is some pressure there as occupancy attendance and lease rates continue to -- and sublease rates continue to fall. I think there's a couple of things. We've got a very small amount of urban central business district office. That's where most of the pressure is in terms of subletting rates. That for us is Class A property. I would also tell you that in addition to class, vintage matters. That's all new product. It's a new product. It's ESG, qualified lead golden platinum. It has all the modern amenities. So, we feel really good about those particular properties. The rest of our office portfolio sits more in suburban markets. And again, you don't have the same pressure from a lease rate, sublease rate and a tenant perspective across the board. Across the rest of commercial real estate, multifamily continues to perform very well. The demographic trends, the household formation continue to be strong. Rental rates continue to accelerate faster than construction costs. So, again, there's a positive tailwind there. Same thing with industrial. Industrial demand, this kind of goes back to the reshoring thing, trend. Industrial demand is really strong, continues -- lease rates continue to hold in. So, we feel really good there. Hospitality is stable. And that continues to be a good trend and then in retail is stable. So, feeling really good about where we are from an overall perspective in commercial real estate. You want to add a comment?\nTimothy Spence: John, I just was going to say on the equity side, all you're seeing, I think, in the consumer for us at the moment is just seasonality. Like a sequential comp from the third quarter to the fourth quarter are the wrong comparisons. Just given the natural seasonality in those businesses, I think it's better just to look at year-over-year. And we expect consumer credit to normalize over time. That's reflected in the guide that we gave. But the delinquency dynamics there are really no different than what you would have seen pre-pandemic, other than the fact that they're still muted relative to what we would have had in the past. So, I -- personally, home equity is not the area that's been an area of focus for me. That's for certain.\nJohn Pancari: Yes, yes. No, I got that. I just saw the reserve addition as well to the home equity allowance.\nTimothy Spence: Well, actually, the dynamic there is that for the first time in as long as I've been at the bank, we actually had quarter-over-quarter home equity growth. What's driving that outcome, but not a change in perspective for us on the quality of the credit or the likely outcomes there.\nJohn Pancari: Right. Good problem to have. Okay. Alright. Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatthew O'Connor: Good morning. I might have misheard the comment on the indirect auto kind of loan growth expectations for this year. Can you just repeat that, what the strategy is and what you're seeing in the spreads there?\nJames Leonard: Yes. Actually, spreads have done well and are actually off to a very solid start in 2023. We finished the year in 2022 with 7.1 billion of production, if you take auto as well as the RV, marine and specialty business combined. So that fixed rate consumer secured loan category. Our expectation for 2023 for that asset class is to be down to about 6 billion or so. So, loan balances in that caption, we would expect to be down. However, yields, we expect to improve 100 basis points from the fourth quarter 2022 levels to fourth quarter 2023 levels. So, it is a nice accelerator to the earlier question around how are you able to deliver both NII growth and NIM expansion. That certainly is a helpful driver.\nMatthew O'Connor: Got it. And then just separately on the capital level, we're seeing some divergence in targeted capital out there. Obviously, there's like upward pressure at the biggest banks, not really relevant to you. But then some of your peers are targeting closer to 10%. And I'm certainly on board with 9%, seeming very high. But I'm wondering, is there any kind of behind the scenes pressure whether it's rating agencies or regulators to just hold a little bit more, given some of the macro uncertainty or anything else that we're not seeing?\nJames Leonard: Yes. Great question, Matt. Thanks for asking. I would say that as this environment unfolds, it really is, to your point, going to create differentiation in both performance execution and overall balance sheet positioning. We've, I think, for a number of quarters and years now been discussing how cautious our outlook is. And that has really informed what we're willing to do from a credit risk appetite perspective. So, the capital levels ultimately are a factor of the credit profile of what's on the sheet as well as the reserve levels that we have. So, the CET1 level at 925 and an ACL level of 198 creates a very sufficient loss absorption capacity. And given our SCB level is the at the minimum, I think external factors or forces would say that we're very well-positioned from a credit profile perspective as well as from a loss absorption capacity. So, we feel good about that.\nMatthew O'Connor: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Ben Reseck [ph] on for Ken. Just a quick follow-up on the Dividend Finance. As those originations continue to ramp up and mortgage loans go on balance sheet, when do you ultimately see that NII benefit overcoming the reserve builds and becoming accretive to earnings? And then, can you just remind us of what type of loss rates you're assuming on those dividend loans? Thanks.\nJames Leonard: Yes. Great question. The PPNR levels for Dividend will be positive in the back half of -- or in 2023. The net income of Dividend post ACL will be positive or accretive in 2024. Certainly, if prepayments accelerate faster than what we have modeled, then that large amount of unamortized platform fees will come through the P&L, would it improve or accelerate the return profile. But for now, that's how we have it playing out. And we model roughly an eight-year life on the dividend asset and that we would expect to have loss rates in the 125 basis point area on a blended basis for the portfolio per year over those eight years.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for taking the question.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Chris Doll, I turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nChris Doll: Thank you operator, and thanks everyone for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the investor relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator, you can now disconnect the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Movements in 30 to 89, six basis points, it's off a really, really low, low base. So, it's not something that we're concerned about from a commercial real estate perspective. I think the thing we're watching for -- we're watching -- I know a lot of people got questions on office. We're watching office. That's a small number for us. In fact, our performance in office is actually in line with or better than the rest of the commercial bank. But there is some pressure there as occupancy attendance and lease rates continue to -- and sublease rates continue to fall. I think there's a couple of things. We've got a very small amount of urban central business district office. That's where most of the pressure is in terms of subletting rates. That for us is Class A property. I would also tell you that in addition to class, vintage matters. That's all new product. It's a new product. It's ESG, qualified lead golden platinum. It has all the modern amenities. So, we feel really good about those particular properties. The rest of our office portfolio sits more in suburban markets. And again, you don't have the same pressure from a lease rate, sublease rate and a tenant perspective across the board. Across the rest of commercial real estate, multifamily continues to perform very well. The demographic trends, the household formation continue to be strong. Rental rates continue to accelerate faster than construction costs. So, again, there's a positive tailwind there. Same thing with industrial. Industrial demand, this kind of goes back to the reshoring thing, trend. Industrial demand is really strong, continues -- lease rates continue to hold in. So, we feel really good there. Hospitality is stable. And that continues to be a good trend and then in retail is stable. So, feeling really good about where we are from an overall perspective in commercial real estate.

            "name": "Timothy Spence",
            "content": "Thanks Chris and good morning, everyone. To start, I would like to thank our employees for the job they did, supporting our customers, communities, and shareholders in 2022. You really held true to our core values and our vision to be the one bank people most value and trust. JUST Capital and CNBC recently released their annual study of America's Most JUST Companies, a comprehensive ranking that recognizes companies who do right by all stakeholders has defined by the American public. Fifth Third ranked 23rd out of the roughly 1000 companies covered in the study and was the highest ranked category four bank. It's a great achievement. Thank you for it. Earlier today, we reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. The strength and quality of our franchise are evident in the numbers. We generated record full year revenue of $8.4 billion, up 6% over the prior year. We managed expenses down 1% year-over-year, producing positive operating leverage of 700 basis points and an efficiency ratio of 56%. Net charge-offs for the year were below 20 basis points. As a result, we achieved a full year return on tangible common equity ex AOCI of 16.5%, which places us in the top quartile of our peer group. Just as importantly, we did what we said we were going to do. We have a culture of accountability Fifth Third, and it makes me proud that our full year results exceeded the guidance we provided you last January in every major caption, including total revenue, expenses, and net charge-offs. As a result, PPNR increased 18% compared to our original guide of 7%. We also made important progress on our growth strategies in 2022. We grew consumer households at a peer leading organic growth rate of around 2.5%, led by our Southeast markets at 7% and surpassed last year's record for new quality relationships in our Commercial segment. We opened 18 new branches in the Southeast in 2022, bringing our three-year total to over 70 new branches in those markets. During the year we also made meaningful progress in our technology modernization initiatives and enhanced our peer leading, digitally enabled treasury management managed services, and our momentum banking product offerings. You may have seen that most recently we extended momentum's early pay feature to include income tax refunds. Our FinTech platforms, dividend finance, and provide continue to scale and achieve top national market shares with dividend ranking third and provide ranking second in their respective markets. Our fee generating businesses are better diversified than most peers and continue to be a key focus for investment. Strong performance in our capital markets business related to helping client hedging activities, mortgage servicing and treasury management, all helped to offset market headwinds that all banks faced as did continued net AUM and flows in our wealth management business. During 2022 we remained focused on delivering stable long-term results instead of chasing short-term earnings. We maintained our discipline in our credit underwriting with continued focus on granularity and diversification. The outcomes of this are evident in our NPA, NPL and early stage delinquency ratios, all of which have remained well behaved and well below normalized levels. Our balance sheet management approach remains centered on providing strong and stable NII performance across various rate environments. We extended our advantage in our securities yield by waiting to deploy excess liquidity until we were able to earn positive real yields and we added derivatives to provide hedge protection through 2031. These actions will provide significant long-term benefits in the event of a lower rate environment. With respect to capital, given our strong PPNR growth and benign credit losses, we exceeded our target CET1 ratio in the fourth quarter and resumed share repurchases. Our capital priorities for 2023 are to maintain a 9.25% CET1 ratio and support organic balance sheet growth, pay a strong dividend, and continue our share of purchase program. We expect repurchases to steadily increase each quarter for a total of approximately $1 billion during the year. Jamie will provide you with the detail on our financial outlook for 2023, but it is a strong one that is consistent with our priorities of stability, profitability, and organic growth. We expect to produce another year of strong revenue growth and operating leverage with full year PPNR growth in the mid to high teens, a return on tangible common equity ex AOCI exceeding 17% and an efficiency ratio below 53%. We will continue to invest in organic growth and efficiency initiatives. We'll add another 30 to 35 branches in our Southeast markets, including our first three in Charleston, South Carolina, and several more in the Greenville, Spartanburg, South Carolina corridor. We'll continue to increase investments in marketing and product innovation to accelerate household growth and we'll invest in scaling dividend and provide. Lastly, we'll make significant progress on our tech modernization journey and begin to realize savings and improve the client experience by leveraging these investments to drive automation into our most labor intensive processes. You have my commitment that we will continue to make decisions with the long-term in mind to invest where we can strengthen the value and resiliency of our franchise and to hold ourselves accountable for doing what we say we will do. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our fourth quarter financial results and our current outlook for 2023. Morning Gerard. Yes. Sure, Gerard and thanks for the question. I don't think we're going to fall off a cliff in the second-half of the year. That's certainly not consistent with what I hear. I was out and went and looked at the calendar the other day. I got to get into eight of our 15 markets in the fourth quarter of this past year. And I think I probably saw 40 or 50 clients while I was out there. I mean, here's what I hear. Like if you look at the manufacturing clients as an example, they're all feeling much more optimistic about moderation as it relates to raw materials. And I think by and large, they solved the supply chain issues that they were facing either through inventory builds or through restructuring the supply chain or because the overseas suppliers that they were relying on to come back online or there isn't an issue in the ports or otherwise. I think the issues they're running into are twofold. One, labor continues to be a challenge and it's labor cost, but it's also just labor availability. Two, because they solved their supply chain challenges through building inventory. When you think about lower inventory turns, you add in rising interest rates, now debt service costs to revenue or higher proportion. And so, while they got the costs associated with raw materials through this last year in price increases, they're all looking to the next 18 to 24 months to try to figure out how they pass on just this sort of continued slow grind on labor, and debt service costs. The services clients are having no problem pushing through costs, which I think is like evident in the inflation data and personally to anybody that took a vacation over the holidays this year. And they continue to be optimistic because demand has remained strong. I think what I hear more than anything else is that we're going to have a little bit of a slow grind down here in terms of growth, and that if anything, the thing I'm more worried about is not do we end up with plus 5%, 0.5% GDP or minus 0.5% GDP, but rather that the market may be overly optimistic about how quickly the Fed is going to be able to bring rates down. And that the byproduct of that is from an operating standpoint, you have to be thinking a lot more about how you position the balance sheet for the next three to five years and for more tepid growth and higher rates than worrying about the next, call it, 12 months in terms of the outlook. Yes. I'll let Jamie fill the question on the specific assumptions on reserves, Mike. But I probably lost my crystal ball when I moved offices earlier this past year. So, I have to rely on what I hear from clients or what we get from our friends at Moody's and otherwise. If you asked me today, I would tell you we're going to have a shallow recession, I think. But I don't know that there's a big difference between a half a percent of growth and a half a percent of GDP decline in particular, given the amount of derisking that's been done inside the banking sector and certainly inside Fifth Third over the course of the past decade. I think the more interesting dynamic really is going to be this question about the duration of a recession if we see it, and what happens if we don't get a typical recovery, right? If you have several years of below trend growth and inflation that sits above the historic, certainly above the historic 2% target. But Jamie, you want to fill the question on the inputs on the reserves? I think if there's one thing I might add there, it's -- while we expect capital markets to improve this year, I would not say we expect them to normalize or recover with the investments that have been made in that business. A full recovery in capital markets would result in a substantially larger business and revenue footprint than we're anticipating this year. We just don't expect it to be as bad or as locked up as we saw in 2022. Good morning. Yes. And just to put a number on the -- narrowly on the Southeast, like we grew consumer deposits by over 6% in the Southeast this past year to Bryan's point. That is anti has been a tailwind for us. Yes. Let me give you the quick answer, and then I'll let Richard comment. Absolutely. I think that is our view is that it's more of a slow growing dynamic here than a cliff, right, as Gerard mentioned earlier. And that the longer that we go with rates at elevated levels, the more pressure that it places on business -- commercial borrowers, in particular. I think our consumer borrower is a little bit different because such a significant share of our consumer lending is done to homeowners that they've had the ability to inoculate themselves a little bit from inflation because they locked in these historically low fixed rate cost of housing. Richard, do you want to talk a little bit about where specifically you think that grind may take a toll? Morning. John, I just was going to say on the equity side, all you're seeing, I think, in the consumer for us at the moment is just seasonality. Like a sequential comp from the third quarter to the fourth quarter are the wrong comparisons. Just given the natural seasonality in those businesses, I think it's better just to look at year-over-year. And we expect consumer credit to normalize over time. That's reflected in the guide that we gave. But the delinquency dynamics there are really no different than what you would have seen pre-pandemic, other than the fact that they're still muted relative to what we would have had in the past. So, I -- personally, home equity is not the area that's been an area of focus for me. That's for certain. Well, actually, the dynamic there is that for the first time in as long as I've been at the bank, we actually had quarter-over-quarter home equity growth. What's driving that outcome, but not a change in perspective for us on the quality of the credit or the likely outcomes there."

            "name": "James Leonard",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim and thank all of you for joining us today. Our quarterly and full year financial performance reflect focused execution and resiliency throughout the bank. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories and generated record revenue. NII was positively impacted by higher market rates as deposit repricing has lagged the repricing of our earning assets, combined with the benefits of fixed rate asset generation at higher rates. Fee income has remained resilient despite the market related headwinds and expenses were well controlled while we continue to reinvest in our businesses. We achieved a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of 56%, which improved throughout the year with the fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio below 52%. Our fourth quarter PPNR grew 12% compared to last quarter and 40% compared to last year. Net interest income of approximately $1.6 billion was a record for the bank and increase 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Our NIM expanded 13 basis points for the quarter. While interest-bearing core deposit costs increased 64 basis points to 105 basis points, reflecting a cycle to date interest-bearing core deposit beta of 24% in the fourth quarter. Total non-interest income increased 9% sequentially driven by our TRA revenue and commercial banking fees. That growth in commercial banking fee income was primarily driven by higher M&A advisory revenue and client financial risk management revenue, and it was partially offset by softer results in mortgage banking origination fees. Non-interest expense increased just 1% compared to the year ago quarter. This expense growth was driven by our acquisition of Dividend Finance during the year combined with continued investments in Provide compensation associated with our minimum wage hike, as well as higher technology and communications expense, reflecting our focus on platform modernization initiatives. Excluding the impacts of Dividend and Provide, total expenses would've been down 1% year-over-year. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increase 1% sequentially. Average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 1% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting an increase in C&I balances. Growth was led by our corporate bank and robust in almost all of our industry verticals. Among our verticals, production was strongest in energy, including renewables, which increased over 50% year-over-year. Healthcare growth was led by Provide with Provide balances up 150% year-over-year. The period end commercial revolver utilization rate remains stable compared to last quarter at 37%. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increase 1% compared to the prior quarter, led by Dividend Finance as well as growth in home equity. This was partially offset by a decline in indirect secured consumer loans. Average total deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter as an increase in commercial deposits was partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits. Period end deposits increase 1% compared to the prior quarter. After the deliberate runoff of surge deposits in the middle of the year, we have achieved solid deposit outcomes throughout the second-half of 2022 reflecting our strong core deposit franchise. Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends remain healthy and our key credit metrics remained well below normalized levels. The MPA ratio of 44 basis points was down two basis points sequentially, and our commercial MPA ratio has now declined for nine consecutive quarters. The net charge-off ratio increased just one basis point sequentially to 22 basis points within our guidance range. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due also increased only two basis points sequentially and remains below 2019 levels. From a balance sheet management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on high quality relationships. In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We also have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in non-prime consumer borrowers among our peers. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in CRE. Across all commercial portfolios, we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress and continue to closely watch the leverage loan portfolio and office CRE. We have focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong stable NII through the cycle. Our strong deposit franchise, our investment portfolio positioning, and our cash flow hedge portfolios will provide protection against lower rates well beyond just the next few years, as well as the addition of the fixed rate lending capabilities from both Dividend and Provide should continue to support our strong through the cycle outcomes. Moving to the ACL. Our ACL built this quarter was $112 million, primarily reflecting loan growth. Dividend Finance loans contributed $96 million to the ACL build. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the unemployment rate reaches 4.2%, while the downside scenario underlying our allowance coverage incorporates a peak unemployment rate of 7.8%. Given our expected period end loan growth, including continued strong production from Dividend Finance, we currently expect a first quarter build to the ACL of approximately $100 million, assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios. Moving to capital. Our CET1 grew from 9.1% to 9.3% during the quarter. The increase in capital reflects our strong earnings generation, which was partially offset by the impact of a $100 million share repurchase completed in December. Moving to our current outlook. We expect full-year average total loan growth between 3% and 4% compared to 2022. We expect most of the growth to come from the commercial loan portfolio, which is expected to increase in the mid-single-digits in 2023. We expect line utilization to be stable in the first-half of 2023, but then decline slightly to 36% as capital markets conditions improve a bit in the second-half of the year. We expect total consumer loans to increase modestly as an expected increase from Dividend Finance and modest growth from home equity and card will be mostly offset by a decline in auto and mortgage reflecting the environment. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to be stable sequentially. We expect commercial loans to increase 1% reflecting strong pipelines in middle market and corporate banking, and assuming commercial revolver utilization rates remain generally stable. We expect consumer balances to be stable to down 1%, reflecting lower auto and residential mortgage balances, partially offset by dividend loan originations of $1 billion or so in the first quarter. From a funding perspective, we expect average core deposits to be stable to down a 1% sequentially, reflecting seasonal factors before resuming modest growth in the subsequent quarters of 2023. We expect continued migration from DDA into interest-bearing products throughout 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits ending the year in the low 30s. Shifting to the income statement. Given our loan outlook and the benefits of our balance sheet management, we expect full year NII to increase 13% to 14%. Our forecast assumes our securities portfolio remains relatively stable from the second-half of 2022 levels and reflects the forward curve as of early January with Fed funds increasing to 5% in the first quarter and the first 25 basis point rate cut occurring in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our current outlook assumes total interest-bearing deposit costs, which were 112 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2022 to increase in the first-half of 2023 before settling in around 2% or so in the second-half of 2023. Our outlook contemplates an environment of continued deposit competition, which would result in a cumulative deposit beta by the end of 2023 of around 42%, given the two additional rate hikes in our forecast over our October guidance. The future impacts of deposit repricing lag combined with the dynamics of our loan portfolio should result in our full year 2023 net interest margin, increasing five basis points or so relative to the fourth quarter of 2022 NIM. We expect NII in the first quarter to be down 1% to 2% sequentially reflecting the impact of a lower day count in the quarter combined with stable loan balances. We expect adjusted non-interest income to be relatively stable in 2023, reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments and talent and capabilities resulting in stronger gross treasury management revenue, capital markets fees, wealth and asset management revenue and mortgage servicing to be offset by the market headwinds impacting top line mortgage revenue and higher earnings credit rates on treasury management, as well as subdued leasing remarketing revenue. If capital markets conditions do not improve, we would expect to generate improved NII and lowered expenses in the second-half of 2023. We expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from $46 million in 2022 to $22 million in 2023. Our guidance also assumes a minimal amount of private equity income in 2023 compared to around $70 million in the prior year. We expect first quarter adjusted non-interest income to be down 6% to 7% compared to the fourth quarter, excluding the impacts of the TRA, largely reflecting seasonal factors. Additionally, we expect to continue generating strong financial risk management revenue, which we expect will be offset by slowdown in M&A advisory revenue and the impacts of higher earnings credits and software top line mortgage banking revenue given the rate environment. We expect full year adjusted non-interest expense to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022. Our expense outlook includes a one point headwind each from the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on January 1st, the mark-to-market impact on non-qualified deferred compensation plans, which was a reduction in 2022 expenses and the full year expense impact of Dividend Finance. We also continue to invest in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth of around 10% consistent with the past several years. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid-single-digits area. Our outlook assumes we close 25 branches in the first-half of 2023 that will deliver in year expense savings and also add 30 to 35 new branches in our high growth markets, which will result in high-single-digits growth of our Southeast branch network. We expect first quarter total adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 6% to 7% compared to the fourth quarter. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal expenses associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, expenses will be down approximately 2% in the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 9% to 10%, resulting in PPNR growth in the 15% to 17% range. This would result in a sub 53% efficiency ratio for the full year, a three point improvement from 2022. We expect 2023 net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range with first quarter net charge-offs in the 25 to 30 basis point range. In summary, with our strong PPNR growth engine, discipline credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees, and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Yes. Thanks Gerard. And yes, I knew when we put you in the queue, I was going to get an AOCI question, so, thanks for living up to that. In terms of the AOCI, if you look at year-end levels with the 10-year at roughly 387, the AOCI, earns back with our duration at 5.4. It earns back pretty evenly across that time period. So, a billion or so of TCE earn back per year. Obviously, no capital impact given that we're category four. If you fast forward to today and where the 10-year is, certainly we've had a significant improvement in the AOCI just in the first 19 days of January. So that would be helpful to the TCE as well. In terms of the securities yields, obviously, we're very pleased with how the portfolio is positioned at a 3% yield. I would expect that what's going to happen with the investment portfolio is that it will continue to grind higher each quarter and finish the year at a 310 level. So, the average for the year is probably in the 305 range, because as we're reinvesting cash flows or seeing opportunities on new investments, we're looking at entry points in that 475 area right now. Yes. Mike, it's Jamie. Yes, I did reference the ROTCE motel few quarters back. And I guess today's theme, it's -- the held to maturity is more like a hide the maturity. And it certainly helps having that flexibility to reposition as environments change. But really there's no one thing that's driving the strong NII outlook and NIM expansion for us. It really is the result of years of hard work of deliberately positioning the balance sheet for really what is a range of outcomes that still could play out given all of the uncertainty. And it really is a total company effort. And that comes from the household growth, new commercial relationships, product innovation, the FinTech acquisitions, and ultimately sales execution both on loan pricing and deposit generations. So that's really what is giving us the ability to grow NII during the course of 2023, as well as expanding NIM at the same time. And I think it's one of those capabilities of Fifth Third that we've proven over the past decade that's perhaps underappreciated by the market. And like you said, the securities are certainly going to be a higher level of gross income over the course of 2023, in part because we were patient in deploying the excess cash that we had and not buying securities when the 10-year was below 2% or even below 1% like some of the other banks. I think one of the bigger differentiators for us will be the fixed rate loan businesses that we have in our ability to emphasize or deemphasize those businesses. And right now, we have a little bit of an emphasis on auto being able to generate roughly $6 billion this year. And then dividend where the gross income on dividend will exceed over $200 million of growth in 2023 relative to 2022. And so really when you package it all together with an investment portfolio that's in a net discount position of about $1 billion, a dividend portfolio that by the end of 2023 will have unamortized fees, that will roll through NII of about $1 billion. We've got a lot of downside protection and a core franchise that with its ability to grow loans and deposits really is helpful. And within all of this guide, we do not assume spread widening. So to the extent that were to happen is, Tim mentioned, that would only be upside to our guide. Yes. Mike, as you know, we used the Moody scenarios of -- their baseline scenario, and that drives 80% weighting and we maintained our weightings at 80.10% with the upside, and the S3 their adverse scenario or 10% probability scenario. So in the adverse, the unemployment gets -- almost up to 8% in the baseline unemployment ratchets is up to 4.2%. And then we blend those scenarios together to drive the ACL. So, I think it meshes well with what Tim's comments were of a shallow or mild downturn in the economy and then a recovery. 10% on the upside, which is the upside scenario is that the Fed delivers a soft landing, so unemployment stays in the high threes. So 10% in the high threes a baseline at 4.2% peak, and then a downside at 10%, at a 7.8% unemployment. Yep. Yes. We feel very good about the ability to have a floor on the NIM at that 330 level and a 200 down scenario should that play out, given all the work we've done on the investment portfolio with the bullet locked out cash flows along with being in a fairly sizable net discount position and the duration that we have combined with the fixed rate loan origination platforms with auto, Dividend and Provide, those should all provide yields. And then as we've talked in the past, we've layered in $15 billion of received fixed swaps that will also provide additional protection from 2025 through 2032. And that may be one other differentiator for us relative to peers is that we've been focused more on protecting that downside over a longer period of time and therefore, the duration of our swap book as well as our investment portfolio maybe a little better positioned should that downturn occur at the end of the decade. Sure. Thanks. When it comes to the fee income, we did say relatively stable over the course of the year and probably is helpful to look at it from two components. The first would be a category I'll call the factors in our control that do deliver nice growth, both from a strong customer acquisition perspective as well as overall fee generation from a combination of the branch network, our wealth business, the commercial business. That will drive both credit card income as well as wealth and asset management fees in the mid-single-digit area and top line fee equivalent growth in the treasury management area in the high-single-digit area given our strong product lineup. From there, transitioning to mortgage, that's actually going to be the largest growth item for us in 2023. And it really goes back to all the work that we put into growing the servicing business in 2020 and 2021 when levels were more depressed. It was a good buying opportunity. And so, given our strong mortgage servicing platform, we'll increase those fees from $125 million in 2022 to the $160 million area. So that's a growth of almost 30%, whereas top line mortgage should be relatively stable off very low levels. So, we feel good about those items. Capital markets, certainly the wildcard in our guide, given that we do expect mid to high-single-digits growth in the first-half of the year relative to the first-half of 2022. And then we assume a little bit of additional growth in the back half of the year under the assumption that the capital markets disruption should abate once the Fed reaches its terminal Fed fund level. And again, as I said in the prepared remarks, if that were to not happen, then we would expect a little bit better loan growth, a little bit better NII and lower expenses. So, in terms of PPNR on a relative basis, I feel confident in that should the capital markets improvement not occur. And then the other category when it comes to fees, it would be the headwinds facing us. So, they're really environmental given the increase in interest rates, and that's on the earnings credit. We're managing earnings credits to about a 20 beta, which is a little bit better than what we thought as we entered the cycle. But even with that, service charges ultimately will be down mid-single-digits for the year, which more than offset that strong top line fee equivalent growth. On the consumer overdraft and NSF side, we probably do a little bit better relative to peers, just given that we move sooner on some of those fee and structural changes. But overall, the first-half of the year will be a little bit softer as we lap those changes that occurred mid year 2022. And then as we said in the prepared remarks, the TRA will decline in 2023 as well our expectations on lower private equity income so that other fees will be down 20%, 25% or so. Yes. We feel very good about the business that Dividend is doing, especially on the solar side of the aisle. And for us, we're expecting roughly $4.5 billion of originations in 2023 with a weighting of 90% solar, 10% home improvement. Home improvement we're less enamored with. But again, it's a good product offering for other points in the cycle. So, it's being deemphasized, and solar continues to do incredibly well. And if anything, there's perhaps a little bit of upside to our NII guide on Dividend for 2023, just given the strength of the business as well as the pricing power. Yes. Actually, spreads have done well and are actually off to a very solid start in 2023. We finished the year in 2022 with 7.1 billion of production, if you take auto as well as the RV, marine and specialty business combined. So that fixed rate consumer secured loan category. Our expectation for 2023 for that asset class is to be down to about 6 billion or so. So, loan balances in that caption, we would expect to be down. However, yields, we expect to improve 100 basis points from the fourth quarter 2022 levels to fourth quarter 2023 levels. So, it is a nice accelerator to the earlier question around how are you able to deliver both NII growth and NIM expansion. That certainly is a helpful driver. Yes. Great question, Matt. Thanks for asking. I would say that as this environment unfolds, it really is, to your point, going to create differentiation in both performance execution and overall balance sheet positioning. We've, I think, for a number of quarters and years now been discussing how cautious our outlook is. And that has really informed what we're willing to do from a credit risk appetite perspective. So, the capital levels ultimately are a factor of the credit profile of what's on the sheet as well as the reserve levels that we have. So, the CET1 level at 925 and an ACL level of 198 creates a very sufficient loss absorption capacity. And given our SCB level is the at the minimum, I think external factors or forces would say that we're very well-positioned from a credit profile perspective as well as from a loss absorption capacity. So, we feel good about that. Yes. Great question. The PPNR levels for Dividend will be positive in the back half of -- or in 2023. The net income of Dividend post ACL will be positive or accretive in 2024. Certainly, if prepayments accelerate faster than what we have modeled, then that large amount of unamortized platform fees will come through the P&L, would it improve or accelerate the return profile. But for now, that's how we have it playing out. And we model roughly an eight-year life on the dividend asset and that we would expect to have loss rates in the 125 basis point area on a blended basis for the portfolio per year over those eight years."

We have a very strong new customer origination engine, both across consumer and commercial. We've got strong new consumer household growth, strong in QRs from a commercial perspective. We have a very high performing treasury management business that provides a lot of deposit support as well as growth. And as you mentioned, our Southeast branch expansion, obviously, is going to create a tailwind for us as well. And finally, we have proven and analytically driven customer offers that have done a really nice job through the cycle and driving the balances when we need them. So, we continue to maintain a lot of confidence in the environment that we're going to be able to deliver and gain our fair share of deposits as the environment changes. Obviously, we can't grow in all environments, but we are cautiously optimistic and well positioned. Yes. We're very comfortable with where we are from a wholesale funding perspective. We continue to have very significant contingent liquidity sources that help us manage through uncertainty in the environment. If we see decent deposit growth, we could see those wholesale funding balances come down over time. But we have a lot of flexibility across our funding base to help us manage through both liquidity needs as well as net interest income."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Doll: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third\u2019s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard will provide an overview of our third quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein; and Treasurer, Bryan Preston have also joined us for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of October 20, 2022 and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\nTim Spence: Thanks, Chris, and thank all you for joining us this morning. Before we turn to our financial results, I\u2019d like to take a moment to express our sympathies for all of those across the state of Florida who were impacted by Hurricane Ian. I would also like to thank our employees for answering the call to take care of our customers and communities in the state. In the day since the hurricane made landfall, our employees have made nearly 90,000 Customer wellness calls, reopened all our branches, and staffed Fifth Third financial empowerment bus to enable customers who lost power and Internet access to apply for FEMA disaster relief. For those of you listening today, your resilience in the face of this natural disaster is awe inspiring. Thank you for living our core values. Turning to the financials. Earlier today, we reported third quarter results that reflect our commitment to strong performance through the cycle. We generated record adjusted revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Credit quality remains strong reflected in charge offs at the low end of our previous guidance. We also generated 10 points of positive operating leverage compared to the year ago quarter and achieved one of our lowest adjusted efficiency ratios over the past decade at 53%. Most all of our core return measures remained in the top quartile among peers, including an ROA of approximately 1.3% and ROTCE, excluding AOCI of nearly 18%. We also produced strong organic growth during the quarter, sustaining a record pace and adding new quality relationships and commercial and growing new households by 3% across our footprint and consumer. Our two recent fintech acquisitions, Dividend and Provide, each chief record quarterly origination levels. Turning to the balance sheet, loan growth was solid across our franchise. Our commercial loan production remains well diversified and supported by the bank's strategic investments. Within our regions, loan production in our southeast and other expansion markets roughly equaled our Midwest markets. Among our verticals, new production was strongest in energy including renewables, with a 70% increase in origination volume compared to the year ago quarter. Small Business production was led by Provide, which doubled year-over-year. Average consumer loans were up 1% led by dividend finance and top five national residential solar lender, and a return to growth in home equity. Dividend recently announced several key national partnerships which will continue to accelerate growth in the future. Switching to deposits. Consistent with prior guidance, our third quarter end of period balances were stable, with average balances down nearly $5 billion, due primarily to the full quarter impact of our delivered exits in the second quarter. In consumer, we grew households 3% year-over-year led by our southeast markets, which grew 8%. We generated consumer transaction balance growth of 5% compared to last year and opened a 1 million momentum banking account in the quarter. In commercial, our deposit franchise is anchored by our peer leading treasury management business. We ranked number two through number nine nationally in most TM payment types as shown in EY's annual cash management survey. We have a strong deposit base and new relationship growth engines in both our consumer and commercial business lines. And we expect the positive production momentum that we built during the third quarter to produce growth in the fourth quarter. Turning to the income statement. The strength and diversification of our fee-based businesses throughout the bank has helped to partially offset the market headwinds all banks are experiencing. In commercial, our gross treasury management revenue increased 6% compared to the year ago quarter led by our Expert AR and Expert AP Solutions. Our capital markets revenue associated with helping clients had share exposure to rates, commodities and foreign exchange increased 30% compared to the year ago quarter. In consumer, we generated strong mortgage revenue growth this quarter in an otherwise challenging environment, thanks to the strength of our mortgage servicing operation. Fifth Third is a low-cost high-quality servicer, one of the only banks to be recognized as both a Fannie Mae Star servicer and a HUD grade A servicer. The actions we took to grow our MSR portfolio nearly 30% since the end of 2019 will continue to pay dividends going forward. Finally, in wealth management, excluding tax payments, we have generated positive AUM inflows in every one of the past 13 quarters, and we were recognized this quarter as the best private bank for high net worth clients by the Digital Banker in Global Private Banker Magazine. We continue to focus on maintaining our culture of prudent expense management across the company while investing in organic growth and tech modernization initiatives. In the third quarter, we made meaningful progress in our technology and platform modernization journey. We successfully migrated our core platforms to a new data center and have now virtualized over 90% of our servers, strengthening network resiliency, increasing speed and capacity and improving the experience for both our customers and employees. In the fourth quarter, we'll re-launch our mobile app and a new cloud based architecture and with several improvements to the user experience. Credit quality remains strong throughout the bank. Our charge-off ratio was 21 basis points for the quarter and our non-performing asset ratio declined compared to the prior quarter. We remain cautious with respect to the broader economy given persistent inflation, the Fed\u2019s aggressive monetary policies and global growth concerns. We've continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high-quality relationships and companies with more diversified resilient business models. We continue to proactively monitor our portfolios for signs of potential stress. And regardless of what comes, I'm confident in our ability to outperform peers through the full economic cycle. With respect to capital, we announced a 10% increase to the quarterly common dividend in September. We continue to accrete capital with strong PPNR growth and expect to achieve a 9.25% CET1 by year-end. We also expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of 2023 subject to economic conditions. We continue to make decisions with the long-term in mind, hold ourselves accountable to what we say we are going to do, and invest in product and service innovations that generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders. With that, I will now turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our third quarter financial results and our current outlook.\nJamie Leonard: Thank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. We are pleased with our third quarter results. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories and generated record adjusted revenue. NII was positively impacted by higher market rates. The income was resilient despite the market-related headwinds and expenses were well controlled while we continue to reinvest in our businesses. Consequently, we achieved a 53% adjusted efficiency ratio. Also excluding net securities losses related to two legacy venture capital investments, we generated core PPNR growth of 13% compared to last quarter and 27% compared to last year. Net interest income was approximately $1.5 billion, a record quarter and increased 12% sequentially and 26% year-over-year, primarily attributable to the benefit of higher market rates, growth and commercial loan balances, and the full quarter benefit of securities purchased in the second quarter. Our NIM expanded 30 basis points during the quarter, while interest bearing core deposit costs increased 32 basis points to 41 basis points in total, this quarter. This equates to a cycle to date deposit beta of 16% thus far on the first 225 basis points of rate hikes. Total reported non-interest income decreased just 1% sequentially. We generated improved mortgage banking and leasing business fee income, which was offset by software results in market sensitive businesses, including capital markets, and the impact of higher earnings credit rates in treasury management. Non-interest expense increased 5% compared to the prior quarter, driven by an increase in compensation and benefits expense, including the impact of the July minimum wage increase to $20 per hour, higher technology and communications expense reflecting our focus on technology modernization initiatives, and the full quarter impact of the dividend finance acquisition. Expenses in the quarter included a $7 million benefit related to the mark-to-market impact of non-qualified deferred compensation with a corresponding offset in securities losses. This compares to a $27 million benefit in the prior quarter. Excluding the NQDC impacts from both periods, total non-interest expense increased $35 million or 3%. Non-interest expense was flat compared to the year ago quarter despite the impacts of our fintech lending acquisitions of both Dividend and Provide. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 2% sequentially, including held for sale loans, total average loans increased 1% compared to the prior quarter. Average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, with muted pay-off and a stable revolver utilization rate of 37% period and commercial loans increased 1% sequentially and 14% compared to the year ago quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased 1% compared to the prior quarter driven by dividend finance, which as a reminder is recorded in other consumer loans as well as growth in residential mortgage. This growth was partially offset by a decline in indirect secured consumer loans. At quarter end, dividend loan balances were approximately $1.4 billion. Average core deposits decreased 3% compared to both the year ago quarter and the prior quarter impacted by the intentional runoff of excess and higher cross commercial deposits in the second quarter, and lower consumer interest checking balances in the third quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits decreased 10% while average consumer transaction deposits increased 5% reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. We grew our securities portfolio approximately $1 billion during the third quarter, compared to $6 billion in the prior quarter. We currently expect security portfolio balances to remain generally stable through the rest of the year. We have continued to focus on maintaining structure and the investment portfolio to provide stable and predictable cash flows. Our overall allocation to bullet and locked-out structures a quarter and remain at 67% in our duration declined to 5.5 in the current quarter compared to 5.8 in the prior quarter. Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends remain healthy. And our key credit metrics remain well below normalized levels. The NPA ratio of 46 basis points was down one basis point sequentially. Our commercial NPA ratio has now declined for eight consecutive quarters. The net charge-off rate ratio was flat sequentially at 21 basis points. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due remained relatively stable sequentially than the amount of loans 90 days past due was approximately two thirds of what it was a year ago. We continue to closely monitor central business district hotels, non-profit health care, including senior living and office CRE we are also monitoring exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress, including the impact of changing consumer discretionary spending patterns, as well as the on-going monitoring of the leverage loan portfolio. From a balance sheet management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high quality commercial relationships. And on homeowners which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We maintain the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in both commercial real estate and in non-prime borrowers among our peers. Through the Dividend and Provide acquisitions, we added granular fixed rate loan origination platforms. We have also focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong, stable NII through the cycle. Our strong deposit franchise, our securities and cash flow hedge portfolios, as well as the additions of Dividend and Provide lending capabilities should continue to position us to drive strong outcomes. In the cash flow hedge portfolio, we have added an incremental $5 billion since the end of the second quarter, bringing the total cash flow hedges added this year to $15 billion. The combined securities and cash flow hedge positions will support NII through the end of the decade. Moving to the ACL, our ACL build this quarter was $96 million, primarily reflecting loan growth, as well as a slightly worsening economic outlook relative to June. Dividend finance loan growth contributed $63 million to this ACL build. Relative to the second quarter, the Moody's GDP growth forecasts are slightly stronger, while the unemployment and home price forecasts have weakened in both the baseline and downside scenarios. Given our expected period and loan growth, including stronger production from dividend finance, we currently expect a fourth quarter bill to the ACL of approximately $100 million assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios. The impact of the expected dividend loan originations to the ACL should be in the $80 million to $90 million range due to our improved loan growth expectations. Our economic scenarios incorporate several key risks that could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strained supply chains including continued aggressive rate hikes, and quantitative tightening and labor supply constraints becoming more binding than originally anticipated. Our September 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment. Future baseline unemployment estimates may begin to be increasingly impacted by the Feds aggressive monetary policies. Moving to capital, our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.1% compared to 9% in the quarter. The increase in capital was primarily due to our strong earnings capacity, partially offset by RWA growth reflecting robust organic business opportunities. Moving to our current outlook, for the fourth quarter of 2022 we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% sequentially. We expect commercial loans to grow 1%, reflecting strong pipelines and middle market and corporate banking, and assuming commercial revolver utilization rates remain stable at 37%. We expect consumer balances to be stable down 1% reflecting our decision to lower auto loan production to enhance our returns on capital and lower residential mortgage balances partially offset by dividend loan originations of around $1 billion in the fourth quarter. From a funding perspective, we expect average core deposits to increase 1% to 2% sequentially, however we do expect some continued migration from DDA into interest bearing products. Wholesale funding balances should be stable given expected core deposit growth relative to our earning asset base. Shifting to the income statement. We expect fourth quarter adjusted revenue growth of 6% compared to the third quarter, excluding the third quarter security losses associated with legacy venture equity investments. We expect NII to be up approximately 5% sequentially, assuming a 75 basis point hike in November and another 50 basis points in December. We expect a cumulative deposit beta of around 30% by year-end. This should result in interest-bearing core deposit costs rising from 41 basis points in the third quarter to the mid-to-high 90 basis point area for the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 6% to 7% compared to the third quarter or stable, excluding the impacts of the TRA. We have a strong M&A advisory pipeline and expect to continue generating strong financial risk management revenue, which we expect will be offset by earnings credits and softer top line mortgage banking revenue, given the rate environment. We expect total adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 3% to 4% compared to the third quarter, reflecting continued investments in talent, technology and our Southeast branch expansion. Our guidance assumes we open 17 new branches, 16 of which will be in our high-growth Southeast markets. Our fourth quarter guide implies stable expenses for 2022 on a full year basis compared to 2021 and 8% adjusted revenue growth, excluding securities losses, resulting in PPNR growth in the high teens. This will result in a mid-50s efficiency ratio for the full year, a 4-point improvement from 2021 and a fourth quarter efficiency ratio in the 51% to 52% range. We expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis point range, which will result in full year net charge-offs of approximately 20 basis points. In summary, with our PPNR growth engine, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChris Doll: Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRobert Siefers: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions.\nJamie Leonard: Good morning, Scott.\nRobert Siefers: I was hoping you guys could sort of address the -- maybe, Jamie, that's for you, kind of walk through the puts and takes with Dividend Finance. I think since that closed the origination expectations have been great and continue to increase, but so do the reserve build expectations. So maybe just some thoughts on how much longer will those related reserve builds last. And how is the overall accretion from that transaction trending relative to what you would have thought at announcement?\nJamie Leonard: Yes. Thanks for the question, Scott. It's a good one and timely because the dividend expectations on loan growth have continued to go up and up, their performance continues to be very strong from a loan origination standpoint. When we bought them, they were fifth in market share. And our best estimate is that they're top 3 in market share now today, and it's certainly a booming business given the rising energy costs. So with that, we had originally modeled a 5-year earn-back on the acquisition that they'd be profitable in 2023 ex the ACL and in 2024 with the ACL and they're certainly tracking ahead of those expectations. Obviously, the challenge during this quarter and as we look ahead, given their strong loan growth is the ACL build, the ACL build and the credit performance is in line with how we modeled the portfolio with the annual loss rates peaking at a 125 charge-off rate, give or take. But given the long-dated nature of the asset, it results in a much higher ACL build than some of our other loan categories. And so we're going to be providing at a pretty healthy rate in dollars given their strong loan production, and that could be $80 million to $90 million next quarter and perhaps every quarter in 2023 given that we expect $1 billion or more per quarter from them. So I guess that's a long answer to say, it's a good problem to have in the long-term because it's a high-returning asset, both from an NII perspective but also a return on the capital. It's just the unfortunate cost of providing life of loan losses at origination.\nRobert Siefers: Okay. Thank you for that color. And then maybe the follow-up. You guys have really good common equity Tier 1 and are anticipating resuming share repurchase early next year, but the TCE ratio continues to -- from the AOCI. Maybe if you can sort of just discuss the extent to which TCE, if at all, weighs into your capital decisions. And I think one of the emergent questions at market is if investors are going to sort of rally behind share repurchase from a low starting point of TCE, so just curious to hear your thoughts there.\nJamie Leonard: Well, thanks for the question because as you know, I do have some opinions on this topic and bear with me a moment while I walk through it because we run the company looking at metrics that both include and exclude AOCI, and we've been showing you both sets of metrics for better or for worse consistently over the past decade, whether that's ROTCE or tangible book value per share and TCE. And when you look at the tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, we actually grew it in the quarter and for the year, even with the Dividend finance acquisition. So really, when it comes down to the lower TCE ratio and the tangible book value per share, including the AOCI, it really does come down to how the AOCI is moving. And so when Brian and I talk about this and have been thinking through it, we think we're really mixing two issues into that one question. The first question when you parse it out is really based on how do I feel about our investment portfolio's positioning and performance. And I would answer that as I feel very good about how we are positioned and especially how we're positioned relative to peers. It would have been great to time the market perfectly and hit the very best entry points of course. But our two years of patience definitely paid off for us. On a relative basis, we continue to have one of the highest-yielding portfolios and among the lowest unrealized losses as a percent of total securities in the industry. So the potential TCE and AOCI issue from this perspective ultimately comes down to whether you have a low-quality or poorly structured investment portfolio that will incur losses in the future, we do not. We will accrete 45 to 50 basis points or about $1 billion of TCE per year going forward and do not expect to incur any losses in the portfolio. And as we've always said, given the high composition of floating rate loans on our balance sheet, the investment portfolio should act as a shock absorber in a falling rate environment, and we believe the nice duration and structure that we have in the portfolio will do just that. So then the second question that gets mixed into this is then should we be putting securities in HTM instead of AFS? And as we said before, as a Category 4 bank, the election to put the security into AFS or HTM really doesn't impact regulatory capital other than a small deferred tax asset impact, more does it change the economics or the risk of an investment. For the largest banks, clearly, there's value to minimizing the risk of regulatory capital volatility by using the held-to-maturity bucket. For banks like us, we believe the benefits of maintaining some flexibility to manage the portfolio through a volatile environment really does create value for us through the cycle. And given that there's no change in the actual value of the security, simply based on the accounting classification of which the portfolio that we put the securities in, so it really does come down to do we think the company from a TCE or value perspective is worth less by simply fair valuing one line item in the balance sheet, or is it worth less because we placed the security and AFS? And the answer to that, we believe, is clearly no. So our goal is always optimize the balance sheet to deliver long-term real economic value and not make decisions that optimize accounting outcomes over economic value. So with that, I apologize for what may have just been the longest answer in the history of earnings calls. But as you might imagine, we feel strongly about the topic.\nTim Spence: And if I can put a point on it, no, it has not factored into the decisions that we make on a day in, day out basis in the way that we run the company or as it relates to capital return.\nRobert Siefers: Perfect. I appreciate that color. It's an interesting issue to say the least and is having kind of wide-ranging ramifications. I really appreciate that.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nTim Spence: Good morning.\nJohn Pancari: Wonder if you can give us a little more color on your thoughts on deposit growth. I know that you indicated that you do expect growth in the fourth quarter, maybe you can help size up that level of growth. And then how do you think about growth into 2023, particularly given that you've completed the delivery deposit balance exits that you had talked about. So how you thinking about 2023, maybe also in the perspective of the non-interest bearing mix as a percentage of the total, how you expect that shifting as well? Thanks.\nTim Spence: Yes, Bryan, why don't you address the first part of the question, and then I'll talk a little bit about why we think we can grow deposits in 2023. So go ahead.\nBryan Preston: Yes. I mean our goal is always to grow deposits and take share every year. We've obviously got a strong consumer household growth or investments in our southeast markets, our leading TM business. We have confidence that we can take share. We obviously have some full year headwinds on average balances due to the excess commercial balances. We intentionally let run off in 2Q. But we do expect to grow from these 3Q levels from into 4Q, probably up 1% to 2% kind of range. You obviously have normal seasonality that we should expect to benefit from a commercial perspective as we also continue to grow households and grow our commercial relationships.\nTim Spence: Yes. I think I just would add John, to put a point on it. We do feel good about our ability to grow deposits for the remainder of this year and as Bryan said, about our ability to grow deposits on an on-going basis. If you just step back and look at the engines that drive deposit growth here, the integration of the branch and the digital offering has been very powerful for Fifth Third, right? And over the course of the past few years, the investment we were making in the Southeast have really accelerated. And that is evident in the rate of growth that we see in those markets. Like I mentioned 8% household growth as an example there. The only bank that has built more branches in the last three years in the Southeast and Fifth Third is JPMorgan Chase, okay? So we have a very fresh branch network. We have another 20-plus branches that will be opened before the end of this year and are on pace to do another 35 next year, all of which are in really high-growth markets. I mentioned the millionth Momentum Banking household when it was opened in the third quarter of this year. I don't think I could overstate the way in which that sort of a product offering changes the nature of the relationship with the customer. Like if you just assume the checking account has a $5,000 average balance, a point of interest on $5,000 equates to about $4 a month. And I mean think about how many other places you spend more than $4 a month and get less value than we're providing now in Momentum as it relates to helping you to manage cash flow and achieve savings goals and move money efficiently and otherwise. And I think that is going to be a very powerful driver of growth. It just makes those core retail deposits stickier than they were in the past. And lastly, then we talked about the treasury management business and they've shared in some of our investor conference presentations, this ratio of turnover to average balances in commercial. So if you just look at ACH volumes over average balances and compare that across banks in our peer group, Fifth Third has by far and away the highest turnover, which is a really good thing because what that means is that the balances that are sitting here being used to support the cash flow velocity of the business as opposed to being treated like an investment alternative, right? And so if you take that as the foundation of the deposit business here, and take into account how hard it is to build those sorts of capabilities over a period of years, it's going to be a pretty powerful moat for the bank going forward. And I think we'll be able to grow from there.\nJamie Leonard: And then, John, on your DDA mix question, when we look back the last tightening cycle, our total DDA to total core deposits dropped 5 points from 35% to 30%. This cycle, we started at 38%, and we model a similar 5% decline, or I should say, we're forecasting a 5% decline. And then we actually model in the rate risk disclosures in the presentation, additional migration even beyond that. So we're assuming a similar mix shift as last tightening cycle. But as Tim mentioned, our product lineup is certainly different and better in the treasury management, market share certainly has improved since the last cycle. But either way, we feel good about how we're forecasting it and think it will be manageable.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay thanks Jamie. And then separately on credit. If you could just give us some color on the drivers of the higher loan delinquencies in the quarter, it looks like both 90 days and 30 to 89 went up. And then separately, maybe just thoughts on the trajectory of the loan loss reserve ratio, excluding what you're doing with Dividend Finance, do you expect additions here on the underlying reserves beyond that portfolio? Thanks.\nRichard Stein: Yes. It's Richard. I'll start with the delinquency comment, and I'll let Jamie talk about the ACL changes. Look, the starting from a small base, we have a couple of deals roll into delinquency you have a couple of rollout. There's really no trend. There's no pattern with respect to industry or borrower type. I think it's just a little bit of seasonality in terms of -- or a little bit of -- just a small change in terms of borrower impact as we get through the end of the quarter.\nJamie Leonard: On the ACL, the driver of the coverage ratio this quarter was certainly Dividend more than anything else, but the other impact being a little bit worsening in the Moody's scenario. So from here, if Dividend loans continue to grow and be an outsized portion of our originations and that coverage ratio just because of that loan mix shift will continue to increase. But otherwise, you wouldn't expect the ACL coverage ratio to go up or down unless the economic scenario changes or the credit profile improves or worsens more than what we currently have modeled.\nJohn Pancari: Okay, great. Thank you Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael Mayo: Hi, can we start off the call talking about virtualizing 90% of your workload? Or I missed some of what you had to say. But what does that mean for your efficiency ratio of 53.3%. Where do you think terminal efficiency ratio is? How much do you have in stranded costs? And on the other hand, the inflation rate costs that are your expenses. So I guess I'm looking for longer-term expense and efficiency guidance and the implications of some of these tech moves.\nJamie Leonard: Yes. I had you in mind as we were right in that paragraph, Mike, in terms of the data centers and virtualizing applications. I think the way to think about what we are getting to at this point as we have talked for many years now about the opportunities that we have to use the cloud, whether it was private or public, to take some of the load off of legacy mainframe infrastructure and to put it into an environment that allow it to be much more scalable and resilient over time. And we hit a couple of important milestones in the quarter in that regard, hence, the commentary about the data center move and having virtualized now 90%, a little over 90% of the servers inside the company. Look, long term, I think we feel very good about the ability to drive efficiency on the maintenance and network infrastructure side of the IT business. But we also intend to be able to continue to invest on an on-going basis, new front-end application development and in building new capabilities into the products and services. So I think what we said in the past is the technology spend has been growing at, call it, 10% on an on-going basis but you should expect that sort of growth to continue. But that it would be offset by our ability to eliminate manual processes and drive automation into the company. And if you look at banks in totality, people expense is about half of our total expense on an annual basis. So there's still a lot of opportunity in front of us in a 3- to 5-year time frame to substitute technology for work that has to be done manually today. That's where I think the efficiency opportunities are. And as it relates to the long term, a 53% efficiency ratio, I believe, is as we were looking at it this morning, the best of any of the commercial banks over $100 billion that are reporting. So I feel really good about where we're at at the moment and the intent is to be able to run the company and that's sort of 53% to 55% range on an on-going basis.\nMichael Mayo: Okay. So how many data centers do you have left? And is it your goal to eventually have no data centers as -- indicated?\nJamie Leonard: We'll have to. We'll always have to. There's a lot of [indiscernible] to run certain applications and then be able to store data in your own private environment, you need to have redundancy.\nMichael Mayo: Okay. And so with the moves that just happened, can you size those cost savings or those savings are simply going to help fund your new tech investments?\nTim Spence: There'll be the mechanism to fund the new tech investments.\nMichael Mayo: Okay. Alright, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi good morning.\nTim Spence: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: I just wanted to ask a couple of questions. One, I heard the commentary around deposits earlier and the outlook for deposit growth from effectively benefiting from the new branches, etcetera, that you've been putting in. Could you just give us a sense of that branch trajectory from here and what you're anticipating over the course of the next year or two? And then also give us a sense as to what your deposit pricing strategies are as well for the next several quarters?\nTim Spence: Yes, sure. I'll take the branch trajectory, Bryan, you can handle it. I think we have been running on a pace to open, call it, 20 to 30 new branches a year. We'd like to see that be in the more of the 30 to 40 range. So we'll hit mid-20s this year. The expectation is to end up somewhere between 30 and 35 next year and to have the 30 to 40 a year range be what we run in the Southeast markets until we achieve the market position that we want to be able to achieve in each of the MSAs that we are focused on down there. Now on a net basis, the branch network has not been growing that fast because we have taken advantage of opportunities as customers have done more of the transactional activity online to thin out or relocate branches in the legacy network which has provided a basis for funding several of the investments that we're making down in the Southeast. Bryan, do you want to talk about rate?\nBryan Preston: Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Tim. We continue to feel good about what we've been able to do on the deposit front. The pricing is obviously starting to get more competitive, especially in the commercial portfolios. But we feel good about the 30% cumulative beta that we have talked about for that first 300 basis points in hikes. Certainly, as rates move higher here, we're going to continue to see some increase in betas. And we've previously talked about maybe that next 100, 125 basis points of hikes, those betas will get over 50%. But we think we're going to be able to manage to the below 40% cumulative beta from here, certainly a little bit higher on commercial than on the consumer side. But we recognize as rates move higher, you are going to start to see more consumer beta flow through as well.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. I noticed you opt your CD offers and matched JP, which is, I know, a competitive positioning that you've got a lot of your footprint. So that's helpful color on the from here beta that you're looking for. Maybe you could just give us a sense on loan growth trajectory because one of the things, obviously, we're all thinking about is loan growth and dollars deposit growth? And any expectation that you would need to lean on wholesale funding a little bit more. I did notice in the quarter, your averages went up in wholesale funding, but that looks like it was action that you took at the end of 2Q. So maybe just give us a sense as to how you see that all trajecting. Thanks.\nTimSpence: Yes. So Betty, from my standpoint on loan growth, I think the guide in the fourth quarter is stable to 1% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. That feels like a pretty good benchmark, right? If you were to start on something for where we see loan growth go in. We have really strong production coming out of dividends, as we mentioned, and are very pleased with the performance there and also strong production on Provide. On C&I, more broadly, I think we have been deliberate about moderating production over the course of this past year, you can see that in the numbers. But the production itself is still really good. It's more granular than it had been in the past, which is an important strategic priority for us. What I think I don't see a catalyst for is a material move from here on utilization rates, right? And against the strength in the fintech platforms and good core middle market production in C&I, you're going to have the drag from the slowdown in the auto production and mortgages that I think we started on perhaps earlier than others and therefore, will make its way into the numbers faster than you may see it in other places. Against that, the goal is always to grow deposits. We like to be able to grow deposits faster than loans that we as tannin [ph] of the way that we try to grow the company that doesn't always happen in any one quarter. But we do expect fourth quarter, 1% to 2% deposit growth. And while we're still in the early stages of the planning process, we intend to grow deposits next year.\nBryan Preston: Yes. And Betsy, from an overall funding perspective, our wholesale funding portfolio as a percent of our asset base is obviously down a decent amount from where we were pre-COVID. It was kind of closer to 9% of total assets, pre-COVID from a long-term debt perspective that number is down to more like 6% right now. Our loan-to-deposit ratio, obviously, is still near those historic lows. And so over time, we do expect to have more structure in our liability base as well as a little bit more long-term debt. So even if we were to see some moments of loan growth faster than deposit growth, we have confidence in our ability to fund it and adding some of that structure to our balance sheet is a decent place to be as well.\nBetsy Graseck: Right. No, I noticed your liquidity sources. It's a very fulsome slide, so I really appreciate that. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Usdin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of questions on the fee side. Understanding your guidance flat to the 727, I just wanted to understand, Tim, in your intro you mentioned that mortgage servicing will continue to be a benefit. So is the mortgage business hang in from here going forward? And then the second question is just can you flesh out a little bit for us just the impact of earnings credit rates on service charges and what type of impact that could have going forward as well? Thank you.\nJamie Leonard: Ken, it's Jamie. I'll take that one. Since we've had long discussions over the years on the strength or lack thereof in our mortgage business and happy to report that the third quarter was a very nice mortgage performance for Fifth Third. I do think from a top line perspective, volumes will be down given the environment into the fourth quarter. But what you're seeing in the strength of the business is really that servicing revenue shine through. And as Tim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're one of the top servicers rated in the industry, and the improvement in that revenue stream is part of why we beat the outlook for the third quarter and will help support the mortgage fee business going forward. We were running the mortgage banking in the first half of the year, total mortgage banking fees. I think in the first six months of the year were $80 million, and we're going to grow that 60% over the back half of the year simply driven by the strength of that mortgage servicing business that we operate. So we feel good about that. That's a run rate servicing fees, net of MSR decay should be around $40 million to $45 million a quarter going forward, and that's going to be a 10% yielding asset for us. But again, the top line will be a little bit challenge so that net-net, assuming no MSR valuation changes, I would expect the mortgage banking fee line to be in that $60 million to $65 million range in the fourth quarter.\nKenneth Usdin: Okay. And sorry, on the service charges with regards to the ECR impact there? And does that continue to -- how does that trend going forward?\nJamie Leonard: Yes. When we look just at the fourth quarter, the top line fee equivalent, as Tim mentioned, we have very stronger pipeline and good business. And so top line will be growing 2% or so. But to your point, the earnings credit, just given the rising rate environment, will result in total service charges being down 2% to 3%, and we have earnings credits moving similar to the deposit betas. And so they'll continue to edge higher the Fed keeps moving on rates.\nKenneth Usdin: Okay. If I could just ask one more, just on your Slide 24, you added 5 billion more swaps since the end of the second quarter, and we can see how you've laddered that all out. Can you help us just understand, as you start to look past 4Q in terms of NII, can you continue to show positive NII growth given the positive beta comments you made earlier and just the trajectory of the protection that you've put on to the balance sheet. Thanks, Jamie.\nBryan Preston: Yes Ken, it's Bryan. Thanks for the question. Based on where we stand today, we feel good about our exit rate NIM in 4Q 2022 carrying over into 2023 with some upside as our balance sheet continues to benefit from the 2022 hikes. We've previously talked about that 4Q NIM in that kind of 335 to 340 range. Assuming a 450 terminal funds rate, we think our NIM will peak in mid-340s in the first half of 2023. We do expect to give some of that upside back as deposit repricing lags catch up. But given the balance sheet actions we've taken to date to monetize our asset sensitivity, we expect we can maintain a 330 plus NIM over the next couple of years even if rates were to fall 200 basis points. Obviously, 2023 and beyond results are subject to significant uncertainty given the economic outlook, and we'll give you additional color on 2023 expectations as part of our fourth quarter earnings in January.\nKenneth Usdin: Great. Thanks a lot, Bryan.\nTim Spence: Yes. If I'm just going to throw one editorial comment in here, Ken, because you hit on two of the topics that we're spending a lot of time talking about internally is I think, perhaps, because we operated for 15 years in a near zero interest rate environment, people forgot about what long-term drives performance in the banking business. And if there's anything at that current point in the cycle is reminding us is that deposits matter and the diversified fee income business lines matter and an interest rate risk and credit risk management matter. And by those measures, if you look at where we are right now. I mean, the company has been around for 164 years. And this is literally going to be its best year ever in terms of profitability and the strength of some of these fee lines like mortgage servicing, right? Like what we have been able to do on top line with treasury management and the quality of the deposit base, coupled with the prudence that I think our treasury, which has done really an outstanding job here and that we have in the credit organization is going to set Fifth Third up to be able to perform very well regardless of what 2023, 2024, 2025 look like.\nKenneth Usdin: Thanks for the color, Tim.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTim Spence: Hey Erika.\nErika Najarian: Hey good morning. Actually, my questions have been asked and answered. Thanks so much, guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nTim Spence: Hey, Matt.\nMatthew O'Connor: Good morning. Any impact to the Dividend Finance business from recent legislation. I guess, it's called the Inflation Reduction Act, but there's a lot of climate initiatives in there that I know help from broader areas, but any impact to that business in terms of volumes and reducing the credit versus what you thought it would have been before?\nTimSpence: Yes. It will be a tailwind for the business. When we underwrote the business and entered into the agreement to buy Dividend, the assumption we were using in our base case was that the federal tax credits would expire and the actions and the Inflation Reduction Act are only going to help support it.\nMatthew O'Connor: Okay. And then as you think about how big this portfolio can get or you're willing to let it that, obviously, there's a lot of room to run. But if you're originating over $4 billion a year, and it's pretty long duration, the balances could build pretty quickly. Any thoughts on kind of how big? I know I've asked you before, but how big it can get and you're willing to let it at go.\nBryan Preston: Yes. I mean, we -- obviously, there's a lot that can change over the next couple of years as outlooks and things adjust and rate expectations change. But as we look at it now and given the capacity that we have on the consumer side because we are going to continue to let our auto portfolio run down getting that portfolio north of $10 billion doesn't cause us any concerns. And we also know that there is a pretty robust market, whether it's securitizations or whole loan markets where we're going to have the ability to manage the portfolio risk associated with these assets, so we feel good about our options associated with it.\nMatthew O'Connor: Okay. And then actually, just following on my first question, I'm a [indiscernible] that was always a long week. But the benefit of this credit, does this increase the volume? Reduce the kind of long-term expected credit cost? Or what's -- or a little bit about.\nTim Spence: It increases the volume. The way to think about it is that from the homeowner's perspective, clearly, there's an incentive to impact your own personal carbon footprint. But these decisions ultimately get made on an economic basis. So the trade-off that the homeowner is making is the cost to install the panels and then to service the debt attached to that relative to the cost to pay an energy bill for energy that you buy from a utility company on a month-to-month basis. So anything that reduces the installation cost on the side of solar or that increases the cost of buying energy off of the grid is beneficial to the size of the overall market is the way to think about it, Matt. And Dividend being one of the largest players, anything that positively impacts the TAM for residential solar or positively impacts the outlook from an origination perspective. So that's why I expect the impact benefit primarily to be as it relates to the extension of federal tax credits.\nMatthew O'Connor: That makes sense. And obviously, higher energy prices could also increase demand.\nTim Spence: Yes.\nMatthew O'Connor: Would there be an opportunity to securitize or like figure out a way to increase the ability to originate even more without keeping it on balance sheet over time, maybe it's more 3, 5 years out?\nTim Spence: We -- I think Bryan mentioned that Dividend has been a top 5 originator. Jamie mentioned that we believe it's a top 3 originator today. The other players in the top are all funding through whole loan transfers or securitizations. So there is a very liquid market for the asset. We have the ability to run at an origination level that is above and beyond what we would hold in the portfolio, if we elected to do it. But that, as you said earlier, we have a long way to run between where we're at today and where we would stop and add very attractive yields from the standpoint of NIM enhancement and overall credit performance.\nMatthew O'Connor: Okay, thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi Tim, hi Jamie.\nJamie Leonard: Hey Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Tim you talked about Fifth Third is one of the most active branched openers in the Southeast, along with JPMorgan Chase. Can you give us some color on the cost of opening, I know each branch is just different, but a typical cost of opening a branch one type of deposit level you need to reach to make it breakeven? And how long does it take you to get to that deposit level, if you use deposits as the measure for breakeven?\nJamie Leonard: Yes, Gerard, it's Jamie. Thanks for the question. We've really reduced the square footage in the branches so that the cost between land and construction is much lower than it used to be and it can range from $3 million to $4 million of book value, maybe a few hub branches would go higher than that. But for the most part, that's where the investment cost is. And as you know, the people side, the staffing is about half of the cost of operating a branch. And so you start to make money when you get into the 25 million-plus deposit range and so that usually takes us 2.5 years or so, sometimes 3, sometimes 2, but our recent de novos are tracking well against the model and actually outperforming on a household growth basis. So that's part of the reason why we're continuing the strategy. And as we look ahead to next year, we did 22 new branches this year in total, and we should do 35 or so next year, primarily in the Southeast.\nGerard Cassidy: And Jamie, when you get to that breakeven point, how many -- how much long does it take to get to a return on investment or return on equity, however you measure it to have it at the level that you're very satisfied with?\nJamie Leonard: Yes, 5 years is really where leading up to the 5-year mark, you then become profitable, flip over probably at that 4.5% on a cumulative basis. And then the earnings power really starts to accumulate beyond that.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up. Yes, go ahead, Tim.\nTim Spence: I was going to say that these are investments with extremely high terminal values, right? If you look at the branches that we have across the network today, it is especially in the world where I think we have done a very good job of being able to integrate the digital investments that we make and the access to a human being in the local market, right? We've talked a lot about the ways in which we're using analytics and other direct connection points to make sure that that's a seamless experience for customers. It just has proven to be a very strong, long-term recipe to grow the franchise. And the longer the Fed stays up, the faster the breakeven on those branches materializes and they are more attractive that the returns look like, right?\nGerard Cassidy: Yes, very true. Thank you. As a follow-up on credit, obviously, your credit quality is very strong, similar to your peers. Maybe just remind us why are the customers, I mean you look at all the economic outlook, you mentioned, Jamie, about Moody's. It was a little worse than what you had in the prior quarter in terms of building up the reserves. How is it that credit just remains so strong in view of these crosscurrents, particularly in the housing market starting to weakening. And then and as part of this, can you just share with us also about the used car prices, obviously, they're finally starting to come down. You guys are in that market? And how does that impact maybe future charge-offs or delinquencies if prices continue to fall down?\nTim Spence: Yes. I'm going to let Richard provide more specificity. But Gerard, if you just step back and look at it because this is the conundrum that I think we find ourselves in as we look forward and think about how we run the business relative to the signal we've got today. On the consumer side of the equation, if you look at Fifth Third consumer checking deposit balances, they are essentially exactly where they were about between 60% to 80% depending on the cohort you're looking at above where they were at in February of 2020. And that ratio has stayed more or less perfectly constant since the third stimulus check pay. So there were temporary spike as tax refunds came in this past year, that money got spent down by and large over the summer, but it restabilized in that sort of 60% to 80% range you know one, two [ph], at least in our case, such a significant percentage of our consumer exposure is to homeowners, right? It's 85% of total exposure and 75% of our credit card and auto customers are homeowners that they had an opportunity to lock in historically low fixed rate mortgages and to manage housing costs in the past couple of years that will allow them as long as they're seeing 4% to 5% wage inflation, which is kind of where we've been running to manage 7%, 8% headline CPI pretty well, right? And the by product that is the liquidity buffer is there and they have leverage over their costs in a way that others didn't. I think equivalently, Richard and I have been out together in several markets, recently talking directly with customers. And what we hear, by and large, is that customers have been able -- demand has stayed very strong and that customers have been able to exercise pricing leverage and to push input costs through to their customers, right? I think the dynamic, in fact, with them, and in each case that they all remain more concerned by is, although supply chain pressures have eased a little bit, they're still concerned about the stability of global supply chains and are making investments to support that. And then labor is the other primary constraint right now. And there, again, I think where there is good activity going on, a lot of it is going on to fund CapEx to drive labor productivity so that labor requirements can go down at a given level of demand. Now first principles would tell you that with the Fed moving as rapidly as it is and with rates having headed the direction they have that at some point here, the rate cycle has to turn into a credit cycle. And that, I think, is the reason why we've been maybe more cautious in terms of some of our actions, then it feels like we hear other people being because we just think that's prudent at this point in time. But I mean, Richard, do you want to talk a little bit about some of the other specifics.\nRichard Stein: Yes. I think the 1 thing to add on commercial, Gerard, is remember, there's a loss emergence period, so it takes a little while for the stress to ultimately roll through loss. And I think what we see and Tim articulated a lot of it is our customers are adapting, and they've had to adapt, honestly, for about 3 years now. Let's -- if you go back to 2019, the tariffs were a challenge for a lot of supply chains and manufacturing. They had to adapt. They've learned that. In COVID, you've had inflation. And so we see resilient business owners do what they do, and that's adapt to the challenges and run their business as well. And I think that's part of the conversation, and that's what we get from our relationship and our relationship managers talking to customers really get good insight to what's happening on the ground. And I think, as Tim said, there's more strength there from a fundamental perspective than perhaps people would otherwise believe. Now to your question on auto, I think the answer is auto is going to be a really classic example of a normalization. And again, you've got a shorter -- generally shorter duration in terms of the asset and the loss emergence period, and you have 2 things that are happening at the same time. One, clearly, you can see it with Manheim, used car prices are down 12% and trending down normalizing. At the same time, we're going to be rolling into originations where we bought it -- where customers bought at higher car prices. So -- we don't really see anything abnormal except for an acceleration of this intersection between car values and the originated loan to value, getting back to something that looks more normal. Again, it's a super prime book for the most part. We're disciplined on the underwriting, the resilience when you look at things like delinquencies continue to be very, very good. In fact, they're- continue to be at seasonal lows. So I think it's just this intersection of prices coming down and origination prices coming up.\nGerard Cassidy: And then just one quick follow-up on that. During the financial crisis with housing and many times, houses fell below the mortgage value and people. If they were unemployed and couldn't afford it, walked away from the house. If auto loans really go upside down and loan-to-values start to get up to 120%, 130% because of the Manheim number keeps falling, have you guys seen any history of people literally just turning the keys over to the car because the loan is upside down? Or is that really not a factor in the auto market?\nRichard Stein: It's certainly not a factor today. In fact, Gerard, if anything, think about where auto prices have gone. You're seeing -- we're seeing customers, and we see this across the spectrum that we don't lend into. I don't want to have to go turn the car and buy a new one. It's too expensive. So they're doing a lot of things to keep their car and to stay current or work through with the lenders. We don't see a lot of that because we don't really have that situation given the the quality of our consumer. But right now, I think people -- if they have a job, they want to keep their car, they don't want to go buy new.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Today's final question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJamie Leonard: Hey, Bill.\nBill Carcache: Hi good morning. Thanks, hey good morning. Tim and Jamie, I really appreciate hearing your thought process on the earlier question about TCE. Would your response to that question change at all, if we had a credit cycle and the Fed wasn't able to lower rates due to inflation? So the securities portfolio wasn't able to add as much of a shock absorber as you described earlier? And then to bring that back to the broader question, is there a point where decreases in TCE would become a concern for you in that scenario in particular?\nJamie Leonard: Well, I guess, first off, we've been accreting capital just through the strong earnings power of the company. That's going to continue. As Tim mentioned, CET1 will grow in the fourth quarter. So obviously, that will help the TCE ratio. And then when we pick up the buybacks next year, we'll run the company at that 925 [ph] CET1 level. That's our expectation. If there's a credit cycle credit events, I think we will be very happy that we have the portfolio we do given the structure as well as the duration that we have. So I'm not worried about the performance of the investment portfolio. I would say that it's probably the best portfolio in the industry. So we feel good about that.\nBill Carcache: That's helpful. Thank you. And then separately, on the funding side, can you speak to your ability to bring off-balance sheet client funds back on balance sheet and the potential amount that is available in theory?\nJamie Leonard: Yes. Right now, there's about $4 billion in our client liquidity portal. And then there's also opportunity within the Wealth and Asset Management business. But again, that would just come down to the willingness to pay 100% beta type of pricing. And at this point in time, there's no need to do that. But if we wanted to match money market rates, we could certainly bring more deposits back onto the sheet.\nBill Carcache: Very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.\nJamie Leonard: Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Chris Doll for any closing remarks.\nChris Doll: Thanks, Dennis, and thanks everyone for your interest in Fifth Third. Please feel free to contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Dennis, you can now disconnect the call.\nOperator: Thank you Ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the Fifth Third Bancorp Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tim Spence",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank all you for joining us this morning. Before we turn to our financial results, I'd like to take a moment to express our sympathies for all of those across the state of Florida who were impacted by Hurricane Ian. I would also like to thank our employees for answering the call to take care of our customers and communities in the state. In the day since the hurricane made landfall, our employees have made nearly 90,000 Customer wellness calls, reopened all our branches, and staffed Fifth Third financial empowerment bus to enable customers who lost power and Internet access to apply for FEMA disaster relief. For those of you listening today, your resilience in the face of this natural disaster is awe inspiring. Thank you for living our core values. Turning to the financials. Earlier today, we reported third quarter results that reflect our commitment to strong performance through the cycle. We generated record adjusted revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Credit quality remains strong reflected in charge offs at the low end of our previous guidance. We also generated 10 points of positive operating leverage compared to the year ago quarter and achieved one of our lowest adjusted efficiency ratios over the past decade at 53%. Most all of our core return measures remained in the top quartile among peers, including an ROA of approximately 1.3% and ROTCE, excluding AOCI of nearly 18%. We also produced strong organic growth during the quarter, sustaining a record pace and adding new quality relationships and commercial and growing new households by 3% across our footprint and consumer. Our two recent fintech acquisitions, Dividend and Provide, each chief record quarterly origination levels. Turning to the balance sheet, loan growth was solid across our franchise. Our commercial loan production remains well diversified and supported by the bank's strategic investments. Within our regions, loan production in our southeast and other expansion markets roughly equaled our Midwest markets. Among our verticals, new production was strongest in energy including renewables, with a 70% increase in origination volume compared to the year ago quarter. Small Business production was led by Provide, which doubled year-over-year. Average consumer loans were up 1% led by dividend finance and top five national residential solar lender, and a return to growth in home equity. Dividend recently announced several key national partnerships which will continue to accelerate growth in the future. Switching to deposits. Consistent with prior guidance, our third quarter end of period balances were stable, with average balances down nearly $5 billion, due primarily to the full quarter impact of our delivered exits in the second quarter. In consumer, we grew households 3% year-over-year led by our southeast markets, which grew 8%. We generated consumer transaction balance growth of 5% compared to last year and opened a 1 million momentum banking account in the quarter. In commercial, our deposit franchise is anchored by our peer leading treasury management business. We ranked number two through number nine nationally in most TM payment types as shown in EY's annual cash management survey. We have a strong deposit base and new relationship growth engines in both our consumer and commercial business lines. And we expect the positive production momentum that we built during the third quarter to produce growth in the fourth quarter. Turning to the income statement. The strength and diversification of our fee-based businesses throughout the bank has helped to partially offset the market headwinds all banks are experiencing. In commercial, our gross treasury management revenue increased 6% compared to the year ago quarter led by our Expert AR and Expert AP Solutions. Our capital markets revenue associated with helping clients had share exposure to rates, commodities and foreign exchange increased 30% compared to the year ago quarter. In consumer, we generated strong mortgage revenue growth this quarter in an otherwise challenging environment, thanks to the strength of our mortgage servicing operation. Fifth Third is a low-cost high-quality servicer, one of the only banks to be recognized as both a Fannie Mae Star servicer and a HUD grade A servicer. The actions we took to grow our MSR portfolio nearly 30% since the end of 2019 will continue to pay dividends going forward. Finally, in wealth management, excluding tax payments, we have generated positive AUM inflows in every one of the past 13 quarters, and we were recognized this quarter as the best private bank for high net worth clients by the Digital Banker in Global Private Banker Magazine. We continue to focus on maintaining our culture of prudent expense management across the company while investing in organic growth and tech modernization initiatives. In the third quarter, we made meaningful progress in our technology and platform modernization journey. We successfully migrated our core platforms to a new data center and have now virtualized over 90% of our servers, strengthening network resiliency, increasing speed and capacity and improving the experience for both our customers and employees. In the fourth quarter, we'll re-launch our mobile app and a new cloud based architecture and with several improvements to the user experience. Credit quality remains strong throughout the bank. Our charge-off ratio was 21 basis points for the quarter and our non-performing asset ratio declined compared to the prior quarter. We remain cautious with respect to the broader economy given persistent inflation, the Fed's aggressive monetary policies and global growth concerns. We've continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high-quality relationships and companies with more diversified resilient business models. We continue to proactively monitor our portfolios for signs of potential stress. And regardless of what comes, I'm confident in our ability to outperform peers through the full economic cycle. With respect to capital, we announced a 10% increase to the quarterly common dividend in September. We continue to accrete capital with strong PPNR growth and expect to achieve a 9.25% CET1 by year-end. We also expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of 2023 subject to economic conditions. We continue to make decisions with the long-term in mind, hold ourselves accountable to what we say we are going to do, and invest in product and service innovations that generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders. With that, I will now turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our third quarter financial results and our current outlook. And if I can put a point on it, no, it has not factored into the decisions that we make on a day in, day out basis in the way that we run the company or as it relates to capital return. Good morning. Yes, Bryan, why don't you address the first part of the question, and then I'll talk a little bit about why we think we can grow deposits in 2023. So go ahead. Yes. I think I just would add John, to put a point on it. We do feel good about our ability to grow deposits for the remainder of this year and as Bryan said, about our ability to grow deposits on an on-going basis. If you just step back and look at the engines that drive deposit growth here, the integration of the branch and the digital offering has been very powerful for Fifth Third, right? And over the course of the past few years, the investment we were making in the Southeast have really accelerated. And that is evident in the rate of growth that we see in those markets. Like I mentioned 8% household growth as an example there. The only bank that has built more branches in the last three years in the Southeast and Fifth Third is JPMorgan Chase, okay? So we have a very fresh branch network. We have another 20-plus branches that will be opened before the end of this year and are on pace to do another 35 next year, all of which are in really high-growth markets. I mentioned the millionth Momentum Banking household when it was opened in the third quarter of this year. I don't think I could overstate the way in which that sort of a product offering changes the nature of the relationship with the customer. Like if you just assume the checking account has a $5,000 average balance, a point of interest on $5,000 equates to about $4 a month. And I mean think about how many other places you spend more than $4 a month and get less value than we're providing now in Momentum as it relates to helping you to manage cash flow and achieve savings goals and move money efficiently and otherwise. And I think that is going to be a very powerful driver of growth. It just makes those core retail deposits stickier than they were in the past. And lastly, then we talked about the treasury management business and they've shared in some of our investor conference presentations, this ratio of turnover to average balances in commercial. So if you just look at ACH volumes over average balances and compare that across banks in our peer group, Fifth Third has by far and away the highest turnover, which is a really good thing because what that means is that the balances that are sitting here being used to support the cash flow velocity of the business as opposed to being treated like an investment alternative, right? And so if you take that as the foundation of the deposit business here, and take into account how hard it is to build those sorts of capabilities over a period of years, it's going to be a pretty powerful moat for the bank going forward. And I think we'll be able to grow from there. There'll be the mechanism to fund the new tech investments. Good morning. Yes, sure. I'll take the branch trajectory, Bryan, you can handle it. I think we have been running on a pace to open, call it, 20 to 30 new branches a year. We'd like to see that be in the more of the 30 to 40 range. So we'll hit mid-20s this year. The expectation is to end up somewhere between 30 and 35 next year and to have the 30 to 40 a year range be what we run in the Southeast markets until we achieve the market position that we want to be able to achieve in each of the MSAs that we are focused on down there. Now on a net basis, the branch network has not been growing that fast because we have taken advantage of opportunities as customers have done more of the transactional activity online to thin out or relocate branches in the legacy network which has provided a basis for funding several of the investments that we're making down in the Southeast. Bryan, do you want to talk about rate? Yes. So Betty, from my standpoint on loan growth, I think the guide in the fourth quarter is stable to 1% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. That feels like a pretty good benchmark, right? If you were to start on something for where we see loan growth go in. We have really strong production coming out of dividends, as we mentioned, and are very pleased with the performance there and also strong production on Provide. On C&I, more broadly, I think we have been deliberate about moderating production over the course of this past year, you can see that in the numbers. But the production itself is still really good. It's more granular than it had been in the past, which is an important strategic priority for us. What I think I don't see a catalyst for is a material move from here on utilization rates, right? And against the strength in the fintech platforms and good core middle market production in C&I, you're going to have the drag from the slowdown in the auto production and mortgages that I think we started on perhaps earlier than others and therefore, will make its way into the numbers faster than you may see it in other places. Against that, the goal is always to grow deposits. We like to be able to grow deposits faster than loans that we as tannin [ph] of the way that we try to grow the company that doesn't always happen in any one quarter. But we do expect fourth quarter, 1% to 2% deposit growth. And while we're still in the early stages of the planning process, we intend to grow deposits next year. Yes. If I'm just going to throw one editorial comment in here, Ken, because you hit on two of the topics that we're spending a lot of time talking about internally is I think, perhaps, because we operated for 15 years in a near zero interest rate environment, people forgot about what long-term drives performance in the banking business. And if there's anything at that current point in the cycle is reminding us is that deposits matter and the diversified fee income business lines matter and an interest rate risk and credit risk management matter. And by those measures, if you look at where we are right now. I mean, the company has been around for 164 years. And this is literally going to be its best year ever in terms of profitability and the strength of some of these fee lines like mortgage servicing, right? Like what we have been able to do on top line with treasury management and the quality of the deposit base, coupled with the prudence that I think our treasury, which has done really an outstanding job here and that we have in the credit organization is going to set Fifth Third up to be able to perform very well regardless of what 2023, 2024, 2025 look like. Hey Erika. Hey, Matt. Yes. It will be a tailwind for the business. When we underwrote the business and entered into the agreement to buy Dividend, the assumption we were using in our base case was that the federal tax credits would expire and the actions and the Inflation Reduction Act are only going to help support it. It increases the volume. The way to think about it is that from the homeowner's perspective, clearly, there's an incentive to impact your own personal carbon footprint. But these decisions ultimately get made on an economic basis. So the trade-off that the homeowner is making is the cost to install the panels and then to service the debt attached to that relative to the cost to pay an energy bill for energy that you buy from a utility company on a month-to-month basis. So anything that reduces the installation cost on the side of solar or that increases the cost of buying energy off of the grid is beneficial to the size of the overall market is the way to think about it, Matt. And Dividend being one of the largest players, anything that positively impacts the TAM for residential solar or positively impacts the outlook from an origination perspective. So that's why I expect the impact benefit primarily to be as it relates to the extension of federal tax credits. Yes. We -- I think Bryan mentioned that Dividend has been a top 5 originator. Jamie mentioned that we believe it's a top 3 originator today. The other players in the top are all funding through whole loan transfers or securitizations. So there is a very liquid market for the asset. We have the ability to run at an origination level that is above and beyond what we would hold in the portfolio, if we elected to do it. But that, as you said earlier, we have a long way to run between where we're at today and where we would stop and add very attractive yields from the standpoint of NIM enhancement and overall credit performance. I was going to say that these are investments with extremely high terminal values, right? If you look at the branches that we have across the network today, it is especially in the world where I think we have done a very good job of being able to integrate the digital investments that we make and the access to a human being in the local market, right? We've talked a lot about the ways in which we're using analytics and other direct connection points to make sure that that's a seamless experience for customers. It just has proven to be a very strong, long-term recipe to grow the franchise. And the longer the Fed stays up, the faster the breakeven on those branches materializes and they are more attractive that the returns look like, right? Yes. I'm going to let Richard provide more specificity. But Gerard, if you just step back and look at it because this is the conundrum that I think we find ourselves in as we look forward and think about how we run the business relative to the signal we've got today. On the consumer side of the equation, if you look at Fifth Third consumer checking deposit balances, they are essentially exactly where they were about between 60% to 80% depending on the cohort you're looking at above where they were at in February of 2020. And that ratio has stayed more or less perfectly constant since the third stimulus check pay. So there were temporary spike as tax refunds came in this past year, that money got spent down by and large over the summer, but it restabilized in that sort of 60% to 80% range you know one, two [ph], at least in our case, such a significant percentage of our consumer exposure is to homeowners, right? It's 85% of total exposure and 75% of our credit card and auto customers are homeowners that they had an opportunity to lock in historically low fixed rate mortgages and to manage housing costs in the past couple of years that will allow them as long as they're seeing 4% to 5% wage inflation, which is kind of where we've been running to manage 7%, 8% headline CPI pretty well, right? And the by product that is the liquidity buffer is there and they have leverage over their costs in a way that others didn't. I think equivalently, Richard and I have been out together in several markets, recently talking directly with customers. And what we hear, by and large, is that customers have been able -- demand has stayed very strong and that customers have been able to exercise pricing leverage and to push input costs through to their customers, right? I think the dynamic, in fact, with them, and in each case that they all remain more concerned by is, although supply chain pressures have eased a little bit, they're still concerned about the stability of global supply chains and are making investments to support that. And then labor is the other primary constraint right now. And there, again, I think where there is good activity going on, a lot of it is going on to fund CapEx to drive labor productivity so that labor requirements can go down at a given level of demand. Now first principles would tell you that with the Fed moving as rapidly as it is and with rates having headed the direction they have that at some point here, the rate cycle has to turn into a credit cycle. And that, I think, is the reason why we've been maybe more cautious in terms of some of our actions, then it feels like we hear other people being because we just think that's prudent at this point in time. But I mean, Richard, do you want to talk a little bit about some of the other specifics."

            "name": "Jamie Leonard",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. We are pleased with our third quarter results. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories and generated record adjusted revenue. NII was positively impacted by higher market rates. The income was resilient despite the market-related headwinds and expenses were well controlled while we continue to reinvest in our businesses. Consequently, we achieved a 53% adjusted efficiency ratio. Also excluding net securities losses related to two legacy venture capital investments, we generated core PPNR growth of 13% compared to last quarter and 27% compared to last year. Net interest income was approximately $1.5 billion, a record quarter and increased 12% sequentially and 26% year-over-year, primarily attributable to the benefit of higher market rates, growth and commercial loan balances, and the full quarter benefit of securities purchased in the second quarter. Our NIM expanded 30 basis points during the quarter, while interest bearing core deposit costs increased 32 basis points to 41 basis points in total, this quarter. This equates to a cycle to date deposit beta of 16% thus far on the first 225 basis points of rate hikes. Total reported non-interest income decreased just 1% sequentially. We generated improved mortgage banking and leasing business fee income, which was offset by software results in market sensitive businesses, including capital markets, and the impact of higher earnings credit rates in treasury management. Non-interest expense increased 5% compared to the prior quarter, driven by an increase in compensation and benefits expense, including the impact of the July minimum wage increase to $20 per hour, higher technology and communications expense reflecting our focus on technology modernization initiatives, and the full quarter impact of the dividend finance acquisition. Expenses in the quarter included a $7 million benefit related to the mark-to-market impact of non-qualified deferred compensation with a corresponding offset in securities losses. This compares to a $27 million benefit in the prior quarter. Excluding the NQDC impacts from both periods, total non-interest expense increased $35 million or 3%. Non-interest expense was flat compared to the year ago quarter despite the impacts of our fintech lending acquisitions of both Dividend and Provide. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 2% sequentially, including held for sale loans, total average loans increased 1% compared to the prior quarter. Average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, with muted pay-off and a stable revolver utilization rate of 37% period and commercial loans increased 1% sequentially and 14% compared to the year ago quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased 1% compared to the prior quarter driven by dividend finance, which as a reminder is recorded in other consumer loans as well as growth in residential mortgage. This growth was partially offset by a decline in indirect secured consumer loans. At quarter end, dividend loan balances were approximately $1.4 billion. Average core deposits decreased 3% compared to both the year ago quarter and the prior quarter impacted by the intentional runoff of excess and higher cross commercial deposits in the second quarter, and lower consumer interest checking balances in the third quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits decreased 10% while average consumer transaction deposits increased 5% reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. We grew our securities portfolio approximately $1 billion during the third quarter, compared to $6 billion in the prior quarter. We currently expect security portfolio balances to remain generally stable through the rest of the year. We have continued to focus on maintaining structure and the investment portfolio to provide stable and predictable cash flows. Our overall allocation to bullet and locked-out structures a quarter and remain at 67% in our duration declined to 5.5 in the current quarter compared to 5.8 in the prior quarter. Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends remain healthy. And our key credit metrics remain well below normalized levels. The NPA ratio of 46 basis points was down one basis point sequentially. Our commercial NPA ratio has now declined for eight consecutive quarters. The net charge-off rate ratio was flat sequentially at 21 basis points. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due remained relatively stable sequentially than the amount of loans 90 days past due was approximately two thirds of what it was a year ago. We continue to closely monitor central business district hotels, non-profit health care, including senior living and office CRE we are also monitoring exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress, including the impact of changing consumer discretionary spending patterns, as well as the on-going monitoring of the leverage loan portfolio. From a balance sheet management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high quality commercial relationships. And on homeowners which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We maintain the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in both commercial real estate and in non-prime borrowers among our peers. Through the Dividend and Provide acquisitions, we added granular fixed rate loan origination platforms. We have also focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong, stable NII through the cycle. Our strong deposit franchise, our securities and cash flow hedge portfolios, as well as the additions of Dividend and Provide lending capabilities should continue to position us to drive strong outcomes. In the cash flow hedge portfolio, we have added an incremental $5 billion since the end of the second quarter, bringing the total cash flow hedges added this year to $15 billion. The combined securities and cash flow hedge positions will support NII through the end of the decade. Moving to the ACL, our ACL build this quarter was $96 million, primarily reflecting loan growth, as well as a slightly worsening economic outlook relative to June. Dividend finance loan growth contributed $63 million to this ACL build. Relative to the second quarter, the Moody's GDP growth forecasts are slightly stronger, while the unemployment and home price forecasts have weakened in both the baseline and downside scenarios. Given our expected period and loan growth, including stronger production from dividend finance, we currently expect a fourth quarter bill to the ACL of approximately $100 million assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios. The impact of the expected dividend loan originations to the ACL should be in the $80 million to $90 million range due to our improved loan growth expectations. Our economic scenarios incorporate several key risks that could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strained supply chains including continued aggressive rate hikes, and quantitative tightening and labor supply constraints becoming more binding than originally anticipated. Our September 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment. Future baseline unemployment estimates may begin to be increasingly impacted by the Feds aggressive monetary policies. Moving to capital, our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.1% compared to 9% in the quarter. The increase in capital was primarily due to our strong earnings capacity, partially offset by RWA growth reflecting robust organic business opportunities. Moving to our current outlook, for the fourth quarter of 2022 we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% sequentially. We expect commercial loans to grow 1%, reflecting strong pipelines and middle market and corporate banking, and assuming commercial revolver utilization rates remain stable at 37%. We expect consumer balances to be stable down 1% reflecting our decision to lower auto loan production to enhance our returns on capital and lower residential mortgage balances partially offset by dividend loan originations of around $1 billion in the fourth quarter. From a funding perspective, we expect average core deposits to increase 1% to 2% sequentially, however we do expect some continued migration from DDA into interest bearing products. Wholesale funding balances should be stable given expected core deposit growth relative to our earning asset base. Shifting to the income statement. We expect fourth quarter adjusted revenue growth of 6% compared to the third quarter, excluding the third quarter security losses associated with legacy venture equity investments. We expect NII to be up approximately 5% sequentially, assuming a 75 basis point hike in November and another 50 basis points in December. We expect a cumulative deposit beta of around 30% by year-end. This should result in interest-bearing core deposit costs rising from 41 basis points in the third quarter to the mid-to-high 90 basis point area for the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 6% to 7% compared to the third quarter or stable, excluding the impacts of the TRA. We have a strong M&A advisory pipeline and expect to continue generating strong financial risk management revenue, which we expect will be offset by earnings credits and softer top line mortgage banking revenue, given the rate environment. We expect total adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 3% to 4% compared to the third quarter, reflecting continued investments in talent, technology and our Southeast branch expansion. Our guidance assumes we open 17 new branches, 16 of which will be in our high-growth Southeast markets. Our fourth quarter guide implies stable expenses for 2022 on a full year basis compared to 2021 and 8% adjusted revenue growth, excluding securities losses, resulting in PPNR growth in the high teens. This will result in a mid-50s efficiency ratio for the full year, a 4-point improvement from 2021 and a fourth quarter efficiency ratio in the 51% to 52% range. We expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis point range, which will result in full year net charge-offs of approximately 20 basis points. In summary, with our PPNR growth engine, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Good morning, Scott. Yes. Thanks for the question, Scott. It's a good one and timely because the dividend expectations on loan growth have continued to go up and up, their performance continues to be very strong from a loan origination standpoint. When we bought them, they were fifth in market share. And our best estimate is that they're top 3 in market share now today, and it's certainly a booming business given the rising energy costs. So with that, we had originally modeled a 5-year earn-back on the acquisition that they'd be profitable in 2023 ex the ACL and in 2024 with the ACL and they're certainly tracking ahead of those expectations. Obviously, the challenge during this quarter and as we look ahead, given their strong loan growth is the ACL build, the ACL build and the credit performance is in line with how we modeled the portfolio with the annual loss rates peaking at a 125 charge-off rate, give or take. But given the long-dated nature of the asset, it results in a much higher ACL build than some of our other loan categories. And so we're going to be providing at a pretty healthy rate in dollars given their strong loan production, and that could be $80 million to $90 million next quarter and perhaps every quarter in 2023 given that we expect $1 billion or more per quarter from them. So I guess that's a long answer to say, it's a good problem to have in the long-term because it's a high-returning asset, both from an NII perspective but also a return on the capital. It's just the unfortunate cost of providing life of loan losses at origination. Well, thanks for the question because as you know, I do have some opinions on this topic and bear with me a moment while I walk through it because we run the company looking at metrics that both include and exclude AOCI, and we've been showing you both sets of metrics for better or for worse consistently over the past decade, whether that's ROTCE or tangible book value per share and TCE. And when you look at the tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, we actually grew it in the quarter and for the year, even with the Dividend finance acquisition. So really, when it comes down to the lower TCE ratio and the tangible book value per share, including the AOCI, it really does come down to how the AOCI is moving. And so when Brian and I talk about this and have been thinking through it, we think we're really mixing two issues into that one question. The first question when you parse it out is really based on how do I feel about our investment portfolio's positioning and performance. And I would answer that as I feel very good about how we are positioned and especially how we're positioned relative to peers. It would have been great to time the market perfectly and hit the very best entry points of course. But our two years of patience definitely paid off for us. On a relative basis, we continue to have one of the highest-yielding portfolios and among the lowest unrealized losses as a percent of total securities in the industry. So the potential TCE and AOCI issue from this perspective ultimately comes down to whether you have a low-quality or poorly structured investment portfolio that will incur losses in the future, we do not. We will accrete 45 to 50 basis points or about $1 billion of TCE per year going forward and do not expect to incur any losses in the portfolio. And as we've always said, given the high composition of floating rate loans on our balance sheet, the investment portfolio should act as a shock absorber in a falling rate environment, and we believe the nice duration and structure that we have in the portfolio will do just that. So then the second question that gets mixed into this is then should we be putting securities in HTM instead of AFS? And as we said before, as a Category 4 bank, the election to put the security into AFS or HTM really doesn't impact regulatory capital other than a small deferred tax asset impact, more does it change the economics or the risk of an investment. For the largest banks, clearly, there's value to minimizing the risk of regulatory capital volatility by using the held-to-maturity bucket. For banks like us, we believe the benefits of maintaining some flexibility to manage the portfolio through a volatile environment really does create value for us through the cycle. And given that there's no change in the actual value of the security, simply based on the accounting classification of which the portfolio that we put the securities in, so it really does come down to do we think the company from a TCE or value perspective is worth less by simply fair valuing one line item in the balance sheet, or is it worth less because we placed the security and AFS? And the answer to that, we believe, is clearly no. So our goal is always optimize the balance sheet to deliver long-term real economic value and not make decisions that optimize accounting outcomes over economic value. So with that, I apologize for what may have just been the longest answer in the history of earnings calls. But as you might imagine, we feel strongly about the topic. And then, John, on your DDA mix question, when we look back the last tightening cycle, our total DDA to total core deposits dropped 5 points from 35% to 30%. This cycle, we started at 38%, and we model a similar 5% decline, or I should say, we're forecasting a 5% decline. And then we actually model in the rate risk disclosures in the presentation, additional migration even beyond that. So we're assuming a similar mix shift as last tightening cycle. But as Tim mentioned, our product lineup is certainly different and better in the treasury management, market share certainly has improved since the last cycle. But either way, we feel good about how we're forecasting it and think it will be manageable. On the ACL, the driver of the coverage ratio this quarter was certainly Dividend more than anything else, but the other impact being a little bit worsening in the Moody's scenario. So from here, if Dividend loans continue to grow and be an outsized portion of our originations and that coverage ratio just because of that loan mix shift will continue to increase. But otherwise, you wouldn't expect the ACL coverage ratio to go up or down unless the economic scenario changes or the credit profile improves or worsens more than what we currently have modeled. Yes. I had you in mind as we were right in that paragraph, Mike, in terms of the data centers and virtualizing applications. I think the way to think about what we are getting to at this point as we have talked for many years now about the opportunities that we have to use the cloud, whether it was private or public, to take some of the load off of legacy mainframe infrastructure and to put it into an environment that allow it to be much more scalable and resilient over time. And we hit a couple of important milestones in the quarter in that regard, hence, the commentary about the data center move and having virtualized now 90%, a little over 90% of the servers inside the company. Look, long term, I think we feel very good about the ability to drive efficiency on the maintenance and network infrastructure side of the IT business. But we also intend to be able to continue to invest on an on-going basis, new front-end application development and in building new capabilities into the products and services. So I think what we said in the past is the technology spend has been growing at, call it, 10% on an on-going basis but you should expect that sort of growth to continue. But that it would be offset by our ability to eliminate manual processes and drive automation into the company. And if you look at banks in totality, people expense is about half of our total expense on an annual basis. So there's still a lot of opportunity in front of us in a 3- to 5-year time frame to substitute technology for work that has to be done manually today. That's where I think the efficiency opportunities are. And as it relates to the long term, a 53% efficiency ratio, I believe, is as we were looking at it this morning, the best of any of the commercial banks over $100 billion that are reporting. So I feel really good about where we're at at the moment and the intent is to be able to run the company and that's sort of 53% to 55% range on an on-going basis. We'll have to. We'll always have to. There's a lot of [indiscernible] to run certain applications and then be able to store data in your own private environment, you need to have redundancy. Ken, it's Jamie. I'll take that one. Since we've had long discussions over the years on the strength or lack thereof in our mortgage business and happy to report that the third quarter was a very nice mortgage performance for Fifth Third. I do think from a top line perspective, volumes will be down given the environment into the fourth quarter. But what you're seeing in the strength of the business is really that servicing revenue shine through. And as Tim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're one of the top servicers rated in the industry, and the improvement in that revenue stream is part of why we beat the outlook for the third quarter and will help support the mortgage fee business going forward. We were running the mortgage banking in the first half of the year, total mortgage banking fees. I think in the first six months of the year were $80 million, and we're going to grow that 60% over the back half of the year simply driven by the strength of that mortgage servicing business that we operate. So we feel good about that. That's a run rate servicing fees, net of MSR decay should be around $40 million to $45 million a quarter going forward, and that's going to be a 10% yielding asset for us. But again, the top line will be a little bit challenge so that net-net, assuming no MSR valuation changes, I would expect the mortgage banking fee line to be in that $60 million to $65 million range in the fourth quarter. Yes. When we look just at the fourth quarter, the top line fee equivalent, as Tim mentioned, we have very stronger pipeline and good business. And so top line will be growing 2% or so. But to your point, the earnings credit, just given the rising rate environment, will result in total service charges being down 2% to 3%, and we have earnings credits moving similar to the deposit betas. And so they'll continue to edge higher the Fed keeps moving on rates. Hey Gerard. Yes, Gerard, it's Jamie. Thanks for the question. We've really reduced the square footage in the branches so that the cost between land and construction is much lower than it used to be and it can range from $3 million to $4 million of book value, maybe a few hub branches would go higher than that. But for the most part, that's where the investment cost is. And as you know, the people side, the staffing is about half of the cost of operating a branch. And so you start to make money when you get into the 25 million-plus deposit range and so that usually takes us 2.5 years or so, sometimes 3, sometimes 2, but our recent de novos are tracking well against the model and actually outperforming on a household growth basis. So that's part of the reason why we're continuing the strategy. And as we look ahead to next year, we did 22 new branches this year in total, and we should do 35 or so next year, primarily in the Southeast. Yes, 5 years is really where leading up to the 5-year mark, you then become profitable, flip over probably at that 4.5% on a cumulative basis. And then the earnings power really starts to accumulate beyond that. Hey, Bill. Well, I guess, first off, we've been accreting capital just through the strong earnings power of the company. That's going to continue. As Tim mentioned, CET1 will grow in the fourth quarter. So obviously, that will help the TCE ratio. And then when we pick up the buybacks next year, we'll run the company at that 925 [ph] CET1 level. That's our expectation. If there's a credit cycle credit events, I think we will be very happy that we have the portfolio we do given the structure as well as the duration that we have. So I'm not worried about the performance of the investment portfolio. I would say that it's probably the best portfolio in the industry. So we feel good about that. Yes. Right now, there's about $4 billion in our client liquidity portal. And then there's also opportunity within the Wealth and Asset Management business. But again, that would just come down to the willingness to pay 100% beta type of pricing. And at this point in time, there's no need to do that. But if we wanted to match money market rates, we could certainly bring more deposits back onto the sheet. Thanks, Bill."

            "name": "Richard Stein",
            "content": "Yes. It's Richard. I'll start with the delinquency comment, and I'll let Jamie talk about the ACL changes. Look, the starting from a small base, we have a couple of deals roll into delinquency you have a couple of rollout. There's really no trend. There's no pattern with respect to industry or borrower type. I think it's just a little bit of seasonality in terms of -- or a little bit of -- just a small change in terms of borrower impact as we get through the end of the quarter. Yes. I think the 1 thing to add on commercial, Gerard, is remember, there's a loss emergence period, so it takes a little while for the stress to ultimately roll through loss. And I think what we see and Tim articulated a lot of it is our customers are adapting, and they've had to adapt, honestly, for about 3 years now. Let's -- if you go back to 2019, the tariffs were a challenge for a lot of supply chains and manufacturing. They had to adapt. They've learned that. In COVID, you've had inflation. And so we see resilient business owners do what they do, and that's adapt to the challenges and run their business as well. And I think that's part of the conversation, and that's what we get from our relationship and our relationship managers talking to customers really get good insight to what's happening on the ground. And I think, as Tim said, there's more strength there from a fundamental perspective than perhaps people would otherwise believe. Now to your question on auto, I think the answer is auto is going to be a really classic example of a normalization. And again, you've got a shorter -- generally shorter duration in terms of the asset and the loss emergence period, and you have 2 things that are happening at the same time. One, clearly, you can see it with Manheim, used car prices are down 12% and trending down normalizing. At the same time, we're going to be rolling into originations where we bought it -- where customers bought at higher car prices. So -- we don't really see anything abnormal except for an acceleration of this intersection between car values and the originated loan to value, getting back to something that looks more normal. Again, it's a super prime book for the most part. We're disciplined on the underwriting, the resilience when you look at things like delinquencies continue to be very, very good. In fact, they're- continue to be at seasonal lows. So I think it's just this intersection of prices coming down and origination prices coming up. It's certainly not a factor today. In fact, Gerard, if anything, think about where auto prices have gone. You're seeing -- we're seeing customers, and we see this across the spectrum that we don't lend into. I don't want to have to go turn the car and buy a new one. It's too expensive. So they're doing a lot of things to keep their car and to stay current or work through with the lenders. We don't see a lot of that because we don't really have that situation given the the quality of our consumer. But right now, I think people -- if they have a job, they want to keep their car, they don't want to go buy new."

            "name": "Bryan Preston",
            "content": "Yes. I mean our goal is always to grow deposits and take share every year. We've obviously got a strong consumer household growth or investments in our southeast markets, our leading TM business. We have confidence that we can take share. We obviously have some full year headwinds on average balances due to the excess commercial balances. We intentionally let run off in 2Q. But we do expect to grow from these 3Q levels from into 4Q, probably up 1% to 2% kind of range. You obviously have normal seasonality that we should expect to benefit from a commercial perspective as we also continue to grow households and grow our commercial relationships. Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Tim. We continue to feel good about what we've been able to do on the deposit front. The pricing is obviously starting to get more competitive, especially in the commercial portfolios. But we feel good about the 30% cumulative beta that we have talked about for that first 300 basis points in hikes. Certainly, as rates move higher here, we're going to continue to see some increase in betas. And we've previously talked about maybe that next 100, 125 basis points of hikes, those betas will get over 50%. But we think we're going to be able to manage to the below 40% cumulative beta from here, certainly a little bit higher on commercial than on the consumer side. But we recognize as rates move higher, you are going to start to see more consumer beta flow through as well. Yes. And Betsy, from an overall funding perspective, our wholesale funding portfolio as a percent of our asset base is obviously down a decent amount from where we were pre-COVID. It was kind of closer to 9% of total assets, pre-COVID from a long-term debt perspective that number is down to more like 6% right now. Our loan-to-deposit ratio, obviously, is still near those historic lows. And so over time, we do expect to have more structure in our liability base as well as a little bit more long-term debt. So even if we were to see some moments of loan growth faster than deposit growth, we have confidence in our ability to fund it and adding some of that structure to our balance sheet is a decent place to be as well. Yes Ken, it's Bryan. Thanks for the question. Based on where we stand today, we feel good about our exit rate NIM in 4Q 2022 carrying over into 2023 with some upside as our balance sheet continues to benefit from the 2022 hikes. We've previously talked about that 4Q NIM in that kind of 335 to 340 range. Assuming a 450 terminal funds rate, we think our NIM will peak in mid-340s in the first half of 2023. We do expect to give some of that upside back as deposit repricing lags catch up. But given the balance sheet actions we've taken to date to monetize our asset sensitivity, we expect we can maintain a 330 plus NIM over the next couple of years even if rates were to fall 200 basis points. Obviously, 2023 and beyond results are subject to significant uncertainty given the economic outlook, and we'll give you additional color on 2023 expectations as part of our fourth quarter earnings in January. Yes. I mean, we -- obviously, there's a lot that can change over the next couple of years as outlooks and things adjust and rate expectations change. But as we look at it now and given the capacity that we have on the consumer side because we are going to continue to let our auto portfolio run down getting that portfolio north of $10 billion doesn't cause us any concerns. And we also know that there is a pretty robust market, whether it's securitizations or whole loan markets where we're going to have the ability to manage the portfolio risk associated with these assets, so we feel good about our options associated with it."

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nChris Doll: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third second quarter 2022 earnings call.  This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard will provide an overview of our second quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein; and Treasurer, Bryan Preston have also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding to the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of July 21, 2022 and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie we will open the call up for questions. With that let me turn it over to Tim.\nTim Spence: Thanks, Chris, and thank all you for joining us.  With this being my first earnings call as CEO I'd like to say what an honor it is to follow a great leader like Greg Carmichael. Let's jump right in. Earlier today, we reported a solid second quarter reflecting our focus on profitability, organic growth, and through the cycle returns. We generated record adjusted revenue and maintained our expense discipline producing adjusted PPNR growth of 11% compared to last year. We extended our track record for strong organic growth, adding new quality relationships in commercial and new households in consumer, and both our recent acquisitions, dividend finance and provide [indiscernible] originations. Charge-offs remained low, NPAs and early stage delinquencies improved sequentially and we saw no decline in the liquidity buffers that our consumer households built during the pandemic. With that said, there is no question in my mind that the economic outlook is blurrier today than it was at the start of the year. Due to the potential forward economic challenges we are maintaining a prudently cautious view on credit as reflected in our reserve coverage. Turning to the balance sheet, loan growth was solid and diversified across our franchise. Average commercial loan growth was driven by C&I which included a 1% increase in utilization on revolving lines of credit. We generated robust loan growth in nearly all our corporate banking verticals in our Chicago, Cincinnati, North and South Carolina and Florida regions led the way in middle market lending. Average consumer loans grew in almost all categories. Our results include a small benefit from a mid-May closing of dividend finance. We're very excited about dividend as rising energy costs and the trend of homeowners improving their existing homes versus trading up only enhances our market opportunity. Switching to deposits, our second quarter results were in line with our prior commentary with average balances, intentionally down $6 billion sequentially and stable from the prior year. As we focused on margins over volume given our overall liquidity position. We have a very strong deposit base with a higher allocation to consumer deposits in the stable retail category than any institution that reports as part of the LCR rule. Consumer transaction deposits grew 1% sequentially and increased 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued growth in momentum banking and double digit deposit balance growth in our Southeast markets. Commercial transaction deposits were down sequentially, partially reflecting the anticipated movement of excess balances to higher yielding alternatives combined with some seasonal impacts. As of yesterday, total deposit balances have remained stable since mid may, despite the Fed rate hikes that occurred late in the second quarter. As a result of our loan growth and deposit pricing discipline, net interest income increased 12% sequentially or 15% excluding the impacts of PPP, Ginnie Mae and the securities prepayment penalty income. As we indicated in the investor conference last month, fees were softer for the quarter, reflecting the impact of market conditions on debt capital markets mortgage, and wealth and management. I am, however, quite pleased with the strength and diversification of our underlying fee growth engines. In payments, our gross treasury management revenue increased 7% and credit card spend grew 10%, both compared to a year ago quarter. In capital markets, financial risk management revenue increased 18% and M&A advisory revenue grew 30%, the majority of which was sourced from existing middle market relationships. In wealth management, despite the market volatility, personal asset management revenue was up 3% year-to-date and we generated our fourth consecutive quarter of positive net AUM inflows. We continue to manage expenses very diligently throughout the bank, reflecting our multi-year continuous improvement discipline, which has funded a significant portion of our organic growth and tech modernization strategies. Looking forward, our proactive actions over the past several years, with respect to our minimum wage and other employee retention strategies should provide us a buffer against inflation relative to peers. With respect to capital, we recently announced our 2.5% stress capital buffer requirements from the Fed stress test to exercise, the minimum under the regulatory capital rules. Our top priorities for capital deployment remains funding organic growth and paying a strong dividend. We recently announced our ability to increase the quarterly dividend by up to $0.03 in September, subject to board approval and economic conditions.  Given our robust loan growth and our desire to run the bank slightly above our capital targets in the current environment, we do not anticipate executing share repurchases for the remainder of the year at this time. While credit quality remains benign, we remain cautious of the impact that the FED\u2019s continued aggressive monetary policy and geopolitical dynamics could have on the economy. Over the past several years, we have built Fifth Third to be resilient and to produce strong results under any market environment. We have been consistent in our strategic priorities and have had the discipline to fund investments in geographic expansion, product innovation and technology through continuous improvement and pruning non-core businesses. We have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high quality commercial relationships and on homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in commercial real estate and in non-prime borrowers among our peers, and 93% of the mortgages on our balance sheet are fixed rate. We have protected NII through a series of actions, including our securities portfolio positioning, adding cash flow hedges to protect the down rate scenario for the next decade. And by maintaining a strong deposit franchise with a focus on primary relationships. Through the dividend and provide acquisitions, we added fixed rate loan origination platforms that will be especially powerful in a lower rate environment. Our allowance for credit losses provides greater loss absorbency than virtually any of our peers. Under my leadership, you should expect us to continue to make decisions with the long-term in mind, to hold ourselves accountable to what we say; we are going to do, and to invest in product and service innovations that generate sustainable long-term value for customers and shareholders alike. In closing, on behalf of the entire leadership team, I\u2019d like to say thank you to our employees who are listening today. As you know, banks inhabit a special place in the communities where they operate and with that comes a special responsibility to be a proponent for positive change. You work hard every day to live our purpose, including delivering 8 million meals to fight hunger across our footprint as part of Fifth Third Day, as well as positioning us to achieve our new $100 billion environmental and social finance commitment. I also want to thank you for the myriad of small things you do every day to improve our customer\u2019s lives. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our second quarter financial results and our current outlook.\nJamie Leonard: Thank you, Tim. And thank all of you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were solid. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories, deployed excess liquidity in the securities at attractive entry points and remain disciplined in managing our deposit costs. Expenses were once again, well controlled, even though we continue to reinvest in our businesses. Fees did underperform our April expectations due to the market volatility, but even with that softness, we generated core PPNR growth of 11% on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we achieved a sub 55% efficiency ratio and generated seven points of positive operating leverage from the second quarter of 2021. The ACL ratio increased five basis points sequentially to 1.85%, which includes a four basis point impact from the Dividend Finance acquisition, combined with $62 million in net charge-offs, we recorded a $179 million total provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.3 billion increased 12% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. As Tim mentioned, the underlying NII growth was around 15% compared to last quarter of which approximately half of the growth was attributable to higher market rates, and half from the combination of investment portfolio growth and loan growth, primarily in C&I. Our interest bearing core deposit costs were well controlled at just nine basis points of this quarter up just five basis points sequentially and help drive the 33 basis points of NIM expansion during the quarter. Total reported non-interest income decreased 1% sequentially and increased 3% on an adjusted basis. Compared to the prior quarter, we generated improved financial risk management card and processing, gross treasury management fees and private equity income, which was partially offset by weaker performance from our market sensitive businesses, including commercial capital markets and mortgage, and the impact of higher treasury management earnings credit rates. Non-interest expense decreased 9% compared to the prior quarter, driven by a decline in compensation and benefits expense from the seasonal peak in the first quarter, lower incentive-based comp in the current quarter due to market dynamics that impacted fees and overall continued expense discipline throughout the company. Expenses in the quarter included a $27 million benefit related to the mark-to-market impact of non-qualified deferred compensation, which has a corresponding offset in security losses. This compares to a $12 million benefit in the prior quarter. Excluding the non-qualified deferred compensation impacts from both periods, total noninterest expense, decreased $95 million or 8%. Noninterest expense decreased 4% compared to the year ago quarter. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increase 4% sequentially including health for sale loans, total average loans increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 4% compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting growth in C&I loans. Commercial loan production remained robust throughout the franchise outperforming our original expectations. Our production and pipelines are the result of our strategic investments and talent, as we continue to see strength and new quality relationship generation during the second quarter. With muted payoffs and a 1% increase in the revolver utilization rate to 37% period and commercial loans increased 3% sequentially, and 12% compared to the year ago quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased 3% compared to the prior quarter driven by residential mortgage and the dividend acquisition, which are recorded in other consumer loans. This growth was partially offset by a decline in home equity. At quarter end, total dividend loan balances were $650 million reflecting our decision to hold some loans the dividend would have otherwise sold combined with their post-close production volume. Average core deposits were stable compared to the year ago quarter, and decreased 4% compared to the prior quarter, including the impact of the intentional runoff of excess and higher cost commercial deposits. This runoff was in line with our expectations and reflects our pricing discipline from our strong overall liquidity position. Compared to the year ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits decreased 8% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 1% reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. Given the improved entry points during the first and second quarters we deployed cash into the securities portfolio, which resulted in second quarter average securities balance growth of approximately $12 billion. We completed net purchases of $6 billion in securities during the second quarter compared to $13 billion in the prior quarter. The higher than previously expected security purchases in the second quarter were the result of accelerating planned second half of 2022 purchases given the attractive entry points in late May and June. We currently expect security portfolio balances to remain generally stable through the rest of the year. We have continued to focus on adding duration and structure to the investment portfolio to provide stable and predictable cash flows. Consequently, our overall allocation to bullet and locked out structures increase from 64% to 67% at quarter end, and our duration increase from 5.4 to 5.7. Moving to credit; as Tim mentioned, credit remained healthy and in line with our previous expectations. The NPA ratio of 47 basis points improved 2 basis points sequentially with net charge offs of just 21 basis points. The ratio of early stage delinquencies, 30 to 89 days past due relative to loans was stable in the second quarter and the amount of loans 90 days past due is less than half of what it was a year ago. We continue to closely monitor the same areas we have previously discussed such as central business district hotels, senior living and office CRE. We are also monitoring exposures where inflation and higher rates may cost stress, including the impact of changing consumer discretionary spending patterns as well as the ongoing monitoring of the leverage loan portfolio. Our ACL build this quarter was $117 million of which approximately 75% was from strong loan growth, including the $53 million ACL impact from the dividend acquisition and the remaining 25% was attributable to worsening economic projections relative to March, net of reductions in certain pandemic related qualitative adjustments. Given the incremental clarity on the economy's ability to withstand geopolitical tensions and the pandemic fallout with vaccine efficacy and other measures, we elected to return to our standard approach for scenario weights of 80% to the baseline and 10% to the downside and upside scenarios. We believe our models are better suited to appropriately evaluate economic scenarios and outcomes from monetary tightening on our loan portfolio than on humanitarian crises such as pandemics and wars. Despite the scenario weight change we increased our reserves in specific portfolios such as CRE, where we continue to believe there elevated risks. Our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains relatively stable with unemployment ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.8%, which is slightly weaker than our previous estimate. Additionally, GDP growth and home price forecast have weakened relative to our March forecast in both our baseline and downside scenarios. Our expectations incorporate several key risks that could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strain supply chains including aggressive rate hikes and quantitative tightening and labor supply constraints becoming more binding than originally anticipated. Our June 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment. Moving to capital, our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9% compared to 9.3% in the prior quarter. The decline in capital was primarily due to strong RWA growth reflecting robust organic business opportunities and the impact of the dividend finance acquisition. We expect to accrete capital to the 9.25% area by year-end given our strong earnings capacity and we will evaluate resuming buybacks after that time. Moving to our current outlook, for the full year 2022 we continue to expect average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021 or around 10% excluding PPP and Ginnie Mae impacts, reflecting strong pipelines and stable commercial revolver utilization rates over the remainder of the year. Dividend finance is generating strong origination volumes. We expect loan originations of around $1.3 billion in the second half of 2022 which is 30% more than our original estimates. Similarly provide loan production remain strong as we expect over $1 billion in total production in 2022. Dividend and provide together are expected to contribute a little more than 1% of the total average loan growth for the year. We expect average commercial loan growth of 9% to 10% or 14% to 15% excluding PPP. We expect total average consumer loans to be stable in 2022, reflecting our decision to lower auto loan production to enhance our returns on capital. We expect around $7 billion in auto and specialty production for the full year, which will still result in double-digit growth and average indirect consumer secured balances in 2022. Our outlook also assumes growth of approximately 15% in other consumer loans reflecting the benefits of dividend finance. Shifting to the income statement we continue to expect full year adjusted revenue growth of 7% to 8%, which will be a record year of revenue for Fifth Third. Given our outlook for earning asset growth combined with the implied forward curve as of July 1st, which assumes a fed funds rate of 3.25% by year end. We expect full year NII to increase 17% to 18%. Our outlook incorporates the impacts from runoff of the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios. Excluding those portfolios, NII growth would be around 20%. Our current outlook assumes average deposit balances decline a $2 billion in the third quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the second quarter runoff of excess and higher cost commercial deposits and seasonality, and then return to growth in the fourth quarter. Since the onset of the rate hikes, our deposit betas have been muted at low single-digits for the cycle to date. We expect increases to our interest-bearing core deposit costs to accelerate over the next two quarters due to the timing impact of deposit reprising lags from earlier hikes and continued aggressive rate hikes from the fed. We continue to expect a 25% deposit beta on the first 225 basis points of rate hikes and a marginal beta of around 45% to 50% on the next 75 basis points of rate hikes. The ultimate impact NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate movements, balance sheet management strategies, including securities growth and hedging transactions and realized deposit betas. We expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be down 7% to 8% in 2022, reflecting softer second quarter performance combined with the high probability of continued market volatility, reflecting a more aggressive rate outlook, including lower wealth and asset management mortgage and capital markets revenue, as well as higher earnings credit rates offsetting strong gross treasury management fee growth. Despite the expected decline in capital markets revenue, we expect full year capital markets revenue to be up nearly 50% from the pre-pandemic 2019 levels, which highlights the success we\u2019ve had over the past few years in growing a diversified capital markets business. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense, including the impacts of dividend finance to be stable to down 1% compared to 2021. An improvement from our previous guide of up 1% to 2%. We continue to strategically invest in our franchise, which should result in low double-digit growth in both technology and marketing expenses. Our outlook also assumes we had 20 to 25 new branches, primarily in our high growth Southeast markets in 2022. Our guidance also incorporates the minimum wage increase to $20 per hour that went into effect on July 4th. We expect these investments in our people platforms and franchise to be offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in leasing expense, given our LaSalle Solutions sale and our continued overall expense discipline throughout the company. As a result our full year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth combined with our expense outlook should generate four points of improvement in the efficiency ratio and positive operating leverage of around 8%. Full year adjusted PPNR growth is expected to be 17% to 19%, which is an improvement to the range compared to our April estimate, reflecting the strong NII and expense outcomes, partially offset by the market related fee headwinds. Our outlook for significantly delivering on our positive operating leverage commitment reflects the benefits of our ability to grow our customer base combined with our strong balance sheet management and expense discipline. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect average total loan balances to increase 1% sequentially reflecting 1% to 2% growth in commercial and stable consumer balances. We expect our average securities portfolio to increase $2 billion to $3 billion reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made during the second quarter. Shifting to the income statement, we expect third quarter adjusted revenue growth of 8% to 9% compared to the second quarter. We expect NII to be up 11% to 12% sequentially, reflecting strong loan growth, the impact of securities purchases and the benefits of our balance sheet positioning. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the second quarter. We expect total adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to the second quarter or up 2% compared to the year ago quarter due to the acquisitions of provide and dividend finance. Excluding the second quarter NQDC benefits on expenses, we expect noninterest expenses to increase around 2% sequentially. We continue to expect third quarter and full year 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis point range. In summary with our balance sheet positioning, PPNR growth engine and disciplined credit risk management, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong performance in this type of environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChris Doll: Thanks Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue, if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck [Morgan Stanley]. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nTim Spence: Good morning, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck: Two questions, one on the buyback. I just wanted to understand the thought process around when the reinstatement would be, is that a function of a certain CET1, that you\u2019re looking to achieve? And should we take it to mean that you'll restart it in 1Q? Thanks.\nJamie Leonard: Yes. Betsy its Jamie. Given the environment that we're operating in, we, as you can tell from our results are clearly positioning to be a little more cautious in this environment. So we think accreting capital for the remainder of the year would be appropriate. And then we will evaluate resuming the buybacks in the first quarter of 2023. And certainly that would be outlook dependent, but that's the current plan as we sit here today.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then on the deposit side, I know you mentioned that deposits have been stable since the middle of May, and it's interesting that you didn't see that deposit outflow continue in June. I'm just wondering, is there a certain kind of depositor that you think will be \u2013 that the outflow came from a type of depositor that will not be incented when the Fed raises rates next week. And corollary here is if you have deposits stable, but loan growth continues to be robust as you are indicating, how are you thinking about funding that? What type of borrowings are you looking to access? Thanks.\nJamie Leonard: Yes. Great question. And I'll start and turn over to Brian for some additional color. Actually I think it was at your conference in early June that we talked about our plans on managing the balance sheet from a deposit standpoint and frankly for the past year, year and a half, we said we'd like to see about $10 billion of the deposits run off. Fortunately, this quarter we were able to really manage the balance sheet almost exactly as we had intended again at your conference, I think, we said we'd done the quarter at a loan to deposit ratio of 74% and we finished at 74.7%. So I do feel good about how we position the balance sheet and our ability to right size it. And maybe with that I will turn it over to Bryan to give a little more color of what we've seen on the outflows.\nBryan Preston: Yes, absolutely. We made the deliberate decision to not match market rates on certain high beta, lower relationship debt to customers. As we've said all along, we estimated about $10 billion in excess balances in our commercial deposit book that we believed may not be sticky. We do not have a lot of appetite for a 100 beta balances that want to be priced at Fed Funds or Fed Funds plus. We were in a position to let about $5 billion of these balances find a new home. We've not lost customer relationships. We know what it would take from a pricing perspective to get these balances back. A decent amount of these funds ended up in our liquidity portal, which gives our customers access to money market investments. We also saw some heightened seasonality this year Betsy, as it relates to tax payments that were a little bit larger. We estimate the tax payment impact with another $4 billion to $5 billion of the runoff. Our commercial balances, as we've said, were stable since mid-May, our consumer balances continued to be very stable and sticky. And overall, we're pleased with our cost of total interest bearing core deposits of 9 bips was up only 5 bips from the first quarter. In terms of how we're thinking about funding balance sheet growth from here, we are always going to be focused on being core deposit funded. We have a lot of levers that we can continue to pull to grow deposits from here. And we're confident in our ability to do that. That being said, we will use short term borrowings as a mechanism to help us manage volatility in the balance sheet month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. And that includes funding opportunistic investment portfolio purchases that we've done. Additionally over time, we've obviously run down our long-term debt portfolio. We'll be looking to re-enter the bank note market. We do think it's important for us to get some structure back into our liability framework. And so that's something that we'll use as well. But we continue to be confident with our ability to be core deposit funded. We are still sitting here at a 75% loan-to-deposit ratio. And so we feel very good right now about our overall positioning.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott [indiscernible]. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on deposits. So it sounds like exclusive of the runoff, or pardon me, the continued impact of the decisions you made in the second quarter. We'd see sort of stable deposits or growth otherwise. Jamie, what are you thinking in terms of what will grow, are those consumer or commercial deposits as we look in the year?\nJamie Leonard: Yes. Talking on the consumer side first, obviously we have a great retail franchise with tremendous products with momentum and the de novo plan and the Southeast build out. So retail deposits, we would expect to continue to grow in the back half of the year. On the commercial side, as I said in my prepared remarks, we'll probably see a little bit more runoff, couple billion in the third quarter before we experience a return to growth in the fourth quarter. And again, that'll be driven by our Treasury Management business where, I think, we've presented different conferences talking about how our TM business is best-in-class in the regional bank space, in terms of TMPs as a percent of revenue or TMPs to loan commitments to help show that share of wallet. And I think Brian's comments are very important to realize that these weren't lost relationships. This was just excess money going to a better home and we expected it. And from here, it'll just be business as usual.\nTim Spence: I think if I can add one thing there that maybe has been less fully appreciated. I think that Jamie's point, we've talked a lot about Momentum Banking, we've talked about Treasury Management, but among our investor peers, we also have the highest percentage of our branch network that has been open less than five years. And the majority of that time has not been in an environment where we were focused on deposit gathering out of those locations so much as we were household growth and otherwise. And the byproduct of that is we think there is a lot of latent new deposit generation power that will come out of the call it 70 de novos that have been opened in the Southeast and the 20 in addition that are going to come between the second half of this year and the first quarter of next year that will provide an additional kick in terms of core deposit generation above and beyond what we're getting out of Momentum Banking and the Treasury Management business.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then if I could ask a separate one just maybe Jamie your thoughts on sort of drivers of the continued weakness in fees into the third quarter, I think, some of them are probably, I think, logically what they would be, but would just be curious to hear your thoughts on sort of puts and takes.\nJamie Leonard: Yes, I think in this environment, the accelerated rate hikes and magnitude of the rate hikes just continue to weigh on the rate dependent fee businesses. So the outlook for mortgage capital markets and TM earnings credits are the biggest drivers of the change in our fee outlook. As Tim mentioned in the prepared remarks, the fee equivalent growth has actually been very strong. It's just as we get that additional NII benefit from the rate hikes, we give a portion of it back and the rates paid on earnings credit. So, from here I would expect the strong consumer household growth to help carry the day on combination of card and deposit service charges. But as a reminder, we are implementing or did implement July 1, the elimination of the NSF fee. So that'll weigh a little bit on the back half of the year fee guide. And then on wealth and asset management fees we've done a great job of new customer acquisition, as well as our AUM net inflows, but obviously the market headwinds have an impact on the fee revenue there, so that again it\u2019s in the updated guide. And then commercial banking is really a fascinating tale of two cities where our ability to help customers manage different exposures that they want to hedge, whether it's raise commodities or FX, along with our institutional brokerage business is just growing 30 plus percent. But the disruption in the capital markets having a big impact on the corporate bond fees and loan syndication fees and we don't really in our outlook expect significant improvement in the capital markets activity in the back half of the year. And I guess when you add up our fee outlook in total, we made about $1,000,000,004 in the first half of the year, we're saying we'll make, you know, $1,000,000,005 plus or minus a little bit in the back half of the year and the TRA of that a $100 million a growth TRA is half of it. So at least for now, that's how we see the back half of the year playing out.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay, perfect. Thank you guys very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy [RBC Capital Markets]. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Hi Tim. Hi, Jamie.\nJamie Leonard: Hello.\nGerard Cassidy: [Indiscernible] for the organization. Can you\u2026\nTim Spence: Gerard, I apologize, you cut out right at the beginning there. Could you start the question over? Yes.\nGerard Cassidy: Sure. Can you hear me now, Tim?\nTim Spence: We can, yes.\nGerard Cassidy: Okay. Thank you. Jamie, you pointed out some very strong loan growth numbers for the commercial and industrial portfolio. Can you guys share with us where you\u2019re seeing this growth both geographically and by industry, and then as \u2013 and in addition to that, I assume you\u2019re probably going to expect to see utilization rates go up as well as that growth comes in.\nJamie Leonard: Yes, I\u2019ll take the second part of the question first. When it comes to the line utilization, and I\u2019m glad you asked the question. What we saw in the second quarter was that in total line utilization moved up a point, and we\u2019re guiding for the rest of the year for that to actually be stable. So, we\u2019ll see how things play out. And in the second quarter, the movement in the line utilization, the biggest group that moved was actually the middle market group was up several points and so that was nice to see. From a production standpoint, it was pretty widespread, and again a very strong quarter of middle market production. I think Tim mentioned, several geographies in his prepared remarks, but, Cincinnati, Carolinas, Florida, it\u2019s a consistent story for us where, a little bit of softness in East Michigan, Northern Ohio is more than offset by strong performance in the rest of the Midwest in the Southeast. And then from a vertical perspective, the renewables team continues and energy continues to go very robust as well as our TMT business. So, we feel good about frankly the ability to acquire new customers in this environment, the sales teams with the RM expansion play out west as well as in the Southeast has worked very well. We\u2019re just mindful of what appears to us to be a slowing economy. And therefore, we\u2019re trimming a little bit on the edges, but frankly, the core is performing very well and you see that in the results this quarter.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow up question, and pivoting to credit quality for a moment, obviously you guys have very strong credit quality, and you built up the reserves as you pointed out in this quarter. And I understand that with the numbers being so small with you and your peers, one or two loans can move the numbers. So with that as a backdrop, can you give us some color on two questions on the commercial portfolio? First is the transfer to the nonaccrual status. That was an increase of about a $100 million this quarter versus $47 million in the prior quarter. Just any color there. And second, I believe you had a higher charge-off number in that category as well at $45 million versus $1 million in the prior quarter. And again, I emphasize the numbers, one loan can move those numbers since they\u2019re so low, but I\u2019m just curious.\nRichard Stein: Yes. Hey Gerard, it\u2019s Richard. Thanks for the question. You\u2019ve described it in your question what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re at levels that are so low, there\u2019s a little bit of balancing along the bottom purposing, if you will. The change in both NPA and in charge-offs was a handful, was a handful of loans. And just finally rolled to a place where we needed to take a more direct action in terms of making them non-accrual in charging them off. I think overall the portfolio continues to form as you point out very well. Well, inside our appetite and we\u2019re very pleased about where we sit today both today, and then also with the outlook in front of us.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of John Pancari [Evercore ISI]. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning guys.\nTim Spence: Good morning, John.\nJohn Pancari: Well, as a follow-up to the Gerard\u2019s question on the on credit. The increasing you just talked about in the non-accruals and charge-offs in the commercial side you said it was a handful of loans, any commonality in terms of industries or businesses that would help give us a little bit of color there? And then separately, are you seeing any signs of emerging stress anywhere within your portfolio worth noting? I know you\u2019re keeping an eye on commercial real estate and your leverage portfolio as well. Thanks.\nTim Spence: Yes, no commonality by industry in those names. I think certainly the economic headwinds of inflation labor supply chain were elements to the \u2013 those were the common elements, but different industries, different segments, but they ultimately put pressure on cash flow. And that caused us to, as I said, take different action. Broadly in terms of pressure, I mean, it\u2019s the same thing we\u2019ve talked about. We\u2019ve talked about office that continues to be challenged, senior living again, that\u2019s another place where you see a disconnect between cost inflation and what they can get from a reimbursement rate perspective. And then what we\u2019re watching are places where changes in consumer behavior are shifting whether it\u2019s from durables and discretionary to consumables and non-discretionary, but it \u2013 no large segments. There\u2019s a little bit of idiosyncratic movement across the portfolio, but nothing major that causes us any concern.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. All right. Great. And then, and my follow up is somewhat related on credit to a degree. The, your rationale to pull back in auto, I know you\u2019ve been talking about that. Can you just give us a kind of a reminder of the reason to pull back what you\u2019re seeing? Is it more just about the competition in the space, or are you seeing something on the credit front that is driving that decision? Because we did see, we are having some other banks talk about that pullback as well. And then separately don\u2019t know if you have your criticized asset trend or change that you can give us color on for the quarter. Thanks.\nJamie Leonard: Yes, sure John. Thanks for the question. In terms of auto, when we started the year forecast was about $11 billion in total production for a combination of auto plus the specialty business RV & Marine. We\u2019re now expecting to do about $7 billion in total in that asset class. And so the $4 billion of reduction is solely driven by the returns dynamic in that sector where several large players have certainly, if it\u2019s not irrational, it\u2019s certainly very aggressive pricing. And therefore we don\u2019t want to compete on an indirect asset class at such low spreads. So spreads a drop to levels that were reminiscent of when we did the pull back, five or six years ago. So the good news for us is, we keep the dealer relationships. We\u2019re continuing to monitor performance. We have spreads back up towards our target level and feel good about the production from a credit quality perspective, as well as a spread. But it\u2019s just not an asset class you want to grow, its single digit returns on capital. In terms of the credits, they were fairly stable in the quarter, not a lot to report there.\nJohn Pancari: Great. All right, Jamie, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin [Jefferies]. Your line is open.\nKen Usdin: Hey guys. Good morning. Just following up on the deposit side. So, hearing your earlier comments about the purposeful outflows, just wondering if you can give a sense of like, are we at the right bottoming spot where on the non-operational side, and given the good start to deposit betas where your interest bearing costs were only up five basis points. Can you just give us updated thoughts on how you\u2019re expecting betas to trend from here relative to prior business? Thanks.\nJamie Leonard: Yes, I think from an end of period perspective, we\u2019ve accomplished what we wanted to accomplish on the non-operational excess deposits. So again, there\u2019ll be an average effect in the third quarter, but overall, we said, a year and a half ago, we\u2019d like to get $10 billion of the excess out. I think we\u2019ve done that. And frankly year-over-year deposits are flat. So it\u2019s not shouldn\u2019t be a big surprise to people that we were able to right size it. And again, the loan, the deposit ratio at 74.7 would love to get it into the mid-80s over a period of several years but that would certainly be driven more by continued loan growth as opposed to any more deposit runoff. In terms of the betas, it is difficult I think to track betas by quarter when the fed is moving in such big chunks, but how we see it playing out is that we'd have a fourth quarter beta of 23% the month of December be 28% and then by the time we get to midyear next year that the trail effect because in our forecast we have the fed going to three in a quarter and then stopping for a little bit longer than normal period of time. And therefore there'll be a little bit of that drift effect as the lag catches up so that the ultimate beta ends up being 30% on those 300 basis points of rate hike. So from a rates paid perspective, it looks something in the area of the 9 basis points this quarter goes to mid-40s in the third, mid-70s in the fourth and then drifts to the mid-90s by the second quarter of 2023. That's how we think this'll play out and then continue to see deposit growth beginning in the fourth quarter and thereafter.\nKen Usdin: All right, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo [Wells Fargo Securities]. Your line is open.\nTim Spence: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Mayo: Hi. I really like your Slide 4. Your NIM is up 33 basis points link quarter and 19 is due to rates, I get that; 16 is due to security, it looks like your timing was good in late May and June, but only 1 basis point due to loan growth. So I guess I think about the remixing of the portfolio into higher yielding securities. Yes, but even higher yielding loans, which doesn't show up. So I guess on the one hand your deposits are down 7% period end. So what was the margin on those deposits like you, I guess you've been saying that's really low margin stuff. You're not staying around for 100% deposit beta deposits. So I get that that's \u2013 that's probably helping you running that off. On the other hand, why don't you have more pickup from loan growth? Are you just originating low yielding loans or what?\nJamie Leonard: No, I wouldn't say we're originating loan \u2013 yielding loans. The mix of a lot of our loan growth and our C&I book just given the floating rate nature of that portfolio and where it's been pricing in has been relatively neutral in terms of a NIM impact. But it does drive a decent amount of NII. Some of the consumer assets that we've been talking about especially the dividend assets in particular; it's just a late quarter impact. So you'll start to see some pickup from those in the future as those balances have a bigger average balance impact. But overall we do expect to see some pickup. The \u2013 we will continue to see C&I benefits just because of the asset sensitivity of our commercial floating rate portfolio. And we'll see some nice kind of drive from here and our NIM will continue to increase throughout the year. We would expect to end the year in a kind of a 3.30 to 3.35-ish range from a NIM perspective in the fourth quarter. So a lot of earnings powers still to come.\nMike Mayo: And then in terms of your expense control, Tim, this is your, I guess as you said your first earnings call as CEO, so you probably going to get the guidance, right. And you guys are guiding third quarter for 8% higher revenues and only 2% higher core expenses. Actually if you look at first quarter to third quarter your run rate NII should be going up by one-fourth based on your guidance, even while your expenses and your guide is to be lower. So I guess how confident are you in that and what is your incremental profit margin and why would it be so much better than your existing profit margin?\nTim Spence: Yes. Mike thanks for the question. I mean, to answer narrowly vary in terms of our level of confidence on our ability to manage expenses. I think the driver here when you think about our business, right, it\u2019s a people costs are a huge share of our overall expense base. And we've been, I think very public about the efforts that we have made over the course of the past few years to drive not only a culture of continuous expense discipline, but also a real focus on leveraging the technology investments we have been making to drive automation and reduce the unit costs associated with core processing activities. So our FTE count on a \u2013 is down about 600 right now, which is a big driver of the savings in terms of expense management and that's helping us. So it's less a dynamic around the margin on the incremental business so much as it is us continuing to make progress on the fixed cost base and the variable costs associated with our existing business activity.\nJamie Leonard: And Mike, I would say, yes. Your math on the NII is very good and we are highly confident in that. I would say if there are two things, the third is extremely good at, one is balance sheet management and you see that in the NIM expansion, and as Bryan mentioned the continued expansion over the course of the year. And then we're also very efficient from an expense standpoint and what you have happening is that as there is fee weakness back to your profit margin question, as there is fee weakness, fees have a higher cost of delivery than obviously NII. NII for the most part's dropping straight to the bottom line. And so that's certainly an element of helping the efficiency ratio, but in addition to that all of the expense savings initiatives we have going on in the company, as Tim mentioned, year-over-year were down 600 people. If you exclude the acquisitions and dispositions and just sequentially we're down 260 people exclusive of the acquisitions and the dispositions, and that's rightsizing our mortgage business closing one of our fulfillment sites, right sizing the interact auto and specialty business, given the slow down and volumes and then all of the LPA enhancements with reducing IT and ops and the branch closure benefits from the first quarter. So we have a lot going on underneath to help provide those tailwinds on expenses, but then we're very mindful of continuing to invest. And so in the third quarter, in the guide you have an increase in technology and marketing and then a little bit of noise from the NQDC assuming it comes out at zero in the third quarter, which is the driver Y expenses, will be up 4% to 5% sequentially. But overall feel very good about our ability to deliver an efficient balance sheet and an efficient income statement.\nMike Mayo: Alright. Thank you.\nTim Spence: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian [Bank of America]. Your line is open\nErika Najarian: Two follow up questions for me please. Jamie, how should we think about how you're thinking of the securities portfolio from here? Do you feel like that's something that you'll continue to build especially after deposit growth comes back or you think it could be a source of funding as deposit pricing accelerates?\nJamie Leonard: Yes. I would expect the investment portfolio to be stable from here. I would not expect to be selling down the portfolio to fund loan growth. It obviously in a crisis could be a great source of liquidity but that would probably be through more collateral usage at FHLB or backing \u2013 backstopping public funds deposits. But overall I'd expect it to be stable in the yield, our guide for the back half of the year on yield is in the 280 both for the third quarter as well as on a full year basis. So that yield guide is up a bit as Mike pointed out with some fortuitous timing on the, the additional leverage we\u2019ve added.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And maybe this is for Richard. I\u2019ll give you the CECL question near the end of the hour. What \u2013 could you remind us when you built your ACL to 241 in 2020? What was the unemployment rate that you were assuming? And the reason I ask this is at 185 ACL, if we think about the scenario, different scenarios of charge-off outcome in a mild recession for Fifth Third, taking into account the, that\u2019s been going on. It feels like in a mild downturn, your ACL is in the right place. And any guidance on this would be great because obviously everybody\u2019s now anticipating some sort of downturns sooner rather than later.\nJamie Leonard: Hey, Erika, it\u2019s Jamie. I\u2019ll take that one. And I\u2019ll answer your question a little bit differently than how you asked it, because the only piece of data I have on the history is the unemployment level versus day one. So our current scenario for the baseline has unemployment, at 3:4, 3:5, 3:7 versus the day one reserve in years, one, two and three were 3:6, 4:3, and 4:4. So versus day one unemployment is a little better, but the big driver of our variance to day one reserves is that, the GDP outlook and collateral values, both for housing and auto are worse. And then obviously the rate environment is significantly worse, which in the modeling puts pressure on corporate profits. So, we\u2019re sitting a little bit elevated over the day one levels, but to your point, we think that is a prudent place to be. And frankly, versus last quarter, the scenarios are certainly worse. And so, GDP erosion, housing pricing is worse, interest rates higher. So from our standpoint, when you have a period of strong loan growth, like we did in the second quarter you have eroding economic forecasts, you should have a CECL build. And then on top of that, we have the dividend acquisition effect, which that $50 million or so of the ACL build on related to the dividend finance production is something that will continue as we commented on strong production expectations for dividend until that portfolio reaches a state of maturity. And so, those ACL builds ultimately we\u2019ll see, what the loss content is to your question on, should there be a mild recession, the Moody\u2019s baseline scenario that we utilize while worse is not, a broad based persistent decline in economic activity that would result in a recession. But again, it\u2019s certainly worse than last quarter and certainly worse than the day one bill.\nRichard Stein: Yes. And I think, with that being said, if we sound more cautious, right. I think we probably are just based on what I read in here. We\u2019ve tried to be really consistent, especially as it relates to the alignment of, what we talk about worrying about and how that\u2019s reflected in the actions and how we run the company. And to try to be realistic about what\u2019s in front of us. Like Jamie said that, you look at what\u2019s going on in the current environment, Erika, and things are, there\u2019s a lot of things to feel optimistic about. And in our particular portfolio, not only do we, as credit obviously has been great and NCOs are low and NPAs, and delinquencies actually came down; the ratios there came down quarter-over-quarter. We are very mindful of the broader backdrop in attempting to gauge how to position the company for the next, 18 to 24 to 36 months. And at least from my point of view, if the goal is to have a company that\u2019s great through the cycle, you always have to be asking yourself what happens if you\u2019re wrong, right. And if we\u2019re wrong in this case, and we\u2019re being too cautious, maybe we miss a point or two alone growth that we otherwise could have gotten, right. But that\u2019s against a backdrop where we\u2019ve done very well on that measure, maybe we buy back stock a quarter or two later than we would have otherwise and then the ACL dressed down naturally as the scenario outlook changes, right. But if we\u2019re right to be cautious on the other hand, the actions we\u2019ve taken as it relates to the securities portfolio, the swaps, the total loss absorption that Fifth Third has relative to peers. And the fact that we did not take the benefit that we\u2019re getting from NII and spend it in the form of different sorts of investments and otherwise are going to pay off very handsomely, in terms of performance. So one way or the other like, even against this backdrop, I think our return metrics look really good on a relative basis. PPNR is going to be up, high teens on a year-over-year basis. I think we feel really good about how the bank is positioned.\nErika Najarian: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor [Deutsche Bank]. Your line is open.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Obviously bought a lot of securities and added some swaps of quarter. And here you on keeping securities relatively flat rest of the year, but just kind of as you step back, would you consider yourself fully invested as you think about, I guess securities plus, mortgage plus swaps or holding deposit flat obviously.\nTim Spence: Yes. I would say the investment portfolio is well positioned and at the level, that we would like to manage it long-term. Now with that said, if we see great opportunities, could we pull forward one quarter or two quarters of cash flow, which is currently running about a billion a quarter, I\u2019m not going to tie my hands and say, I wouldn\u2019t take advantage of great opportunities, but as I said here today and what rates have done, we feel really good about, just stability from here.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. All right. Yes, it seems like you had pretty good timing with the spike and rates in the quarter. So thank you.\nTim Spence: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Christopher Marinac [Janney Montgomery]. Your line is open.\nChristopher Marinac: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the need to protect for lower interest rates. Jamie is that something that you spend much time thinking about and is that something that\u2019s in place?\nJamie Leonard: Yes, that\u2019s the story of my life right now, because in our outlook, we expect that the fed hikes to the 325 level. And then, I saw a research piece the other day that talked about, on average or the median of the fed cuts begin four months after the last hike. Now, we expect the fed to in order to tamp down in inflation, is really focused on slowing the economy. So, they probably hold for a longer period of time than that median and hold it that, whatever the peak level is. And so frankly, that could tip things over into a recession, maybe not, but at a minimum there will be rate cuts down the road and rate cuts are ultimately the most detrimental activity to a bank\u2019s balance sheet if left unprotected, and therefore everything we\u2019ve done over the past couple of years has been building for that time, that the fed does move and we have a rate decline. And so we\u2019ve added duration to the portfolio. Again, this quarter, it\u2019s up to 5:7 [ph]. We increase the bullet, locked-out, cash flows to 67%. We grew the portfolio to $55 billion. We added $10 billion in swaps. And then as Tim pointed out in his comments, we\u2019ve added some fixed rate loan platforms to our business model, and that should also be helpful should rates decline. So yes, we spend a lot of time on that, and I think we have a very, very good team to be able to help manage through that environment. And certainly deposit generation activities are very helpful, especially from the retail footprint as those are the low cost stable funding that banks like to enjoy.\nChristopher Marinac: Well, that\u2019s great caller. Thank you very much for walking us through that and thanks for all the information this morning.\nTim Spence: Thank you.\nChris Doll: Thanks everyone. Please feel free to reach to the Investor Relations department. If you have any follow up questions and thank you for your interest in Fifth Third. Operator, you can now disconnect the call.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tim Spence",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and thank all you for joining us.  With this being my first earnings call as CEO I'd like to say what an honor it is to follow a great leader like Greg Carmichael. Let's jump right in. Earlier today, we reported a solid second quarter reflecting our focus on profitability, organic growth, and through the cycle returns. We generated record adjusted revenue and maintained our expense discipline producing adjusted PPNR growth of 11% compared to last year. We extended our track record for strong organic growth, adding new quality relationships in commercial and new households in consumer, and both our recent acquisitions, dividend finance and provide [indiscernible] originations. Charge-offs remained low, NPAs and early stage delinquencies improved sequentially and we saw no decline in the liquidity buffers that our consumer households built during the pandemic. With that said, there is no question in my mind that the economic outlook is blurrier today than it was at the start of the year. Due to the potential forward economic challenges we are maintaining a prudently cautious view on credit as reflected in our reserve coverage. Turning to the balance sheet, loan growth was solid and diversified across our franchise. Average commercial loan growth was driven by C&I which included a 1% increase in utilization on revolving lines of credit. We generated robust loan growth in nearly all our corporate banking verticals in our Chicago, Cincinnati, North and South Carolina and Florida regions led the way in middle market lending. Average consumer loans grew in almost all categories. Our results include a small benefit from a mid-May closing of dividend finance. We're very excited about dividend as rising energy costs and the trend of homeowners improving their existing homes versus trading up only enhances our market opportunity. Switching to deposits, our second quarter results were in line with our prior commentary with average balances, intentionally down $6 billion sequentially and stable from the prior year. As we focused on margins over volume given our overall liquidity position. We have a very strong deposit base with a higher allocation to consumer deposits in the stable retail category than any institution that reports as part of the LCR rule. Consumer transaction deposits grew 1% sequentially and increased 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued growth in momentum banking and double digit deposit balance growth in our Southeast markets. Commercial transaction deposits were down sequentially, partially reflecting the anticipated movement of excess balances to higher yielding alternatives combined with some seasonal impacts. As of yesterday, total deposit balances have remained stable since mid may, despite the Fed rate hikes that occurred late in the second quarter. As a result of our loan growth and deposit pricing discipline, net interest income increased 12% sequentially or 15% excluding the impacts of PPP, Ginnie Mae and the securities prepayment penalty income. As we indicated in the investor conference last month, fees were softer for the quarter, reflecting the impact of market conditions on debt capital markets mortgage, and wealth and management. I am, however, quite pleased with the strength and diversification of our underlying fee growth engines. In payments, our gross treasury management revenue increased 7% and credit card spend grew 10%, both compared to a year ago quarter. In capital markets, financial risk management revenue increased 18% and M&A advisory revenue grew 30%, the majority of which was sourced from existing middle market relationships. In wealth management, despite the market volatility, personal asset management revenue was up 3% year-to-date and we generated our fourth consecutive quarter of positive net AUM inflows. We continue to manage expenses very diligently throughout the bank, reflecting our multi-year continuous improvement discipline, which has funded a significant portion of our organic growth and tech modernization strategies. Looking forward, our proactive actions over the past several years, with respect to our minimum wage and other employee retention strategies should provide us a buffer against inflation relative to peers. With respect to capital, we recently announced our 2.5% stress capital buffer requirements from the Fed stress test to exercise, the minimum under the regulatory capital rules. Our top priorities for capital deployment remains funding organic growth and paying a strong dividend. We recently announced our ability to increase the quarterly dividend by up to $0.03 in September, subject to board approval and economic conditions.  Given our robust loan growth and our desire to run the bank slightly above our capital targets in the current environment, we do not anticipate executing share repurchases for the remainder of the year at this time. While credit quality remains benign, we remain cautious of the impact that the FED's continued aggressive monetary policy and geopolitical dynamics could have on the economy. Over the past several years, we have built Fifth Third to be resilient and to produce strong results under any market environment. We have been consistent in our strategic priorities and have had the discipline to fund investments in geographic expansion, product innovation and technology through continuous improvement and pruning non-core businesses. We have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high quality commercial relationships and on homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in commercial real estate and in non-prime borrowers among our peers, and 93% of the mortgages on our balance sheet are fixed rate. We have protected NII through a series of actions, including our securities portfolio positioning, adding cash flow hedges to protect the down rate scenario for the next decade. And by maintaining a strong deposit franchise with a focus on primary relationships. Through the dividend and provide acquisitions, we added fixed rate loan origination platforms that will be especially powerful in a lower rate environment. Our allowance for credit losses provides greater loss absorbency than virtually any of our peers. Under my leadership, you should expect us to continue to make decisions with the long-term in mind, to hold ourselves accountable to what we say; we are going to do, and to invest in product and service innovations that generate sustainable long-term value for customers and shareholders alike. In closing, on behalf of the entire leadership team, I'd like to say thank you to our employees who are listening today. As you know, banks inhabit a special place in the communities where they operate and with that comes a special responsibility to be a proponent for positive change. You work hard every day to live our purpose, including delivering 8 million meals to fight hunger across our footprint as part of Fifth Third Day, as well as positioning us to achieve our new $100 billion environmental and social finance commitment. I also want to thank you for the myriad of small things you do every day to improve our customer's lives. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our second quarter financial results and our current outlook. Good morning, Betsy. I think if I can add one thing there that maybe has been less fully appreciated. I think that Jamie's point, we've talked a lot about Momentum Banking, we've talked about Treasury Management, but among our investor peers, we also have the highest percentage of our branch network that has been open less than five years. And the majority of that time has not been in an environment where we were focused on deposit gathering out of those locations so much as we were household growth and otherwise. And the byproduct of that is we think there is a lot of latent new deposit generation power that will come out of the call it 70 de novos that have been opened in the Southeast and the 20 in addition that are going to come between the second half of this year and the first quarter of next year that will provide an additional kick in terms of core deposit generation above and beyond what we're getting out of Momentum Banking and the Treasury Management business. Gerard, I apologize, you cut out right at the beginning there. Could you start the question over? Yes. We can, yes. Good morning, John. Yes, no commonality by industry in those names. I think certainly the economic headwinds of inflation labor supply chain were elements to the \u2013 those were the common elements, but different industries, different segments, but they ultimately put pressure on cash flow. And that caused us to, as I said, take different action. Broadly in terms of pressure, I mean, it's the same thing we've talked about. We've talked about office that continues to be challenged, senior living again, that's another place where you see a disconnect between cost inflation and what they can get from a reimbursement rate perspective. And then what we're watching are places where changes in consumer behavior are shifting whether it's from durables and discretionary to consumables and non-discretionary, but it \u2013 no large segments. There's a little bit of idiosyncratic movement across the portfolio, but nothing major that causes us any concern. Good morning, Mike. Yes. Mike thanks for the question. I mean, to answer narrowly vary in terms of our level of confidence on our ability to manage expenses. I think the driver here when you think about our business, right, it's a people costs are a huge share of our overall expense base. And we've been, I think very public about the efforts that we have made over the course of the past few years to drive not only a culture of continuous expense discipline, but also a real focus on leveraging the technology investments we have been making to drive automation and reduce the unit costs associated with core processing activities. So our FTE count on a \u2013 is down about 600 right now, which is a big driver of the savings in terms of expense management and that's helping us. So it's less a dynamic around the margin on the incremental business so much as it is us continuing to make progress on the fixed cost base and the variable costs associated with our existing business activity. Thank you. Yes. I would say the investment portfolio is well positioned and at the level, that we would like to manage it long-term. Now with that said, if we see great opportunities, could we pull forward one quarter or two quarters of cash flow, which is currently running about a billion a quarter, I'm not going to tie my hands and say, I wouldn't take advantage of great opportunities, but as I said here today and what rates have done, we feel really good about, just stability from here. Thanks, Matt. Thank you."

            "name": "Jamie Leonard",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim. And thank all of you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were solid. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories, deployed excess liquidity in the securities at attractive entry points and remain disciplined in managing our deposit costs. Expenses were once again, well controlled, even though we continue to reinvest in our businesses. Fees did underperform our April expectations due to the market volatility, but even with that softness, we generated core PPNR growth of 11% on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we achieved a sub 55% efficiency ratio and generated seven points of positive operating leverage from the second quarter of 2021. The ACL ratio increased five basis points sequentially to 1.85%, which includes a four basis point impact from the Dividend Finance acquisition, combined with $62 million in net charge-offs, we recorded a $179 million total provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.3 billion increased 12% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. As Tim mentioned, the underlying NII growth was around 15% compared to last quarter of which approximately half of the growth was attributable to higher market rates, and half from the combination of investment portfolio growth and loan growth, primarily in C&I. Our interest bearing core deposit costs were well controlled at just nine basis points of this quarter up just five basis points sequentially and help drive the 33 basis points of NIM expansion during the quarter. Total reported non-interest income decreased 1% sequentially and increased 3% on an adjusted basis. Compared to the prior quarter, we generated improved financial risk management card and processing, gross treasury management fees and private equity income, which was partially offset by weaker performance from our market sensitive businesses, including commercial capital markets and mortgage, and the impact of higher treasury management earnings credit rates. Non-interest expense decreased 9% compared to the prior quarter, driven by a decline in compensation and benefits expense from the seasonal peak in the first quarter, lower incentive-based comp in the current quarter due to market dynamics that impacted fees and overall continued expense discipline throughout the company. Expenses in the quarter included a $27 million benefit related to the mark-to-market impact of non-qualified deferred compensation, which has a corresponding offset in security losses. This compares to a $12 million benefit in the prior quarter. Excluding the non-qualified deferred compensation impacts from both periods, total noninterest expense, decreased $95 million or 8%. Noninterest expense decreased 4% compared to the year ago quarter. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increase 4% sequentially including health for sale loans, total average loans increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 4% compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting growth in C&I loans. Commercial loan production remained robust throughout the franchise outperforming our original expectations. Our production and pipelines are the result of our strategic investments and talent, as we continue to see strength and new quality relationship generation during the second quarter. With muted payoffs and a 1% increase in the revolver utilization rate to 37% period and commercial loans increased 3% sequentially, and 12% compared to the year ago quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased 3% compared to the prior quarter driven by residential mortgage and the dividend acquisition, which are recorded in other consumer loans. This growth was partially offset by a decline in home equity. At quarter end, total dividend loan balances were $650 million reflecting our decision to hold some loans the dividend would have otherwise sold combined with their post-close production volume. Average core deposits were stable compared to the year ago quarter, and decreased 4% compared to the prior quarter, including the impact of the intentional runoff of excess and higher cost commercial deposits. This runoff was in line with our expectations and reflects our pricing discipline from our strong overall liquidity position. Compared to the year ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits decreased 8% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 1% reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. Given the improved entry points during the first and second quarters we deployed cash into the securities portfolio, which resulted in second quarter average securities balance growth of approximately $12 billion. We completed net purchases of $6 billion in securities during the second quarter compared to $13 billion in the prior quarter. The higher than previously expected security purchases in the second quarter were the result of accelerating planned second half of 2022 purchases given the attractive entry points in late May and June. We currently expect security portfolio balances to remain generally stable through the rest of the year. We have continued to focus on adding duration and structure to the investment portfolio to provide stable and predictable cash flows. Consequently, our overall allocation to bullet and locked out structures increase from 64% to 67% at quarter end, and our duration increase from 5.4 to 5.7. Moving to credit; as Tim mentioned, credit remained healthy and in line with our previous expectations. The NPA ratio of 47 basis points improved 2 basis points sequentially with net charge offs of just 21 basis points. The ratio of early stage delinquencies, 30 to 89 days past due relative to loans was stable in the second quarter and the amount of loans 90 days past due is less than half of what it was a year ago. We continue to closely monitor the same areas we have previously discussed such as central business district hotels, senior living and office CRE. We are also monitoring exposures where inflation and higher rates may cost stress, including the impact of changing consumer discretionary spending patterns as well as the ongoing monitoring of the leverage loan portfolio. Our ACL build this quarter was $117 million of which approximately 75% was from strong loan growth, including the $53 million ACL impact from the dividend acquisition and the remaining 25% was attributable to worsening economic projections relative to March, net of reductions in certain pandemic related qualitative adjustments. Given the incremental clarity on the economy's ability to withstand geopolitical tensions and the pandemic fallout with vaccine efficacy and other measures, we elected to return to our standard approach for scenario weights of 80% to the baseline and 10% to the downside and upside scenarios. We believe our models are better suited to appropriately evaluate economic scenarios and outcomes from monetary tightening on our loan portfolio than on humanitarian crises such as pandemics and wars. Despite the scenario weight change we increased our reserves in specific portfolios such as CRE, where we continue to believe there elevated risks. Our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains relatively stable with unemployment ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.8%, which is slightly weaker than our previous estimate. Additionally, GDP growth and home price forecast have weakened relative to our March forecast in both our baseline and downside scenarios. Our expectations incorporate several key risks that could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strain supply chains including aggressive rate hikes and quantitative tightening and labor supply constraints becoming more binding than originally anticipated. Our June 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment. Moving to capital, our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9% compared to 9.3% in the prior quarter. The decline in capital was primarily due to strong RWA growth reflecting robust organic business opportunities and the impact of the dividend finance acquisition. We expect to accrete capital to the 9.25% area by year-end given our strong earnings capacity and we will evaluate resuming buybacks after that time. Moving to our current outlook, for the full year 2022 we continue to expect average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021 or around 10% excluding PPP and Ginnie Mae impacts, reflecting strong pipelines and stable commercial revolver utilization rates over the remainder of the year. Dividend finance is generating strong origination volumes. We expect loan originations of around $1.3 billion in the second half of 2022 which is 30% more than our original estimates. Similarly provide loan production remain strong as we expect over $1 billion in total production in 2022. Dividend and provide together are expected to contribute a little more than 1% of the total average loan growth for the year. We expect average commercial loan growth of 9% to 10% or 14% to 15% excluding PPP. We expect total average consumer loans to be stable in 2022, reflecting our decision to lower auto loan production to enhance our returns on capital. We expect around $7 billion in auto and specialty production for the full year, which will still result in double-digit growth and average indirect consumer secured balances in 2022. Our outlook also assumes growth of approximately 15% in other consumer loans reflecting the benefits of dividend finance. Shifting to the income statement we continue to expect full year adjusted revenue growth of 7% to 8%, which will be a record year of revenue for Fifth Third. Given our outlook for earning asset growth combined with the implied forward curve as of July 1st, which assumes a fed funds rate of 3.25% by year end. We expect full year NII to increase 17% to 18%. Our outlook incorporates the impacts from runoff of the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios. Excluding those portfolios, NII growth would be around 20%. Our current outlook assumes average deposit balances decline a $2 billion in the third quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the second quarter runoff of excess and higher cost commercial deposits and seasonality, and then return to growth in the fourth quarter. Since the onset of the rate hikes, our deposit betas have been muted at low single-digits for the cycle to date. We expect increases to our interest-bearing core deposit costs to accelerate over the next two quarters due to the timing impact of deposit reprising lags from earlier hikes and continued aggressive rate hikes from the fed. We continue to expect a 25% deposit beta on the first 225 basis points of rate hikes and a marginal beta of around 45% to 50% on the next 75 basis points of rate hikes. The ultimate impact NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate movements, balance sheet management strategies, including securities growth and hedging transactions and realized deposit betas. We expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be down 7% to 8% in 2022, reflecting softer second quarter performance combined with the high probability of continued market volatility, reflecting a more aggressive rate outlook, including lower wealth and asset management mortgage and capital markets revenue, as well as higher earnings credit rates offsetting strong gross treasury management fee growth. Despite the expected decline in capital markets revenue, we expect full year capital markets revenue to be up nearly 50% from the pre-pandemic 2019 levels, which highlights the success we've had over the past few years in growing a diversified capital markets business. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense, including the impacts of dividend finance to be stable to down 1% compared to 2021. An improvement from our previous guide of up 1% to 2%. We continue to strategically invest in our franchise, which should result in low double-digit growth in both technology and marketing expenses. Our outlook also assumes we had 20 to 25 new branches, primarily in our high growth Southeast markets in 2022. Our guidance also incorporates the minimum wage increase to $20 per hour that went into effect on July 4th. We expect these investments in our people platforms and franchise to be offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in leasing expense, given our LaSalle Solutions sale and our continued overall expense discipline throughout the company. As a result our full year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth combined with our expense outlook should generate four points of improvement in the efficiency ratio and positive operating leverage of around 8%. Full year adjusted PPNR growth is expected to be 17% to 19%, which is an improvement to the range compared to our April estimate, reflecting the strong NII and expense outcomes, partially offset by the market related fee headwinds. Our outlook for significantly delivering on our positive operating leverage commitment reflects the benefits of our ability to grow our customer base combined with our strong balance sheet management and expense discipline. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect average total loan balances to increase 1% sequentially reflecting 1% to 2% growth in commercial and stable consumer balances. We expect our average securities portfolio to increase $2 billion to $3 billion reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made during the second quarter. Shifting to the income statement, we expect third quarter adjusted revenue growth of 8% to 9% compared to the second quarter. We expect NII to be up 11% to 12% sequentially, reflecting strong loan growth, the impact of securities purchases and the benefits of our balance sheet positioning. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the second quarter. We expect total adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to the second quarter or up 2% compared to the year ago quarter due to the acquisitions of provide and dividend finance. Excluding the second quarter NQDC benefits on expenses, we expect noninterest expenses to increase around 2% sequentially. We continue to expect third quarter and full year 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis point range. In summary with our balance sheet positioning, PPNR growth engine and disciplined credit risk management, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong performance in this type of environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Yes. Betsy its Jamie. Given the environment that we're operating in, we, as you can tell from our results are clearly positioning to be a little more cautious in this environment. So we think accreting capital for the remainder of the year would be appropriate. And then we will evaluate resuming the buybacks in the first quarter of 2023. And certainly that would be outlook dependent, but that's the current plan as we sit here today. Yes. Great question. And I'll start and turn over to Brian for some additional color. Actually I think it was at your conference in early June that we talked about our plans on managing the balance sheet from a deposit standpoint and frankly for the past year, year and a half, we said we'd like to see about $10 billion of the deposits run off. Fortunately, this quarter we were able to really manage the balance sheet almost exactly as we had intended again at your conference, I think, we said we'd done the quarter at a loan to deposit ratio of 74% and we finished at 74.7%. So I do feel good about how we position the balance sheet and our ability to right size it. And maybe with that I will turn it over to Bryan to give a little more color of what we've seen on the outflows. Yes. Talking on the consumer side first, obviously we have a great retail franchise with tremendous products with momentum and the de novo plan and the Southeast build out. So retail deposits, we would expect to continue to grow in the back half of the year. On the commercial side, as I said in my prepared remarks, we'll probably see a little bit more runoff, couple billion in the third quarter before we experience a return to growth in the fourth quarter. And again, that'll be driven by our Treasury Management business where, I think, we've presented different conferences talking about how our TM business is best-in-class in the regional bank space, in terms of TMPs as a percent of revenue or TMPs to loan commitments to help show that share of wallet. And I think Brian's comments are very important to realize that these weren't lost relationships. This was just excess money going to a better home and we expected it. And from here, it'll just be business as usual. Yes, I think in this environment, the accelerated rate hikes and magnitude of the rate hikes just continue to weigh on the rate dependent fee businesses. So the outlook for mortgage capital markets and TM earnings credits are the biggest drivers of the change in our fee outlook. As Tim mentioned in the prepared remarks, the fee equivalent growth has actually been very strong. It's just as we get that additional NII benefit from the rate hikes, we give a portion of it back and the rates paid on earnings credit. So, from here I would expect the strong consumer household growth to help carry the day on combination of card and deposit service charges. But as a reminder, we are implementing or did implement July 1, the elimination of the NSF fee. So that'll weigh a little bit on the back half of the year fee guide. And then on wealth and asset management fees we've done a great job of new customer acquisition, as well as our AUM net inflows, but obviously the market headwinds have an impact on the fee revenue there, so that again it's in the updated guide. And then commercial banking is really a fascinating tale of two cities where our ability to help customers manage different exposures that they want to hedge, whether it's raise commodities or FX, along with our institutional brokerage business is just growing 30 plus percent. But the disruption in the capital markets having a big impact on the corporate bond fees and loan syndication fees and we don't really in our outlook expect significant improvement in the capital markets activity in the back half of the year. And I guess when you add up our fee outlook in total, we made about $1,000,000,004 in the first half of the year, we're saying we'll make, you know, $1,000,000,005 plus or minus a little bit in the back half of the year and the TRA of that a $100 million a growth TRA is half of it. So at least for now, that's how we see the back half of the year playing out. Hello. Yes, I'll take the second part of the question first. When it comes to the line utilization, and I'm glad you asked the question. What we saw in the second quarter was that in total line utilization moved up a point, and we're guiding for the rest of the year for that to actually be stable. So, we'll see how things play out. And in the second quarter, the movement in the line utilization, the biggest group that moved was actually the middle market group was up several points and so that was nice to see. From a production standpoint, it was pretty widespread, and again a very strong quarter of middle market production. I think Tim mentioned, several geographies in his prepared remarks, but, Cincinnati, Carolinas, Florida, it's a consistent story for us where, a little bit of softness in East Michigan, Northern Ohio is more than offset by strong performance in the rest of the Midwest in the Southeast. And then from a vertical perspective, the renewables team continues and energy continues to go very robust as well as our TMT business. So, we feel good about frankly the ability to acquire new customers in this environment, the sales teams with the RM expansion play out west as well as in the Southeast has worked very well. We're just mindful of what appears to us to be a slowing economy. And therefore, we're trimming a little bit on the edges, but frankly, the core is performing very well and you see that in the results this quarter. Yes, sure John. Thanks for the question. In terms of auto, when we started the year forecast was about $11 billion in total production for a combination of auto plus the specialty business RV & Marine. We're now expecting to do about $7 billion in total in that asset class. And so the $4 billion of reduction is solely driven by the returns dynamic in that sector where several large players have certainly, if it's not irrational, it's certainly very aggressive pricing. And therefore we don't want to compete on an indirect asset class at such low spreads. So spreads a drop to levels that were reminiscent of when we did the pull back, five or six years ago. So the good news for us is, we keep the dealer relationships. We're continuing to monitor performance. We have spreads back up towards our target level and feel good about the production from a credit quality perspective, as well as a spread. But it's just not an asset class you want to grow, its single digit returns on capital. In terms of the credits, they were fairly stable in the quarter, not a lot to report there. Yes, I think from an end of period perspective, we've accomplished what we wanted to accomplish on the non-operational excess deposits. So again, there'll be an average effect in the third quarter, but overall, we said, a year and a half ago, we'd like to get $10 billion of the excess out. I think we've done that. And frankly year-over-year deposits are flat. So it's not shouldn't be a big surprise to people that we were able to right size it. And again, the loan, the deposit ratio at 74.7 would love to get it into the mid-80s over a period of several years but that would certainly be driven more by continued loan growth as opposed to any more deposit runoff. In terms of the betas, it is difficult I think to track betas by quarter when the fed is moving in such big chunks, but how we see it playing out is that we'd have a fourth quarter beta of 23% the month of December be 28% and then by the time we get to midyear next year that the trail effect because in our forecast we have the fed going to three in a quarter and then stopping for a little bit longer than normal period of time. And therefore there'll be a little bit of that drift effect as the lag catches up so that the ultimate beta ends up being 30% on those 300 basis points of rate hike. So from a rates paid perspective, it looks something in the area of the 9 basis points this quarter goes to mid-40s in the third, mid-70s in the fourth and then drifts to the mid-90s by the second quarter of 2023. That's how we think this'll play out and then continue to see deposit growth beginning in the fourth quarter and thereafter. No, I wouldn't say we're originating loan \u2013 yielding loans. The mix of a lot of our loan growth and our C&I book just given the floating rate nature of that portfolio and where it's been pricing in has been relatively neutral in terms of a NIM impact. But it does drive a decent amount of NII. Some of the consumer assets that we've been talking about especially the dividend assets in particular; it's just a late quarter impact. So you'll start to see some pickup from those in the future as those balances have a bigger average balance impact. But overall we do expect to see some pickup. The \u2013 we will continue to see C&I benefits just because of the asset sensitivity of our commercial floating rate portfolio. And we'll see some nice kind of drive from here and our NIM will continue to increase throughout the year. We would expect to end the year in a kind of a 3.30 to 3.35-ish range from a NIM perspective in the fourth quarter. So a lot of earnings powers still to come. And Mike, I would say, yes. Your math on the NII is very good and we are highly confident in that. I would say if there are two things, the third is extremely good at, one is balance sheet management and you see that in the NIM expansion, and as Bryan mentioned the continued expansion over the course of the year. And then we're also very efficient from an expense standpoint and what you have happening is that as there is fee weakness back to your profit margin question, as there is fee weakness, fees have a higher cost of delivery than obviously NII. NII for the most part's dropping straight to the bottom line. And so that's certainly an element of helping the efficiency ratio, but in addition to that all of the expense savings initiatives we have going on in the company, as Tim mentioned, year-over-year were down 600 people. If you exclude the acquisitions and dispositions and just sequentially we're down 260 people exclusive of the acquisitions and the dispositions, and that's rightsizing our mortgage business closing one of our fulfillment sites, right sizing the interact auto and specialty business, given the slow down and volumes and then all of the LPA enhancements with reducing IT and ops and the branch closure benefits from the first quarter. So we have a lot going on underneath to help provide those tailwinds on expenses, but then we're very mindful of continuing to invest. And so in the third quarter, in the guide you have an increase in technology and marketing and then a little bit of noise from the NQDC assuming it comes out at zero in the third quarter, which is the driver Y expenses, will be up 4% to 5% sequentially. But overall feel very good about our ability to deliver an efficient balance sheet and an efficient income statement. Yes. I would expect the investment portfolio to be stable from here. I would not expect to be selling down the portfolio to fund loan growth. It obviously in a crisis could be a great source of liquidity but that would probably be through more collateral usage at FHLB or backing \u2013 backstopping public funds deposits. But overall I'd expect it to be stable in the yield, our guide for the back half of the year on yield is in the 280 both for the third quarter as well as on a full year basis. So that yield guide is up a bit as Mike pointed out with some fortuitous timing on the, the additional leverage we've added. Hey, Erika, it's Jamie. I'll take that one. And I'll answer your question a little bit differently than how you asked it, because the only piece of data I have on the history is the unemployment level versus day one. So our current scenario for the baseline has unemployment, at 3:4, 3:5, 3:7 versus the day one reserve in years, one, two and three were 3:6, 4:3, and 4:4. So versus day one unemployment is a little better, but the big driver of our variance to day one reserves is that, the GDP outlook and collateral values, both for housing and auto are worse. And then obviously the rate environment is significantly worse, which in the modeling puts pressure on corporate profits. So, we're sitting a little bit elevated over the day one levels, but to your point, we think that is a prudent place to be. And frankly, versus last quarter, the scenarios are certainly worse. And so, GDP erosion, housing pricing is worse, interest rates higher. So from our standpoint, when you have a period of strong loan growth, like we did in the second quarter you have eroding economic forecasts, you should have a CECL build. And then on top of that, we have the dividend acquisition effect, which that $50 million or so of the ACL build on related to the dividend finance production is something that will continue as we commented on strong production expectations for dividend until that portfolio reaches a state of maturity. And so, those ACL builds ultimately we'll see, what the loss content is to your question on, should there be a mild recession, the Moody's baseline scenario that we utilize while worse is not, a broad based persistent decline in economic activity that would result in a recession. But again, it's certainly worse than last quarter and certainly worse than the day one bill. Yes, that's the story of my life right now, because in our outlook, we expect that the fed hikes to the 325 level. And then, I saw a research piece the other day that talked about, on average or the median of the fed cuts begin four months after the last hike. Now, we expect the fed to in order to tamp down in inflation, is really focused on slowing the economy. So, they probably hold for a longer period of time than that median and hold it that, whatever the peak level is. And so frankly, that could tip things over into a recession, maybe not, but at a minimum there will be rate cuts down the road and rate cuts are ultimately the most detrimental activity to a bank's balance sheet if left unprotected, and therefore everything we've done over the past couple of years has been building for that time, that the fed does move and we have a rate decline. And so we've added duration to the portfolio. Again, this quarter, it's up to 5:7 [ph]. We increase the bullet, locked-out, cash flows to 67%. We grew the portfolio to $55 billion. We added $10 billion in swaps. And then as Tim pointed out in his comments, we've added some fixed rate loan platforms to our business model, and that should also be helpful should rates decline. So yes, we spend a lot of time on that, and I think we have a very, very good team to be able to help manage through that environment. And certainly deposit generation activities are very helpful, especially from the retail footprint as those are the low cost stable funding that banks like to enjoy."

            "content": "Yes. Hey Gerard, it's Richard. Thanks for the question. You've described it in your question what's happening. We're at levels that are so low, there's a little bit of balancing along the bottom purposing, if you will. The change in both NPA and in charge-offs was a handful, was a handful of loans. And just finally rolled to a place where we needed to take a more direct action in terms of making them non-accrual in charging them off. I think overall the portfolio continues to form as you point out very well. Well, inside our appetite and we're very pleased about where we sit today both today, and then also with the outlook in front of us. Yes. And I think, with that being said, if we sound more cautious, right. I think we probably are just based on what I read in here. We've tried to be really consistent, especially as it relates to the alignment of, what we talk about worrying about and how that's reflected in the actions and how we run the company. And to try to be realistic about what's in front of us. Like Jamie said that, you look at what's going on in the current environment, Erika, and things are, there's a lot of things to feel optimistic about. And in our particular portfolio, not only do we, as credit obviously has been great and NCOs are low and NPAs, and delinquencies actually came down; the ratios there came down quarter-over-quarter. We are very mindful of the broader backdrop in attempting to gauge how to position the company for the next, 18 to 24 to 36 months. And at least from my point of view, if the goal is to have a company that's great through the cycle, you always have to be asking yourself what happens if you're wrong, right. And if we're wrong in this case, and we're being too cautious, maybe we miss a point or two alone growth that we otherwise could have gotten, right. But that's against a backdrop where we've done very well on that measure, maybe we buy back stock a quarter or two later than we would have otherwise and then the ACL dressed down naturally as the scenario outlook changes, right. But if we're right to be cautious on the other hand, the actions we've taken as it relates to the securities portfolio, the swaps, the total loss absorption that Fifth Third has relative to peers. And the fact that we did not take the benefit that we're getting from NII and spend it in the form of different sorts of investments and otherwise are going to pay off very handsomely, in terms of performance. So one way or the other like, even against this backdrop, I think our return metrics look really good on a relative basis. PPNR is going to be up, high teens on a year-over-year basis. I think we feel really good about how the bank is positioned."

            "name": "Bryan Preston",
            "content": "Yes, absolutely. We made the deliberate decision to not match market rates on certain high beta, lower relationship debt to customers. As we've said all along, we estimated about $10 billion in excess balances in our commercial deposit book that we believed may not be sticky. We do not have a lot of appetite for a 100 beta balances that want to be priced at Fed Funds or Fed Funds plus. We were in a position to let about $5 billion of these balances find a new home. We've not lost customer relationships. We know what it would take from a pricing perspective to get these balances back. A decent amount of these funds ended up in our liquidity portal, which gives our customers access to money market investments. We also saw some heightened seasonality this year Betsy, as it relates to tax payments that were a little bit larger. We estimate the tax payment impact with another $4 billion to $5 billion of the runoff. Our commercial balances, as we've said, were stable since mid-May, our consumer balances continued to be very stable and sticky. And overall, we're pleased with our cost of total interest bearing core deposits of 9 bips was up only 5 bips from the first quarter. In terms of how we're thinking about funding balance sheet growth from here, we are always going to be focused on being core deposit funded. We have a lot of levers that we can continue to pull to grow deposits from here. And we're confident in our ability to do that. That being said, we will use short term borrowings as a mechanism to help us manage volatility in the balance sheet month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. And that includes funding opportunistic investment portfolio purchases that we've done. Additionally over time, we've obviously run down our long-term debt portfolio. We'll be looking to re-enter the bank note market. We do think it's important for us to get some structure back into our liability framework. And so that's something that we'll use as well. But we continue to be confident with our ability to be core deposit funded. We are still sitting here at a 75% loan-to-deposit ratio. And so we feel very good right now about our overall positioning."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] 00:35 Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nChris Doll: 00:42 Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the first quarter of 2022. 00:48 Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. 01:09 This morning, I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Greg Carmichael; President, Tim Spence; CFO, Jamie Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg, Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. 01:23 Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.\nGreg Carmichael: 01:27 Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported first quarter net income of $494 million or $0.68 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.02 impact from the Visa total return swap, the mark-to-market impact over to AvidXchange Holdings. 01:43 Excluding these items, adjusted first quarter earnings were $0.70 per share. During the quarter, we generated strong loan growth, including average C&I growth of up 8%, excluding PPP. We grew core deposits once again with strength in consumer transaction deposits of 4% reflecting our success in generating quality household growth, which increased 3% on a year-over-year basis. 02:09 We also took advantage of attractive market entry points for deploying our excess cash that grew our securities portfolio by approximately $5 billion on an average basis. As a result of our interest-earning asset growth, net interest income increased 1% sequentially, excluding PPP. We had yet another quarter of benign credit quality, reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting, which resulted in near record low charge-offs of just 12 basis points. In addition to our muted credit losses, NPA remained stable, our commercial criticized assets continued to improve. 02:48 As many of you saw last week, I announced my plans to retire as CEO and transition to Executive Chairman effective July 5th. As part of our thorough succession planning process, I'm excited and proud to announce the Board has unanimously appointed Tim Spence to succeed me as our next CEO. I believe this is the right time for a transition, given Fifth Third's tremendous financial health and performance. Shareholders who have follow Fifth Third for a while, know that when I became CEO, I made a commitment that we would generate strong financial results and performed well through the various business cycles, we improvised our plans on a project North Star, we articulated several key strategic priorities generate strong and sustainable long-term financial results, including optimizing our balance sheet, differentiating our customer experience, growing and diversifying our fee revenues, building on our legacy of digital innovation and maintaining expense discipline. I am very proud of what we achieved. 03:49 We transformed our approach to credit-risk management, centralizing credit underwriting with geographic sector and product level concentration limits. We exited commercial relationships that had a skewed risk return profile totaling $7 billion focusing on high quality relationships with a more diversified and resilient businesses. We deliberately reduced our leverage lending exposure down more than 6% since 2015. 04:16 We remain cautious with respect to our CRE portfolio, with the lowest CRE as a percentage of capital among peers. We maintained our expense discipline, taking actions when necessary, including exiting non-core businesses, which allowed us to prioritize our investments in areas of strategic importance. We invested heavily in our treasury management systems, shifting our focus to building managed service platforms. As a result, we now have the highest TM fees as a percentage of revenue and commitments, and we are the fastest growing among our peers. 04:50 We made significant investments in technology to improve our resiliency and better serve our customers. We build a consumer business that has consistently added households far in excess of our peers in the U.S. average, while also taking our customers\u2019 satisfaction scores from below peer median in 2015 to top quartile today. We grew market share organically in the Southeast and West Coast and established a leading position in Chicago through the strategic acquisition of MB Financial. 05:20 We also invested in strategic nonbank acquisitions like Provide, Dividend, Coker Capital, H2C, Franklin Street and more, to accelerate growth and broaden our capabilities. We structure our security portfolio to generate stable, predictable cash flows that has allowed us to extend in our earnings advantage versus peers. And we focus on generating sustainable value for all stakeholders, including customers, employees and communities. 05:49 From day one, my focus was to build a franchise that would perform well through the cycle, while generating consistent and quality earnings quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. While some of these decisions impact the near-term profitability at the time, all of these proof points highlight the actions we have taken over the past several years to improve Fifth Third and set us up for long-term outperformance through various business cycles. 06:13 Furthermore, we expect our intentionally asset-sensitive balance sheet to perform extremely well relative to peers in this rate environment. With the revenue benefits of higher rates for August, we are mindful that there are likely to be elevated risk in the overall U.S. economy, which is a fairly aggressively tightens monetary policy the curb inflation, combined with the existing supply chain constraints and labor shortages . However, because of our actions and positioning Fifth Third is a strong as ever and well positioned for long-term outperformance. 06:45 I would just like to say that being the CEO of Fifth Third has been an honor of a lifetime. I'm grateful for the support of the board and all of our employees and I'm incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished. Fifth Third is in great shape and Tim is well prepared to lead Fifth Third into the future. Tim is an outstanding and visionary leader. He is been an integral part of Fifth Third\u2019s leadership team since 2015, helping develop strategies and vision that we are executing with excellence through innovation and technology. 07:13 Before I hand over to Tim, so this is my 29th and final quarterly earnings call. I can also say that I have enjoyed almost all of these discussions about our financial performance and outlook with the honest investor community. I want to say thank you for your confidence that you have given me for my tenure. Also I want to thank our entire leadership team, I have been extremely fortunate to work with such a great seasoned team, which I believe is the best-in-the-industry. We have accomplished together that has been nothing short of remarkable. Thank you. I know that under Tim's leadership, you will continue do great things, inspire others and improve the lives of our customers and well-being of our communities. 07:50 With that let me turn it over to Tim.\nTimothy Spence: 07:52 Good morning to you all. Thank you, Greg for the kind words . I'm honored to serve as Fifth Third's next CEO and to follow-on the footsteps of an incredible leader like you. I could be more excited about Fifth Third's future. Given my role in the company over the past several years and the strength of our performance, you should expect continuity in our strategic focus areas and then how we run the bank. We will maintain our operational focus, expense discipline and culture of accountability to produce consistent financial results while investing for the future. We will continue to anticipate and respond proactively to demand shifts and new competitive threats, consistent with the actions you have seen us take over the past several years, including our deliberate multi-year reduction in punitive consumer fees before it became an industry topic, the rollout of our award-winning Momentum Banking product suite, which is unparalleled among peers, our differentiated digitally enabled treasury management services to automate accounts payable and receivable launched well before the pandemic. 08:53 Partnerships and acquisitions of FinTech platforms like Provide and Dividend Finance that create national scale and a best-in-class customer experience and our focus on financing renewable energy well before ESG became a mainstream term. More broadly, we will remain mindful of the long-term structural shifts taking place such as the evolving geopolitical environments, population aging, government debt levels and central bank tightening that will create winners and losers over the next decade. No one knows for sure what the world will look like 10 years from now, but it's prudent risk managers we are always contemplating the many potential tail risks, as well as positioning the bank to take advantage of potential business opportunities that will arise. We will also be steadfast in our belief that we are most successful when we take care of all our stakeholders. 09:44 To that end, yesterday, we announced that we are increasing our minimum wage to $20 an hour across our footprint and that concurrently we will provide a mid-year wage increase to employees in our first four job bands. We are taking these actions despite having best-in-class employee retention according to leading research because we recognize that rising costs throughout the economy have a disproportionate impact on our frontline employees who are the face of Fifth Third. In total, more than 40% of our workforce will benefit from these increases, including 95% of our retail branch and operations employees. It is simply the right thing to do. 10:21 In the short term, this will result in roughly $18 million in the incremental annualized expenses. However, as we have seen with our two previous wage increases, we fully expect to achieve stronger financial outcomes from lower turnover, improved workforce quality, lower recruiting expenses and more effective training. As Greg mentioned, our balance sheet and earnings power are extremely strong. From a capital deployment perspective, we will continue to favor organic growth, evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities such as Provide and Dividend Finance paying a strong dividend and then share repurchases. Practically speaking given our robust loan growth, we currently anticipate resuming share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2022. 11:07 On behalf of the entire leadership team, I would like to say thank you to our employees. I'm very proud that in addition to producing solid financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. I also hope you all feel the same sense of pride that I do in being part of an organization that was just named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, one of just five banks globally. Fifth Third is a great company, because we have great people who live our core values every day. 11:39 With that, I will turn it over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook.\nJames Leonard: 11:46 Thank you, Tim and thank all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were solid despite the market volatility during the quarter. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories, deployed excess liquidity into securities at attractive entry points and grew deposits. Expenses were once again well controlled, but fees underperformed our January expectations due to the market environment. 12:13 Improvements in credit quality resulted in an ACL ratio of 180 basis points compared to 185 basis points last quarter, while an increase in loan balances resulted in the net of $11 million increase to our credit reserves. Combined with another quarter muted net charge-offs, we had a $45 million total provision for credit losses. 12:37 Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion was stable sequentially. Reported results were impacted by lower day count, lower PPP income including a slowdown in forgiveness that resulted in $10 million less than expected PPP related NII, and the expected decline in residential mortgage balances from previous Ginnie Mae purchases. These detriments were offset by the benefit from the deployment of excess liquidity into securities, strong loan growth and the impact of higher market rates. 13:13 Excluding PPP, NII increased 1% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Total reported non-interest income decreased 9% compared to the year ago quarter, or 7% on an adjusted basis. Similar to peers, our results were impacted by lower capital markets revenue, primarily due to transaction delays, as well as lower mortgage revenue in light of lower origination volumes and gain on sale margins, partially offset by improving MSR asset decay. 13:40 We generated solid year-over-year fee growth in treasury management and wealth and asset management where we produced net AUM inflows again this quarter. Consumer deposit fees were stable as our success generating household growth, offset that continued decline in punitive consumer fees as part of our Momentum Banking offering. 14:08 Non-interest expenses increased just 1% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting continued discipline throughout the company. Compensation expenses were well controlled with the year-over-year increase reflecting the previously announced broad-based restricted equity awards, which will support the continuation of our strong employee retention. We also continue to invest in the ongoing modernization of our tech platforms. These items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to 2021\u2019s contract renegotiations. 14:45 Adjusted expenses increased 2% sequentially, driven by the special equity award and the usual seasonal increase in compensation and benefits expense. Our expenses this quarter included a mark-to-market benefit associated with non-qualified deferred compensation plans of $12 million with a corresponding offset in securities losses. 15:09 Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 4% sequentially. Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 2% compared to the prior quarter as strength in auto originations combined with growth in residential mortgage was partially offset by declines in home equity and other consumer loan balances, primarily from GreenSky balance runoff. 15:37 Average commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 5% compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting growth in C&I loans. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased 6% with C&I loans, up 8%. Commercial loan production remains strong and in-line with our original expectations. Production was strongest in core middle market, which was well diversified geographically, which increased over 60% year-over-year. 16:09 Our production and pipelines continued to reflect our strategic investments in talent and our successful geographic expansion, as we sustained our record pace in adding new quality relationships during the first quarter. With muted payoffs and higher revolver utilization rates reflecting the capital market slowdown, period endcommercial loans excluding PPP increased 5% sequentially, and 13% compared to the year ago quarter. Over half of the sequential period end growth was due to existing revolvers with the utilization rate increasing 2% to 35.5%. 16:50 Given the market opportunities in the first quarter, we began deploying excess cash to protect against the rising risk of an economic downturn. During the first quarter, we grew our securities portfolio approximately $13 billion. On an average basis, securities increased $5 billion, or 13% sequentially. As we have said over the past two years, our balance sheet positioning allowed us to remain patient and not grow the portfolio at historically low interest rates caused by the extraordinary Federal Reserve intervention. 17:27 The past 90 days have absolutely validated our decision to patiently wait, but our actions this quarter and beyond will ensure our strong through the cycle performance under various rate scenarios over the long term. Our investments continue to focus on adding duration and structure to the portfolio with stable and predictable cash flows. Consequently, our overall allocation to bullet and locked-out structures increased from 59% to 64% at quarter end. 17:59 Average other short-term investments, which includes our interest-bearing cash decreased $6 billion, reflecting the growth in loans and securities, partially offset by continued core deposit growth. Compared to the year ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits increased 5% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 11%, reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. We once again added households in every market compared to last year led by our key Southeast markets. 18:34 Moving to credit. As Greg mentioned, our credit performance this quarter was once again strong with NPAs at 47 basis points and net charge-offs at 12 basis points. We continue to closely monitor areas where inflation and higher rates may cause stress. As Greg also mentioned we have deliberately reduced our highly monitored leveraged loan portfolio for this very reason, which is now below $3 billion in outstanding\u2019s. while also significantly improving the quality of the portfolio. 19:09 Moving to the ACL. Our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains stable with unemployment ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.7%. We maintained our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Our ACL build this quarter reflected strong loan growth and a worsening downside economic scenario, partially offset by improvements in the credit risk profile of the loan portfolio, including a reduction in borrowers and prolonged distress. 19:49 If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $1.1 billion higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $236 million lower. While our base case expectations point to continued economic growth, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, including escalating geopolitical tensions, which could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strained supply chains, pressures from the Fed's quantitative tightening or additional COVID variants, which could play out given the uncertain environment. Our March 31st allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment. 20:41 Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.3%, above our stated target of 9%. The decline in capital was primarily due to strong RWA growth in light of the robust organic business opportunities and securities purchases combined with an 8 basis point impact from the CECL capital transition rule. We expect to close the acquisition of Dividend Finance in the second quarter, which will deploy approximately 30 basis points of capital. Our tangible book value per share excluding AOCI increased 1% during the quarter and 5% compared to the year ago quarter. 21:27 Moving to our current outlook, which includes the financial impacts from Dividend Finance. We expect full year average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021 including the expected headwinds from PPP and the Ginnie Mae forbearance loans we added last year. Excluding these items, we expect total average loan growth of around 10% reflecting strong pipelines, sales force additions, the Dividend and Provide acquisitions and stable commercial revolver utilization rates over the remainder of the year. This should result in commercial loan growth of 9% to 10%, or 15% to 16% excluding PPP. 22:15 We now expect total average consumer loans to be stable in 2022, reflecting our first quarter decision to lower auto loan production in order to enhance our returns on capital. We now expect around $8 billion in auto and specialty production for the full year, which will still result in double-digit growth in indirect consumer secured balances in 2022. Our outlook also assumes modest growth in other consumer loans, reflecting the benefits of Dividend Finance, partially offset by a 20% decline in GreenSky loans. 22:56 On a sequential basis, we expect second quarter average total loan growth of 2% to 3% comprised of 3% to 4% commercial balance growth and stable consumer balances. We expect 5% to 6% average C&I growth in the second quarter, excluding PPP. We expect our average securities portfolio to increase approximately $10 billion in the second quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made later in the first quarter combined with the assumption that we have $2 billion more in balances given the market opportunities we have seen through early April. We also assume $1 billion in additional securities growth in both the third and fourth quarter. 23:48 Given our outlook for earning asset growth combined with the implied forward curve as of April 1st, we now expect full year NII to increase approximately 13% to 14%. It is worth noting that our outlook incorporates the impacts from the run-off of the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios, which resulted in a $220 million headwind this year. Excluding those portfolios, NII growth would exceed 18%. Our current outlook assumes stable to slight growth in deposit balances in 2022 compared to 2021 with continued strong growth in consumer deposits in the mid-single digits offset by the expected run off of non-operational commercial deposits. 24:43 We expect deposit betas of around 15% on the first 125 basis points of Fed rate hikes. The 25 basis points, we saw in March combined with another 50 basis points in both May and June. While we remain confident in the quality of our deposit base, the rapid and aggressive policy response by the Fed to curb inflation, including the potential for 10 rate hikes from March 2022 to March 2023 and aggressive Fed balance sheet reductions. We expect deposit betas of approximately 25% over the first 200 basis points this cycle compared to the mid-30s last cycle. The ultimate impact to NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate movements, balance sheet management strategies including securities growth and hedging transactions, and realized deposit betas. 25:46 For the second quarter, we expect NII to be up 11% to 13% sequentially, reflecting strong loan growth, the impact of securities purchases and the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet. We expect adjusted non-interest income to be stable to down 1% in 2022 compared to our prior expectations of up 3% to 5%. This change is primarily driven by the change in our rate outlook. The single biggest line contributing to the change as deposit service charges, which is reflective of incremental earnings credits in light of the higher interest rate environment. The rate environment has also impacted our outlook for mortgage revenue, which we now expect to be down 10% or so in 2022 compared to 2021. 26:39 We continue to expect strong but slightly lower than January expectations in commercial banking fees and private equity income in 2022 provided resolutions of the temporary delays experienced in the first quarter occur. It is worth noting that even with the decline and expected fee income primarily due to the interest rate environment, we expect total revenue to now be approximately $275 million more than our January guidance. 27:12 We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 8% to 9% compared to the first quarter or down around 1% compared to the year ago quarter. We expect full year adjusted non-interest expense to be stable on a standalone basis, or up 1% to 2% including the impact of Dividend Finance compared to 2021, which is an improvement from our previous guidance of up to 2% to 3%. We continue to strategically invest in our franchise, which should result in low double-digit growth in both technology and marketing expenses. 27:52 Our outlook also assumes we add 25 new branches primarily in our high growth Southeast markets. Our guidance also incorporates the minimum wage increase to $20 per hour that Tim mentioned. We expect these investments in our people, platforms and franchise to be partially offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives, reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in leasing expense given our disposition of LaSalle Business Solutions, which was completed in April and our continued overall expense discipline throughout the company. 28:35 We expect total adjusted expenses in the second quarter to be down around 3% to 4% compared to the first quarter, which is up 2% compared to the year ago quarter, due to the acquisitions of Provide and Dividend Finance or stable on a stand-alone basis. As a result, our full-year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth is expected to significantly exceed the growth in expenses, resulting in nearly 3.5 points of improvement in the efficiency ratio. 29:12 Our outlook for significantly delivering on our positive operating leverage commitment reflects our recent acquisitions expense discipline and strong balance sheet management. It also considers the known revenue headwinds from PPP and our Ginnie Mae portfolio. We continue to expect second quarter and full year 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20 basis points to 25 basis points range. 29:37 In summary, we continue to take actions to further strengthen our balance sheet positioning for this environment. We are deploying excess cash prudently into both loans and securities to support continued through the cycle-out performance and have a lot of momentum in our businesses to have a very successful 2022. 29:57 With that let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChris Doll: 30:02 Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. 30:17 Operator, please open the call up for questions.\nOperator: 30:21 [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nScott Siefers: 30:35 Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hi, Jamie, I appreciate -- hey, [indiscernible] I guess, first of all, I hope that Greg and Tim congratulations to both of you, best wishes. Greg as you go forward and Tim in the new position.\nTimothy Spence: 30:50 Thank you.\nScott Siefers: 30:52 Yeah. Jamie, appreciate all the thoughts on sort of liquidity deployment, I guess now that you've deployed sort of a majority of the target and roughly $10 billion or so in excess liquidity and the rest will be deployed through the remainder of the year. Is there in your mind sort of an opportunity to kind of redefine what you're excess liquidity looks like? In other words, deposits aren't really coming out of the system as large the way one might have thought earlier? Is there a point at which you say, hey, those are going to stick around and there sort of user or will they just be absorbed with loan growth et cetera. Just maybe any thoughts there?\nJames Leonard: 31:30 So it's a good question and thanks for asking, Scott, I probably should have included it in my prepared remarks, but I have recalibrated our excess liquidity given the first quarter's activity to where we're sitting on about $15 billion of excess cash here in April. I still like the one-third, one-third, one-third approach, where perhaps a third of it runs off in the commercial deposit book is the Fed starts to move in 50 basis point increments. And then, a third in additional security purchases, so $5 billion more during the course of this year. And then, obviously, the rest in loan growth especially with Dividend coming on board, where we expect continued nice loan growth throughout the year.\nScott Siefers: 32:19 Okay. Perfect. And then, you gave some thoughts on sort of the puts and takes in the expense outlook. I guess, so nice to see that you can absorb that minimum wage increases still improve the expense guidance. Are there any areas where you guys exclusively dial back things outside of compensation increase or but I guess sort of maybe just a little more thought on the puts and takes as you see them?\nJames Leonard: 32:46 Yeah. The puts and takes this quarter relative to the January guide really is the interplay of the rate environment between fees and NII, whereas expenses, the main driver of the improved expense base on a stand-alone basis was really the fulfillment costs and related compensation related to the lower fees, but the rest of the franchise in our approach to managing expenses during the year really hasn't changed from when we started the year. We continue to focus on technology investments and supporting our marketing efforts and so the marketing spend is actually a little bit higher as we look out at the year given the strong growth, we've had in consumer household acquisitions and the Momentum Banking product. Obviously, the minimum wage adjustment was a little bit of an uptick in expenses, but again offset by some of the savings from the lower fee guide. So overall, I think the approach remains the same, which has continued to invest in the business and continue to let that strong momentum show up in the rest of the balance sheet activities.\nScott Siefers: 34:02 Perfect. All right. Good. Thank you very much.\nOperator: 34:06 Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open.\nErika Najarian: 34:15 Hi. Good morning. My first question is that really for Greg and Tim. Greg, congratulations on your retirement. I'm wondering sort of why you decided now would be a good time to step aside. And Tim, maybe just as a follow-up to that, what are you most excited about as you look forward outside of macro in terms of the growth prospects for the bank that you're inheriting?\nGreg Carmichael: 34:44 Thanks for the question. First of all, I think it's really a perfect time for to me to be stepping down as CEO. The bank is in fantastic shape. I became CEO in 2015. The objectives we put in place to be good through cycle, make the changes that lead to for outperformance through the cycle. I feel really good about. So, position of the bank, our business for the future of the success we've had, it's a great time to step aside. Second thing is Tim\u2019s readiness. Tim's worked in the bank, six plus years, it's been succession, I think well final succession plan. Tim is absolutely ready and the time is now for him step up given the forms of bank. And third thing is my personal aspiration retire at age 60, which I turned 60 in January and that's always an aspiration mine to be able to be able to do that. And there's a lot of things I want to focus on, lot as travel on the personal side, personal investments and 60 was kind of my timeline also. So that would not have been work if Tim was already in the bank was position as well as also it really came together to right time.\nTimothy Spence: 35:51 Yeah. Erika, as it pertains to your question for me, I\u2019m excited about a lot. We are in as good a shape as Fifth Third has been at any point since I have been around the company, including the several years that I spent outside the bank as a consultant to the bank and Greg. And I think we have assembled to really outstanding bench of leadership talent, right. We talk a lot about experience being a team sport here. So you have deeply experienced folks from inside the company, you have folks who have joined from outside the bank who brought in fresh perspectives and it really helped us to think about how we shape the business going forward. 36:34 And if you think about the long-term objective, we set for ourselves, which is to outperform through the cycle. I think all the pieces parts are in place. We have a great culture of expense discipline. We've inculcated a credit discipline that will support through the cycle performance. We have been investing continuously. I think sometimes maybe we haven't got an enough credit for it because we have essentially been harvesting expenses in some areas and redeploying them and grow. And the byproduct of that is, we have a really excellent footprint and a nice balance between the Southeast and the Midwest. And we're seeing bloom coming for many of the investments we've made in digital capabilities. I think, in particular, with a focus on product innovation, right, whether that is Momentum Banking and the differentiation that, that is Provide and supported has provided to our household growth goals where the managed services, which as Greg mentioned in his prepared remarks that help to really drive the right balance in fees to total revenue. 37:33 And then I think last but certainly not least the benefits we're going to continue to see from the acquisitions that Provide and Dividend in terms of providing sustainable loan growth was really attractive ROAs. So, I do have lots to feel good about here.\nErika Najarian: 37:48 Got it. And the second question is for Jamie. Jamie, AFS has become a bad word this quarter and I'm wondering, you've always had a very distinct investment policy. If you could explain to the generalist that are listening to this call. There have been distressed about the CET1 erosion that they've seen at the big banks for it's been relevant and then the role the AOCI in other regional banks impacted tangible book. What you bought in the quarter to $10 billion and the difference between duration risk or CMBS and RMBS? And also if you could translate into generalist language, what bullet and locked-out structures mean?\nJames Leonard: 38:35 I think, I can take the next hour of this call and go through those but this tells you how difficult question it is. Jump in if I don\u2019t touch on all aspects of it, but I guess, I would start with saying and maybe I'm fighting a losing battle on this one, but I do struggle with the concept of fair valuing one line item of the balance sheet, but not the rest of it or not evaluating HTM in combination with AFS because philosophically for me, as a category four bank. Our election to put a security in the AFS or HTM doesn't change the economics or the risk of the investment. And I understand, the largest banks there is value in minimizing the risk of the regulatory capital volatility, but for us, well below $700 billion in assets, we believe the benefits of maintaining the flexibility to manage the portfolio as the environment unfolds or our outlook changes create significant value. 39:42 And you've seen that over the last eight years where we've had the number one performing investment portfolio yield in the industry. So I struggle with the concept of what our company be worth more if I place the securities into the Roche Motel of HTM or if I maintained by flexibility in my optionality and put it in AFS, but I understand that's how the valuation work. Our goal is always to optimize the balance sheet to deliver long-term real economic value and not make decisions, but optimize accounting outcome over economic value. So that's why we continue to pull it all of the securities and AFS because we like the optionality. In terms of what we're buying -- the second part of your question, we do like the bullet and locked-out cash flow structure so that there is a minimal extension risk in that security relative to RMBS. Probably the best example for the generalist on that would be our duration was 4.8 years at the end of the year and it moved to 5.4 years at the end of this quarter. All of that duration extension was because of the securities that we purchased, we averaged 2.5 yield and 6.5 year duration on what we purchased. So all of our duration extension was intentional and we prefer to add duration when we want to add it as opposed to the market foreseeing that duration extension upon us and that's really the value of the bullet and the locked-out cash flow. And I'll sacrifice a little bit of yield in a base environment but I protect the volatility on up rates or down rates and that's really the philosophy of managing the investment portfolio.\nErika Najarian: 41:40 Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: 41:44 Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nMike Mayo: 41:53 Hi. Just, -- I\u2019m saying questions if that's going to clarify there. So you've deployed or what 60% of your excess capital -- excess cash, I'm sorry and now you have about 40% of the excess cash to deploy from year? How we should think about this?\nJames Leonard: 42:14 Yeah. I looked at it Mike is, I had a $35 billion of excess cash, I bought 13 of additional leverage in the quarter. Got about 15 left, net of loan growth for second quarter purchases and additional cash deployment as the year progresses. And I think to Scott's question early on, there is an opportunity to perhaps that other $5 billion of run-off in deposits doesn\u2019t occur as offset by growth in other areas, but for now that's how we see the year playing out.\nMike Mayo: 42:46 And then to the other question for the CEO change, Greg, you gave a summary of what you've accomplished over the last seven, eight years. Anything that you say if you had more time, you'd like to have achieved? And then Tim, more like who -- who is Tim Spence, right? What is your background? Maybe Greg, why did the Board select Tim? What are the unique characteristics for Tim to be steward of Fifth Third's shareholders capital for the next several years for? Thanks.\nGreg Carmichael: 43:23 Absolutely, right. First of all, I think, we accomplished the objectives that I set out for as we talked about and we put project those where in place. I'd like to done more faster you're probably, but you will see an ability of the organization absorbed amount of change that we're bringing forth was important also. So I think we did it the right way it\u2019s not a whole lot, I would have changed or done differently. I'm sort of very probably accomplished as Jamie said and Tim said, , it's a team sport and we've got a great organization. We've worked hard to put a great organization and great team around Tim. 43:56 Why Tim, right now? Absolutely, the right person. Tim has a strong technology background. He has been instrumental into other acquisitions and the investments that we've been in this space. He has great, great abilities to look ahead. Understand and assess the challenges that we're going to be faced with now one year, two years, but five years down the road. So you think about our bank needs going forward, strong technology, expertise, but also beneficiary being able to see down the road or with the challenges might be that we're faced with and also execution. Tim is fantastic on the execution side you can be the great visionary, great strategist but if you cannot execute, you are not to be successful. Tim demonstrated over the years especially as present and he can execute extremely, extremely well. Once again, if that wasn't the case, we wouldn't be making this transition at this time. But he is absolutely ready, he is the right person. The reason I just said, I couldn't be more excited. I'm a large shareholder. I\u2019m going to be a large shareholder to have Tim at the helm forward. And I\u2019m excited about starting the next phase of my life, which is retirements of retirement I worked hard to achieve at early age and I think it's just a great, great time for both of us.\nMike Mayo: 45:06 Okay. I'll requeue. I\u2019ve some more tech questions. Thanks.\nOperator: 45:11 Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBetsy Graseck: 45:19 Hi. Good morning.\nJames Leonard: 45:23 Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: 45:25 Okay. A couple of questions, first on C&I. I noticed in the deck that ex-PPP you were up 8% QQ. And I just wanted to see if you could unpack the drivers a little bit. One of the reasons is, inventory build is going up, how much longer can that last? I've got a colleague internally who is telling me that inventories are about peaking and I'm wondering, if you agree with that or not? And maybe give some sense of what you're seeing in your customers desire for CapEx and what the runway is on that? Thanks.\nTimothy Spence: 46:00 Yeah. Sure. Betsy. This is Tim. Thanks for the question. So I think you have to think about our C&I business is being the corporate banking business and the middle market business. So I think, very clearly the corporate banking side of the business that rising utilization there is at least in part a byproduct of the capital markets having been influx and I do anticipate that as the markets are opened up and that folks that we bank who are issuers on a regular basis. Go back into them that you'll see more fee income and then in turn a little bit less utilization. But there is no question inventory build there. Core middle market, I think there is still room to run on inventory build but there is no question that the catalyst for us in terms of our own growth has been now that the focus on CapEx in particular, investments that are going to drive labor productivity or at a minimum, a reduction in labor requirements. 47:00 And then in addition to that we have benefited now and are continuing to benefit from what was a record pace of adding new quality relationships. Last year, which is carried over into the first quarter that Jamie and Greg and I were laughing before the call. It's really, it's the 4Cs for us at Cincinnati, Chicago, the Carolinas and California plus Tennessee and we couldn't figure out how to get to fee out of that one, but that drove the outperformance and C&I production in the first quarter.\nBetsy Graseck: 47:33 Okay. I guess, Tennessee, so maybe at the end of that.\nTimothy Spence: 47:36 Yeah. There you got Tennessee, exactly.\nBetsy Graseck: 47:40 And then maybe you could help me understand how you're thinking about deposits and deposit moving from here, you get the Fed QE that then you\u2019ve got your high quality book and so, how should we be thinking about deposit growth and what the loan to deposit ratio should look like as we progress over the next year or so? Thanks.\nJames Leonard: 48:03 Yeah. We certainly expect the loan-to-deposit ratio to what I'll say improve get higher. We finished the quarter at 69% and really the interaction between the loan-to-deposit ratio and the deposit betas is obviously, highly correlated. And as we entered the last tightening cycle at third, we were in the mid-90s. So we don't expect to get that high in this over the next couple of years, but we certainly would like to manage the company in the 80s from a loan-to-deposit ratio, but it will take a little bit time to get there. I think from a deposit activity standpoint, we expect continued strong consumer deposit growth and then we're forecasting and perhaps it's conservative, a run-off in the non-operational deposits within the commercial book is, we're just not going to chase rate sensitive non-relationship deposit balances. 49:06 But with that said, I really like the balance sheet that we've put together over the last seven years where we've really improved the primacy within the consumer book as well as the granularity through the household growth along with the improvements in the operational deposits through our strong treasury management business. I know we've talked about at different conferences over the course of the year the strength of our TM business, but that ultimately will pay off as rates start to rise and we can perhaps manage to a lower beta in the next 200 basis points than what we saw with the start of the 2015 hikes.\nBetsy Graseck: 49:48 And the non-operational, you size that.\nJames Leonard: 49:54 I'm sorry, I couldn\u2019t...\nBetsy Graseck: 49:56 The non-operational deposits you've sized that.\nJames Leonard: 50:02 Yeah.\nBetsy Graseck: 50:03 Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: 50:07 Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKen Usdin: 50:14 Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Jamie, just a following up on the securities portfolio purchases, now that you've both move more in and also rates have moved higher. I wonder if you could just level set us relative to your comments last quarter about where you think the securities book yields go over the course of the year -- year end [indiscernible]. Can you just give us kind of an updated level set on how that trajectory, given the better front book yields that you've been able to see?\nJames Leonard: 50:44 Yes. We expect the investment yields to be in the 2.75 area in the second quarter as well as for the full year, which is up, obviously from the guide we had in January in the 2.60 to 2.70 range.\nKen Usdin: 51:00 Perfect. Great. And then second question on a deepening on the expense side. So the expense guide got a little better for the full year even with the incremental minimum wage. Could you just kind of give us some granularity on what was the rest of the delta, was it incentive comp or related to fees? Was it just incremental efficiencies that you've been able to find just a details there would be great? Thank you.\nJames Leonard: 51:25 It's predominantly the fulfillment costs within mortgage and incentives in the other businesses that were impacted by the lower fee outlook. And then, partially offset by the higher marketing expenses and the minimum wage increase impact.\nKen Usdin: 51:46 Okay. Got it. So everything else related to like brands, branch savings et cetera., technology spend is intact underneath the surface?\nJames Leonard: 51:54 Correct. Yeah.\nKen Usdin: 51:56 Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: 52:01 Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nEbrahim Poonawala: 52:09 Hey. Good morning. I guess one question just around, as we think about capital deployment, future M&A. Just to talk us around how and maybe Tim, if you want to jump in, how you think about adding scale for your obviously organically growing in the Southeast, talk to us about like bank M&A, is there any appetite for that? And then how does that fit in, when you think about technology and I know, Tim has spent a lot of time on payment and strategy? So just some perspective around how you see Fifth Third position on the tech stack and what are the one or two big sort of areas that you are looking to invest as we think about the next couple of years?\nGreg Carmichael: 52:54 Okay. A lot of questions. Let me get started here. First off, when you think about deploying capital, we have not changed I would think about. Number one is organic growth that's extremely important is the expansion in Southeast and the West Coast, investing in our people, technology, products, services, job one is organic growth, billion quality franchise for the future that performed well. Second, we look at non-bank M&A transactions. So opportunities like Provide, Dividend Finance, H2C, Coker, Franklin will be examples of non-bank opportunities that really add to our products and service capabilities, that's extremely in our reach extremely important to us. We're always looking for those type of opportunities that make us a better bank, and that\u2019s number two. 53:36 Number three, more obviously, want to continue to pay a strong dividend. Number four, with excess cash will be share repurchases. Lowering our part would be M&A. Now why is M&A bank M&A lower on our progress of us. Quite frankly, there's not a lot of opportunities out there. And we will believe M&A is a strategy unto itself. We think, M&A is a strategy, which will support our strategic direction. When you look at some of the transactions that we've done recently, we did not participate those type of transactions. So once again if there was an opportunity from a bank M&A perspective, they have to fit into our strategic objectives such as the larger and more relevant the Southeast and attractive markets. There is just not lot of those opportunities that exist today. That's why it\u2019s lower in our priority list. It doesn\u2019t mean if something did emerge that fits into our strategic direction, makes us more relevant to Southeast in a right markets that we're looking for and is a good cultural fit that we wouldn't consider it. We actually we consider it. It's just lower on our prior list because there is not a lot of opportunities out there that really fit or we should be trying to accomplish that we think are actionable. So that's why it\u2019s lower in the list for us. But once again it's something emerge, we will obviously assess that for long-term strategic shareholder value when we consider it.\nTimothy Spence: 54:53 Yeah. And moving forward towards, I concur with all that, I think we said for a long time that we don't believe that scale is an and in another itself and that certainly will be consistent in terms of our point of view on how we proceed. As it pertains to your questions about technology, you can think about the investments that we have been making and basically three areas. One is, just the core infrastructure, right. We talked a lot about data centers. We've talked a lot about the cloud data strategy. We talked a lot about information security and otherwise. I think we feel very good about where we're at on that front. We are making good progress. I can't remember the cricket analogy, Simon have to go with middle innings, but we are in the platform modernization front, okay. And I think feel very good about the migration away from legacy mainframe platforms and on the platforms that allow us to spend a lot more of our money on new application development as opposed to maintenance and service. 55:54 And then I think the thing that's probably been less, there has been under emphasized in our industry in general, but which is a big point of focus for ours. We are believers that the more fundamental disruption associated with the Internet in all sectors, is the way that it informs product and product innovation. So that is the area where I think we will continue to look to differentiate. We have to be good at all of the other items. There are hygiene factors, but it's the opportunities to leverage technology to change the nature of the value proposition that we have for our customers. The way that we did with Momentum Banking when we launched a year ago. And as we continue to hone and refine and add feature functionality to that platform. The things that the folks have provide have done over time that they -- where they have actually been able to accelerate the amount of innovation that they brought to market. We launched five or six new products within the first six months that they were on board and they had gotten two or three out in the prior few years beforehand. And then the managed services, which are obviously a critical platform for us and which provide really stable and high margin fee income.\nEbrahim Poonawala: 57:09 Thanks for the comprehensive response. One quick follow-up. Jamie, sorry if I missed it, did you mention what the dollar amount was for the non-operational deposits?\nJames Leonard: 57:17 We did not, but it's baked into the $5 billion of outflow that we're assuming occurs during the course of the year. So, sorry, I didn't answer that more clearly with Betsy's question.\nEbrahim Poonawala: 57:30 Understand. Greg and Tim, congratulations. Thank you.\nTimothy Spence: 57:33 Thank you.\nOperator: 57:35 Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatt O'Connor: 57:42 Good morning. Could you guys talk about how C&I spreads are trending? I know a few quarters ago, you were talking about pressure, but we've seen obviously widening spreads in capital markets, which is a perfect indicator, but certainly better to widen the narrow. And on the flip side, as rates go up, there's obviously more spread to potentially probably where does you think about competitive forces? So, maybe what you're seeing now and how you think will trend next few quarters? Thank you.\nJames Leonard: 58:13 Yeah, Matt. It's Jamie. Thanks for the question. The C&I spreads or definitely stabilized during the course of the first quarter, such that the C&I yields ex-PPP were only down 4 basis points as opposed to some of the double-digit types of declines you saw in other quarters. So we feel good about stabilization of loan yields. And in fact for the balance sheet hitting an inflection point in the second quarter for pretty much every asset class, but yields and spreads should be improving as we go forward from here.\nMatt O'Connor: 58:55 Okay. And then as we think about, I guess specifically like on the spreads like yields will go up obviously rates are going up, but then a lot of banks are -- all banks are trying to grow kind of the core C&I which has been trying to Fifth Third for years. So how do you think some of the spreads trend the next few quarters between the puts and takes off again capital markets you've seen some spread widening but competitive forces from the banks?\nJames Leonard: 59:19 Yeah. I think C&I spreads in the second quarter stable flat and then improvement perhaps as we get to the back end of the second quarter heading into the second half of the year, given some of the disruption in the capital markets and the spread widening from the geopolitical tensions, that's how we have a model going forward.\nMatt O'Connor: 59:42 Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: 59:44 Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.\nGerard Cassidy: 59:50 Good morning, everyone.\nGreg Carmichael: 59:53 Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: 59:56 Greg and Tim congratulations on the new roles for both of you. Jamie, I always appreciate your color commentary about the balance sheet and the asset liability sensitivity as well as the expectations you have for the full year as well as the second quarter and the world has changed dramatically in this first quarter as evidenced by your assumptions on the Fed funds rate and the powerful impact that has had on net interest income. Can you share with us, if we're here a year from now, then Greg will be drinking a pina colada in the Caribbean and we know that. But for you [Multiple Speakers] What should we really focus in on a year from now that could be a starling. Is it just breathtaking how it's changed and it's not just for you folks, of course, it\u2019s everybody. But I'm just taking the back at how strong everyone's net interest income growth is now because of the rate environment changed and I\u2019m wondering a year from now, what could it be like that could make us stay up late at night worrying?\nJames Leonard: 61:07 I think a year from now and really the value that we see from our actions this quarter is just how well positioned our balance sheet is to perform well through the cycle both from an NII perspective and a credit perspective. And I think perhaps there was some concern that we have waited too long and miss the opportunity. And I think the good news from today's release is that we are well positioned and well protected to the possibility of recession in 2023 or 2024, not that that's our base case, but certainly something that we're mindful of and we pride ourselves and really under Greg's leadership over the last seven years of being good risk managers and that's how we approach thanks for that show that downturn occur. We're well positioned to be a strong performer. But should we continue to see good economic growth, but this is a company that's positioned to do well with generating high returns, high PPNR growth and really do well through the cycle.\nTimothy Spence: 62:22 Gerard, if I were to add on adding Jamie referenced credit, we've come out of a period here where the dynamic around rates as I think really obscured the importance of funding quality. And it just given the way that reporting gets done, it's probably hard to tell from the outside looking in, how good the funding base is, and that doesn't just extend the banks, it's the non-banks as well, right. So as the Fed tightens, I think there is going to be more differentiation and maybe the market fully appreciates as it relates to the stability and the quality your funding base and the banks who have done the things that we've tried to do in terms of growing primary relationships and what the focus on core operational deposits should be much better positioned to whether an environment where liquidity maybe is, there is a premium attached to it unlike the environment that we really have come out of over the course of the past handful years.\nGerard Cassidy: 63:25 Very good. Thank you for the color. And the prime relationships that you've developed with your customers and the low cost funding that comes along with that is obviously very beneficial. At what point or is there a point that you folks may look for some term funding if rates were to really go higher 12 months from now. Just like they've done in the last three or four months, does it make sense at some point to start looking at some term funding?\nJames Leonard: 63:57 Yes. And that is included in our NII guide as well for the year.\nGerard Cassidy: 64:02 Very good. Thank you, Jamie.\nOperator: 64:07 Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open\nJohn Pancari: 64:13 Good morning. On the deposit beta topic, I just wanted to see if you could perhaps discuss any of the risks or concerns that investors had that is for the industry could surprise higher than many of the banks are expecting, I know you guys are expecting a lower beta perhaps in the 25% range versus we experienced in previous cycle. Can you just talk about the concerns there that competition to be could be much more intense this time around given the various players in the space that could perhaps influence deposit betas to be higher than expected?\nJames Leonard: 64:56 Yeah, John. Thanks for the question. There are a lot of competing factors on where the betas shake out. We think the overwhelming factor for the industry is the amount of liquidity is signified by the loan to deposit ratio and the industry being 20% better than they were at the end of 2015, heading into the last cycle, but you're certainly right the level of competition ultimately dictates the deposit betas, we just think the industry is so much better positioned now that the level of that competition should be less. So from an industry perspective, we think that should win out but then if we're wrong then let's talk about it on an idiosyncratic basis for Fifth Third, what we've been able to accomplish with the primacy and operational deposits and the treasury management business has translated for us what we believe should be a lower beta on the first 200 -- at the 35 last time, 25 this time. But with that said, 90 days ago, we were modeling a 20 beta on those first 200. So we have raised our own expectations a bit. Hopefully, we will do better than that, but possibility that we would not 25% beta is what we've settled in our outlook in the up 200. 66:31 When you break it down by customer segment, obviously the wealth and asset management area as a highly price sensitive portfolio whereas for us the improvement won\u2019t be as much in that portfolio as it is in the commercial business because of the treasury management. And then in the retail book if the value exchange with the free services that you receive in Momentum Banking, we believe should result in a little bit lower beta this time around so that we're not competing on rate for the retail customer, but rather the value exchange with those other services, then including things like less punitive fees, the NSF elimination and all of the other structural changes we made to our product lineup should result in a better beta of the cycle. But if by chance, we are wrong. I think we're well positioned to be able to compete well regardless of how that plays out.\nJohn Pancari: 67:32 Got it. Okay. Thanks, Jamie. That's helpful. And then a similar question actually on the credit side. I know you're not flagging anything to concerning on the credit front and that's very similar to the message that we've gotten net of out of the banks this earnings season. And you know, but I know you saw a bit of a tick up in your [indiscernible] in a couple of the banks we have seen that as well. What areas of credit are you watching most closely? What areas do you think will move first? And are there any signs of faster than expected normalization at all within your consumer portfolio for example?\nRichard Stein: 68:11 Yeah. Hey. It's Richard. Let me start with the last one. From a consumer standpoint, we're actually not seeing signs of acceleration. If you think about where the excess liquidity certainly to the top 70% of that went to the top 20% of income households that liquidity has been sticking around for our customer base and again, we're prime and super-prime. And activity really haven\u2019t -- we really haven't seen a shift in activity with respect to behavior changes in terms of that excess liquidity running off faster than we expected. In fact it's running off a little slower than we expected as people continue to strike the right balance across their lifestyles. 68:40 From a delinquency standpoint, we're at such a low level and this links to change for us was really in commercial. We're at such a low level, but it just takes one or two to slip over the quarter to change the percentage. So, we're really not seeing any trends. In terms of that would be alarming, that would -- that points us to an acceleration of the normalization across credit, whether it's consumer or commercial I think areas we're watching. Clearly, we continue to watch the leverage space, particularly enterprise value lending that's an area that we've been very disciplined on and we were happy with the portfolio. But that's a place where we continue to exercise discipline. 69:27 There is a handful of segments and CRE. Office is one that we're watching long term just given -- just given the structural changes in that space, but we focus on quality Class A properties, gateway cities. It's all very good stuff. And then, there's -- we're watching consumer products and manufacturing and senior living in a couple of more places where, look, we're watching as places where the ability to pass through cost increase, maybe a little harder. We haven't seen evidence of that at least at this point most people been able to pass cost increases through, but that's where we're watching.\nJohn Pancari: 70:05 Very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: 70:08 Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is now open.\nTerry McEvoy: 70:15 I'll take that. Good morning. Jamie, maybe a question for you. Could you just remind us what the mixes within commercial banking revenue, it was down 21%, but the better than some of your others who maybe, call it, capital markets or investment banking? And then maybe what are pipelines like today, and do you have any near-term thoughts on that business?\nJames Leonard: 70:36 Yeah. The disruption in the first quarter definitely impacted the debt capital markets groups with the loan syndications and the corporate bond fees. For us within the commercial banking, it's a pretty good split between FRM products where we're helping customers with hedging called out a third of the business, a little bit more than that amount in investment banking revenue and then the remainder within some of the lending fee categories that an aggregate to the total. So, what we've seen is that FRM has done better that we originally expected, but that investment banking category within corporate bond and loan syndication and branch fees performed worse than expectations, so that's the mix there. The guide for the year includes some assumption that\u2019s markets stabilize and reopen and should that not happen and we would just have more of that interplay between NII and fees. So that at the end of the day I will still feel good about the revenue generation of the company.\nTerry McEvoy: 71:52 And then just as a follow-up, the average commercial loan growth of 9% to 10% versus 7% to 8% in January. Is that all layering in Dividend Finance or ex that deal, you see a stronger year within commercial lending?\nJames Leonard: 72:08 Yeah. So Dividend Finance will show up in other consumer loans, unlike Provide that did show up in C&I. So you'll see Provide\u2019s benefit is in the C&I guide and Dividend Finance's and other consumer loans category.\nTerry McEvoy: 72:24 Okay. Great. Thanks for clearing that up. And then congrats to both Greg and Tim. Thank you for taking my questions.\nGreg Carmichael: 72:30 Thank you, Terry.\nOperator: 72:35 Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Marinac: 72:41 Thanks. Good morning. Jamie, I wanted to ask about the Fed balance sheet and epic contracts. Does not make a difference to your rate outlook and/or kind of how you perceive the macro picture?\nJames Leonard: 72:53 We do expect contraction with our outlook of the Fed balance sheet as they potentially begin the sell down in June, announced that in May. I guess ultimately, the variable to our outlook would be, if they were to move significantly faster than perhaps you have a little bit more deposit outflow or higher deposit betas than what's expected, but it would have to be pretty quick and significant action on their part to implement the quantitative tightening more so than what we've got baked in. So I think ultimately it will play out, okay.\nChristopher Marinac: 73:38 Okay. But you're not expecting the opposite where they don't contract at all, it's not part of the interaction?\nJames Leonard: 73:44 Correct. Yeah.\nChristopher Marinac: 73:45 Okay. Very well. Thanks.\nOperator: 73:51 Your next question again comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMike Mayo: 73:59 Hi. I was since, Greg you define Tim starting with the word tack or technology maybe just dig into a little bit more, Tim, your vision for what droves the bank in the future look like in terms of technology. Greg, you certainly have taken Fifth Third away, but there's still a lot more to go, I'm sure. So I'll give you Column A or Column B. Column A would be more one premise proprietary in-house don't rely too much on third-party and you can control your destiny, and Column A is where certain banks are where they want to protect a lot of their customer data and information, safety and security. Now Column B would be a zero ops, 100% public cloud, maybe 10, 15, 20 FinTech partners and the Lego approach where you piece those together really making use of having kind of a break down the borders around the bank. So column A or column B or maybe I'm framing this wrong and you can give another answer, but how do you 4C that the tech bank of the future?\nGreg Carmichael: 75:08 Tim is going to answer towards C here.\nTimothy Spence: 75:11 No. Look like, I think it's a mix of both the nice thing about our sector is there really is a very active technology vendor community and it gives you a lot of choices about how you want to run the business. I don't think we're ever going to be all in bucket A or bucket B. We're big believers that where there is an industry utilities that drives very limited customer differentiation and where there is a benefit to shared scale it makes sense to ride on the rails that are available and where there is an opportunity to differentiate and/or in the aspect of the business that's deeply proprietary that it's got to be managed and maintained in-house. So I think you're going to see us take a best of blend approach as it relates to those two areas. But with a heavy focus on owning the tech platforms in the products which are customer facing and probably comparatively a lighter emphasis on that as it relates to the back office where you're talking about a scaled utility that's processing credits and debits as opposed to something that's more strategic our proprietary to business.\nMike Mayo: 76:26 Okay. That was clear. Any more concrete metrics that you can give us not everyone disclosed this, but the number of apps that you have and how much you'd like to reduce that or the number of vendors you have and where you'd like that to go, or percent that you're on the public cloud and where you'd like to take that or number of data centers where the end state is what you desire? So anything concrete those of us on the outside could -- you maybe ask you again in a couple of years to track your progress?\nGreg Carmichael: 76:55 Hey, Mike. This is Greg. I don't have concrete numbers for you. When you think about things like data centers it's two. Obviously, we want to be down to two data centers and we're approaching that pretty quickly here. Obviously, we want to make sure we have a hot sight and you get latency on how fast things could travel, it's really mindful that, but that's going to be the case. We think about our core apps around the business something less than we have today. I'm not sure how substantial of the agenda today, but something less we have today. Customer-facing apps as you think about them, when we can build off of common platforms and expand of a common platform very different than the past, there is an open source cloud-based computing that technology enabled us to do things over definitely we have less applications. So less applications for the customer facing side of house somewhat less applications on the back and as we consolidate some of our platforms and vendors, definitely less vendors. And data center we wanted to.\nTimothy Spence: 77:53 Mike, the metric that I think I'm really -- the metrics I'd really chiefly focused on how to deal with the resiliency of our environment. We have talked a lot about that, then they have to do with the mix of spend and the sort of continued focus on driving a heavier share of our overall spend to new application, development and products and out of legacy maintenance costs, right. Those I think are the things coupled then with what you can see publicly in terms of the way that customers evaluate our digital channels, in terms of the differentiation that you can see in the quality and the products and the services that are going to be the things that you should hold us accountable to.\nMike Mayo: 78:37 Last one, so to run the bank, change the bank spend for technology where has it been, where is it today and where it might go to then?\nTimothy Spence: 78:46 Yeah. You include information security and otherwise, it's been, call it 35 change the bank, 65 run the bank the goal going forward is to invert that 65-35.\nMike Mayo: 78:57 Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: 79:02 Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.\nGerard Cassidy: 79:10 Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up and apologize if you guys addressed this in your opening remarks. But Tim, you mentioned the 4Cs of your markets post Tennessee. Can you share with us where you're seeing the best commercial loan growth within the portfolio. I mean, coming from what parts of the 4Cs?\nTimothy Spence: 79:35 Yeah. As in which industry sectors, Gerard or where within -- where geographically within the markets?\nGerard Cassidy: 79:41 More geographic that said, yeah.\nTimothy Spence: 79:44 Yeah, sure. So Betsy did correct me, it is the 5Cs if you count the FEE at the end of Tennessee as one, and I got an angry text message from our Head of Indiana and pointed out that they had a pretty good quarter as well. So, yeah, look I think geographically we have the benefit of having a really strong presence and mid-sized natural areas. And if you look at both demographics and economic activity that's where the majority of growth is coming from across the U.S. right now. It isn't necessarily the mega cities and it's certainly not the rural areas. It's the Charlotte's, the Raleigh's, the Cincinnati, the Indianapolis, the Columbus, the Inland Empire and California, as a point of example there as well, where you're seeing a lot of the activity and that is very consistent with what you would see inside our book of business as well. 80:41 So the Cincinnati Columbus corridor, I think has been a very strong resilient corridor that should be even better as Intel lands here and we get the downstream component suppliers and logistics companies and software engineering companies and otherwise that make their way into the space. Indianapolis and Columbus, I think are the two bright stars in terms of economic growth in the Midwest and obviously what we are getting out of the upstate. And Charlotte and Raleigh has been really outstanding along with middle Tennessee and Nashville, as opposed to other parts of the state that are growing at less robust pace.\nGerard Cassidy: 81:21 And then as a follow-up to, in the commercial lending areas, how important are the treasury management products to complement the actual loan growth, obviously, we know lending standards can easily drive loan growth if you lower them. [Multiple Speakers] Can you share with us the color as well.\nTimothy Spence: 81:40 Yeah. I know there -- I mean they are extremely important and they have been a big catalyst for the success we've had in growing our quality relationship count, Gerard, so a third 30% to 35% of our new relationships have been led by TM in terms of the initial product sale, which certainly is anomalous to what I had experienced prior to or having had the success that we've had as it relates to managed services. And if you look at the available industry research the folks that do benchmarking on this front that Fifth Third is always in the very top of the top quartile in terms of TM penetration in the middle market into our middle-market lending relationships, which I think you can kind of evaluate just by looking at the growth of commercial deposit fees over time and commercial deposits as a percentage of Commercial total loan commitments, both of which Fifth Third is best-in-class in relative to its investor peer group. So it's important strategically in terms of how we go to market and the results are bearing out in terms of the financial performance.\nGerard Cassidy: 82:50 Great. Thank you.\nOperator: 82:54 There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to your Chris Doll.\nChris Doll: 82:59 Thank you, Emma, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the IR department if you have questions\nOperator: 83:06 This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Richard Stein",
            "content": "68:11 Yeah. Hey. It's Richard. Let me start with the last one. From a consumer standpoint, we're actually not seeing signs of acceleration. If you think about where the excess liquidity certainly to the top 70% of that went to the top 20% of income households that liquidity has been sticking around for our customer base and again, we're prime and super-prime. And activity really haven't -- we really haven't seen a shift in activity with respect to behavior changes in terms of that excess liquidity running off faster than we expected. In fact it's running off a little slower than we expected as people continue to strike the right balance across their lifestyles. 68:40 From a delinquency standpoint, we're at such a low level and this links to change for us was really in commercial. We're at such a low level, but it just takes one or two to slip over the quarter to change the percentage. So, we're really not seeing any trends. In terms of that would be alarming, that would -- that points us to an acceleration of the normalization across credit, whether it's consumer or commercial I think areas we're watching. Clearly, we continue to watch the leverage space, particularly enterprise value lending that's an area that we've been very disciplined on and we were happy with the portfolio. But that's a place where we continue to exercise discipline. 69:27 There is a handful of segments and CRE. Office is one that we're watching long term just given -- just given the structural changes in that space, but we focus on quality Class A properties, gateway cities. It's all very good stuff. And then, there's -- we're watching consumer products and manufacturing and senior living in a couple of more places where, look, we're watching as places where the ability to pass through cost increase, maybe a little harder. We haven't seen evidence of that at least at this point most people been able to pass cost increases through, but that's where we're watching."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Timothy Spence",
            "content": "07:52 Good morning to you all. Thank you, Greg for the kind words . I'm honored to serve as Fifth Third's next CEO and to follow-on the footsteps of an incredible leader like you. I could be more excited about Fifth Third's future. Given my role in the company over the past several years and the strength of our performance, you should expect continuity in our strategic focus areas and then how we run the bank. We will maintain our operational focus, expense discipline and culture of accountability to produce consistent financial results while investing for the future. We will continue to anticipate and respond proactively to demand shifts and new competitive threats, consistent with the actions you have seen us take over the past several years, including our deliberate multi-year reduction in punitive consumer fees before it became an industry topic, the rollout of our award-winning Momentum Banking product suite, which is unparalleled among peers, our differentiated digitally enabled treasury management services to automate accounts payable and receivable launched well before the pandemic. 08:53 Partnerships and acquisitions of FinTech platforms like Provide and Dividend Finance that create national scale and a best-in-class customer experience and our focus on financing renewable energy well before ESG became a mainstream term. More broadly, we will remain mindful of the long-term structural shifts taking place such as the evolving geopolitical environments, population aging, government debt levels and central bank tightening that will create winners and losers over the next decade. No one knows for sure what the world will look like 10 years from now, but it's prudent risk managers we are always contemplating the many potential tail risks, as well as positioning the bank to take advantage of potential business opportunities that will arise. We will also be steadfast in our belief that we are most successful when we take care of all our stakeholders. 09:44 To that end, yesterday, we announced that we are increasing our minimum wage to $20 an hour across our footprint and that concurrently we will provide a mid-year wage increase to employees in our first four job bands. We are taking these actions despite having best-in-class employee retention according to leading research because we recognize that rising costs throughout the economy have a disproportionate impact on our frontline employees who are the face of Fifth Third. In total, more than 40% of our workforce will benefit from these increases, including 95% of our retail branch and operations employees. It is simply the right thing to do. 10:21 In the short term, this will result in roughly $18 million in the incremental annualized expenses. However, as we have seen with our two previous wage increases, we fully expect to achieve stronger financial outcomes from lower turnover, improved workforce quality, lower recruiting expenses and more effective training. As Greg mentioned, our balance sheet and earnings power are extremely strong. From a capital deployment perspective, we will continue to favor organic growth, evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities such as Provide and Dividend Finance paying a strong dividend and then share repurchases. Practically speaking given our robust loan growth, we currently anticipate resuming share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2022. 11:07 On behalf of the entire leadership team, I would like to say thank you to our employees. I'm very proud that in addition to producing solid financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. I also hope you all feel the same sense of pride that I do in being part of an organization that was just named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, one of just five banks globally. Fifth Third is a great company, because we have great people who live our core values every day. 11:39 With that, I will turn it over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook. 30:50 Thank you. 35:51 Yeah. Erika, as it pertains to your question for me, I'm excited about a lot. We are in as good a shape as Fifth Third has been at any point since I have been around the company, including the several years that I spent outside the bank as a consultant to the bank and Greg. And I think we have assembled to really outstanding bench of leadership talent, right. We talk a lot about experience being a team sport here. So you have deeply experienced folks from inside the company, you have folks who have joined from outside the bank who brought in fresh perspectives and it really helped us to think about how we shape the business going forward. 36:34 And if you think about the long-term objective, we set for ourselves, which is to outperform through the cycle. I think all the pieces parts are in place. We have a great culture of expense discipline. We've inculcated a credit discipline that will support through the cycle performance. We have been investing continuously. I think sometimes maybe we haven't got an enough credit for it because we have essentially been harvesting expenses in some areas and redeploying them and grow. And the byproduct of that is, we have a really excellent footprint and a nice balance between the Southeast and the Midwest. And we're seeing bloom coming for many of the investments we've made in digital capabilities. I think, in particular, with a focus on product innovation, right, whether that is Momentum Banking and the differentiation that, that is Provide and supported has provided to our household growth goals where the managed services, which as Greg mentioned in his prepared remarks that help to really drive the right balance in fees to total revenue. 37:33 And then I think last but certainly not least the benefits we're going to continue to see from the acquisitions that Provide and Dividend in terms of providing sustainable loan growth was really attractive ROAs. So, I do have lots to feel good about here. 46:00 Yeah. Sure. Betsy. This is Tim. Thanks for the question. So I think you have to think about our C&I business is being the corporate banking business and the middle market business. So I think, very clearly the corporate banking side of the business that rising utilization there is at least in part a byproduct of the capital markets having been influx and I do anticipate that as the markets are opened up and that folks that we bank who are issuers on a regular basis. Go back into them that you'll see more fee income and then in turn a little bit less utilization. But there is no question inventory build there. Core middle market, I think there is still room to run on inventory build but there is no question that the catalyst for us in terms of our own growth has been now that the focus on CapEx in particular, investments that are going to drive labor productivity or at a minimum, a reduction in labor requirements. 47:00 And then in addition to that we have benefited now and are continuing to benefit from what was a record pace of adding new quality relationships. Last year, which is carried over into the first quarter that Jamie and Greg and I were laughing before the call. It's really, it's the 4Cs for us at Cincinnati, Chicago, the Carolinas and California plus Tennessee and we couldn't figure out how to get to fee out of that one, but that drove the outperformance and C&I production in the first quarter. 47:36 Yeah. There you got Tennessee, exactly. 54:53 Yeah. And moving forward towards, I concur with all that, I think we said for a long time that we don't believe that scale is an and in another itself and that certainly will be consistent in terms of our point of view on how we proceed. As it pertains to your questions about technology, you can think about the investments that we have been making and basically three areas. One is, just the core infrastructure, right. We talked a lot about data centers. We've talked a lot about the cloud data strategy. We talked a lot about information security and otherwise. I think we feel very good about where we're at on that front. We are making good progress. I can't remember the cricket analogy, Simon have to go with middle innings, but we are in the platform modernization front, okay. And I think feel very good about the migration away from legacy mainframe platforms and on the platforms that allow us to spend a lot more of our money on new application development as opposed to maintenance and service. 55:54 And then I think the thing that's probably been less, there has been under emphasized in our industry in general, but which is a big point of focus for ours. We are believers that the more fundamental disruption associated with the Internet in all sectors, is the way that it informs product and product innovation. So that is the area where I think we will continue to look to differentiate. We have to be good at all of the other items. There are hygiene factors, but it's the opportunities to leverage technology to change the nature of the value proposition that we have for our customers. The way that we did with Momentum Banking when we launched a year ago. And as we continue to hone and refine and add feature functionality to that platform. The things that the folks have provide have done over time that they -- where they have actually been able to accelerate the amount of innovation that they brought to market. We launched five or six new products within the first six months that they were on board and they had gotten two or three out in the prior few years beforehand. And then the managed services, which are obviously a critical platform for us and which provide really stable and high margin fee income. 57:33 Thank you. 62:22 Gerard, if I were to add on adding Jamie referenced credit, we've come out of a period here where the dynamic around rates as I think really obscured the importance of funding quality. And it just given the way that reporting gets done, it's probably hard to tell from the outside looking in, how good the funding base is, and that doesn't just extend the banks, it's the non-banks as well, right. So as the Fed tightens, I think there is going to be more differentiation and maybe the market fully appreciates as it relates to the stability and the quality your funding base and the banks who have done the things that we've tried to do in terms of growing primary relationships and what the focus on core operational deposits should be much better positioned to whether an environment where liquidity maybe is, there is a premium attached to it unlike the environment that we really have come out of over the course of the past handful years. 75:11 No. Look like, I think it's a mix of both the nice thing about our sector is there really is a very active technology vendor community and it gives you a lot of choices about how you want to run the business. I don't think we're ever going to be all in bucket A or bucket B. We're big believers that where there is an industry utilities that drives very limited customer differentiation and where there is a benefit to shared scale it makes sense to ride on the rails that are available and where there is an opportunity to differentiate and/or in the aspect of the business that's deeply proprietary that it's got to be managed and maintained in-house. So I think you're going to see us take a best of blend approach as it relates to those two areas. But with a heavy focus on owning the tech platforms in the products which are customer facing and probably comparatively a lighter emphasis on that as it relates to the back office where you're talking about a scaled utility that's processing credits and debits as opposed to something that's more strategic our proprietary to business. 77:53 Mike, the metric that I think I'm really -- the metrics I'd really chiefly focused on how to deal with the resiliency of our environment.

            "name": "James Leonard",
            "content": "11:46 Thank you, Tim and thank all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were solid despite the market volatility during the quarter. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories, deployed excess liquidity into securities at attractive entry points and grew deposits. Expenses were once again well controlled, but fees underperformed our January expectations due to the market environment. 12:13 Improvements in credit quality resulted in an ACL ratio of 180 basis points compared to 185 basis points last quarter, while an increase in loan balances resulted in the net of $11 million increase to our credit reserves. Combined with another quarter muted net charge-offs, we had a $45 million total provision for credit losses. 12:37 Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion was stable sequentially. Reported results were impacted by lower day count, lower PPP income including a slowdown in forgiveness that resulted in $10 million less than expected PPP related NII, and the expected decline in residential mortgage balances from previous Ginnie Mae purchases. These detriments were offset by the benefit from the deployment of excess liquidity into securities, strong loan growth and the impact of higher market rates. 13:13 Excluding PPP, NII increased 1% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Total reported non-interest income decreased 9% compared to the year ago quarter, or 7% on an adjusted basis. Similar to peers, our results were impacted by lower capital markets revenue, primarily due to transaction delays, as well as lower mortgage revenue in light of lower origination volumes and gain on sale margins, partially offset by improving MSR asset decay. 13:40 We generated solid year-over-year fee growth in treasury management and wealth and asset management where we produced net AUM inflows again this quarter. Consumer deposit fees were stable as our success generating household growth, offset that continued decline in punitive consumer fees as part of our Momentum Banking offering. 14:08 Non-interest expenses increased just 1% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting continued discipline throughout the company. Compensation expenses were well controlled with the year-over-year increase reflecting the previously announced broad-based restricted equity awards, which will support the continuation of our strong employee retention. We also continue to invest in the ongoing modernization of our tech platforms. These items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to 2021's contract renegotiations. 14:45 Adjusted expenses increased 2% sequentially, driven by the special equity award and the usual seasonal increase in compensation and benefits expense. Our expenses this quarter included a mark-to-market benefit associated with non-qualified deferred compensation plans of $12 million with a corresponding offset in securities losses. 15:09 Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 4% sequentially. Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 2% compared to the prior quarter as strength in auto originations combined with growth in residential mortgage was partially offset by declines in home equity and other consumer loan balances, primarily from GreenSky balance runoff. 15:37 Average commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 5% compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting growth in C&I loans. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased 6% with C&I loans, up 8%. Commercial loan production remains strong and in-line with our original expectations. Production was strongest in core middle market, which was well diversified geographically, which increased over 60% year-over-year. 16:09 Our production and pipelines continued to reflect our strategic investments in talent and our successful geographic expansion, as we sustained our record pace in adding new quality relationships during the first quarter. With muted payoffs and higher revolver utilization rates reflecting the capital market slowdown, period endcommercial loans excluding PPP increased 5% sequentially, and 13% compared to the year ago quarter. Over half of the sequential period end growth was due to existing revolvers with the utilization rate increasing 2% to 35.5%. 16:50 Given the market opportunities in the first quarter, we began deploying excess cash to protect against the rising risk of an economic downturn. During the first quarter, we grew our securities portfolio approximately $13 billion. On an average basis, securities increased $5 billion, or 13% sequentially. As we have said over the past two years, our balance sheet positioning allowed us to remain patient and not grow the portfolio at historically low interest rates caused by the extraordinary Federal Reserve intervention. 17:27 The past 90 days have absolutely validated our decision to patiently wait, but our actions this quarter and beyond will ensure our strong through the cycle performance under various rate scenarios over the long term. Our investments continue to focus on adding duration and structure to the portfolio with stable and predictable cash flows. Consequently, our overall allocation to bullet and locked-out structures increased from 59% to 64% at quarter end. 17:59 Average other short-term investments, which includes our interest-bearing cash decreased $6 billion, reflecting the growth in loans and securities, partially offset by continued core deposit growth. Compared to the year ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits increased 5% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 11%, reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. We once again added households in every market compared to last year led by our key Southeast markets. 18:34 Moving to credit. As Greg mentioned, our credit performance this quarter was once again strong with NPAs at 47 basis points and net charge-offs at 12 basis points. We continue to closely monitor areas where inflation and higher rates may cause stress. As Greg also mentioned we have deliberately reduced our highly monitored leveraged loan portfolio for this very reason, which is now below $3 billion in outstanding's. while also significantly improving the quality of the portfolio. 19:09 Moving to the ACL. Our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains stable with unemployment ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.7%. We maintained our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Our ACL build this quarter reflected strong loan growth and a worsening downside economic scenario, partially offset by improvements in the credit risk profile of the loan portfolio, including a reduction in borrowers and prolonged distress. 19:49 If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $1.1 billion higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $236 million lower. While our base case expectations point to continued economic growth, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, including escalating geopolitical tensions, which could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strained supply chains, pressures from the Fed's quantitative tightening or additional COVID variants, which could play out given the uncertain environment. Our March 31st allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment. 20:41 Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.3%, above our stated target of 9%. The decline in capital was primarily due to strong RWA growth in light of the robust organic business opportunities and securities purchases combined with an 8 basis point impact from the CECL capital transition rule. We expect to close the acquisition of Dividend Finance in the second quarter, which will deploy approximately 30 basis points of capital. Our tangible book value per share excluding AOCI increased 1% during the quarter and 5% compared to the year ago quarter. 21:27 Moving to our current outlook, which includes the financial impacts from Dividend Finance. We expect full year average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021 including the expected headwinds from PPP and the Ginnie Mae forbearance loans we added last year. Excluding these items, we expect total average loan growth of around 10% reflecting strong pipelines, sales force additions, the Dividend and Provide acquisitions and stable commercial revolver utilization rates over the remainder of the year. This should result in commercial loan growth of 9% to 10%, or 15% to 16% excluding PPP. 22:15 We now expect total average consumer loans to be stable in 2022, reflecting our first quarter decision to lower auto loan production in order to enhance our returns on capital. We now expect around $8 billion in auto and specialty production for the full year, which will still result in double-digit growth in indirect consumer secured balances in 2022. Our outlook also assumes modest growth in other consumer loans, reflecting the benefits of Dividend Finance, partially offset by a 20% decline in GreenSky loans. 22:56 On a sequential basis, we expect second quarter average total loan growth of 2% to 3% comprised of 3% to 4% commercial balance growth and stable consumer balances. We expect 5% to 6% average C&I growth in the second quarter, excluding PPP. We expect our average securities portfolio to increase approximately $10 billion in the second quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made later in the first quarter combined with the assumption that we have $2 billion more in balances given the market opportunities we have seen through early April. We also assume $1 billion in additional securities growth in both the third and fourth quarter. 23:48 Given our outlook for earning asset growth combined with the implied forward curve as of April 1st, we now expect full year NII to increase approximately 13% to 14%. It is worth noting that our outlook incorporates the impacts from the run-off of the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios, which resulted in a $220 million headwind this year. Excluding those portfolios, NII growth would exceed 18%. Our current outlook assumes stable to slight growth in deposit balances in 2022 compared to 2021 with continued strong growth in consumer deposits in the mid-single digits offset by the expected run off of non-operational commercial deposits. 24:43 We expect deposit betas of around 15% on the first 125 basis points of Fed rate hikes. The 25 basis points, we saw in March combined with another 50 basis points in both May and June. While we remain confident in the quality of our deposit base, the rapid and aggressive policy response by the Fed to curb inflation, including the potential for 10 rate hikes from March 2022 to March 2023 and aggressive Fed balance sheet reductions. We expect deposit betas of approximately 25% over the first 200 basis points this cycle compared to the mid-30s last cycle. The ultimate impact to NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate movements, balance sheet management strategies including securities growth and hedging transactions, and realized deposit betas. 25:46 For the second quarter, we expect NII to be up 11% to 13% sequentially, reflecting strong loan growth, the impact of securities purchases and the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet. We expect adjusted non-interest income to be stable to down 1% in 2022 compared to our prior expectations of up 3% to 5%. This change is primarily driven by the change in our rate outlook. The single biggest line contributing to the change as deposit service charges, which is reflective of incremental earnings credits in light of the higher interest rate environment. The rate environment has also impacted our outlook for mortgage revenue, which we now expect to be down 10% or so in 2022 compared to 2021. 26:39 We continue to expect strong but slightly lower than January expectations in commercial banking fees and private equity income in 2022 provided resolutions of the temporary delays experienced in the first quarter occur. It is worth noting that even with the decline and expected fee income primarily due to the interest rate environment, we expect total revenue to now be approximately $275 million more than our January guidance. 27:12 We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 8% to 9% compared to the first quarter or down around 1% compared to the year ago quarter. We expect full year adjusted non-interest expense to be stable on a standalone basis, or up 1% to 2% including the impact of Dividend Finance compared to 2021, which is an improvement from our previous guidance of up to 2% to 3%. We continue to strategically invest in our franchise, which should result in low double-digit growth in both technology and marketing expenses. 27:52 Our outlook also assumes we add 25 new branches primarily in our high growth Southeast markets. Our guidance also incorporates the minimum wage increase to $20 per hour that Tim mentioned. We expect these investments in our people, platforms and franchise to be partially offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives, reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in leasing expense given our disposition of LaSalle Business Solutions, which was completed in April and our continued overall expense discipline throughout the company. 28:35 We expect total adjusted expenses in the second quarter to be down around 3% to 4% compared to the first quarter, which is up 2% compared to the year ago quarter, due to the acquisitions of Provide and Dividend Finance or stable on a stand-alone basis. As a result, our full-year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth is expected to significantly exceed the growth in expenses, resulting in nearly 3.5 points of improvement in the efficiency ratio. 29:12 Our outlook for significantly delivering on our positive operating leverage commitment reflects our recent acquisitions expense discipline and strong balance sheet management. It also considers the known revenue headwinds from PPP and our Ginnie Mae portfolio. We continue to expect second quarter and full year 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20 basis points to 25 basis points range. 29:37 In summary, we continue to take actions to further strengthen our balance sheet positioning for this environment. We are deploying excess cash prudently into both loans and securities to support continued through the cycle-out performance and have a lot of momentum in our businesses to have a very successful 2022. 29:57 With that let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. 31:30 So it's a good question and thanks for asking, Scott, I probably should have included it in my prepared remarks, but I have recalibrated our excess liquidity given the first quarter's activity to where we're sitting on about $15 billion of excess cash here in April. I still like the one-third, one-third, one-third approach, where perhaps a third of it runs off in the commercial deposit book is the Fed starts to move in 50 basis point increments. And then, a third in additional security purchases, so $5 billion more during the course of this year. And then, obviously, the rest in loan growth especially with Dividend coming on board, where we expect continued nice loan growth throughout the year. 32:46 Yeah. The puts and takes this quarter relative to the January guide really is the interplay of the rate environment between fees and NII, whereas expenses, the main driver of the improved expense base on a stand-alone basis was really the fulfillment costs and related compensation related to the lower fees, but the rest of the franchise in our approach to managing expenses during the year really hasn't changed from when we started the year. We continue to focus on technology investments and supporting our marketing efforts and so the marketing spend is actually a little bit higher as we look out at the year given the strong growth, we've had in consumer household acquisitions and the Momentum Banking product. Obviously, the minimum wage adjustment was a little bit of an uptick in expenses, but again offset by some of the savings from the lower fee guide. So overall, I think the approach remains the same, which has continued to invest in the business and continue to let that strong momentum show up in the rest of the balance sheet activities. 38:35 I think, I can take the next hour of this call and go through those but this tells you how difficult question it is. Jump in if I don't touch on all aspects of it, but I guess, I would start with saying and maybe I'm fighting a losing battle on this one, but I do struggle with the concept of fair valuing one line item of the balance sheet, but not the rest of it or not evaluating HTM in combination with AFS because philosophically for me, as a category four bank. Our election to put a security in the AFS or HTM doesn't change the economics or the risk of the investment. And I understand, the largest banks there is value in minimizing the risk of the regulatory capital volatility, but for us, well below $700 billion in assets, we believe the benefits of maintaining the flexibility to manage the portfolio as the environment unfolds or our outlook changes create significant value. 39:42 And you've seen that over the last eight years where we've had the number one performing investment portfolio yield in the industry. So I struggle with the concept of what our company be worth more if I place the securities into the Roche Motel of HTM or if I maintained by flexibility in my optionality and put it in AFS, but I understand that's how the valuation work. Our goal is always to optimize the balance sheet to deliver long-term real economic value and not make decisions, but optimize accounting outcome over economic value. So that's why we continue to pull it all of the securities and AFS because we like the optionality. In terms of what we're buying -- the second part of your question, we do like the bullet and locked-out cash flow structure so that there is a minimal extension risk in that security relative to RMBS. Probably the best example for the generalist on that would be our duration was 4.8 years at the end of the year and it moved to 5.4 years at the end of this quarter. All of that duration extension was because of the securities that we purchased, we averaged 2.5 yield and 6.5 year duration on what we purchased. So all of our duration extension was intentional and we prefer to add duration when we want to add it as opposed to the market foreseeing that duration extension upon us and that's really the value of the bullet and the locked-out cash flow. And I'll sacrifice a little bit of yield in a base environment but I protect the volatility on up rates or down rates and that's really the philosophy of managing the investment portfolio. 42:14 Yeah. I looked at it Mike is, I had a $35 billion of excess cash, I bought 13 of additional leverage in the quarter. Got about 15 left, net of loan growth for second quarter purchases and additional cash deployment as the year progresses. And I think to Scott's question early on, there is an opportunity to perhaps that other $5 billion of run-off in deposits doesn't occur as offset by growth in other areas, but for now that's how we see the year playing out. 45:23 Good morning. 48:03 Yeah. We certainly expect the loan-to-deposit ratio to what I'll say improve get higher. We finished the quarter at 69% and really the interaction between the loan-to-deposit ratio and the deposit betas is obviously, highly correlated. And as we entered the last tightening cycle at third, we were in the mid-90s. So we don't expect to get that high in this over the next couple of years, but we certainly would like to manage the company in the 80s from a loan-to-deposit ratio, but it will take a little bit time to get there. I think from a deposit activity standpoint, we expect continued strong consumer deposit growth and then we're forecasting and perhaps it's conservative, a run-off in the non-operational deposits within the commercial book is, we're just not going to chase rate sensitive non-relationship deposit balances. 49:06 But with that said, I really like the balance sheet that we've put together over the last seven years where we've really improved the primacy within the consumer book as well as the granularity through the household growth along with the improvements in the operational deposits through our strong treasury management business. I know we've talked about at different conferences over the course of the year the strength of our TM business, but that ultimately will pay off as rates start to rise and we can perhaps manage to a lower beta in the next 200 basis points than what we saw with the start of the 2015 hikes. 49:54 I'm sorry, I couldn't... 50:02 Yeah. 50:44 Yes. We expect the investment yields to be in the 2.75 area in the second quarter as well as for the full year, which is up, obviously from the guide we had in January in the 2.60 to 2.70 range. 51:25 It's predominantly the fulfillment costs within mortgage and incentives in the other businesses that were impacted by the lower fee outlook. And then, partially offset by the higher marketing expenses and the minimum wage increase impact. 51:54 Correct. Yeah. 57:17 We did not, but it's baked into the $5 billion of outflow that we're assuming occurs during the course of the year. So, sorry, I didn't answer that more clearly with Betsy's question. 58:13 Yeah, Matt. It's Jamie. Thanks for the question. The C&I spreads or definitely stabilized during the course of the first quarter, such that the C&I yields ex-PPP were only down 4 basis points as opposed to some of the double-digit types of declines you saw in other quarters. So we feel good about stabilization of loan yields. And in fact for the balance sheet hitting an inflection point in the second quarter for pretty much every asset class, but yields and spreads should be improving as we go forward from here. 59:19 Yeah. I think C&I spreads in the second quarter stable flat and then improvement perhaps as we get to the back end of the second quarter heading into the second half of the year, given some of the disruption in the capital markets and the spread widening from the geopolitical tensions, that's how we have a model going forward. 61:07 I think a year from now and really the value that we see from our actions this quarter is just how well positioned our balance sheet is to perform well through the cycle both from an NII perspective and a credit perspective. And I think perhaps there was some concern that we have waited too long and miss the opportunity. And I think the good news from today's release is that we are well positioned and well protected to the possibility of recession in 2023 or 2024, not that that's our base case, but certainly something that we're mindful of and we pride ourselves and really under Greg's leadership over the last seven years of being good risk managers and that's how we approach thanks for that show that downturn occur. We're well positioned to be a strong performer. But should we continue to see good economic growth, but this is a company that's positioned to do well with generating high returns, high PPNR growth and really do well through the cycle. 63:57 Yes. And that is included in our NII guide as well for the year. 64:56 Yeah, John. Thanks for the question. There are a lot of competing factors on where the betas shake out. We think the overwhelming factor for the industry is the amount of liquidity is signified by the loan to deposit ratio and the industry being 20% better than they were at the end of 2015, heading into the last cycle, but you're certainly right the level of competition ultimately dictates the deposit betas, we just think the industry is so much better positioned now that the level of that competition should be less. So from an industry perspective, we think that should win out but then if we're wrong then let's talk about it on an idiosyncratic basis for Fifth Third, what we've been able to accomplish with the primacy and operational deposits and the treasury management business has translated for us what we believe should be a lower beta on the first 200 -- at the 35 last time, 25 this time. But with that said, 90 days ago, we were modeling a 20 beta on those first 200. So we have raised our own expectations a bit. Hopefully, we will do better than that, but possibility that we would not 25% beta is what we've settled in our outlook in the up 200. 66:31 When you break it down by customer segment, obviously the wealth and asset management area as a highly price sensitive portfolio whereas for us the improvement won't be as much in that portfolio as it is in the commercial business because of the treasury management. And then in the retail book if the value exchange with the free services that you receive in Momentum Banking, we believe should result in a little bit lower beta this time around so that we're not competing on rate for the retail customer, but rather the value exchange with those other services, then including things like less punitive fees, the NSF elimination and all of the other structural changes we made to our product lineup should result in a better beta of the cycle. But if by chance, we are wrong. I think we're well positioned to be able to compete well regardless of how that plays out. 70:36 Yeah. The disruption in the first quarter definitely impacted the debt capital markets groups with the loan syndications and the corporate bond fees. For us within the commercial banking, it's a pretty good split between FRM products where we're helping customers with hedging called out a third of the business, a little bit more than that amount in investment banking revenue and then the remainder within some of the lending fee categories that an aggregate to the total. So, what we've seen is that FRM has done better that we originally expected, but that investment banking category within corporate bond and loan syndication and branch fees performed worse than expectations, so that's the mix there. The guide for the year includes some assumption that's markets stabilize and reopen and should that not happen and we would just have more of that interplay between NII and fees. So that at the end of the day I will still feel good about the revenue generation of the company. 72:08 Yeah. So Dividend Finance will show up in other consumer loans, unlike Provide that did show up in C&I. So you'll see Provide's benefit is in the C&I guide and Dividend Finance's and other consumer loans category. 72:53 We do expect contraction with our outlook of the Fed balance sheet as they potentially begin the sell down in June, announced that in May. I guess ultimately, the variable to our outlook would be, if they were to move significantly faster than perhaps you have a little bit more deposit outflow or higher deposit betas than what's expected, but it would have to be pretty quick and significant action on their part to implement the quantitative tightening more so than what we've got baked in. So I think ultimately it will play out, okay. 73:44 Correct. Yeah."

            "content": "01:27 Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported first quarter net income of $494 million or $0.68 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.02 impact from the Visa total return swap, the mark-to-market impact over to AvidXchange Holdings. 01:43 Excluding these items, adjusted first quarter earnings were $0.70 per share. During the quarter, we generated strong loan growth, including average C&I growth of up 8%, excluding PPP. We grew core deposits once again with strength in consumer transaction deposits of 4% reflecting our success in generating quality household growth, which increased 3% on a year-over-year basis. 02:09 We also took advantage of attractive market entry points for deploying our excess cash that grew our securities portfolio by approximately $5 billion on an average basis. As a result of our interest-earning asset growth, net interest income increased 1% sequentially, excluding PPP. We had yet another quarter of benign credit quality, reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting, which resulted in near record low charge-offs of just 12 basis points. In addition to our muted credit losses, NPA remained stable, our commercial criticized assets continued to improve. 02:48 As many of you saw last week, I announced my plans to retire as CEO and transition to Executive Chairman effective July 5th. As part of our thorough succession planning process, I'm excited and proud to announce the Board has unanimously appointed Tim Spence to succeed me as our next CEO. I believe this is the right time for a transition, given Fifth Third's tremendous financial health and performance. Shareholders who have follow Fifth Third for a while, know that when I became CEO, I made a commitment that we would generate strong financial results and performed well through the various business cycles, we improvised our plans on a project North Star, we articulated several key strategic priorities generate strong and sustainable long-term financial results, including optimizing our balance sheet, differentiating our customer experience, growing and diversifying our fee revenues, building on our legacy of digital innovation and maintaining expense discipline. I am very proud of what we achieved. 03:49 We transformed our approach to credit-risk management, centralizing credit underwriting with geographic sector and product level concentration limits. We exited commercial relationships that had a skewed risk return profile totaling $7 billion focusing on high quality relationships with a more diversified and resilient businesses. We deliberately reduced our leverage lending exposure down more than 6% since 2015. 04:16 We remain cautious with respect to our CRE portfolio, with the lowest CRE as a percentage of capital among peers. We maintained our expense discipline, taking actions when necessary, including exiting non-core businesses, which allowed us to prioritize our investments in areas of strategic importance. We invested heavily in our treasury management systems, shifting our focus to building managed service platforms. As a result, we now have the highest TM fees as a percentage of revenue and commitments, and we are the fastest growing among our peers. 04:50 We made significant investments in technology to improve our resiliency and better serve our customers. We build a consumer business that has consistently added households far in excess of our peers in the U.S. average, while also taking our customers' satisfaction scores from below peer median in 2015 to top quartile today. We grew market share organically in the Southeast and West Coast and established a leading position in Chicago through the strategic acquisition of MB Financial. 05:20 We also invested in strategic nonbank acquisitions like Provide, Dividend, Coker Capital, H2C, Franklin Street and more, to accelerate growth and broaden our capabilities. We structure our security portfolio to generate stable, predictable cash flows that has allowed us to extend in our earnings advantage versus peers. And we focus on generating sustainable value for all stakeholders, including customers, employees and communities. 05:49 From day one, my focus was to build a franchise that would perform well through the cycle, while generating consistent and quality earnings quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. While some of these decisions impact the near-term profitability at the time, all of these proof points highlight the actions we have taken over the past several years to improve Fifth Third and set us up for long-term outperformance through various business cycles. 06:13 Furthermore, we expect our intentionally asset-sensitive balance sheet to perform extremely well relative to peers in this rate environment. With the revenue benefits of higher rates for August, we are mindful that there are likely to be elevated risk in the overall U.S. economy, which is a fairly aggressively tightens monetary policy the curb inflation, combined with the existing supply chain constraints and labor shortages . However, because of our actions and positioning Fifth Third is a strong as ever and well positioned for long-term outperformance. 06:45 I would just like to say that being the CEO of Fifth Third has been an honor of a lifetime. I'm grateful for the support of the board and all of our employees and I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished. Fifth Third is in great shape and Tim is well prepared to lead Fifth Third into the future. Tim is an outstanding and visionary leader. He is been an integral part of Fifth Third's leadership team since 2015, helping develop strategies and vision that we are executing with excellence through innovation and technology. 07:13 Before I hand over to Tim, so this is my 29th and final quarterly earnings call. I can also say that I have enjoyed almost all of these discussions about our financial performance and outlook with the honest investor community. I want to say thank you for your confidence that you have given me for my tenure. Also I want to thank our entire leadership team, I have been extremely fortunate to work with such a great seasoned team, which I believe is the best-in-the-industry. We have accomplished together that has been nothing short of remarkable. Thank you. I know that under Tim's leadership, you will continue do great things, inspire others and improve the lives of our customers and well-being of our communities. 07:50 With that let me turn it over to Tim. 34:44 Thanks for the question. First of all, I think it's really a perfect time for to me to be stepping down as CEO. The bank is in fantastic shape. I became CEO in 2015. The objectives we put in place to be good through cycle, make the changes that lead to for outperformance through the cycle. I feel really good about. So, position of the bank, our business for the future of the success we've had, it's a great time to step aside. Second thing is Tim's readiness. Tim's worked in the bank, six plus years, it's been succession, I think well final succession plan. Tim is absolutely ready and the time is now for him step up given the forms of bank. And third thing is my personal aspiration retire at age 60, which I turned 60 in January and that's always an aspiration mine to be able to be able to do that. And there's a lot of things I want to focus on, lot as travel on the personal side, personal investments and 60 was kind of my timeline also. So that would not have been work if Tim was already in the bank was position as well as also it really came together to right time. 43:23 Absolutely, right. First of all, I think, we accomplished the objectives that I set out for as we talked about and we put project those where in place. I'd like to done more faster you're probably, but you will see an ability of the organization absorbed amount of change that we're bringing forth was important also. So I think we did it the right way it's not a whole lot, I would have changed or done differently. I'm sort of very probably accomplished as Jamie said and Tim said, , it's a team sport and we've got a great organization. We've worked hard to put a great organization and great team around Tim. 43:56 Why Tim, right now? Absolutely, the right person. Tim has a strong technology background. He has been instrumental into other acquisitions and the investments that we've been in this space. He has great, great abilities to look ahead. Understand and assess the challenges that we're going to be faced with now one year, two years, but five years down the road. So you think about our bank needs going forward, strong technology, expertise, but also beneficiary being able to see down the road or with the challenges might be that we're faced with and also execution. Tim is fantastic on the execution side you can be the great visionary, great strategist but if you cannot execute, you are not to be successful. Tim demonstrated over the years especially as present and he can execute extremely, extremely well. Once again, if that wasn't the case, we wouldn't be making this transition at this time. But he is absolutely ready, he is the right person. The reason I just said, I couldn't be more excited. I'm a large shareholder. I'm going to be a large shareholder to have Tim at the helm forward. And I'm excited about starting the next phase of my life, which is retirements of retirement I worked hard to achieve at early age and I think it's just a great, great time for both of us. 52:54 Okay. A lot of questions. Let me get started here. First off, when you think about deploying capital, we have not changed I would think about. Number one is organic growth that's extremely important is the expansion in Southeast and the West Coast, investing in our people, technology, products, services, job one is organic growth, billion quality franchise for the future that performed well. Second, we look at non-bank M&A transactions. So opportunities like Provide, Dividend Finance, H2C, Coker, Franklin will be examples of non-bank opportunities that really add to our products and service capabilities, that's extremely in our reach extremely important to us. We're always looking for those type of opportunities that make us a better bank, and that's number two. 53:36 Number three, more obviously, want to continue to pay a strong dividend. Number four, with excess cash will be share repurchases. Lowering our part would be M&A. Now why is M&A bank M&A lower on our progress of us. Quite frankly, there's not a lot of opportunities out there. And we will believe M&A is a strategy unto itself. We think, M&A is a strategy, which will support our strategic direction. When you look at some of the transactions that we've done recently, we did not participate those type of transactions. So once again if there was an opportunity from a bank M&A perspective, they have to fit into our strategic objectives such as the larger and more relevant the Southeast and attractive markets. There is just not lot of those opportunities that exist today. That's why it's lower in our priority list. It doesn't mean if something did emerge that fits into our strategic direction, makes us more relevant to Southeast in a right markets that we're looking for and is a good cultural fit that we wouldn't consider it. We actually we consider it. It's just lower on our prior list because there is not a lot of opportunities out there that really fit or we should be trying to accomplish that we think are actionable. So that's why it's lower in the list for us. But once again it's something emerge, we will obviously assess that for long-term strategic shareholder value when we consider it. 59:53 Good morning. 72:30 Thank you, Terry. 75:08 Tim is going to answer towards C here. 76:55 Hey, Mike. This is Greg. I don't have concrete numbers for you. When you think about things like data centers it's two. Obviously, we want to be down to two data centers and we're approaching that pretty quickly here. Obviously, we want to make sure we have a hot sight and you get latency on how fast things could travel, it's really mindful that, but that's going to be the case. We think about our core apps around the business something less than we have today. I'm not sure how substantial of the agenda today, but something less we have today. Customer-facing apps as you think about them, when we can build off of common platforms and expand of a common platform very different than the past, there is an open source cloud-based computing that technology enabled us to do things over definitely we have less applications. So less applications for the customer facing side of house somewhat less applications on the back and as we consolidate some of our platforms and vendors, definitely less vendors. And data center we wanted to."

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the conference over to Matt Curoe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatt Curoe: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Fifth Third's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning our Chairman, President, and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Bryan Preston will provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and outlook; our Chief Operating Officer, Jamie Leonard and Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck have also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of January 19, 2024, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\nTimothy Spence: Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe that great banks distinguish themselves based on how they navigate challenging and uncertain operating environment. 2023 was certainly a challenging year for the industry, but I am very pleased with how we measured up. A defensive balance sheet positioning, strong execution, and multiyear strategic investments produce top-quartile profitability, the best core deposit growth, and the best total shareholder return among all regional peers who did not participate in an FDIC-assisted transaction. We generated an all-time record full-year revenue of $8.7 billion. Deposits grew 5% compared to an industry-wide decline of 3%. Credit performance was strong with net charge-offs remaining below historical averages. And although it would be foolish to expect it to repeat forever, in commercial real estate we experienced zero net charge-offs in 2023 and only two basis points in delinquent loans as of early January. These strong outcomes combined with our multi-year expense discipline produced a full-year adjusted return on assets of 1.25% and adjusted return on tangible common equity ex-AOCI of 15.9% and an adjusted efficiency ratio of 55.9%. All among the best of our peers. We also continue to take market share organically by growing our customer base and deepening relationships. We grew consumer households by 3% overall punctuated by 6% growth in the Southeast. In commercial, we added a record number of new quality middle market relationships up 11% over the prior year. As a result, we grew or maintained our deposit market share position in all 40 of our largest MSAs. As we turn the page to 2024, we remain focused on differentiating Fifth Third based on the strength and consistency of our financial performance by prioritizing stability, profitability, and growth in that order. Bryan will take you through the detail on the fourth quarter and our outlook for the year shortly. But before that, I would like to touch on a few points. The first of these is the strength of our balance sheet. Our defensive positioning and decision to move quickly to adapt to proposed regulatory changes have put us in a position to play offense in 2024. Having achieved full Category 1 LCR compliance on August 31st and maintained it since, our liquidity position is very strong. We completed our RWA diet in the fourth quarter and accreted nearly 50 basis points of CET1, putting us on pace to reach a 10.5% CET1 ratio by mid-year 2024. Given our strong earnings profile and the significant rally in interest rates in December, our tangible book value per share grew nearly 30% during the fourth quarter. At the beginning of January, we moved $12.6 billion of securities to held-to-maturity, representing roughly one quarter of our AFS portfolio. We expect this move will de-risk potential AOCI volatility to capital by about 30% in the event that market rates rise again. If the economic outlook remains stable and the capital rules are finalized, no worse than the current NPR. These actions put us in a position to resume share repurchases of up to $300 million to $400 million in the second half of 2024, including $100 million to $200 million as early as the beginning of the third quarter. Should the final rules prove less stringent than the initial proposals, we'll have additional flexibility in deploying excess capital and liquidity to further improve profitability and position Fifth Third for growth. The second point I'd like to highlight is profitability. Expense discipline, strong returns, and positive operating leverage remain core areas of focus for Fifth Third. Supported by our technology modernization investments and a focus on leaning out key value streams, we reduced full-time equivalent employee headcount by 4% from our peak in 2023 to the end of the year without the need for a company-wide expense program. The run rate benefits of these efforts put us in a position to sustain the peer-leading annualized expense growth that we have averaged the past several years, even as we continue to invest for growth. While the carryover effect of the RWA diet makes it unfeasible for the full year, we do anticipate returning to positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024. The third point I'd like to highlight is about growth. Our strategies have been consistent, building out our Southeast markets, producing a strong fee to total revenue mix, and leveraging software that differentiates our product offerings and improves productivity. These are multi-year investments that cannot be replicated easily by competitors to one to two years of hiring a few new branches or small tuck-in acquisitions. In 2023, we opened 37 new branches concentrated in the Southeast, bringing us to 107 opened over the past five years. We plan to open another 31 branches in the Southeast in 2024. As a portfolio, these branches have continued to outperform our expectations on both household acquisition and deposit growth and should provide a tailwind for several years forward. We also continue to invest in treasury management, wealth and asset management, and capital markets. All three of these businesses grew for us in 2023. We expect mid-to-high single-digit growth in each in 2024. In treasury management, our acquisitions of Rize and Big Data Healthcare and the launch of Newline, our embedded payments business, should continue to support peer-leading performance. In wealth and asset management, Global Finance recently named our Private Bank as the Best US Regional Private Bank for the fifth consecutive year and Best Private Bank for Entrepreneurs globally for the first time. In our capital markets business, we have seen more robust activity levels to start the year, including an M&A pipeline that is 1.5 times the full-year revenue target embedded in our guidance. Overall, we expect 2024 to be a solid year of improving revenue trends and continued to expense discipline. Given what we believe to be a less certain outlook than the markets would imply, we are positioned to perform well under a range of economic and interest rate scenarios. Before, I hand it over to Bryan, I want to say thank you to our employees for hustling to deliver great results in 2023 and for the job you do every day to take care of our customers and communities. You make our company a special place for this. With that, I'll now turn it over to Bryan to provide additional details on our fourth quarter results and our current outlook for 2024.\nBryan Preston: Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. 2023 was a very different year than what we were expecting 12 months ago. For Fifth Third, our success in outperforming this year was driven by our intentional actions to create and maintain flexibility for navigating uncertainty. As we enter 2024, we are very pleased with the results from 2023 and how we continue to be well-positioned for a wide range of economic outcomes. We have optionality in our balance sheet and diversification on our business mix that will allow us to adapt to changing environments. As Tim mentioned, achieving this positioning requires discipline and years of deliberate investments. Our full-year financial performance in 2023 benefited from this long-term investment. Fifth Third delivered industry-leading deposit growth of 5%, record revenue of $8.7 billion, and 100 basis points of capital accretion during the year, all while maintaining expense and credit discipline. We delivered another solid quarter to end the year. Adjusting for the FDIC special assessment and the other discrete items listed on page two of our release, return on assets was 1.3%, RoTCE was 17%, and our efficiency ratio was 55%. Additionally, we completed our risk-weighted asset diet in the fourth quarter, which reduced RWA by 3%, which was a little more than we previously estimated. The diet combined with our strong earnings led to a nearly 50 basis point increase in CET1 during the quarter, which ended at 10.3%. This capital accretion combined with the rally in market rates during the fourth quarter resulted in our pro forma CET1 ratio including the AOCI impact from unrealized losses on AFS securities, increasing to 7.7% at year-end, well above the 7% minimum. Net interest income for the quarter was $1.4 billion, which was consistent with our expectations. While NII continues to be impacted by the increasing cost of deposits, due to higher market interest rates. We've been able to build a robust liquidity position by generating peer-leading core deposit growth. Our core interest-bearing deposit costs increased 24 basis points sequentially, reflecting a cycle-to-date interest-bearing core deposit beta of 54% in the fourth quarter. We believe maintaining significant liquidity on balance sheet. It's a prudent decision given the uncertain economic and regulatory environments. Our short-term investments, which are primarily comprised of our cash at the Fed increased $8.6 billion in the fourth quarter on an average basis and drove all of the 13 basis points sequential decrease in NIM. Excluding the impacts of securities gains losses and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income increased 3% sequentially due to the growth in commercial banking, mortgage, wealth, and card and processing revenues. As well as the normal fourth quarter impact of the CRA. The growth in commercial banking fees was driven by strong institutional brokerage and improved corporate bond fees, partially offset by lower lease from marketing revenue. Fourth quarter non-interest income was also impacted by the decision to eliminate our extended overdraft fee, which was the driver of the decrease in service charges on deposits. Compared to the prior year, non-interest income decreased 3%, primarily due to a $25 million reduction in CRA revenue. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 2% sequentially, primarily driven by the impact of the non-qualified deferred compensation mark-to-market, which is mostly offset in securities gains losses. Excluding the impact of the NQDC mark, which was a $17 million expense in the fourth quarter compared to a $5 million benefit in the prior quarter, expenses were flat sequentially. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter expenses were down 1%, which reflects our ongoing commitment to expense discipline, Tim mentioned earlier. Moving to the balance sheet. As expected, total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 2% sequentially. Most significantly driven by the 3% decrease in average total commercial loans. Our corporate banking business experienced the biggest reduction due to the RWA diet. With period-end, corporate banking total commitments decreasing 6% and unused commitments decreasing 4%. Period end, the commercial revolver utilization rate was 35%, a 1% decrease from the prior quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially due to our intentional pullback in indirect auto and the overall slowdown in the residential mortgage originations given the rate environment, partially offset by growth from dividend finance. Average core deposits increased 3% sequentially, driven by the growth in interest checking, money market and customer CD balances. DDA migration is showing signs of deceleration with fourth quarter showing the smallest dollar decline in DDA balances since the onset of the rate hiking cycle, even when adjusting for normal seasonal strength at year-end. DDA as a percent of core deposits were 26% for the quarter compared to 28% in the prior quarter. In addition to the migration impact, this measure is negatively impacted by the strong interest-bearing core deposit growth from new consumer and commercial relationships. By segment, average commercial deposits increased 5% sequentially while both consumer and wealth deposits increased 1%. As a result of our balance sheet positioning, RWA diet and success growing deposits, we achieved a loan to core deposit ratio of 72% at year-end, which continues to rank as the best compared to our regional peers. As Tim mentioned, we ended the year with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 129%. The strong funding profile provides us with great flexibility as we enter 2024. Moving to credit. Asset quality trends remained strong and below historical averages. The net charge-off ratio was 32 basis points which was down nine basis points sequentially and consistent with our guidance. 30 to 89 day delinquencies are flat compared to the end of 2022, the NPA ratio increased eight basis points to 59 basis points, but remains below our 10-year average of 65 basis points. We will maintain our credit discipline, focusing on generating and maintaining granular high-quality relationships. In consumer, we remain focused on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained our conservative underwriting policies. However, we are beginning and expect to continue to see normalization of delinquency and credit loss trends from the historically low levels experienced over the last couple of years. From an overall credit risk management perspective, we continue to assess forward-looking client vulnerabilities based on firm specific and industry trends and closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher for longer interest rates may cause stress. Moving to the ACL, while our reserve coverage increased one basis point sequentially to 2.12%, the ACL balance decreased by $41 million due to lower period-end loans, which was the primary driver of the release. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Our capital build is pacing ahead of the expectations we set at the beginning of the RWA diet. We are highly confident in our ability to build our CET1 ratio to 10.5% by June 2024. As Tim mentioned, on January 3rd, we made the decision to hold $12.6 billion of securities until maturity, resulting in the reclassification to HTM during 2024. This decision reduces the risk of potential capital volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations under the proposed capital rules. We continue to expect improvement in the unrealized losses in our remaining AFS portfolio, resulting in approximately 32% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2025 and approximately 66% by 2028, assuming the forward curve plays out. After the transfer to HTM, 65% of the remaining AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked out securities which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. We continue to believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level for our capital. And as Tim mentioned, we expect to resume share repurchases during the second half of 2024, assuming the economic environment remains stable and the capital rules are finalized, consistent with the NPR. Moving to our current outlook. We expect full year average total loans to be down 2% compared to 2023, with the decrease primarily driven by the impact of the RWA diet on commercial loans and indirect consumer as well as lower mortgage production due to the higher rate environment, partially offset by the continued growth of dividend and provide. While we expect full year average total loans to decrease, we expect average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Commercial balances are expected to be up low single-digits by the end of 2024 and dividend originations are projected between $2.5 billion and $3 billion for the full year. We are also assuming commercial revolver utilization remained stable. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect average total loan balances to be down 1%, again, driven by the full quarter impact of the RWA diet. Both commercial and consumer loans should be down around 1%. Dividend finance originations are projected to be $400 million to $500 million in the first quarter. Total loan balances should be relatively stable throughout the first quarter. We expect deposit growth to continue during 2024 with full year average core deposits increasing 2% to 3%. While we expect DDA migration to continue given the high absolute level of interest rates, the pace of migration will be sensitive to the path of the Fed funds rate in 2024. If rates remain at current levels, we could see the DDA mix dip below 25% by the fourth quarter of 2024. However, we would expect to show a more stable composition if the more aggressive rate cut forecast were to be realized. Shifting to the income statement. Given the impact of the RWA diet on average loan balances, and the impact of higher deposit costs, we expect full year NII to decrease 2% to 4%. Our forecast assumes our security portfolio remains relatively stable and our cash levels began a slow, but steady decrease throughout 2024. This outlook is consistent with the forward curve as of early January, which projected six total rate cuts. Given the uncertainty regarding the rate outlook, our balance sheet is positioned such that even with fewer rate cuts, such as the three cut scenario being projected by the FOMC, we would expect to see only a modest deterioration in our NII outlook and would still fall within our full year guidance of down 2% to 4%. We expect NII in the first quarter to be down 2% to 3% sequentially, reflecting the impact of the lower average loan balances, a lower day count in the quarter and higher deposit costs. Our current outlook assumes interest-bearing core deposit costs, which were 289 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2023, increase 5 to 10 basis points in the first quarter, a deceleration from the 24 basis point increase experienced in the fourth quarter. With rate cuts forecasted to begin in late March and continue through the end of the year, we would expect deposit costs to decrease throughout the remainder of 2024. Under this outlook, the terminal beta for the rising rate cycle would be in the mid-50s for interest-bearing core deposits. We continue to believe we are at our NIM trough in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, another quarter of outperformance in deposit growth resulting in a higher-than-expected cash position, while a good outcome could impact NIM by a few more basis points. Barring a significant change in economic outlook, we would expect NII to stabilize and then begin growing sequentially during the remainder of 2024. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be up 1% to 2% in 2024, reflecting continued growth in treasury management revenue, capital market fees and wealth and asset management revenue partially offset by the full year impact of the elimination of our extended overdraft fee. We expect mortgage origination will remain muted in 2024 and net servicing revenue to decrease modestly as the servicing portfolio UPB continues to amortize lower. Adjusted other noninterest income, which excludes the impact of the Visa total return swap, is expected to decline by over 15% as TRA revenue will decrease from $22 million in 2023 to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, and we are not including any large onetime private equity gains in our forecast. We expect first quarter adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the fourth quarter excluding the impacts of the TRA, largely reflecting seasonal factors. Normal seasonal items include lower capital markets activity and M&A activity partially offset by seasonal strength in wealth from tax planning. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up around 1% compared to 2023. Our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid to high single digits and sales force additions in middle market, treasury management and wealth. We will also close 29 branches in 2024 to offset costs associated with the 31 new branches opening in our high-growth Southeast markets. We expect first quarter total adjusted noninterest expense to be up around 8% compared to the fourth quarter. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding the seasonal items, expenses would be flat in the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be down 1% to 2% and PPNR to decline in the 4% to 5% range. This outcome will result in an efficiency ratio of around 57% for the full year, a modest increase relative to 2023, driven by the decrease in NII. As Tim mentioned, we expect positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024 compared to the second half of 2023. Moving to credit, we continue to expect 2024 net charge-offs to be in the 35 to 45 basis point range as credit continues to normalize with first quarter net charge-offs in the 35 to 40 basis point range. As we return to loan growth, we expect to resume provision builds. Assuming no change to the economic outlook, loan growth and mix is expected to drive a $100 million to $150 million of provision build for the year, with the first quarter being in the $0 to $25 million range. The provision build over the last three quarters of the year should be fairly even. In summary, 2024 is expected to be a year of transition as we begin the shift to a rate cutting cycle with our well-positioned balance sheet, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we will continue to generate long-term sustainable value for shareholders, customers, communities and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call up for Q&A.\nMatt Curoe: Thanks, Bryan. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. A lot of good color on the NII expectations, so I appreciate that. I guess just within there, I think, Bryan, you noted your comment about deposit costs decreasing through the course of this year. Maybe a thought or two on how those trajectories will differ in your view between the commercial and the consumer portfolios.\nBryan Preston: Thanks, Scott. Great question. We tell you that obviously similar to what we've seen from a rising rate perspective. The commercial and the wealth betas in particular, were -- have come through recently at a much higher level. We're in the range of probably low to high 80s from a beta perspective in both of those businesses. Cumulative betas have started to reach that point. So we're going to get a lot of repricing out of those portfolios as rates move lower. To give you a little bit of perspective, our indexed commercial deposits right now are up around $30 billion. So that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to get some price out of that book. The consumer book is one that the betas -- the cumulative betas in that book is kind of in the mid-30s right now. It certainly moved up from a marginal perspective and we continue to have a lot of optionality between our promos and exceptions as well as what we've done from a CD perspective. We're going to be able to get rate cuts out of those portfolios as well. Our CD book, which is $10 billion now is fairly evenly laddered across the year with about 25% maturities across each quarter. We've been very careful as part of our pricing strategy to make sure that we could be able to reprice those down quickly as the rate environment were to change.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Thank you. And then separately, so given that you're done with the RWA mitigation efforts, it sounds like you've got the option to be on your front foot to the extent that you choose to be going into the year. Just sort of curious what your expectation is in terms of loan demand as the year plays out.\nTimothy Spence: Yes. Scott, it's Tim. I'll take that one. I mean, look, when we talk to customers today, I think in general, they're cautious but not pessimistic. So rates in the election uncertainty are definitely weighing on the appetite for new investments in the near term. I don't know of anybody who stopped an existing program or an existing investment, but they are being very careful about new expansion. So I don't expect that we're going to see a big pickup in loan demand. And I'm sure we'll get a question later on the economy. We're not expecting robust growth to drive the top line there. It's going to have to come from market share gains. So -- in our world, the key areas of investment there are very clearly in the middle market, where we have been very focused in driving more granularity into the C&I portfolio. Our middle market loan production this past year was nearly 50-50 split between the Midwest markets, including Chicago and then the Southeast markets and our expansion markets in California and Texas. And our sales force in those locations across the entire footprint is going to be up about 20% over a three-year period here for 2024. So we've got a good pent-up sales capacity there and high activity levels that will drive the outcome. And then I think the other area of strength has been in the health care and telecom, media and technology verticals. And then in the fintech platforms, right, the continued seasoning in of both provide and dividend portfolios. The last thing is the absence of a negative here, which is the auto business, our deliberate rundown of the outstandings in the auto business have created a little bit of a drag on loan growth. And the combination of credit unions being a little bit more funding constrained than all the banks who exited have created a much more favorable environment for auto originations. So we expect volumes there to come up. We're generating volume today with a weighted average FICO north of 780 and very attractive risk-adjusted spreads and that should stop the headwind and give us a more stable platform from which we'll get growth through the rest of the year.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Okay, great color. Thank you very much.\nTimothy Spence: Absolutely.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Tim. Hi, Bryan.\nBryan Preston: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Congratulations, Bryan, on a new role. And if Jamie is listening, congratulations to him as well.\nBryan Preston: Worse than that, Gerard, Jamie is here.\nGerard Cassidy: I hear that laugh. That's great. Here's like and you touched on it Tim about the economy -- many of the banks, you as well, are following the forward curve for rates, which is understandable. And there continuing to be signs that the US economy is proving more resilient than we all expected. And so the question is this for the upcoming year, what if we're all wrong -- and all of a sudden, we see 2% plus real GDP growth, the Fed doesn't move on rates, maybe one or two cuts like what we saw in '95. And credit remains even better. How does that affect the way you approach what you've set up for '24? I know Bryan gave us some color on the different interest rate scenarios. But wants just come into this year, at the end of this year, it proves to be much stronger than any of us are expecting and inflation stays around 3%.\nTimothy Spence: Yes. I'll leave it to Bryan to provide more detail, drag. But I'm glad you asked that question because if there is one frustration, I have, in particular, on the way that the media is reporting on economic activity is the treating the world like it's deterministic and it's not, right? It's stochastic in terms of the outcomes here and while you can see the slowdown in inflation, you can see some slowdown in the economy, in particular, in specific sectors. It's just hard to be certain, given the impact of deficit spending and the way that has continued to provide a buffer against any consumer slowdown. And I think the possibility that maybe we return to a world where recessions in the US are regional as opposed to being national phenomenon, which I think people have forgotten about because of the last two were driven by global health pandemic and a global financial crisis. So we're trying to run the company in a way that provides an outlook on the expected outcomes in the middle of the distribution, but that manages to a much more stable return profile in the event we get into either of the tails, right, more robust economic growth, stickier inflation on one side of the equation and therefore, the Fed not being able to come off of its restrictive policies and stuff. And the other alternative, where I think you have to say you have some sort of a geopolitical event that creates a price shock and energy or another supply chain issue or otherwise, which could trigger an unexpected slowdown. So Bryan, maybe a little color on the upside.\nBryan Preston: Yes, absolutely. I think the scenario that you're laying out there with fewer Fed cuts, continued strength from an economic perspective, that's not a remote scenario in our view. We feel like that is something that could very easily happen, especially in the first half of the year as we continue to see potentially some strong resiliency from the consumers. What that means for us, and it's a big part of the actions that we've taken thus far is that we think that could cause the long end of the curve to move up a little bit, that would actually be beneficial for us as we get an even greater benefit from the fixed rate asset repricing. We've talked previously that full year impact of fixed rate asset repricing should generate about $300 million of annualized run rate NII improvement. And that number would look even better if we saw that long and move up. It also is part of the rationale associated with shifting some of our securities into HTM. So a stronger economy is one that we're actually would obviously always hope for because we're very well positioned for that. To quote Jamie, you can't spell flexibility without FITB. That's something that we have been very focused on and recognizing that we can be wrong on both sides, the economy weaker or stronger, and we're well positioned for that.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you. And then another bigger picture question, Tim. I think you touched on your middle market business, customers grew 11% year-over-year. And then later in the comments, I think you said that you got to take these customers or clients from maybe other banks. How are you guys doing that? And then if you could tie it into that loan-to-deposit ratio, I think you guys said you're at 72%. What's the ideal level that you eventually like to get to? Thank you.\nTimothy Spence: Yes. I mean I think it's a combination of things, Gerard. The first one is we've been very deliberate to select a few places and invest multiyear when we think about how we invest strategically, right? So the Southeast is obviously a key point of focus there. And I know a lot of people are investing in the Southeast, but it bears reminding that we've been in nearly every one of the markets down there for more than 15 years. And we're not running small LPOs. We have more than 200 client-facing people in those markets across commercial banking and wealth management alone. And then like another 1,700 that said in more than 300 branches. And the brand is seeded in those markets. So those investments when you make them, you make the investment in year one, but they don't actually hit the sort of peak benefit until year five or six. So you have this accumulation I guess a coiled spring for lack of a better term that supports then more sustained growth. We have the same benefit in the Midwest in Chicago, in particular. I mean, we added nearly 100 new quality relationships in Chicago in the middle market alone last year and have been gaining share pretty steadily at least if you use the FDIC deposit share measures as the guide. In Chicago because we're still seeing the benefits that we got out of the combination between Fifth Third and MB in those markets. The other area that we are winning, where we win is through the strength of the treasury management and the capital markets platform, which really is a middle market-focused offering for Fifth Third. About 1/3 of the new quality relationships we added in treasury management last year were treasury management only. So as opposed to being a follow-on product that you deliver into a customer that you lend money to, they're actually contributing to the relationship acquisition. And that's an engine that just wouldn't have existed here in the past, and I think still doesn't exist inside most of our peers.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nTimothy Spence: Hey, Mike.\nMike Mayo: Hey, I'll ask a question about the quarter, then requeue for bigger picture question. But what you don't hear too many regionals talking about buybacks like you are right now. So -- but you have a lot of numbers you're tossing out there. You have a 7% CET1 minimum, 7.7%, 10.5% by mid-year. It might be better on the buyback of $300 million to $400 million depending on the rules. So I guess, I just want to be a little more concrete. So -- are you sure that you want to be talking about buybacks as much as you are now? And what gives you confidence in doing so? And then the other side of that is you say if the rules get eased, then you might be able to buy back more than the $300 million to $400 million. So just give us the kind of the whole range of options, if you could.\nBryan Preston: Yes, Mike. And what we would tell you on the buybacks and in particular, on the rule, the -- there's a lot -- there appears to be momentum associated with some relief on both the ops risk side and the credit risk RWA. As we've continued to refine our estimate from an RWA perspective, the rule as proposed is a low single-digit impact from an RWA perspective. And almost seven points of RWA is created by the ops risk rule. So if that is pared back, we could actually see our RWA go down under the new rule, which obviously creates a lot of incremental capacity for us as we think about how much capital we need to help run the company from a long-term perspective. Additionally, we have a lot of confidence in the stability of the capital ratios going forward and the pace at which we're accreting capital, that in combined with the actions that we've taken from a security portfolio perspective to de-risk the portfolio with the HCM election as well as just the continued benefit that we're going to get from roll-in on the remaining AFS portfolio. It just puts us in a position where we are going to have a lot of capital generation and a lot of ability to have flexibility to return capital if the organic growth opportunities aren't there.\nTimothy Spence: Yes. And Mike, I think the one thing I would add to what Bryan said we've tried to be very clear and transparent that our belief is it's always better if you have to make a change to adapt to new regulation, it's better to get there first. We did that as it related to consumer deposit fees, right, and very deliberate about being early there because we just viewed those profit pools as being unsustainable. I think we were clear this past summer and through the fall and winter that our intention on putting ourselves on the RWA diet and focusing as much as we did on building liquidity was that we wanted to get to the rules there first because of the flexibility that it provided. So we ended the year at roughly 10.3 in terms of the CET1. We said we wanted to get to 10.5. We'll get there just based on the current run rate in the middle of the second quarter, you had to pick a particular spot. And that gives us then the ability to return to share repurchases subject to the environment not changing, maybe a little bit earlier than others.\nMike Mayo: And a short follow-up. So Basel III gets gutted, I guess, not a high probability, but some have mentioned that recently, then your RWAs, obviously, would be flat. So you might be better off if they change the ops rule -- and it passes. Did I get that right?\nTimothy Spence: Yes.\nBryan Preston: Other than if it truly gets gutted and the AOCI impact, that would be a better option than even if ops risk rule got gutted, so.\nMike Mayo: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning.\nTimothy Spence: Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess two questions. One, first on trying to make sense of the loan-to-deposit ratio at 70% relative to Fifth-Third's history prior to the pandemic. And even relative to some of your peers -- is a 70% loan-to-deposit ratio, the new normal for the bank or trying to understand if there's anything idiosyncratic about the deposit base that requires you to hold and operate with a lower loan-to-deposit ratio.\nTimothy Spence: Great question. I would tell you that 72% is not our long-term target, but I would say that our loan-to-deposit ratio has come down relative to pre-pandemic levels. And a big portion of that is just heightened expectations regarding liquidity. So I would expect us to operate in the mid-70s more than likely from a long-term perspective with loan-to-deposit. We were probably mid-80s pre-pandemic. So that is something that we would expect to continue. But we do think that we can move up from the current levels.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. And I guess a separate question maybe for Tim. I think you tried to sort of draw some distance between you and some of your peers around the Southeast technology investments. If we take those statements and account for how do you think this should reflect into should fiscal become a higher growth bank relative to these banks, a more efficient bank? Like what should we be measuring you against and do we start seeing that this year and next year? Or is this more of a longer-term process?\nTimothy Spence: Yes, great question Ebrahim. And I think maybe a nuance, I'm less trying to draw a distinction between us and others than I am to say that you can't get what we think we have in terms of the advantages overnight, right? They're not advantages that can be built in one to two years. They require a steady and consistent investment, which, of course, has been the philosophy here, along with the belief that you have to find ways to self-fund it through efficiency and better productivity along the way. And I'm hesitant to say Fifth Third is going to be a growth bank because I think four or five of the people who are described as growth banks failed this past year. Our belief, though, is that great companies should be able to take market share on an organic basis. So if you assume that the base market growth is somewhere around 2% or at least the financial services sector should be able to track GDP. There's a headwind with the emergence of all of these nonbank competitors. Therefore, the more realistic goal from my perspective is to try to beat GDP by a couple of percentage points on an annualized basis, which probably means you need to have 3% to 4% outsized growth relative to your market. These granular investments we're making across the Southeast are definitely part of the way that matriculates in the performance. I think the other place then you should expect to see it, given where we're investing is continued support for a better fees to total revenue mix, which is going to be really critically important in the event that the rules as they are proposed do pass because of the impact that higher capital and liquidity requirements are going to have. And you're seeing that today. The core Fifth Third consumer franchise, if you just look at household acquisition as a measure is outgrowing Midwest population growth by about 1.5% per year. It's outgrowing the Southeast markets by about four percentage points per year. So you can see the impact of the incremental investment, if you just disaggregate our business and look at it on a market-by-market basis. Jamie, maybe you want to add something here?\nJames Leonard: Yes, Ebrahim, on maybe to tie your two questions together, on the loan-to-deposit ratio, part of the improvement has been the strong deposit growth we've been able to get both from the RWA diet, which I talked about a couple of quarters ago, just how customer reaction resulted in more deposits and a better share of wallet. And that continued in the fourth quarter and commercial deposits, you see in the numbers are up nicely. And then on the Southeast, we actually grew deposits in the Southeast, 5% just in the fourth quarter. And so you do get that growth in the numbers, but the Midwest still grew in total about 1%. So we've got a very nice balance here of Midwest and Southeast. And I was down in South Carolina on Wednesday, we opened our 10th branch in South Carolina this week and have plans to do 25 more over the next five years. So I think you'll continue to see the benefits of the investments over the last three years as we continue to really expand that Southeast presence.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\nNicholas Holowko: Good morning. This is Nick Holowko on for Erika. I think in the past, you've talked about a curve where the front end is in the low 3% range as an ideal rate environment for the bank. Is that still the right way to think about it? And if we get to that range, do you think we could see NIM migrate back to the 3.20% to 3.30% range that you're producing back in the 2018, 2019 period. Thank you.\nBryan Preston: Yes, absolutely. We're turning to a normal curve where we would have, I'd say, a 3% front end and maybe 100 to 200 basis points of spread between the front end and the 10-year rate is a very ideal environment for us because, one, we are going to get the benefit of deposit repricing lower, and at the same time, still being able to pick up a lot of benefit associated with that fixed rate asset repricing. So being able to achieve a 3.20% plus NIM in that kind of scenario, a year or two forward would be something that would be easily -- that should be very easily achievable, and we feel good about that environment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nVivek Juneja: Hi. Congrats, Bryan and Jamie. A couple of quick questions for you guys. One is in your NII outlook that you've given for the year, what are you assuming for deposit betas on the way down. Sorry if I missed that, trying to keep an eye on bunch of different releases this morning.\nBryan Preston: Glad you asked the question. It's the first time it's come off, actually, and it wasn't in our scripted remarks. We are expecting betas on the way down to look very similar to what we saw in the last couple of hikes which is in a 60% to 70% range. We don't expect a significant difference in betas between like the first cut and the third cut. You're still at such a high level that, that beta should be relatively high from a marginal perspective. Our rate risk disclosures, we talk about, say, 60% to 65% beta on the way down. We tend to be a little bit conservative on those disclosures. So we think we're going to be able to deliver that, if not a little bit better.\nVivek Juneja: Great. Another little one. Other consumer loans, the NPLs moved up quite a bit linked quarter to a little over 1%. Any color is that coming from dividend finance? Or is that something else?\nJames Leonard: Yes. It's Jamie, Vivek. Yes, it is actually from dividend finance. And the driver of that -- there's some element that's just normalization as you go through growing a new company, but that's a smaller part of it. The larger part of it of the increase is actually from our decision to deliver a good customer experience for the borrowers that have had instances where there are delays in getting the solar panel installations to receive permission to operate from the utilities that could also be delayed due to installer performance issues or supply chain shortages. So what we've elected to do is different forms of deferment or modification in order to assist the borrowers. And then I would expect this to improve over time as we continue to improve the installer network as well.\nVivek Juneja: So not much loss content you'd expect from that, Jamie then, since it seems like you're deferring rather than that.\nJames Leonard: There will be lost content in there. It is appropriately reserved, so not an income impact. But from a solar perspective, we continue to run solar losses around 1% or so. And as we talked about, our deal model was 130 basis points on solar. The challenge we've had from a loss content perspective has been on the home improvement side, where dividend had a subprime component to their portfolio that has higher losses. And we stopped originating that product back over a year ago. So there will be some loss content, but I don't think you would see it impacting income.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you guys can elaborate a bit on the commercial real estate exposure. Obviously, it's a bit less than peers. And as you noted, no charge-offs last year, but your nonperformers are also into this event and even the office criticized is a relatively low 6% compared to others. So how is it so good? And I guess, are you confident that the marks and estimates are up to date. Thank you.\nGreg Schroeck: Yes, it's Greg. Great question. So yes, very confident in our marks and where we currently are. Also very, very comfortable with the overall asset quality. We've been, for the last several years, very disciplined in terms of our client selection. We're underwriting commercial real estate, specifically office at something below 60% loan to value. We've got 90% recourse on that portfolio. And so our borrowers are continuing to exhibit the right behaviors. They're supporting their projects. They're writing checks to reduce the debt as necessary. We're out ahead of that portfolio. The maturities are evenly split over the next four to five years. We don't have that so-called wall of maturities that we've heard from some other banks and you've heard in the marketplace. So I do feel very good about the overall portfolio, our office included.\nMatt O'Connor: And then just more broadly speaking, obviously, the overall charge-off outlook for this year is fairly benign 35 to 45 basis points. Any more color in terms of drivers of call it, the midpoint of that range versus 2023 levels?\nGreg Schroeck: I think we're going to continue to see a lot of what we saw in 2024 with what we saw in 2023, right? We don't have any significant trends geographically or by product. And so what we saw in 2023 was a little bit more episodic. And based on what we're seeing on the C&I side right now, I mean, our borrowers have done a nice job both on the executing on the revenue expense management side, there's obviously margin compression. But overall, as Tim said earlier, they're looking for the same things we're looking for, which is what is the Fed going to do and when. We hear a lot about labor costs, so they're keeping their eye on that. So I think we're going to have a lot of the same old same old, certainly as we get into the first and second quarters in terms of what we're seeing both from a loss content and commercial real estate minimal and C&I, right? We will have a name pop up every once in a while we'll deal with it. But again, we're not seeing trends that would lead me to believe that our criticized assets -- our overall asset quality is going to move much from where it is right now. Again, as we sit here today heading into the first quarter.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.\nChristopher Marinac: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Can you remind us how the commercial C&I DDAs behave on a down rate environment? And is there any reason to believe that they wouldn't kind of behave positively in your favor this time?\nBryan Preston: Yes, absolutely. We would expect DDAs to especially the migration to stop migrating into interest-bearing and begin growing as rates cuts begin to occur. We talked about that a little bit in the scripted remarks that if we were to see more aggressive cuts, we'd see some opportunity there. We've typically modeled somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion of DDA migration per 100 basis points of rate hikes or rate cuts. We'd expect that to be a fairly similar migration level on up or down, just positive or negative. We would tell you that probably the beginning cut or two, maybe it's a little bit slower, but if you were to see a much more aggressive path, and if the Fed funds rate got down into the 3s, we would expect a decent reversal.\nChristopher Marinac: Got it. That makes sense. Thank you, Bryan, and then just a quick follow-up on reserve build -- would you still build reserves kind of within the current level we have today? I'm just trying to compare the guide of 35 to 40 basis points in the average life of the portfolio is less than four. There's really strong coverage. So just curious if you would build that same level.\nBryan Preston: Yes. As long as the economic scenario is similar and the mix of the portfolio, obviously, is very important in terms of what drives a build. Certainly, dividend, some of the things that we're talking about from an auto perspective, where can carry a little bit more reserve that has an impact from a build perspective that drives more of the dollar built than anything else at this point.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nBryan Preston: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Matt Curoe for some closing remarks.\nMatt Curoe: Thank you, JL and thanks, everyone, for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. JL, you can now disconnect the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Timothy Spence",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe that great banks distinguish themselves based on how they navigate challenging and uncertain operating environment. 2023 was certainly a challenging year for the industry, but I am very pleased with how we measured up. A defensive balance sheet positioning, strong execution, and multiyear strategic investments produce top-quartile profitability, the best core deposit growth, and the best total shareholder return among all regional peers who did not participate in an FDIC-assisted transaction. We generated an all-time record full-year revenue of $8.7 billion. Deposits grew 5% compared to an industry-wide decline of 3%. Credit performance was strong with net charge-offs remaining below historical averages. And although it would be foolish to expect it to repeat forever, in commercial real estate we experienced zero net charge-offs in 2023 and only two basis points in delinquent loans as of early January. These strong outcomes combined with our multi-year expense discipline produced a full-year adjusted return on assets of 1.25% and adjusted return on tangible common equity ex-AOCI of 15.9% and an adjusted efficiency ratio of 55.9%. All among the best of our peers. We also continue to take market share organically by growing our customer base and deepening relationships. We grew consumer households by 3% overall punctuated by 6% growth in the Southeast. In commercial, we added a record number of new quality middle market relationships up 11% over the prior year. As a result, we grew or maintained our deposit market share position in all 40 of our largest MSAs. As we turn the page to 2024, we remain focused on differentiating Fifth Third based on the strength and consistency of our financial performance by prioritizing stability, profitability, and growth in that order. Bryan will take you through the detail on the fourth quarter and our outlook for the year shortly. But before that, I would like to touch on a few points. The first of these is the strength of our balance sheet. Our defensive positioning and decision to move quickly to adapt to proposed regulatory changes have put us in a position to play offense in 2024. Having achieved full Category 1 LCR compliance on August 31st and maintained it since, our liquidity position is very strong. We completed our RWA diet in the fourth quarter and accreted nearly 50 basis points of CET1, putting us on pace to reach a 10.5% CET1 ratio by mid-year 2024. Given our strong earnings profile and the significant rally in interest rates in December, our tangible book value per share grew nearly 30% during the fourth quarter. At the beginning of January, we moved $12.6 billion of securities to held-to-maturity, representing roughly one quarter of our AFS portfolio. We expect this move will de-risk potential AOCI volatility to capital by about 30% in the event that market rates rise again. If the economic outlook remains stable and the capital rules are finalized, no worse than the current NPR. These actions put us in a position to resume share repurchases of up to $300 million to $400 million in the second half of 2024, including $100 million to $200 million as early as the beginning of the third quarter. Should the final rules prove less stringent than the initial proposals, we'll have additional flexibility in deploying excess capital and liquidity to further improve profitability and position Fifth Third for growth. The second point I'd like to highlight is profitability. Expense discipline, strong returns, and positive operating leverage remain core areas of focus for Fifth Third. Supported by our technology modernization investments and a focus on leaning out key value streams, we reduced full-time equivalent employee headcount by 4% from our peak in 2023 to the end of the year without the need for a company-wide expense program. The run rate benefits of these efforts put us in a position to sustain the peer-leading annualized expense growth that we have averaged the past several years, even as we continue to invest for growth. While the carryover effect of the RWA diet makes it unfeasible for the full year, we do anticipate returning to positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024. The third point I'd like to highlight is about growth. Our strategies have been consistent, building out our Southeast markets, producing a strong fee to total revenue mix, and leveraging software that differentiates our product offerings and improves productivity. These are multi-year investments that cannot be replicated easily by competitors to one to two years of hiring a few new branches or small tuck-in acquisitions. In 2023, we opened 37 new branches concentrated in the Southeast, bringing us to 107 opened over the past five years. We plan to open another 31 branches in the Southeast in 2024. As a portfolio, these branches have continued to outperform our expectations on both household acquisition and deposit growth and should provide a tailwind for several years forward. We also continue to invest in treasury management, wealth and asset management, and capital markets. All three of these businesses grew for us in 2023. We expect mid-to-high single-digit growth in each in 2024. In treasury management, our acquisitions of Rize and Big Data Healthcare and the launch of Newline, our embedded payments business, should continue to support peer-leading performance. In wealth and asset management, Global Finance recently named our Private Bank as the Best US Regional Private Bank for the fifth consecutive year and Best Private Bank for Entrepreneurs globally for the first time. In our capital markets business, we have seen more robust activity levels to start the year, including an M&A pipeline that is 1.5 times the full-year revenue target embedded in our guidance. Overall, we expect 2024 to be a solid year of improving revenue trends and continued to expense discipline. Given what we believe to be a less certain outlook than the markets would imply, we are positioned to perform well under a range of economic and interest rate scenarios. Before, I hand it over to Bryan, I want to say thank you to our employees for hustling to deliver great results in 2023 and for the job you do every day to take care of our customers and communities. You make our company a special place for this. With that, I'll now turn it over to Bryan to provide additional details on our fourth quarter results and our current outlook for 2024. Yes. Scott, it's Tim. I'll take that one. I mean, look, when we talk to customers today, I think in general, they're cautious but not pessimistic. So rates in the election uncertainty are definitely weighing on the appetite for new investments in the near term. I don't know of anybody who stopped an existing program or an existing investment, but they are being very careful about new expansion. So I don't expect that we're going to see a big pickup in loan demand. And I'm sure we'll get a question later on the economy. We're not expecting robust growth to drive the top line there. It's going to have to come from market share gains. So -- in our world, the key areas of investment there are very clearly in the middle market, where we have been very focused in driving more granularity into the C&I portfolio. Our middle market loan production this past year was nearly 50-50 split between the Midwest markets, including Chicago and then the Southeast markets and our expansion markets in California and Texas. And our sales force in those locations across the entire footprint is going to be up about 20% over a three-year period here for 2024. So we've got a good pent-up sales capacity there and high activity levels that will drive the outcome. And then I think the other area of strength has been in the health care and telecom, media and technology verticals. And then in the fintech platforms, right, the continued seasoning in of both provide and dividend portfolios. The last thing is the absence of a negative here, which is the auto business, our deliberate rundown of the outstandings in the auto business have created a little bit of a drag on loan growth. And the combination of credit unions being a little bit more funding constrained than all the banks who exited have created a much more favorable environment for auto originations. So we expect volumes there to come up. We're generating volume today with a weighted average FICO north of 780 and very attractive risk-adjusted spreads and that should stop the headwind and give us a more stable platform from which we'll get growth through the rest of the year. Absolutely. Yes. I'll leave it to Bryan to provide more detail, drag. But I'm glad you asked that question because if there is one frustration, I have, in particular, on the way that the media is reporting on economic activity is the treating the world like it's deterministic and it's not, right? It's stochastic in terms of the outcomes here and while you can see the slowdown in inflation, you can see some slowdown in the economy, in particular, in specific sectors. It's just hard to be certain, given the impact of deficit spending and the way that has continued to provide a buffer against any consumer slowdown. And I think the possibility that maybe we return to a world where recessions in the US are regional as opposed to being national phenomenon, which I think people have forgotten about because of the last two were driven by global health pandemic and a global financial crisis. So we're trying to run the company in a way that provides an outlook on the expected outcomes in the middle of the distribution, but that manages to a much more stable return profile in the event we get into either of the tails, right, more robust economic growth, stickier inflation on one side of the equation and therefore, the Fed not being able to come off of its restrictive policies and stuff. And the other alternative, where I think you have to say you have some sort of a geopolitical event that creates a price shock and energy or another supply chain issue or otherwise, which could trigger an unexpected slowdown. So Bryan, maybe a little color on the upside. Yes. I mean I think it's a combination of things, Gerard. The first one is we've been very deliberate to select a few places and invest multiyear when we think about how we invest strategically, right? So the Southeast is obviously a key point of focus there. And I know a lot of people are investing in the Southeast, but it bears reminding that we've been in nearly every one of the markets down there for more than 15 years. And we're not running small LPOs. We have more than 200 client-facing people in those markets across commercial banking and wealth management alone. And then like another 1,700 that said in more than 300 branches. And the brand is seeded in those markets. So those investments when you make them, you make the investment in year one, but they don't actually hit the sort of peak benefit until year five or six. So you have this accumulation I guess a coiled spring for lack of a better term that supports then more sustained growth. We have the same benefit in the Midwest in Chicago, in particular. I mean, we added nearly 100 new quality relationships in Chicago in the middle market alone last year and have been gaining share pretty steadily at least if you use the FDIC deposit share measures as the guide. In Chicago because we're still seeing the benefits that we got out of the combination between Fifth Third and MB in those markets. The other area that we are winning, where we win is through the strength of the treasury management and the capital markets platform, which really is a middle market-focused offering for Fifth Third. About 1/3 of the new quality relationships we added in treasury management last year were treasury management only. So as opposed to being a follow-on product that you deliver into a customer that you lend money to, they're actually contributing to the relationship acquisition. And that's an engine that just wouldn't have existed here in the past, and I think still doesn't exist inside most of our peers. Hey, Mike. Yes. And Mike, I think the one thing I would add to what Bryan said we've tried to be very clear and transparent that our belief is it's always better if you have to make a change to adapt to new regulation, it's better to get there first. We did that as it related to consumer deposit fees, right, and very deliberate about being early there because we just viewed those profit pools as being unsustainable. I think we were clear this past summer and through the fall and winter that our intention on putting ourselves on the RWA diet and focusing as much as we did on building liquidity was that we wanted to get to the rules there first because of the flexibility that it provided. So we ended the year at roughly 10.3 in terms of the CET1. We said we wanted to get to 10.5. We'll get there just based on the current run rate in the middle of the second quarter, you had to pick a particular spot. And that gives us then the ability to return to share repurchases subject to the environment not changing, maybe a little bit earlier than others. Yes. Good morning. Great question. I would tell you that 72% is not our long-term target, but I would say that our loan-to-deposit ratio has come down relative to pre-pandemic levels. And a big portion of that is just heightened expectations regarding liquidity. So I would expect us to operate in the mid-70s more than likely from a long-term perspective with loan-to-deposit. We were probably mid-80s pre-pandemic. So that is something that we would expect to continue. But we do think that we can move up from the current levels. Yes, great question Ebrahim. And I think maybe a nuance, I'm less trying to draw a distinction between us and others than I am to say that you can't get what we think we have in terms of the advantages overnight, right? They're not advantages that can be built in one to two years. They require a steady and consistent investment, which, of course, has been the philosophy here, along with the belief that you have to find ways to self-fund it through efficiency and better productivity along the way. And I'm hesitant to say Fifth Third is going to be a growth bank because I think four or five of the people who are described as growth banks failed this past year. Our belief, though, is that great companies should be able to take market share on an organic basis. So if you assume that the base market growth is somewhere around 2% or at least the financial services sector should be able to track GDP. There's a headwind with the emergence of all of these nonbank competitors. Therefore, the more realistic goal from my perspective is to try to beat GDP by a couple of percentage points on an annualized basis, which probably means you need to have 3% to 4% outsized growth relative to your market. These granular investments we're making across the Southeast are definitely part of the way that matriculates in the performance. I think the other place then you should expect to see it, given where we're investing is continued support for a better fees to total revenue mix, which is going to be really critically important in the event that the rules as they are proposed do pass because of the impact that higher capital and liquidity requirements are going to have. And you're seeing that today. The core Fifth Third consumer franchise, if you just look at household acquisition as a measure is outgrowing Midwest population growth by about 1.5% per year. It's outgrowing the Southeast markets by about four percentage points per year. So you can see the impact of the incremental investment, if you just disaggregate our business and look at it on a market-by-market basis. Jamie, maybe you want to add something here?"

            "name": "James Leonard",
            "content": "Yes, Ebrahim, on maybe to tie your two questions together, on the loan-to-deposit ratio, part of the improvement has been the strong deposit growth we've been able to get both from the RWA diet, which I talked about a couple of quarters ago, just how customer reaction resulted in more deposits and a better share of wallet. And that continued in the fourth quarter and commercial deposits, you see in the numbers are up nicely. And then on the Southeast, we actually grew deposits in the Southeast, 5% just in the fourth quarter. And so you do get that growth in the numbers, but the Midwest still grew in total about 1%. So we've got a very nice balance here of Midwest and Southeast. And I was down in South Carolina on Wednesday, we opened our 10th branch in South Carolina this week and have plans to do 25 more over the next five years. So I think you'll continue to see the benefits of the investments over the last three years as we continue to really expand that Southeast presence. Yes. It's Jamie, Vivek. Yes, it is actually from dividend finance. And the driver of that -- there's some element that's just normalization as you go through growing a new company, but that's a smaller part of it. The larger part of it of the increase is actually from our decision to deliver a good customer experience for the borrowers that have had instances where there are delays in getting the solar panel installations to receive permission to operate from the utilities that could also be delayed due to installer performance issues or supply chain shortages. So what we've elected to do is different forms of deferment or modification in order to assist the borrowers. And then I would expect this to improve over time as we continue to improve the installer network as well. There will be lost content in there. It is appropriately reserved, so not an income impact. But from a solar perspective, we continue to run solar losses around 1% or so. And as we talked about, our deal model was 130 basis points on solar. The challenge we've had from a loss content perspective has been on the home improvement side, where dividend had a subprime component to their portfolio that has higher losses. And we stopped originating that product back over a year ago. So there will be some loss content, but I don't think you would see it impacting income."

            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. 2023 was a very different year than what we were expecting 12 months ago. For Fifth Third, our success in outperforming this year was driven by our intentional actions to create and maintain flexibility for navigating uncertainty. As we enter 2024, we are very pleased with the results from 2023 and how we continue to be well-positioned for a wide range of economic outcomes. We have optionality in our balance sheet and diversification on our business mix that will allow us to adapt to changing environments. As Tim mentioned, achieving this positioning requires discipline and years of deliberate investments. Our full-year financial performance in 2023 benefited from this long-term investment. Fifth Third delivered industry-leading deposit growth of 5%, record revenue of $8.7 billion, and 100 basis points of capital accretion during the year, all while maintaining expense and credit discipline. We delivered another solid quarter to end the year. Adjusting for the FDIC special assessment and the other discrete items listed on page two of our release, return on assets was 1.3%, RoTCE was 17%, and our efficiency ratio was 55%. Additionally, we completed our risk-weighted asset diet in the fourth quarter, which reduced RWA by 3%, which was a little more than we previously estimated. The diet combined with our strong earnings led to a nearly 50 basis point increase in CET1 during the quarter, which ended at 10.3%. This capital accretion combined with the rally in market rates during the fourth quarter resulted in our pro forma CET1 ratio including the AOCI impact from unrealized losses on AFS securities, increasing to 7.7% at year-end, well above the 7% minimum. Net interest income for the quarter was $1.4 billion, which was consistent with our expectations. While NII continues to be impacted by the increasing cost of deposits, due to higher market interest rates. We've been able to build a robust liquidity position by generating peer-leading core deposit growth. Our core interest-bearing deposit costs increased 24 basis points sequentially, reflecting a cycle-to-date interest-bearing core deposit beta of 54% in the fourth quarter. We believe maintaining significant liquidity on balance sheet. It's a prudent decision given the uncertain economic and regulatory environments. Our short-term investments, which are primarily comprised of our cash at the Fed increased $8.6 billion in the fourth quarter on an average basis and drove all of the 13 basis points sequential decrease in NIM. Excluding the impacts of securities gains losses and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income increased 3% sequentially due to the growth in commercial banking, mortgage, wealth, and card and processing revenues. As well as the normal fourth quarter impact of the CRA. The growth in commercial banking fees was driven by strong institutional brokerage and improved corporate bond fees, partially offset by lower lease from marketing revenue. Fourth quarter non-interest income was also impacted by the decision to eliminate our extended overdraft fee, which was the driver of the decrease in service charges on deposits. Compared to the prior year, non-interest income decreased 3%, primarily due to a $25 million reduction in CRA revenue. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 2% sequentially, primarily driven by the impact of the non-qualified deferred compensation mark-to-market, which is mostly offset in securities gains losses. Excluding the impact of the NQDC mark, which was a $17 million expense in the fourth quarter compared to a $5 million benefit in the prior quarter, expenses were flat sequentially. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter expenses were down 1%, which reflects our ongoing commitment to expense discipline, Tim mentioned earlier. Moving to the balance sheet. As expected, total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 2% sequentially. Most significantly driven by the 3% decrease in average total commercial loans. Our corporate banking business experienced the biggest reduction due to the RWA diet. With period-end, corporate banking total commitments decreasing 6% and unused commitments decreasing 4%. Period end, the commercial revolver utilization rate was 35%, a 1% decrease from the prior quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially due to our intentional pullback in indirect auto and the overall slowdown in the residential mortgage originations given the rate environment, partially offset by growth from dividend finance. Average core deposits increased 3% sequentially, driven by the growth in interest checking, money market and customer CD balances. DDA migration is showing signs of deceleration with fourth quarter showing the smallest dollar decline in DDA balances since the onset of the rate hiking cycle, even when adjusting for normal seasonal strength at year-end. DDA as a percent of core deposits were 26% for the quarter compared to 28% in the prior quarter. In addition to the migration impact, this measure is negatively impacted by the strong interest-bearing core deposit growth from new consumer and commercial relationships. By segment, average commercial deposits increased 5% sequentially while both consumer and wealth deposits increased 1%. As a result of our balance sheet positioning, RWA diet and success growing deposits, we achieved a loan to core deposit ratio of 72% at year-end, which continues to rank as the best compared to our regional peers. As Tim mentioned, we ended the year with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 129%. The strong funding profile provides us with great flexibility as we enter 2024. Moving to credit. Asset quality trends remained strong and below historical averages. The net charge-off ratio was 32 basis points which was down nine basis points sequentially and consistent with our guidance. 30 to 89 day delinquencies are flat compared to the end of 2022, the NPA ratio increased eight basis points to 59 basis points, but remains below our 10-year average of 65 basis points. We will maintain our credit discipline, focusing on generating and maintaining granular high-quality relationships. In consumer, we remain focused on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained our conservative underwriting policies. However, we are beginning and expect to continue to see normalization of delinquency and credit loss trends from the historically low levels experienced over the last couple of years. From an overall credit risk management perspective, we continue to assess forward-looking client vulnerabilities based on firm specific and industry trends and closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher for longer interest rates may cause stress. Moving to the ACL, while our reserve coverage increased one basis point sequentially to 2.12%, the ACL balance decreased by $41 million due to lower period-end loans, which was the primary driver of the release. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Our capital build is pacing ahead of the expectations we set at the beginning of the RWA diet. We are highly confident in our ability to build our CET1 ratio to 10.5% by June 2024. As Tim mentioned, on January 3rd, we made the decision to hold $12.6 billion of securities until maturity, resulting in the reclassification to HTM during 2024. This decision reduces the risk of potential capital volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations under the proposed capital rules. We continue to expect improvement in the unrealized losses in our remaining AFS portfolio, resulting in approximately 32% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2025 and approximately 66% by 2028, assuming the forward curve plays out. After the transfer to HTM, 65% of the remaining AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked out securities which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. We continue to believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level for our capital. And as Tim mentioned, we expect to resume share repurchases during the second half of 2024, assuming the economic environment remains stable and the capital rules are finalized, consistent with the NPR. Moving to our current outlook. We expect full year average total loans to be down 2% compared to 2023, with the decrease primarily driven by the impact of the RWA diet on commercial loans and indirect consumer as well as lower mortgage production due to the higher rate environment, partially offset by the continued growth of dividend and provide. While we expect full year average total loans to decrease, we expect average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Commercial balances are expected to be up low single-digits by the end of 2024 and dividend originations are projected between $2.5 billion and $3 billion for the full year. We are also assuming commercial revolver utilization remained stable. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect average total loan balances to be down 1%, again, driven by the full quarter impact of the RWA diet. Both commercial and consumer loans should be down around 1%. Dividend finance originations are projected to be $400 million to $500 million in the first quarter. Total loan balances should be relatively stable throughout the first quarter. We expect deposit growth to continue during 2024 with full year average core deposits increasing 2% to 3%. While we expect DDA migration to continue given the high absolute level of interest rates, the pace of migration will be sensitive to the path of the Fed funds rate in 2024. If rates remain at current levels, we could see the DDA mix dip below 25% by the fourth quarter of 2024. However, we would expect to show a more stable composition if the more aggressive rate cut forecast were to be realized. Shifting to the income statement. Given the impact of the RWA diet on average loan balances, and the impact of higher deposit costs, we expect full year NII to decrease 2% to 4%. Our forecast assumes our security portfolio remains relatively stable and our cash levels began a slow, but steady decrease throughout 2024. This outlook is consistent with the forward curve as of early January, which projected six total rate cuts. Given the uncertainty regarding the rate outlook, our balance sheet is positioned such that even with fewer rate cuts, such as the three cut scenario being projected by the FOMC, we would expect to see only a modest deterioration in our NII outlook and would still fall within our full year guidance of down 2% to 4%. We expect NII in the first quarter to be down 2% to 3% sequentially, reflecting the impact of the lower average loan balances, a lower day count in the quarter and higher deposit costs. Our current outlook assumes interest-bearing core deposit costs, which were 289 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2023, increase 5 to 10 basis points in the first quarter, a deceleration from the 24 basis point increase experienced in the fourth quarter. With rate cuts forecasted to begin in late March and continue through the end of the year, we would expect deposit costs to decrease throughout the remainder of 2024. Under this outlook, the terminal beta for the rising rate cycle would be in the mid-50s for interest-bearing core deposits. We continue to believe we are at our NIM trough in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, another quarter of outperformance in deposit growth resulting in a higher-than-expected cash position, while a good outcome could impact NIM by a few more basis points. Barring a significant change in economic outlook, we would expect NII to stabilize and then begin growing sequentially during the remainder of 2024. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be up 1% to 2% in 2024, reflecting continued growth in treasury management revenue, capital market fees and wealth and asset management revenue partially offset by the full year impact of the elimination of our extended overdraft fee. We expect mortgage origination will remain muted in 2024 and net servicing revenue to decrease modestly as the servicing portfolio UPB continues to amortize lower. Adjusted other noninterest income, which excludes the impact of the Visa total return swap, is expected to decline by over 15% as TRA revenue will decrease from $22 million in 2023 to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, and we are not including any large onetime private equity gains in our forecast. We expect first quarter adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the fourth quarter excluding the impacts of the TRA, largely reflecting seasonal factors. Normal seasonal items include lower capital markets activity and M&A activity partially offset by seasonal strength in wealth from tax planning. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up around 1% compared to 2023. Our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid to high single digits and sales force additions in middle market, treasury management and wealth. We will also close 29 branches in 2024 to offset costs associated with the 31 new branches opening in our high-growth Southeast markets. We expect first quarter total adjusted noninterest expense to be up around 8% compared to the fourth quarter. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding the seasonal items, expenses would be flat in the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be down 1% to 2% and PPNR to decline in the 4% to 5% range. This outcome will result in an efficiency ratio of around 57% for the full year, a modest increase relative to 2023, driven by the decrease in NII. As Tim mentioned, we expect positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024 compared to the second half of 2023. Moving to credit, we continue to expect 2024 net charge-offs to be in the 35 to 45 basis point range as credit continues to normalize with first quarter net charge-offs in the 35 to 40 basis point range. As we return to loan growth, we expect to resume provision builds. Assuming no change to the economic outlook, loan growth and mix is expected to drive a $100 million to $150 million of provision build for the year, with the first quarter being in the $0 to $25 million range. The provision build over the last three quarters of the year should be fairly even. In summary, 2024 is expected to be a year of transition as we begin the shift to a rate cutting cycle with our well-positioned balance sheet, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we will continue to generate long-term sustainable value for shareholders, customers, communities and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call up for Q&A. Thanks, Scott. Great question. We tell you that obviously similar to what we've seen from a rising rate perspective. The commercial and the wealth betas in particular, were -- have come through recently at a much higher level. We're in the range of probably low to high 80s from a beta perspective in both of those businesses. Cumulative betas have started to reach that point. So we're going to get a lot of repricing out of those portfolios as rates move lower. To give you a little bit of perspective, our indexed commercial deposits right now are up around $30 billion. So that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to get some price out of that book. The consumer book is one that the betas -- the cumulative betas in that book is kind of in the mid-30s right now. It certainly moved up from a marginal perspective and we continue to have a lot of optionality between our promos and exceptions as well as what we've done from a CD perspective. We're going to be able to get rate cuts out of those portfolios as well. Our CD book, which is $10 billion now is fairly evenly laddered across the year with about 25% maturities across each quarter. We've been very careful as part of our pricing strategy to make sure that we could be able to reprice those down quickly as the rate environment were to change. Good morning. Worse than that, Gerard, Jamie is here. Yes, absolutely. I think the scenario that you're laying out there with fewer Fed cuts, continued strength from an economic perspective, that's not a remote scenario in our view. We feel like that is something that could very easily happen, especially in the first half of the year as we continue to see potentially some strong resiliency from the consumers. What that means for us, and it's a big part of the actions that we've taken thus far is that we think that could cause the long end of the curve to move up a little bit, that would actually be beneficial for us as we get an even greater benefit from the fixed rate asset repricing. We've talked previously that full year impact of fixed rate asset repricing should generate about $300 million of annualized run rate NII improvement. And that number would look even better if we saw that long and move up. It also is part of the rationale associated with shifting some of our securities into HTM. So a stronger economy is one that we're actually would obviously always hope for because we're very well positioned for that. To quote Jamie, you can't spell flexibility without FITB. That's something that we have been very focused on and recognizing that we can be wrong on both sides, the economy weaker or stronger, and we're well positioned for that. Yes, Mike. And what we would tell you on the buybacks and in particular, on the rule, the -- there's a lot -- there appears to be momentum associated with some relief on both the ops risk side and the credit risk RWA. As we've continued to refine our estimate from an RWA perspective, the rule as proposed is a low single-digit impact from an RWA perspective. And almost seven points of RWA is created by the ops risk rule. So if that is pared back, we could actually see our RWA go down under the new rule, which obviously creates a lot of incremental capacity for us as we think about how much capital we need to help run the company from a long-term perspective. Additionally, we have a lot of confidence in the stability of the capital ratios going forward and the pace at which we're accreting capital, that in combined with the actions that we've taken from a security portfolio perspective to de-risk the portfolio with the HCM election as well as just the continued benefit that we're going to get from roll-in on the remaining AFS portfolio. It just puts us in a position where we are going to have a lot of capital generation and a lot of ability to have flexibility to return capital if the organic growth opportunities aren't there. Other than if it truly gets gutted and the AOCI impact, that would be a better option than even if ops risk rule got gutted, so. Yes, absolutely. We're turning to a normal curve where we would have, I'd say, a 3% front end and maybe 100 to 200 basis points of spread between the front end and the 10-year rate is a very ideal environment for us because, one, we are going to get the benefit of deposit repricing lower, and at the same time, still being able to pick up a lot of benefit associated with that fixed rate asset repricing. So being able to achieve a 3.20% plus NIM in that kind of scenario, a year or two forward would be something that would be easily -- that should be very easily achievable, and we feel good about that environment. Glad you asked the question. It's the first time it's come off, actually, and it wasn't in our scripted remarks. We are expecting betas on the way down to look very similar to what we saw in the last couple of hikes which is in a 60% to 70% range. We don't expect a significant difference in betas between like the first cut and the third cut. You're still at such a high level that, that beta should be relatively high from a marginal perspective. Our rate risk disclosures, we talk about, say, 60% to 65% beta on the way down. We tend to be a little bit conservative on those disclosures. So we think we're going to be able to deliver that, if not a little bit better. Yes, absolutely. We would expect DDAs to especially the migration to stop migrating into interest-bearing and begin growing as rates cuts begin to occur. We talked about that a little bit in the scripted remarks that if we were to see more aggressive cuts, we'd see some opportunity there. We've typically modeled somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion of DDA migration per 100 basis points of rate hikes or rate cuts. We'd expect that to be a fairly similar migration level on up or down, just positive or negative. We would tell you that probably the beginning cut or two, maybe it's a little bit slower, but if you were to see a much more aggressive path, and if the Fed funds rate got down into the 3s, we would expect a decent reversal. Yes. As long as the economic scenario is similar and the mix of the portfolio, obviously, is very important in terms of what drives a build. Certainly, dividend, some of the things that we're talking about from an auto perspective, where can carry a little bit more reserve that has an impact from a build perspective that drives more of the dollar built than anything else at this point. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Chris Doll, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nChris Doll: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fifth Third's third quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard, will provide an overview of our third quarter results and outlook. Our Treasurer, Bryan Preston; and Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, have also joined us for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of October 19, 2023, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\nTimothy Spence: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We believe that great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate challenging ones. That is why we focus on stability, profitability, and growth in that order. It is also why I am so pleased that our key return and profitability metrics remain resilient despite the market-related headwinds that all banks are facing. Earlier today, we reported earnings per share of $0.91 or $0.92 excluding a one set impact from our Visa swap, reflecting strong PPNR results and favorable credit outcomes. We generated an adjusted return on tangible common equity ex-AOCI of nearly 16%, which increased 50 basis points sequentially, and a return on assets of 1.26%. We generated strong fee growth compared to the year ago quarter, supported by a more diverse range of fee income streams than peers, and our investments in treasury management, capital markets, and wealth management. Our third quarter total non-interest expense increased less than 2% compared to the year ago quarter, and we generated an adjusted efficiency ratio below 55%. In the last four years, we have managed expenses to the lowest growth rate among peers, despite also investing in growth by building more new branches, raising our minimum wage, modernizing our technology platforms, and acquiring four fintech companies. Expense management at Fifth Third is a continuous process and not a program. Since March of this year, full-time equivalent employee headcount is down 3.5%.  Turning to the balance sheet, we generated 4% average deposit growth compared to the year ago quarter versus a 5% decline for the industry. New relationship growth remains strong. Consumer households grew more than 2%, led by 6% growth in the Southeast, a continuation of our multi-year growth base. New middle market relationships added year-to-date remain 25% ahead of last year's record base.  Thanks to the release of the annual FDIC summary of deposits, the third quarter provides a unique opportunity to understand market share gains and losses on a metro area by metro area basis. This year, Fifth Third maintained or improved our market rank in every single one of our 40 largest MSAs.  In the Midwest, we maintained our #2 overall position behind JPMorgan Chase. In the Southeast, where we are just 4 years removed for opening our first next-gen branch, we have reached or are approaching target locational share in 8 of our original 11 focused markets. We intend to continue to open approximately 35 branches per year through 2028, at which time nearly 50% of our branches will be in Southeast markets. These market share gains are the byproduct of multiyear strategies that are not easily replicable by competitors. They include innovative operational deposit-oriented products like Momentum Banking, AI-driven customer acquisition strategies and the top quartile customer service model in addition to our investments in new branches.  Our key credit metrics remained strong during the quarter. Charge-offs were in line with our July expectations in both early stage delinquencies and non-performing assets improved sequentially. The ACL increased 3 basis points given slight changes to Moody's macroeconomic forecast.  Turning to liquidity and capital. We made significant progress against our goal to adapt early to expected changes in the regulatory framework. Our focused efforts throughout the bank enabled us to end the quarter with $103 billion in total liquidity sources and to achieve full Category 1 LCR compliance at the end of both August and September. During the quarter, we also made significant progress on our RWA optimization initiative. Total RWA declined 1% compared to the prior quarter. Our exercise should be complete by the end of the fourth quarter, so we can return to growing loans next year.  We created over 30 basis points of CET1 capital during the quarter, reflecting our strong earnings power while we also raised our quarterly dividend by 6%. With respect to the economy, while aggregate figures on spending and employment remains strong and market sentiment has shifted more in favor of a soft landing. We continue to be more cautious given concerning signals disguised beneath the aggregates. For example, while the most recent headline payroll numbers were strong, most, if not all, the job growth is a byproduct of more people working part-time jobs. Real average weekly earnings slipped every month during the quarter and the lower end of the consumer spectrum now maintains deposit balances below pre-COVID levels. Anecdotally, the last time Google searches for soft landing was this high was in May of 2008.  Before I turn it over, I want to say thank you to our employees for everything you do to take care of our customers, strengthen our communities and support one another. Your efforts are why Time Magazine recently recognized Fifth Third as one of the world's best companies, and why I am as confident as ever in Fifth Third's ability to outperform through the cycle and to deliver innovations that improve lives for all our stakeholders.  With that, Jamie will provide more details on our third quarter financial results and outlook. \nJames Leonard: Thank you, Tim, and thanks all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter results were once again strong despite the market headwinds. We continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity levels ahead of pending regulations while also managing our business very efficiently. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio below 55%, reflecting ongoing expense discipline throughout the bank and the continued diversification and resilience of our fee revenue streams.  Net interest income of approximately $1.45 billion decreased 1% sequentially. Our NII and NIM results reflect our proactive and continued defensive positioning given the uncertain economic and regulatory environments. Our short-term investments, which primarily represent our cash held at the Fed, increased $5 billion on an average basis and increased $8 billion on an end-of-period basis to $19 billion. This increased level of cash was the primary driver of our 12 basis point NIM decline.  Adjusted noninterest income increased 1% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in capital markets and deposit service charge revenue, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage revenue driven primarily by lower origination volumes. Our ability to produce strong capital markets revenue in a volatile market has become a key distinction for Fifth Third compared to many peers.  Adjusted noninterest expense increased just 2% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting growth in compensation and benefits, occupancy and technology expenses partially offset by continued expense discipline across the company.  Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially and due to softening customer demand and our RWA optimization efforts. Average C&I balances decreased 2% sequentially. As Tim mentioned, clients remain cautious with respect to their growth plans. Consequently, production was muted in corporate banking. Also, average CRE balances decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter. The period-end commercial revolver utilization rate of 36% increased 1% compared to last quarter, partially due to our exit of certain lower returning unused commercial commitments.  On a sequential basis, total corporate banking commitments and unused commitments decreased 3% and 4%, respectively, while total middle market commitments and unused commitments increased 5% and 7%, respectively. This trend highlights our capital optimization efforts while we continue to grow share in the middle market. Average total consumer portfolio loan and lease balances decreased 1% sequentially due to our intentional decline in indirect auto and the overall slowdown in residential mortgage originations, given the rate environment, partially offset by growth from dividend finance.  Our card balances increased just 1% this quarter, reflecting our conservative risk culture and focus on transactors. Balances have increased 3% relative to the year ago quarter compared to 11% for the industry. Average total deposits increased 3% sequentially as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were partially offset by a decline in demand deposits given the mix shift we have seen for several quarters. DDAs as a percent of core deposits were 28% for the quarter compared to 30% in the prior quarter. The 2-point decline was primarily due to the strong deposit growth in the denominator that Tim highlighted from our net new relationship growth in both consumer and commercial, which are obviously skewed to interest-bearing products in this environment.  As a result, we added more than $4 billion in core deposits during the quarter, the most since the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the DDA migration continued to show signs of deceleration this quarter and marked the smallest dollar decline in DDA balances since the onset of the rate hiking cycle. By segment, average consumer deposits increased 2% sequentially, and commercial deposits increased 4%, while wealth and asset management deposits declined 2% and reflecting clients' alternative investment options.  As a result of our balance sheet positioning and success adding new deposits, we achieved a loan to core deposit ratio of 74% and at quarter end, which should be one of the best, if not the best, compared to our regional peers. We also achieved full Category 1 LCR compliance at 118% at quarter end.  Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit has remained resilient. The net charge-off ratio of 41 basis points increased 12 basis points compared to the prior quarter as we expected, reflecting two credits, which had been fully reserved. Early stage delinquencies decreased 7% compared to the prior quarter, while loans 90 days past due, of just 2 basis points or a record low for Fifth Third.  Non-performing loans decreased 9%. This quarter marked the lowest inflows of commercial NPLs since the second quarter of 2022. From an overall credit management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on generating and maintaining high-quality relationships. As many of you know, we tightened underwriting standards during COVID, which limited our growth but improved the stability of our balance sheet.  In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained conservative underwriting policies. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall CRE concentration as a percent of total loans relative to peers for many years. Our criticized non-performing and delinquent CRE loans have all improved sequentially and remain very well behaved.  And within that, the same is true for our office exposures. For instance, criticized office loans represented just 5.4% of total office CRE, which improved 180 basis points sequentially. Additionally, we have zero delinquencies and zero charge-offs. We also decreased loan balances by 8% in the office book without any loan sales. These credit quality metrics are significantly better than peers who have reported their office exposure so far this quarter. While credit quality in the office portfolio has remained very strong, and we continue to believe the overall impact on Fifth Third will be limited. We nevertheless continue to watch it closely given the environment.  Our shared national credit portfolio also remains very strong from a credit quality perspective, with criticized assets, non-performing loans and net charge-offs consistently lower than the overall commercial portfolio across a multiyear period. Our credit resilience highlights our proactive risk culture. We continue to closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress throughout the entire portfolio as well as the fallout from the ongoing labor strike in the auto manufacturing sector, where we think our exposures are very manageable.  Moving to the ACL. Our reserves decreased $5 million, but the coverage ratio increased 3 basis points sequentially to 2.11% as the impact of lower period end loans was offset by a slightly worse overall base case economic outlook. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. Both the Moody's base scenario and the downside scenario used for the third quarter ACL assume a slightly worse average unemployment rate compared to the prior quarter. We maintained our scenario weightings of 80% to the base and 10% to each the upside and downside scenarios.  Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio increased 31 basis points sequentially ending the quarter at 9.8%. Our capital position reflects our ability to build capital quickly through our strong earnings generation, combined with the impact of our RWA diet. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 10% compared to the year ago quarter. We continue to expect improvement in our unrealized securities losses resulting in approximately 35% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2025 and approximately 2/3 by 2028, assuming the forward curve plays out.  Looking forward, we expect to build capital at an accelerated pace given our RWA optimization initiative and our continued deferment of share buybacks. We anticipate accreting capital such that our CET1 ratio ends this year above 10%.  Moving to our current outlook. We expect fourth quarter average total loan balances to decline 2% to 3% sequentially with consumer loans down 2% and commercial loans down 3%. The reflects our overall cautious economic outlook combined with one more quarter of our RWA diet as we are responding quickly to higher risk-adjusted return thresholds throughout the bank considering the economic and regulatory environments. We expect average deposits to be up slightly on a sequential basis. Within that, we expect core deposits to increase 1% due to our multiyear investments in the franchise to add households and primary commercial relationships, along with the benefit from seasonality. While we continue to expect modest migration from DDA into interest-bearing products in a higher for longer interest rate environment, specifically for the fourth quarter, we expect the mix of DDA to core deposits to remain relatively stable given those seasonal benefits.  Shifting to the income statement. We expect fourth quarter NII to be down approximately 1% to 2% sequentially due to the continued impacts of the balance sheet dynamics I mentioned. Our NII guidance assumes no additional rate hikes and a cumulative beta, which includes CDs and excludes DDAs of 55% by the fourth quarter. Excluding brokered deposits that we have been using as a replacement for other wholesale funding, given the pricing considerations, our cumulative beta expectation continues to be 53%. This outlook translates to total interest-bearing deposit costs increasing 15 basis points to 20 basis points in the fourth quarter.  Our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances remain relatively stable through year-end. As a byproduct of our strong deposit growth, combined with our loan outlook and stable securities balances, we expect to hold closer to $20 billion in cash and cash equivalents by year-end. Given these balance trends, we expect our loan to core deposit ratio to continue to move lower through the end of the year, which will keep Fifth Third in a strong liquidity position in anticipation of more stringent regulatory requirements, including remaining compliant with the full Category 1 LCR.  We expect fourth quarter adjusted noninterest income to increase 1% to 2% compared to the third quarter. We expect revenues to remain resilient across most captions driven by our multiyear focus on growing a diverse portfolio of fee businesses that should perform well in different economic environments. We expect fourth quarter TRA revenue of $22 million compared to $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect fourth quarter adjusted noninterest expenses to be stable to up 1% compared to the third quarter. Our guidance excludes the pending FDIC special assessment, which we currently estimate at $208 million for Fifth Third.  With respect to credit quality, we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be 30 basis points to 35 basis points. We do expect to gradually normalize from here. We continue to believe that are through the cycle, annual charge-offs will be in the 35 basis point to 45 basis point range given the credit risk profile of the bank. Given our reduced loan outlook, we expect the change in the ACL for the fourth quarter to be stable to up $25 million, assuming no significant changes in the underlying Moody's economic scenarios. This considers production from dividend finance of around $700 million in the fourth quarter, which as you know, carries a higher reserve level of around 9%.  In summary, with our proactive balance sheet management, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to meet the proposed regulatory requirements while continuing to generate long-term value for our shareholders.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. \nChris Doll: Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. \nScottSiefers: Jamie, I was hoping maybe you could expand even a little more on your thoughts on bringing in so many deposits in the third quarter. I know you're trying to get your liquidity to a certain very high level and you achieved it. But it was just a kind of astonishing number. So just curious as to what the thinking throughout the quarter was. I guess additional forward look though you provided some of the deposit commentary or expectations in there. But just any additional thoughts would be helpful, please. \nJamesLeonard: Thanks, Scott, for the question. We were certainly bringing the Victory bell on deposits this quarter. Really, when you take a look back, coming out of March Madness, one of the biggest drivers of our deposit success in the second quarter and the third quarter was really transitioning our customer recommendation engine from household growth to deposit growth. And while that sacrificed a little bit on the household growth numbers instead of our typical up 3% or up 4%, we were up 2% on households, but that translated to very strong consumer deposit growth. And so within the deposit growth we did have during the quarter of almost $4.8 billion, about 60% was commercial, 40% was consumer. And within consumer, 70% of that growth was in the Southeast markets, while 30% of that growth was in the Midwest. So again, the retail franchise at Fifth Third is just performing at an extremely high level.  And on the commercial side, the growth was surprisingly high given the corporate banking book growth within the commercial deposit growth. About 80% of the growth was in corporate banking. So at the time, we were targeting, let's get LCR, full LCR north of 100%. We actually came in at 118%. So definitely did better than we initially expected. But when we were dissecting the quarter end results, it really makes sense that the corporate banking book did better. And as one of sort of hidden benefits of the RWA diet is that we are getting better share of wallet within that corporate banking book, and that also helped drive the deposit growth. So overall, a very strong quarter. Again, for us on the deposit side, we expect continued growth in the fourth quarter, albeit at a little bit lower growth rate but still up a bit in the fourth quarter. \nScottSiefers: That's very helpful. And then if I could switch gears for just a second. The securities portfolio remarks, I guess you all might come out looking a little heavier than some others. But by the same token, you guys have been more hesitant to use the HTM classification as well. I guess just any updated thoughts on sort of how you're thinking about that. It at least optically, would help out levels, if not in terms of real world. But just curious to hear your updated thoughts. \nJamesLeonard: If you break it down between real world and regulatory world, that's really how we are looking at this in the real world with really the economic risk. Whenever you have a fixed rate asset, whether that's in AFS, HTM or in the loan portfolio, you have that economic risk to higher rates. We have elected to hold our securities in AFS, and we'll continue to do so, given that it gives us better flexibility and opportunity to reposition as the environment changes. But when you are in the real world managing the balance sheet, how we approach balance sheet management is in totality. And you can look at our strong NII results, our interest-bearing liability results, any of the measures relative to peers, the total balance sheet is performing very well. We're going to grow NII this year, 3% to 5%. Others are shrinking. So our philosophy is paying off in the real world.  The challenge simply comes from the fair value of a single line item and putting that into capital. We're not insensitive to how that looks on the face of the balance sheet and the tangible book value per share. But we still believe it is prudent to have that flexibility because flexibility has value. In terms of the regulatory risk, perhaps one of the details that we continue to evaluate as something we've not really communicated to all of you externally, is that given the burn down that you have in the presentation and the significant, whether it's static rate, forward rate, you're looking at 60%, 65% of the ASC burn down during the transition into the new capital regimes, assuming the rules play out as currently written, and that burn down is going to happen on our portfolio because our portfolio has structured. We have defined maturities unlike those portfolios that are in residential mortgage-backed, instruments with convexity and extension risk, we know our portfolio is going to pay down.  And we know that this is going to be very manageable from a regulatory capital perspective. When we model the capital impact at a fully phased-in level on AOCI, the impact on CET1 is about 125 basis points when you reach the third quarter of 2028 and that's why we continue to accrete CET1 is to be able to have sufficient regulatory capital for that world. And in fact, should rates get north of 8%. We would still be maintaining a CET1 well above regulatory minimums would be over 8% CET1 in that environment.  So we feel good about how we're positioned, how we will roll down the curve and ultimately, the regulatory capital. It's just one of the challenges in this environment with everything in AFS is that you have that mark on the tangible book value per share, that erosion. But at the same time, should rates fall. I think all of you would be very pleased with how much tangible book value accretion, we would report in that environment. \nTimothySpence: And Scott, if I just put a point on the last thing, Jamie you said. I mean, we believe investors want us to do what is best for managing the business and for recognizing the fact that options have value but if you believe that the AOCI mark is weighing on the stock, then the other way to look at it is the burn down is 25% accretion in tangible book value per share in the next two years, just given the current outlook on rates, which is a pretty unique buying opportunity, be the other way to look at it. \nScottSiefers: Yes, I agree. All right. That's perfect. So Tim and Jamie, thank you both. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. \nErikaNajarian: Jamie, this first one is for you. Not to belabor the earlier point, but all the PPNR metrics and balance sheet metrics look great and also did the forward look? And I guess, if you could just explain what happened in the quarter, I think given that your portfolio -- your securities portfolio is 61% CMBS. I think investors that know you well, expected not as much negative convexity -- was there something unique that happened in this quarter in the portfolio that -- where the AOCI was that much wider? \nJamesLeonard: Not really. It was a pretty vanilla quarter for us where we had cash flows in the quarter of about $500 million. We put about $700 million to work of the excess cash in short duration Level 1 treasury floaters. When you look at the AOCI walk that happened in the quarter, the securities portfolio because everything is in AFS, worsened about $1.2 billion and if you look at how the 5-year move increased about 45 basis points, the 10-year moved to about 75% and then spreads widen 5 bps on the CMBS and about 15 bps in mortgage. So when you add it all up with the DV01 of about $25 million, that gets you to the AOCI movement for the quarter on the investment portfolio. And so it was in line at least with our expectations with how rates were moving during the quarter. \nErikaNajarian: And my follow-up question was for you, Tim. I think it was a very powerful statement you said in the beginning of the call in terms of confidence that you could return to loan growth next year. I think several of your peers that have similar CET1 ratios and similar AOCI marks are still talking about dieting. Could you give us a sense of, first of all, if you could confirm what the AOCI was in basis points, Jamie? And second, Tim, how are you balancing on one hand, the market wants you to continue to build capital as we approach that transitional date on CET1? And on the other, we're still hearing low demand from corporates for financing. \nTimothySpence: So there's a lot in there. But that's the right question, Erica. So a few things here. One, I think, we have tried to be consistent in how we confront change or a need for change in how we operate the company. And the underlying principle here is that if you have to make a change, it's better to do it quickly so that you can get it behind you and return at normal mode of operations. So we have been aggressive in building liquidity. Jamie talked about the fact that we were Cat-1 LCR compliant in both August and September this year. And I think equivalently, we have tried to be very proactive about how we manage through the RWA diet.  So we have one additional quarter to go of dieting to hit our RWA target, which was about a 2% reduction, if you just look at what we're expecting in the fourth quarter. And from there, we'll have achieved what we think we need to achieve in order to be able to refocus on growing the balance sheet. Prudently, I should say, growing the loan portfolio prudently sequentially over the course of the next year. We have the benefit of a very high level of profitability right now, right? We obviously don't have all of the peer reports at this point. But if you look at the core profitability measures here, they're excellent. We're generating 30-plus basis points of CET1 a quarter, which is quite helpful as it relates to being able to both build capital and fund loan growth.  And then while demand is tepid, across the sector. We have some idiosyncratic benefits here that probably have been a little bit lost behind the diet in the form of both dividend and provide, which continue to perform very well and generate growth. And the sustained multiyear investment we've made in expanding our middle market coverage in the Southeast markets, the middle-market relationships in terms of the new relationships we've added in the company year-to-date, are 25% ahead of our all-time record pace.  And we still have bankers who are seasoning in in terms of building their portfolios that we have been fortunate to hire over the course of the past few years. So that -- those are the things that really provide the catalyst in an environment where demand in aggregate is a little bit more tepid and then the raw capacity in the form of capital generation to be able to support that statement that we can return to growth next year. \nJamesLeonard: And then, Erika, on your other components of the question, CET1 for us finished the quarter at 9.8%. Excluding the investment portfolio, AOCI, that number would be 6.3%. And then the RWA bloat from the pending rules would be about 2% to 3% of RWA, which is about 20 basis points. So we would look to be at a 6.1 level. But as we talked about then, the earnings power of the company is very strong. We continue to defer the buybacks. We'll continue to accrete capital and with the passage of time, given the structure in the investment portfolio. The burn down of that AOCI will be 65% or so by the time we reach the fully phased-in level. So we feel that this is a very manageable timeline for the company. In fact, have a lot of cushion should rates even go higher. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. \nGerardCassidy: Tim, coming back to your opening comments about your corporate and commercial customers being cautious and you yourself seeing some of the economic cross wins or cross currents being cautious. I noticed yesterday that the real GDP number that the Atlanta Fed puts out for the third quarter, is calling for a 5.4% real GDP growth in the third quarter. It's probably too high. But the point is there are a lot of cross currents. Can you share with us when you talk to your customers, what do you think is going to take them to become more optimistic and most cautious? Is it a Fed halting and increasing short-term interest rates? Is it better inflation numbers? What do you think they're waiting for before they really start committing to borrowing more money and growing their businesses? \nTimothySpence: That's a great question, Gerard. I think, honestly, it's less uncertainty, right? So to your point. So you have a lot of variables underway here. You have the Fed and rates, as you mentioned, you have an immense amount of government spending right now, which is propping up economic growth in certain sectors of the economy that otherwise wouldn't be there. You have sort of unusual times in the housing market, where we have both high rates and still stable or even in some markets, slightly growing home prices, even the home affordability is at an all-time low.  And it's just, I think, more than anything else, we need to see some of those variables get fixed, right, in terms of what happens. So if the Fed stops raising rates and then introduces a cut, I think that would be helpful. I think that we have to see the last of the stimulus dollars come out of consumer accounts and see what the floor looks like in terms of consumer spending. And then I think we have to have a better sense for what the underlying economic activity looks like in areas where the government spending the $2.3 trillion that are coming out of the various government programs are not driving a lot of the economic activity for people to get a little bit more focused. Because again, what I hear and went out to the opportunity to get feedback from about 3 dozen clients shortly before the call here, is they're seeing a gradual slowdown that is essentially disposable income. They're seeing disparities on the consumer side between either the businesses or take hotels, hotel properties that either cater to retired people or to high-end consumers in high-end destinations continue to do well, whereas the mass market properties are starting to soften. We hear them on the B2B side being much more guarded as it relates to liquidity and monitoring cash and adjusting staffing levels and just delaying the larger CapEx investments here.  And I think an interesting data point, as I had the chance to spend a little bit of time with the head of economic development for one of the large states in our footprint and I was asking about the new project pipeline. So yes, pipeline is still robust. There's a lot of discussion going on, but the time to decision from when they're initially contacted about a potential opportunity for either a new plant or a headquarter relocation or otherwise to the award in a given state has moved from 200 days as recently as 18 months ago to over 500 days. So you can just see the grind down here of economic activity as people sit on the sidelines and wait to get a better sense for what direction we're headed on the economy. \nGerardCassidy: Thank you, Tim. Very insightful. And then on credit, tying into maybe the economic comments that you just made, and I don't know if this is sort of Greg and Jamie. But can you share with us -- Jamie, you showed some very strong credit numbers prepared remarks. And can you tell us, is it better underwriting, if you look back to the financial crisis, through the cycle, net charge-off ratio, I guess it's quite a bit higher than what you're thinking today?  And then second, is it also your customers, because of the pandemic and what they went through, are they just better managed today from a balance sheet perspective than was the case pre-financial crisis? \nGregSchroeck: It's Greg. It's a great question. I think it's all of the above, right? I think we have been very disciplined, very fundamental about our through-the-cycle underwriting for the past several years. We've been very disciplined around our concentration in geographically or by product, right? So we have a very well-diversified portfolio. As a result, we're not seeing trending one way or the other. So we've just been disciplined around that. We've been disciplined around ongoing portfolio management, right? So we are proactive. We're getting out ahead of issues when they arise. We are stress testing 200 basis points ahead of the yield curve, forward-looking yield curve. And we've seen throughout the cycles. To the extent we get out ahead of this and we identified issues earlier, we minimize. We also have the ability then to bring solutions to our clients, right, to help them through some of these cycles.  And so we're seeing all of that across the board, be it in our commercial real estate portfolio, very diverse. We weren't as aggressive in that portfolio as some other banks were when rates were 550 basis points lower and the same thing through our C&I book. So it's fundamental, sticking to those fundamentals, staying disciplined, both on the front-end underwriting, client selection and then staying on top of the portfolio. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. \nEbrahimPoonawala: I guess maybe just following up on Gerard's question on the macro and credit. Tim, just if you can add to your comments there's still some concern that we could hit a recession first half of next year could drive significant deterioration in credit quality. One, how much of a visibility do you have into credit change over the next few quarters where you can safely say that's unlikely. And maybe, Jamie, just talk to us about the ability of the CECL model to capture that kind of deterioration ahead of time. \nTimothySpence: So good morning Ebrahim, it's good to chat. I think a couple of comments. So narrowly to your point, I think we have fairly good visibility into what the first half of the year is going to look like. And we're not seeing anything at the moment that would suggest that we're headed toward credit deterioration in the first half, right? We talked about it in the script delinquency formation that delinquency rates are actually down on the early-stage basis. NPAs are down sequentially, and we have a roll forward for you in the appendix. The slides, which would indicate that, that trend is likely to continue through the fourth quarter. And on the consumer side, just as an example, the nice thing about the way that we manage delinquencies is it's like an assembly line. So you can see in the zero to 29 and then the 30-plus buckets what you're going to be dealing with or early next year, and there just isn't anything in there to be worried about.  With that said, the base case we're using as we think about the management of the company, strategic investments, how we manage expenses and otherwise, continues to assume that maybe the market is a little bit too bullish on the idea of a soft landing here. I mean again, you just look at the payroll numbers, so -- and apply a human lens to it. So jobs are up, but job participation is flat. Labor force participation is flat. And average hours worked are down and unemployment stable. What that means is you have more people working two jobs because they're not getting enough hours or earning enough money at the job that they were working, the base job that they were working to be able to cover their expenses.  So when you then look at declining real incomes, the only thing that really would be standing between somebody who is having to work two jobs and is still suffering from a declining real income and credit delinquency is the fact that there was the stimulus buffer that built up because people had forbearance on loan portfolios and stimulus dollars. Well, the student loans are back now. Housing inflation is still very high at 7.2%, I think, in the most recent prints. And those are just early indicators that there are people across the country that are struggling a lot more than the headline numbers would suggest.  So I feel good because the two areas I would say the market is most worried about right now are subprime consumers and renters where we have very little in the way of exposure on virtually no subprime, I think the lowest level there of any of our peers who provide information on that front and 85% of the consumer exposure is to homeowners. And then in commercial real estate, where, again, our exposure relative to total capital is lower than anybody else's. And because we weren't trying to grow that portfolio materially, we're able to be much more selective, which is reflected in superior credit metrics right now when you look at our commercial real estate book relative to others. So it's both smaller and better performing. \nJamesLeonard: And in terms of how the consumer is doing and what we see in our data, the average consumer balance is still deposit balance is still 15% above pre-COVID levels. But to Tim's point, renters are back to pre-COVID levels and sub-660 FICOs are actually below pre-COVID level. So the averages can be a little bit misleading in terms of what credit outcomes may bring in 2024. But as Tim said, we're certainly well positioned from a credit perspective on our balance sheet.  And from an ACL perspective on the second part of your question, the scenarios we use from Moody's have GDP contracting almost near zero. So the modeling certainly picks up erosion in the forecast. In this quarter, you had a slight erosion both in GDP and unemployment as well as with corporate profits and that was part of the reason or the primary reason why our ACL coverage increased from 208 basis points to 211 basis points. It's just we had the benefits of the loan balance reduction and the unused commitment reductions from RWA optimization efforts that offset that. \nEbrahimPoonawala: That's helpful. And just as a separate question. In terms of deposit pricing, as we look through next year and if rates don't get cut in higher for longer, are you observing any differences within your geographies, Midwest versus Southeast? Clearly, you're opening a lot of branches in the Southeast. So you have a different strategy there. I assume relative to the home market. Just give us a sense of pricing competition, any differences? And in your view, is deposit pricing now essentially national in nature? Or is it still localized where certain markets could meaningfully outperform or lag in -- on the pricing side? \nJamesLeonard: Excellent question. I'll start and then turn it over to Bryan. In terms of total deposit cost and deposit pricing, the quarter played out as expected with our beta ticking up from total deposits, excluding brokered to 50%. We expect that to hit the 53% beta we talked about a quarter or two ago. So the pricing is playing out as we had expected. And I think most of the bank's beta guides are coming up to where we've been at this hire for longer scenario. But in terms of each geography, Bryan, do you want to touch on that? \nBryanPreston: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Jamie. In general, I think what we're seeing is that it's a combination of -- it is local and a national impact right now. And what you're seeing is that you may have periods of time where the dominant players or the bigger players in specific markets may just have a lower liquidity need. And so that gives you a little bit of an opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive and do well from a share perspective. But what we've seen since March is that tends to rotate around a little bit.  And ultimately, as people start to realize as deposit competition is moving in the market, you're just seeing people then start to react. Your most rate-sensitive customers are absolutely focused on the national markets. They tend to be the ones that are most willing to use a non-traditional provider, and so you definitely see some of that. But in general, it tends to -- you still tend to have some opportunity to take advantage of some geographic differences, but those geographic differences can rotate over time. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. \nKennethUsdin: I think you guys said in the conference season that the fourth quarter would likely be the bottom for NIM and the first quarter of next year will be the bottom for NII dollars. Just wondering, given the guide you gave today, if that still foots to that and anything we should be thinking about in terms of getting to that NII bottoming? \nJamesLeonard: The first quarter, the day count is what will drive that NII trough. The NIM whether it's the fourth quarter or the first quarter is going to be driven solely by how much excess cash we have from the strong deposit performance. So we'll see, but it's going to be one of those 2 quarters. \nKennethUsdin: And then as you think forward, how do we understand the benefit that you'll get once rates get to a peak about fixed rate loan repricing. I think it's clear to understand how the securities book moves. But on the loan side, can you walk us through just how much benefit you might be able to see as we get into next year from that side being able to offset any lagging deposit pricing? \nJamesLeonard: The consumer book, in particular, is where most of the fixed rate repricing benefit resides. If you look at 2024, we'll have about $8 billion of consumer loan payoffs is how we model it. And front book rates are 200 basis points to 300 basis points higher than back book rates. And so if you take that, coupled with, call it, $4 billion in security maturities and cash flows you end up with about $300 million tailwind on an annualized basis. Obviously, that will happen during the course of 2024, so take half of that for the in-year effect. But you're looking at $300 million type of run rate benefit just from one year's repricing. \nKennethUsdin: If I could just ask one last one. The swap slide you have just talks about the '25 -- 2025 versus '23 update. Is there anything different or any thought process different about some other banks have been adding securities based swaps to protect capital and add a little variable rate juice? Have you done anything like that incrementally? Or is that slide looks pretty intact in terms of how you're approaching swap portfolios of both loans and securities? \nBryanPreston: We've done nothing incremental at this point. Obviously, we're paying attention to the market and evaluating opportunities. I think more than anything the, as Jamie mentioned, the lower lockout structure of our portfolio ultimately is our hedge to higher rates right now because we now have those defined maturities that are going to come in, and we think that keeps us relatively well positioned. But we're constantly keeping an eye on the market and figuring out if there are opportunities for us to continue to improve our positioning. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. \nMichaelMayo: I guess this goes in the category of no good deed goes unpunished. Your efficiency ratio of 55%, do you think that can improve next year, which is another way of saying is there any shot at getting positive operating leverage? And when I give the positives and negatives, and correct me, it looks like from the negative, the RWA diet certainly helps capital, but has a cost to NII. And I think you mentioned NII not bottoming maybe until first second quarter. You have the cumulative beta going up to 53%. It's in line, but still going higher. You're opening 35 new branches a year.  On the other hand, your RWA will end and maybe you can lean into the balance sheet more. You mentioned the deposits, the smallest DDA increase since March, the excess cash, which you could choose to put to work, so really part of the tailwind is the asset beta relative to the deposit beta. So does your efficiency improve next year? Can you get positive operating leverage? Is that too much of a stretch? How do you think about that? \nJamesLeonard: I think it will be environment dependent, which I'm sure is not the answer we want. But I think you hit on all the right points, Mike, which is the RWA diet makes positive operating leverage difficult in 2024. With that said, we will do everything in our power to deliver as good a results as we can, but I think it will be a challenge in 2024. \nTimothySpence: The old saying is Cincinnati invented hustle, so we're going to work as hard as we possibly can on that front. \nMichaelMayo: And just clarification on the credit side. Did I hear you correctly, you have zero office delinquencies, zero office charge-offs. Commercial, you have the lowest inflows to NPA since 2Q '22. You reiterated 35 basis points to 45 basis points through the cycle. Is that correct? And I know it's been asked already, but you're saying the economy is grinding lower doesn't look good. So you just say you're credit is economically insensitive at this point? I mean that's like -- do you think you could maybe be wrong if things don't go so well. \nTimothySpence: Until you got to the last part there, I was going to say in a word, yes. But then you made the question a little more complicated. If you want to...? \nJamesLeonard: All of those facts are correct, and we feel very good about all of the work we've done on the credit portfolio over the last 15 years. In terms of it being economically insensitive, no, but within any industry, there are going to be winners and losers, and that's where it comes down to that client selection that Greg referenced. We just believe we are very well positioned, and we've been very diligent and part of the benefit that we're getting right now is the fact that we were not stretching for loan growth over the past several years and we probably had the lowest loan growth guides over the past several years running. And so back to our priorities of stability and profitability ahead of growth. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI. \nJohnPancari: Just on the credit side. I know you mentioned that the new NPA inflows were the lowest since the second quarter of '22, excluding the large charged-off items, I guess, could you maybe talk about the sustainability of that? What are you seeing in terms of risk migration and some of your internal risk ratings and everything? Do you think the inflows are likely to remain that low at this point? And what's the driver of the pressure? Is it the areas everybody suspects in terms of CRE or is it more on the C&I side? \nTimothySpence: It's not on the CRE side, great question. Not on the CRE side, we're not seeing. It doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. We're watching that portfolio. Clearly, there's stress in that portfolio, but we have so little of it, that's not driving. And as I said earlier, we don't have any geographic or product trends. There's not an industry that's driving our NPA numbers as we sit here today, we have very little from a delinquency standpoint.  And so again, it gets back to how diverse the portfolio is. Yes, I still think we've got some pressure on the 550 basis point rate increase that will flow through to our clients. But we're on top of the portfolio. It's why we're stressing 200 basis points ahead of the yield curve. So we get out ahead of that stuff. And so could it go up a little bit given all the cross-currents, sure, but I think we're in a great spot. Our client selection has been outstanding. Our through the cycle, very disciplined fundamental underwriting I think gets us through this cycle. And so I feel good about where we are today. And even if it goes up a little bit, it's very controllable. \nJohnPancari: And then secondly, kind of a two-parter. Do you have -- I know you mentioned the criticized loans are down in total this quarter versus last. You have the magnitude of that decline? And then on the Shared National Credit side, the portfolio of 29% of loans, I think over the past year that maybe is down a touch. I mean, do you expect that you're going to reduce the size of the Shared National Credit book? And also what is the criticized ratio for that portfolio? \nTimothySpence: So we reduced the -- it is about 29%, you're right. We reduced that portfolio by about 7% year-to-date, given the diving that Jamie talked about earlier, I would expect that number to probably continue to decline between now and year-end. Our portfolio -- that SNC portfolio performs better than on every metric than the rest of the portfolio. So it's under 6% from a criticized asset standpoint. Delinquencies are less than we see in the rest of the book. NPAs are less. So it is some of our strongest performing of the portfolio -- the commercial portfolio. \nJamesLeonard: John, it's Jamie. The crit office loans were what I referenced that declined 180 basis points. Crits overall, were up just a little bit. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia Morgan Stanley. \nMananGosalia: I wanted to follow up on the RWA diet and the trajectory of rates. I guess does it move into the annual impact how you manage that. So from here, we get the annual moving up 1% or down 1%. Does that impact how you will manage loans? And as we look into next year, what would cause you to maybe lean into low growth? And what would cause you to peel back? Is it just the outlook on credit, what you're seeing there? Or could the rate outlook impact that as well? \nBryanPreston: Yes, it's Bryan. I would tell you that the outlook on rates has a modest impact on how we think of loans, but it's more about just composition and more in consumer where we may see some additional opportunity or relative asset classes, you might feel a little bit better about some of the spreads in auto. You're going to see almost no mortgage production in a higher rate environment, obviously. And that's probably the biggest implication just given that our commercial portfolio is primarily floating rate, doesn't really have a big impact from a floating rate portfolio perspective. And it really for us comes down to overall macro, how we feel about what the credit outlook is going to be and whether or not we're earning adequate returns on the capital we're deploying. \nMananGosalia: And then just from a cash perspective, it seems like the build was a little bit more than you guided to before? I think you had said about $15 billion or so in cash is what you were targeting before. I think you're target has now moved to $20 billion. What's driving the change? Is it the volatility in rates? Is it just preparation for LCR? Or is it also just that you can get 5.5% of cash and makes more sense to hold cash over securities? \nJamesLeonard: It was mostly the fact that deposit growth outpaced expectations. And in this environment, we want to hold excess cash as opposed to doing anything, adding it to the investment portfolio. We certainly view cash as an asset allocation at these rates, as you referenced. \nMananGosalia: So it sounds like at some point, you'd be able to bring that $20 billion down. It might not be in the next 6 months or so. But as rate volatility improves, you might be able to bring that down? \nJamesLeonard: Yes, I would say that our balance sheet is elevated due to a couple of reasons. One, the unrealized losses, whether you have an AFS or HTM, you do have to fund those losses in your liquidity buffers. And so should those losses come down, that certainly frees up cash to shrink the sheet or over time as our non-HQLA allocation matures, we will reinvest that in shorter duration level 1s and also allow us to maintain an above 100%, while also shrinking the sheet. It's just -- both of those things are going to be measured more years than in quarters in terms of the cash coming down. \nMananGosalia: So just as a clarification then, does that make you more asset sensitive, all things equal now versus, say, last year? \nJamesLeonard: We're pretty neutral right now, how that lines up versus last year, probably a little asset sensitive a year ago, whereas today, we're neutral to at least in the disclosure showing liability sensitive. \nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott. \nChristopherMarinac: I know you mentioned a little bit about credit and previous questions. But generally speaking, is the criticized and classified number is going to be within a certain band in the next several quarters? Or do you see them rising more than that? \nJamesLeonard: I would say steady based on what we're seeing now from the delinquency and NPA, all the above and our ongoing portfolio, in the last 12 months, we have rerated 95-plus percent of the portfolio. So based on all of that underwriting or reunderwriting, if you will, I'm expecting steady. \nChristopherMarinac: And if it went higher than you think that would obviously drive more provisions and obviously more reserve build next year, just all things being equal. Is that fair? \nJamesLeonard: Sure. Yes. \nChristopherMarinac: Great. Thanks for all the background and information this morning. We appreciate it. \nOperator: And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Chris Doll for some final closing remarks. \nChris Doll: Thanks, Rob, and thanks, everyone else, for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the IR department if you have any follow-up questions. Rob, you can now disconnect the line. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "It's Greg. It's a great question. I think it's all of the above, right? I think we have been very disciplined, very fundamental about our through-the-cycle underwriting for the past several years. We've been very disciplined around our concentration in geographically or by product, right? So we have a very well-diversified portfolio. As a result, we're not seeing trending one way or the other. So we've just been disciplined around that. We've been disciplined around ongoing portfolio management, right? So we are proactive. We're getting out ahead of issues when they arise. We are stress testing 200 basis points ahead of the yield curve, forward-looking yield curve. And we've seen throughout the cycles. To the extent we get out ahead of this and we identified issues earlier, we minimize. We also have the ability then to bring solutions to our clients, right, to help them through some of these cycles.  And so we're seeing all of that across the board, be it in our commercial real estate portfolio, very diverse. We weren't as aggressive in that portfolio as some other banks were when rates were 550 basis points lower and the same thing through our C&I book. So it's fundamental, sticking to those fundamentals, staying disciplined, both on the front-end underwriting, client selection and then staying on top of the portfolio."

            "name": "Timothy Spence",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We believe that great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate challenging ones. That is why we focus on stability, profitability, and growth in that order. It is also why I am so pleased that our key return and profitability metrics remain resilient despite the market-related headwinds that all banks are facing. Earlier today, we reported earnings per share of $0.91 or $0.92 excluding a one set impact from our Visa swap, reflecting strong PPNR results and favorable credit outcomes. We generated an adjusted return on tangible common equity ex-AOCI of nearly 16%, which increased 50 basis points sequentially, and a return on assets of 1.26%. We generated strong fee growth compared to the year ago quarter, supported by a more diverse range of fee income streams than peers, and our investments in treasury management, capital markets, and wealth management. Our third quarter total non-interest expense increased less than 2% compared to the year ago quarter, and we generated an adjusted efficiency ratio below 55%. In the last four years, we have managed expenses to the lowest growth rate among peers, despite also investing in growth by building more new branches, raising our minimum wage, modernizing our technology platforms, and acquiring four fintech companies. Expense management at Fifth Third is a continuous process and not a program. Since March of this year, full-time equivalent employee headcount is down 3.5%.  Turning to the balance sheet, we generated 4% average deposit growth compared to the year ago quarter versus a 5% decline for the industry. New relationship growth remains strong. Consumer households grew more than 2%, led by 6% growth in the Southeast, a continuation of our multi-year growth base. New middle market relationships added year-to-date remain 25% ahead of last year's record base.  Thanks to the release of the annual FDIC summary of deposits, the third quarter provides a unique opportunity to understand market share gains and losses on a metro area by metro area basis. This year, Fifth Third maintained or improved our market rank in every single one of our 40 largest MSAs.  In the Midwest, we maintained our #2 overall position behind JPMorgan Chase. In the Southeast, where we are just 4 years removed for opening our first next-gen branch, we have reached or are approaching target locational share in 8 of our original 11 focused markets. We intend to continue to open approximately 35 branches per year through 2028, at which time nearly 50% of our branches will be in Southeast markets. These market share gains are the byproduct of multiyear strategies that are not easily replicable by competitors. They include innovative operational deposit-oriented products like Momentum Banking, AI-driven customer acquisition strategies and the top quartile customer service model in addition to our investments in new branches.  Our key credit metrics remained strong during the quarter. Charge-offs were in line with our July expectations in both early stage delinquencies and non-performing assets improved sequentially. The ACL increased 3 basis points given slight changes to Moody's macroeconomic forecast.  Turning to liquidity and capital. We made significant progress against our goal to adapt early to expected changes in the regulatory framework. Our focused efforts throughout the bank enabled us to end the quarter with $103 billion in total liquidity sources and to achieve full Category 1 LCR compliance at the end of both August and September. During the quarter, we also made significant progress on our RWA optimization initiative. Total RWA declined 1% compared to the prior quarter. Our exercise should be complete by the end of the fourth quarter, so we can return to growing loans next year.  We created over 30 basis points of CET1 capital during the quarter, reflecting our strong earnings power while we also raised our quarterly dividend by 6%. With respect to the economy, while aggregate figures on spending and employment remains strong and market sentiment has shifted more in favor of a soft landing. We continue to be more cautious given concerning signals disguised beneath the aggregates. For example, while the most recent headline payroll numbers were strong, most, if not all, the job growth is a byproduct of more people working part-time jobs. Real average weekly earnings slipped every month during the quarter and the lower end of the consumer spectrum now maintains deposit balances below pre-COVID levels. Anecdotally, the last time Google searches for soft landing was this high was in May of 2008.  Before I turn it over, I want to say thank you to our employees for everything you do to take care of our customers, strengthen our communities and support one another. Your efforts are why Time Magazine recently recognized Fifth Third as one of the world's best companies, and why I am as confident as ever in Fifth Third's ability to outperform through the cycle and to deliver innovations that improve lives for all our stakeholders.  With that, Jamie will provide more details on our third quarter financial results and outlook. And Scott, if I just put a point on the last thing, Jamie you said. I mean, we believe investors want us to do what is best for managing the business and for recognizing the fact that options have value but if you believe that the AOCI mark is weighing on the stock, then the other way to look at it is the burn down is 25% accretion in tangible book value per share in the next two years, just given the current outlook on rates, which is a pretty unique buying opportunity, be the other way to look at it. So there's a lot in there. But that's the right question, Erica. So a few things here. One, I think, we have tried to be consistent in how we confront change or a need for change in how we operate the company. And the underlying principle here is that if you have to make a change, it's better to do it quickly so that you can get it behind you and return at normal mode of operations. So we have been aggressive in building liquidity. Jamie talked about the fact that we were Cat-1 LCR compliant in both August and September this year. And I think equivalently, we have tried to be very proactive about how we manage through the RWA diet.  So we have one additional quarter to go of dieting to hit our RWA target, which was about a 2% reduction, if you just look at what we're expecting in the fourth quarter. And from there, we'll have achieved what we think we need to achieve in order to be able to refocus on growing the balance sheet. Prudently, I should say, growing the loan portfolio prudently sequentially over the course of the next year. We have the benefit of a very high level of profitability right now, right? We obviously don't have all of the peer reports at this point. But if you look at the core profitability measures here, they're excellent. We're generating 30-plus basis points of CET1 a quarter, which is quite helpful as it relates to being able to both build capital and fund loan growth.  And then while demand is tepid, across the sector. We have some idiosyncratic benefits here that probably have been a little bit lost behind the diet in the form of both dividend and provide, which continue to perform very well and generate growth. And the sustained multiyear investment we've made in expanding our middle market coverage in the Southeast markets, the middle-market relationships in terms of the new relationships we've added in the company year-to-date, are 25% ahead of our all-time record pace.  And we still have bankers who are seasoning in in terms of building their portfolios that we have been fortunate to hire over the course of the past few years. So that -- those are the things that really provide the catalyst in an environment where demand in aggregate is a little bit more tepid and then the raw capacity in the form of capital generation to be able to support that statement that we can return to growth next year. That's a great question, Gerard. I think, honestly, it's less uncertainty, right? So to your point. So you have a lot of variables underway here. You have the Fed and rates, as you mentioned, you have an immense amount of government spending right now, which is propping up economic growth in certain sectors of the economy that otherwise wouldn't be there. You have sort of unusual times in the housing market, where we have both high rates and still stable or even in some markets, slightly growing home prices, even the home affordability is at an all-time low.  And it's just, I think, more than anything else, we need to see some of those variables get fixed, right, in terms of what happens. So if the Fed stops raising rates and then introduces a cut, I think that would be helpful. I think that we have to see the last of the stimulus dollars come out of consumer accounts and see what the floor looks like in terms of consumer spending. And then I think we have to have a better sense for what the underlying economic activity looks like in areas where the government spending the $2.3 trillion that are coming out of the various government programs are not driving a lot of the economic activity for people to get a little bit more focused. Because again, what I hear and went out to the opportunity to get feedback from about 3 dozen clients shortly before the call here, is they're seeing a gradual slowdown that is essentially disposable income. They're seeing disparities on the consumer side between either the businesses or take hotels, hotel properties that either cater to retired people or to high-end consumers in high-end destinations continue to do well, whereas the mass market properties are starting to soften. We hear them on the B2B side being much more guarded as it relates to liquidity and monitoring cash and adjusting staffing levels and just delaying the larger CapEx investments here.  And I think an interesting data point, as I had the chance to spend a little bit of time with the head of economic development for one of the large states in our footprint and I was asking about the new project pipeline. So yes, pipeline is still robust. There's a lot of discussion going on, but the time to decision from when they're initially contacted about a potential opportunity for either a new plant or a headquarter relocation or otherwise to the award in a given state has moved from 200 days as recently as 18 months ago to over 500 days. So you can just see the grind down here of economic activity as people sit on the sidelines and wait to get a better sense for what direction we're headed on the economy. So good morning Ebrahim, it's good to chat. I think a couple of comments. So narrowly to your point, I think we have fairly good visibility into what the first half of the year is going to look like. And we're not seeing anything at the moment that would suggest that we're headed toward credit deterioration in the first half, right? We talked about it in the script delinquency formation that delinquency rates are actually down on the early-stage basis. NPAs are down sequentially, and we have a roll forward for you in the appendix. The slides, which would indicate that, that trend is likely to continue through the fourth quarter. And on the consumer side, just as an example, the nice thing about the way that we manage delinquencies is it's like an assembly line. So you can see in the zero to 29 and then the 30-plus buckets what you're going to be dealing with or early next year, and there just isn't anything in there to be worried about.  With that said, the base case we're using as we think about the management of the company, strategic investments, how we manage expenses and otherwise, continues to assume that maybe the market is a little bit too bullish on the idea of a soft landing here. I mean again, you just look at the payroll numbers, so -- and apply a human lens to it. So jobs are up, but job participation is flat. Labor force participation is flat. And average hours worked are down and unemployment stable. What that means is you have more people working two jobs because they're not getting enough hours or earning enough money at the job that they were working, the base job that they were working to be able to cover their expenses.  So when you then look at declining real incomes, the only thing that really would be standing between somebody who is having to work two jobs and is still suffering from a declining real income and credit delinquency is the fact that there was the stimulus buffer that built up because people had forbearance on loan portfolios and stimulus dollars. Well, the student loans are back now. Housing inflation is still very high at 7.2%, I think, in the most recent prints. And those are just early indicators that there are people across the country that are struggling a lot more than the headline numbers would suggest.  So I feel good because the two areas I would say the market is most worried about right now are subprime consumers and renters where we have very little in the way of exposure on virtually no subprime, I think the lowest level there of any of our peers who provide information on that front and 85% of the consumer exposure is to homeowners. And then in commercial real estate, where, again, our exposure relative to total capital is lower than anybody else's. And because we weren't trying to grow that portfolio materially, we're able to be much more selective, which is reflected in superior credit metrics right now when you look at our commercial real estate book relative to others. So it's both smaller and better performing. The old saying is Cincinnati invented hustle, so we're going to work as hard as we possibly can on that front. Until you got to the last part there, I was going to say in a word, yes. But then you made the question a little more complicated. If you want to...? It's not on the CRE side, great question. Not on the CRE side, we're not seeing. It doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. We're watching that portfolio. Clearly, there's stress in that portfolio, but we have so little of it, that's not driving. And as I said earlier, we don't have any geographic or product trends. There's not an industry that's driving our NPA numbers as we sit here today, we have very little from a delinquency standpoint.  And so again, it gets back to how diverse the portfolio is. Yes, I still think we've got some pressure on the 550 basis point rate increase that will flow through to our clients. But we're on top of the portfolio. It's why we're stressing 200 basis points ahead of the yield curve. So we get out ahead of that stuff. And so could it go up a little bit given all the cross-currents, sure, but I think we're in a great spot. Our client selection has been outstanding. Our through the cycle, very disciplined fundamental underwriting I think gets us through this cycle. And so I feel good about where we are today. And even if it goes up a little bit, it's very controllable. So we reduced the -- it is about 29%, you're right. We reduced that portfolio by about 7% year-to-date, given the diving that Jamie talked about earlier, I would expect that number to probably continue to decline between now and year-end. Our portfolio -- that SNC portfolio performs better than on every metric than the rest of the portfolio. So it's under 6% from a criticized asset standpoint. Delinquencies are less than we see in the rest of the book. NPAs are less. So it is some of our strongest performing of the portfolio -- the commercial portfolio."

            "name": "James Leonard",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and thanks all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter results were once again strong despite the market headwinds. We continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity levels ahead of pending regulations while also managing our business very efficiently. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio below 55%, reflecting ongoing expense discipline throughout the bank and the continued diversification and resilience of our fee revenue streams.  Net interest income of approximately $1.45 billion decreased 1% sequentially. Our NII and NIM results reflect our proactive and continued defensive positioning given the uncertain economic and regulatory environments. Our short-term investments, which primarily represent our cash held at the Fed, increased $5 billion on an average basis and increased $8 billion on an end-of-period basis to $19 billion. This increased level of cash was the primary driver of our 12 basis point NIM decline.  Adjusted noninterest income increased 1% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in capital markets and deposit service charge revenue, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage revenue driven primarily by lower origination volumes. Our ability to produce strong capital markets revenue in a volatile market has become a key distinction for Fifth Third compared to many peers.  Adjusted noninterest expense increased just 2% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting growth in compensation and benefits, occupancy and technology expenses partially offset by continued expense discipline across the company.  Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially and due to softening customer demand and our RWA optimization efforts. Average C&I balances decreased 2% sequentially. As Tim mentioned, clients remain cautious with respect to their growth plans. Consequently, production was muted in corporate banking. Also, average CRE balances decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter. The period-end commercial revolver utilization rate of 36% increased 1% compared to last quarter, partially due to our exit of certain lower returning unused commercial commitments.  On a sequential basis, total corporate banking commitments and unused commitments decreased 3% and 4%, respectively, while total middle market commitments and unused commitments increased 5% and 7%, respectively. This trend highlights our capital optimization efforts while we continue to grow share in the middle market. Average total consumer portfolio loan and lease balances decreased 1% sequentially due to our intentional decline in indirect auto and the overall slowdown in residential mortgage originations, given the rate environment, partially offset by growth from dividend finance.  Our card balances increased just 1% this quarter, reflecting our conservative risk culture and focus on transactors. Balances have increased 3% relative to the year ago quarter compared to 11% for the industry. Average total deposits increased 3% sequentially as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were partially offset by a decline in demand deposits given the mix shift we have seen for several quarters. DDAs as a percent of core deposits were 28% for the quarter compared to 30% in the prior quarter. The 2-point decline was primarily due to the strong deposit growth in the denominator that Tim highlighted from our net new relationship growth in both consumer and commercial, which are obviously skewed to interest-bearing products in this environment.  As a result, we added more than $4 billion in core deposits during the quarter, the most since the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the DDA migration continued to show signs of deceleration this quarter and marked the smallest dollar decline in DDA balances since the onset of the rate hiking cycle. By segment, average consumer deposits increased 2% sequentially, and commercial deposits increased 4%, while wealth and asset management deposits declined 2% and reflecting clients' alternative investment options.  As a result of our balance sheet positioning and success adding new deposits, we achieved a loan to core deposit ratio of 74% and at quarter end, which should be one of the best, if not the best, compared to our regional peers. We also achieved full Category 1 LCR compliance at 118% at quarter end.  Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit has remained resilient. The net charge-off ratio of 41 basis points increased 12 basis points compared to the prior quarter as we expected, reflecting two credits, which had been fully reserved. Early stage delinquencies decreased 7% compared to the prior quarter, while loans 90 days past due, of just 2 basis points or a record low for Fifth Third.  Non-performing loans decreased 9%. This quarter marked the lowest inflows of commercial NPLs since the second quarter of 2022. From an overall credit management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on generating and maintaining high-quality relationships. As many of you know, we tightened underwriting standards during COVID, which limited our growth but improved the stability of our balance sheet.  In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained conservative underwriting policies. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall CRE concentration as a percent of total loans relative to peers for many years. Our criticized non-performing and delinquent CRE loans have all improved sequentially and remain very well behaved.  And within that, the same is true for our office exposures. For instance, criticized office loans represented just 5.4% of total office CRE, which improved 180 basis points sequentially. Additionally, we have zero delinquencies and zero charge-offs. We also decreased loan balances by 8% in the office book without any loan sales. These credit quality metrics are significantly better than peers who have reported their office exposure so far this quarter. While credit quality in the office portfolio has remained very strong, and we continue to believe the overall impact on Fifth Third will be limited. We nevertheless continue to watch it closely given the environment.  Our shared national credit portfolio also remains very strong from a credit quality perspective, with criticized assets, non-performing loans and net charge-offs consistently lower than the overall commercial portfolio across a multiyear period. Our credit resilience highlights our proactive risk culture. We continue to closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress throughout the entire portfolio as well as the fallout from the ongoing labor strike in the auto manufacturing sector, where we think our exposures are very manageable.  Moving to the ACL. Our reserves decreased $5 million, but the coverage ratio increased 3 basis points sequentially to 2.11% as the impact of lower period end loans was offset by a slightly worse overall base case economic outlook. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. Both the Moody's base scenario and the downside scenario used for the third quarter ACL assume a slightly worse average unemployment rate compared to the prior quarter. We maintained our scenario weightings of 80% to the base and 10% to each the upside and downside scenarios.  Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio increased 31 basis points sequentially ending the quarter at 9.8%. Our capital position reflects our ability to build capital quickly through our strong earnings generation, combined with the impact of our RWA diet. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 10% compared to the year ago quarter. We continue to expect improvement in our unrealized securities losses resulting in approximately 35% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2025 and approximately 2/3 by 2028, assuming the forward curve plays out.  Looking forward, we expect to build capital at an accelerated pace given our RWA optimization initiative and our continued deferment of share buybacks. We anticipate accreting capital such that our CET1 ratio ends this year above 10%.  Moving to our current outlook. We expect fourth quarter average total loan balances to decline 2% to 3% sequentially with consumer loans down 2% and commercial loans down 3%. The reflects our overall cautious economic outlook combined with one more quarter of our RWA diet as we are responding quickly to higher risk-adjusted return thresholds throughout the bank considering the economic and regulatory environments. We expect average deposits to be up slightly on a sequential basis. Within that, we expect core deposits to increase 1% due to our multiyear investments in the franchise to add households and primary commercial relationships, along with the benefit from seasonality. While we continue to expect modest migration from DDA into interest-bearing products in a higher for longer interest rate environment, specifically for the fourth quarter, we expect the mix of DDA to core deposits to remain relatively stable given those seasonal benefits.  Shifting to the income statement. We expect fourth quarter NII to be down approximately 1% to 2% sequentially due to the continued impacts of the balance sheet dynamics I mentioned. Our NII guidance assumes no additional rate hikes and a cumulative beta, which includes CDs and excludes DDAs of 55% by the fourth quarter. Excluding brokered deposits that we have been using as a replacement for other wholesale funding, given the pricing considerations, our cumulative beta expectation continues to be 53%. This outlook translates to total interest-bearing deposit costs increasing 15 basis points to 20 basis points in the fourth quarter.  Our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances remain relatively stable through year-end. As a byproduct of our strong deposit growth, combined with our loan outlook and stable securities balances, we expect to hold closer to $20 billion in cash and cash equivalents by year-end. Given these balance trends, we expect our loan to core deposit ratio to continue to move lower through the end of the year, which will keep Fifth Third in a strong liquidity position in anticipation of more stringent regulatory requirements, including remaining compliant with the full Category 1 LCR.  We expect fourth quarter adjusted noninterest income to increase 1% to 2% compared to the third quarter. We expect revenues to remain resilient across most captions driven by our multiyear focus on growing a diverse portfolio of fee businesses that should perform well in different economic environments. We expect fourth quarter TRA revenue of $22 million compared to $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect fourth quarter adjusted noninterest expenses to be stable to up 1% compared to the third quarter. Our guidance excludes the pending FDIC special assessment, which we currently estimate at $208 million for Fifth Third.  With respect to credit quality, we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be 30 basis points to 35 basis points. We do expect to gradually normalize from here. We continue to believe that are through the cycle, annual charge-offs will be in the 35 basis point to 45 basis point range given the credit risk profile of the bank. Given our reduced loan outlook, we expect the change in the ACL for the fourth quarter to be stable to up $25 million, assuming no significant changes in the underlying Moody's economic scenarios. This considers production from dividend finance of around $700 million in the fourth quarter, which as you know, carries a higher reserve level of around 9%.  In summary, with our proactive balance sheet management, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to meet the proposed regulatory requirements while continuing to generate long-term value for our shareholders.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Thanks, Scott, for the question. We were certainly bringing the Victory bell on deposits this quarter. Really, when you take a look back, coming out of March Madness, one of the biggest drivers of our deposit success in the second quarter and the third quarter was really transitioning our customer recommendation engine from household growth to deposit growth. And while that sacrificed a little bit on the household growth numbers instead of our typical up 3% or up 4%, we were up 2% on households, but that translated to very strong consumer deposit growth. And so within the deposit growth we did have during the quarter of almost $4.8 billion, about 60% was commercial, 40% was consumer. And within consumer, 70% of that growth was in the Southeast markets, while 30% of that growth was in the Midwest. So again, the retail franchise at Fifth Third is just performing at an extremely high level.  And on the commercial side, the growth was surprisingly high given the corporate banking book growth within the commercial deposit growth. About 80% of the growth was in corporate banking. So at the time, we were targeting, let's get LCR, full LCR north of 100%. We actually came in at 118%. So definitely did better than we initially expected. But when we were dissecting the quarter end results, it really makes sense that the corporate banking book did better. And as one of sort of hidden benefits of the RWA diet is that we are getting better share of wallet within that corporate banking book, and that also helped drive the deposit growth. So overall, a very strong quarter. Again, for us on the deposit side, we expect continued growth in the fourth quarter, albeit at a little bit lower growth rate but still up a bit in the fourth quarter. If you break it down between real world and regulatory world, that's really how we are looking at this in the real world with really the economic risk. Whenever you have a fixed rate asset, whether that's in AFS, HTM or in the loan portfolio, you have that economic risk to higher rates. We have elected to hold our securities in AFS, and we'll continue to do so, given that it gives us better flexibility and opportunity to reposition as the environment changes. But when you are in the real world managing the balance sheet, how we approach balance sheet management is in totality. And you can look at our strong NII results, our interest-bearing liability results, any of the measures relative to peers, the total balance sheet is performing very well. We're going to grow NII this year, 3% to 5%. Others are shrinking. So our philosophy is paying off in the real world.  The challenge simply comes from the fair value of a single line item and putting that into capital. We're not insensitive to how that looks on the face of the balance sheet and the tangible book value per share. But we still believe it is prudent to have that flexibility because flexibility has value. In terms of the regulatory risk, perhaps one of the details that we continue to evaluate as something we've not really communicated to all of you externally, is that given the burn down that you have in the presentation and the significant, whether it's static rate, forward rate, you're looking at 60%, 65% of the ASC burn down during the transition into the new capital regimes, assuming the rules play out as currently written, and that burn down is going to happen on our portfolio because our portfolio has structured. We have defined maturities unlike those portfolios that are in residential mortgage-backed, instruments with convexity and extension risk, we know our portfolio is going to pay down.  And we know that this is going to be very manageable from a regulatory capital perspective. When we model the capital impact at a fully phased-in level on AOCI, the impact on CET1 is about 125 basis points when you reach the third quarter of 2028 and that's why we continue to accrete CET1 is to be able to have sufficient regulatory capital for that world. And in fact, should rates get north of 8%. We would still be maintaining a CET1 well above regulatory minimums would be over 8% CET1 in that environment.  So we feel good about how we're positioned, how we will roll down the curve and ultimately, the regulatory capital. It's just one of the challenges in this environment with everything in AFS is that you have that mark on the tangible book value per share, that erosion. But at the same time, should rates fall. I think all of you would be very pleased with how much tangible book value accretion, we would report in that environment. Not really. It was a pretty vanilla quarter for us where we had cash flows in the quarter of about $500 million. We put about $700 million to work of the excess cash in short duration Level 1 treasury floaters. When you look at the AOCI walk that happened in the quarter, the securities portfolio because everything is in AFS, worsened about $1.2 billion and if you look at how the 5-year move increased about 45 basis points, the 10-year moved to about 75% and then spreads widen 5 bps on the CMBS and about 15 bps in mortgage. So when you add it all up with the DV01 of about $25 million, that gets you to the AOCI movement for the quarter on the investment portfolio. And so it was in line at least with our expectations with how rates were moving during the quarter. And then, Erika, on your other components of the question, CET1 for us finished the quarter at 9.8%. Excluding the investment portfolio, AOCI, that number would be 6.3%. And then the RWA bloat from the pending rules would be about 2% to 3% of RWA, which is about 20 basis points. So we would look to be at a 6.1 level. But as we talked about then, the earnings power of the company is very strong. We continue to defer the buybacks. We'll continue to accrete capital and with the passage of time, given the structure in the investment portfolio. The burn down of that AOCI will be 65% or so by the time we reach the fully phased-in level. So we feel that this is a very manageable timeline for the company. In fact, have a lot of cushion should rates even go higher. And in terms of how the consumer is doing and what we see in our data, the average consumer balance is still deposit balance is still 15% above pre-COVID levels. But to Tim's point, renters are back to pre-COVID levels and sub-660 FICOs are actually below pre-COVID level. So the averages can be a little bit misleading in terms of what credit outcomes may bring in 2024. But as Tim said, we're certainly well positioned from a credit perspective on our balance sheet.  And from an ACL perspective on the second part of your question, the scenarios we use from Moody's have GDP contracting almost near zero. So the modeling certainly picks up erosion in the forecast. In this quarter, you had a slight erosion both in GDP and unemployment as well as with corporate profits and that was part of the reason or the primary reason why our ACL coverage increased from 208 basis points to 211 basis points. It's just we had the benefits of the loan balance reduction and the unused commitment reductions from RWA optimization efforts that offset that. Excellent question. I'll start and then turn it over to Bryan. In terms of total deposit cost and deposit pricing, the quarter played out as expected with our beta ticking up from total deposits, excluding brokered to 50%. We expect that to hit the 53% beta we talked about a quarter or two ago. So the pricing is playing out as we had expected. And I think most of the bank's beta guides are coming up to where we've been at this hire for longer scenario. But in terms of each geography, Bryan, do you want to touch on that? The first quarter, the day count is what will drive that NII trough. The NIM whether it's the fourth quarter or the first quarter is going to be driven solely by how much excess cash we have from the strong deposit performance. So we'll see, but it's going to be one of those 2 quarters. The consumer book, in particular, is where most of the fixed rate repricing benefit resides. If you look at 2024, we'll have about $8 billion of consumer loan payoffs is how we model it. And front book rates are 200 basis points to 300 basis points higher than back book rates. And so if you take that, coupled with, call it, $4 billion in security maturities and cash flows you end up with about $300 million tailwind on an annualized basis. Obviously, that will happen during the course of 2024, so take half of that for the in-year effect. But you're looking at $300 million type of run rate benefit just from one year's repricing. I think it will be environment dependent, which I'm sure is not the answer we want. But I think you hit on all the right points, Mike, which is the RWA diet makes positive operating leverage difficult in 2024. With that said, we will do everything in our power to deliver as good a results as we can, but I think it will be a challenge in 2024. All of those facts are correct, and we feel very good about all of the work we've done on the credit portfolio over the last 15 years. In terms of it being economically insensitive, no, but within any industry, there are going to be winners and losers, and that's where it comes down to that client selection that Greg referenced. We just believe we are very well positioned, and we've been very diligent and part of the benefit that we're getting right now is the fact that we were not stretching for loan growth over the past several years and we probably had the lowest loan growth guides over the past several years running. And so back to our priorities of stability and profitability ahead of growth. John, it's Jamie. The crit office loans were what I referenced that declined 180 basis points. Crits overall, were up just a little bit. It was mostly the fact that deposit growth outpaced expectations. And in this environment, we want to hold excess cash as opposed to doing anything, adding it to the investment portfolio. We certainly view cash as an asset allocation at these rates, as you referenced. Yes, I would say that our balance sheet is elevated due to a couple of reasons. One, the unrealized losses, whether you have an AFS or HTM, you do have to fund those losses in your liquidity buffers. And so should those losses come down, that certainly frees up cash to shrink the sheet or over time as our non-HQLA allocation matures, we will reinvest that in shorter duration level 1s and also allow us to maintain an above 100%, while also shrinking the sheet. It's just -- both of those things are going to be measured more years than in quarters in terms of the cash coming down. We're pretty neutral right now, how that lines up versus last year, probably a little asset sensitive a year ago, whereas today, we're neutral to at least in the disclosure showing liability sensitive. I would say steady based on what we're seeing now from the delinquency and NPA, all the above and our ongoing portfolio, in the last 12 months, we have rerated 95-plus percent of the portfolio. So based on all of that underwriting or reunderwriting, if you will, I'm expecting steady. Sure. Yes."

            "content": "Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Jamie. In general, I think what we're seeing is that it's a combination of -- it is local and a national impact right now. And what you're seeing is that you may have periods of time where the dominant players or the bigger players in specific markets may just have a lower liquidity need. And so that gives you a little bit of an opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive and do well from a share perspective. But what we've seen since March is that tends to rotate around a little bit.  And ultimately, as people start to realize as deposit competition is moving in the market, you're just seeing people then start to react. Your most rate-sensitive customers are absolutely focused on the national markets. They tend to be the ones that are most willing to use a non-traditional provider, and so you definitely see some of that. But in general, it tends to -- you still tend to have some opportunity to take advantage of some geographic differences, but those geographic differences can rotate over time. We've done nothing incremental at this point. Obviously, we're paying attention to the market and evaluating opportunities. I think more than anything the, as Jamie mentioned, the lower lockout structure of our portfolio ultimately is our hedge to higher rates right now because we now have those defined maturities that are going to come in, and we think that keeps us relatively well positioned. But we're constantly keeping an eye on the market and figuring out if there are opportunities for us to continue to improve our positioning. Yes, it's Bryan. I would tell you that the outlook on rates has a modest impact on how we think of loans, but it's more about just composition and more in consumer where we may see some additional opportunity or relative asset classes, you might feel a little bit better about some of the spreads in auto. You're going to see almost no mortgage production in a higher rate environment, obviously. And that's probably the biggest implication just given that our commercial portfolio is primarily floating rate, doesn't really have a big impact from a floating rate portfolio perspective. And it really for us comes down to overall macro, how we feel about what the credit outlook is going to be and whether or not we're earning adequate returns on the capital we're deploying."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Chris Doll, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nChris Doll: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fifth Third Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard, will provide an overview of our second quarter results and outlook. Our Treasurer, Bryan Preston and Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, have also joined the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures, reconciliations to the GAAP results and forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of July 20, 2023, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\nTimothy Spence: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the quarter, I'd like to welcome our new Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck to the call. Greg has been a part of Fifth Third for 35 years, and during that time, you see more than a few credit cycles. He previously held leadership roles in both credit risk and the line of business, including serving as our Chief Commercial Credit Officer for several years and is our Head of Leasing, asset-based lending and structured finance. We're fortunate to have him as part of the Fifth Third executive team. Despite heightened market volatility over the past four months, Fifth Third has delivered consistent top quartile financial results while investing strategically to position the bank for the long term. Our operating priorities have been and continue to be stability, profitability and growth in that order. Earlier today, we reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.87, excluding items noted in the release, a 10% increase compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 9%, reflecting our diverse fee sources and resilient balance sheet. Expenses increased 4%, excluding items noted in the release. And credit quality was strong with net charge-offs and early stage delinquencies remaining below normalized levels. Our key return metrics improved even as we increased our capital levels and credit reserves. We generated an adjusted return on assets of over 1.2% and adjusted return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, of 15.4% and an efficiency ratio below 55% for the quarter. These will be important bellwether metrics for all banks as we adapt to impending regulatory changes. Deposits continue to be in focus for the entire sector in the second quarter. Fifth Third's total period-end deposits increased 1% sequentially and increased 2% year-over-year as compared to a 5% decline for the HA [ph] over the same period. Our commercial banking and commercial banking business segments both generated period-end deposit growth. Given the year-over-year decline in deposit system-wide, it's reasonable to ask how Fifth Third has continued to outperform. The answers are deliberate multiyear strategies to expand distribution in our Southeast markets to launch innovative operational deposit-oriented solutions like momentum banking and our treasury management offerings and our sustained focus on primary household growth. We have added over 70 de novo branches in our Southeast footprint since 2019, more than any other bank except JPMorgan. As a portfolio, these branches are outperforming their original business cases on deposit production with several producing at a rate of 200% to 300% of plan. In consumer, we generated year-over-year net household growth of 3% once again this quarter, continuing a strong multiyear trend and punctuated by 7% year-on-year growth in the Southeast and continued success in our Momentum banking product. In commercial, we have added a record number of new quality middle-market relationships this year, up 30% from 2022. Our embedded payments business, Newline, has also been a strong catalyst for deposit growth. We expect the environment in the back half of the year to remain highly competitive for deposits. While we will continue to protect our house relationships and manage to a strong and stable liquidity profile, we will not match a rational pricing competition in a way that prioritizes headline growth over profitability. Turning to pending regulation. We are taking steps to adapt our balance sheet in anticipation of higher capital and liquidity requirements across the industry. We finished the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 9.5% having accreted around 90 basis points of capital from retained earnings over the course of the past year. We are balancing three capital priorities, continuing to build capital on an accelerated pace, supporting a dividend increase in the third quarter subject to Board approval and supporting clients to drive organic growth. We will continue to pause share repurchases until the final capital rules are published and new capital targets are established. We are also taking several actions to boost on balance sheet liquidity and optimize returns. -- in reducing our indirect auto lending origination volumes by approximately 15% through the exit of noncore states, trimming outsized lines and closely evaluating select areas of our corporate banking business. While we acknowledge the market's more optimistic outlook, we remain vigilant on the potential for a recession in 2024. Our commercial clients continue to perform well, but they are being cautious by slowing their growth plans. Many are closely watching the impact that regulation may have on credit availability and pricing. Consumers have held up well in aggregate, but there has been a divergence between homeowners who were able to lock in historically low mortgage rates and renters who have had to face persistent inflation in their largest monthly expense. Compared to three years ago, homeowners in our deposit base have maintained strong deposit balances, whereas renters deposit balances are down meaningfully. I want to thank our nearly 20,000 employees for their unwavering commitment to serving clients in our communities. Last year, you volunteered more than 117,000 hours to community organizations and you provided leadership to roughly 1,200 not-for-profit boards. Due to your hard work, we have already delivered nearly $30 billion of our 10-year $100 billion commitment to provide affordable housing, access to essential services and renewable energy. In June, we celebrated Fifth Third's 165th anniversary. Given the current pace of technological and regulatory change and the logical questions about market structure and competitive model to follow. It was an interesting time to reflect on our history and what it could tell us about this moment. Since Fifth Third's founding in 1858, the company has withstood a civil war, two World Wars, two global health pandemic and 33 recessions. The company adapted its business model to take advantage of technological innovations including the telephone, electric white bulbs, the automobile and the Internet. We were an early adopter of the wire and ACH Windows, anchored the rollout of the credit card networks in the Midwest, invented the network ATM and were one of the 15 initial launch bankers. We witnessed the creation of the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC and have continued to thrive through many different regulatory regimes. I believe that companies that stand the test of time, develop a character of their own that extends beyond the people who work there. Fifth Third's character is rooted in hard work, ingenuity and insistence on excellence and the sense of responsibility for the communities we serve. I'm as confident as in Fifth Third's positioning, our ability to outperform through the cycle and to deliver innovations that improve lives for all our stakeholders. And frankly, I'm just thankful to be part of [indiscernible] steward the bank into the future. With that, I'll now hand it over to Jamie to provide more details on our financial results and outlook.\nJames Leonard: Thank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were once again strong despite the market headwinds. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of just below 55%, which is a 4-point improvement compared to the prior quarter. Our second quarter adjusted PPNR grew more than 8% compared to both the prior quarter and year ago quarter, driven by the continued diversification and growth of our fee revenue streams combined with disciplined expense management throughout the bank. . Net interest income primate $1.46 billion increased 9% year-over-year, did decline 4% sequentially. Our sequential NII performance was the result of our deliberate actions to grow on balance sheet liquidity to support a defensive balance sheet position, given the uncertain macroeconomic outlook and tightening liquidity conditions. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 54 basis points to 2.3%, which represents a cycle-to-date beta of 45% on interest-bearing deposits, which includes the impact of CDs. Adjusted noninterest income increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, with increases in mortgage fee income and commercial banking revenue partially offset by a decline in deposit service charges due to the impact of earnings credits from higher market rates and the elimination of our consumer NSF fees in July of last year. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 10% compared to the year ago quarter as elevated compensation and benefits expense was driven by nonqualified deferred compensation costs, the minimum wage increase that went into effect in July of 2022 and continued investment in dividend finance. Additionally, expenses increased from higher technology and communications expense and the impact of the increased FDIC assessment that began in January. Excluding the impacts of nonqualified deferred compensation, which are offset by a gross up in securities gains, the FDIC assessment increase and incremental expense growth from dividend finance, Total underlying expenses increased approximately 4% compared to the year ago quarter. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases were stable sequentially in both commercial and consumer portfolios due to our continued discipline with respect to client selection and optimizing returns and also reflecting softening demand. The period-end commercial revolver utilization rate of 35% decreased 2% compared to last quarter. C&I balances were flat compared to the prior quarter as strong middle market loan production and muted payoffs were offset by the lower revolver utilization. Corporate banking production was also tempered due to our focus on optimizing returns on capital in this environment and lower customer demand. Average total consumer portfolio loan and lease balances reflected growth from dividend finance, offset by declines in indirect auto and residential mortgage. Average total deposits were flat compared to the prior quarter as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were offset by a decline in demand deposits. By segment, consumer deposits increased 1% and commercial deposits decreased 1%, while wealth and asset management deposits declined 12%, reflecting the impact of tax payments as well as clients' alternative investment options. June activity reflected continued momentum such that period-end total deposits were up 1% compared to the prior quarter. Notably, we have grown deposits 2% since the end of last June compared to a 5% decline for the top 25 banks as shown in the Fed's H8 data. Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends were stable with our key credit metrics remaining below normalized levels. The net charge-off ratio of 29 basis points increased three basis points compared to the prior quarter. The NPA ratio of 54 basis points was up three basis points compared to the prior quarter. In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which represents 85% of our consumer portfolio. We have also maintained one of the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in nonprime consumer borrowers among our peers. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall CRE concentration as a percent of total loans relative to peers for many years. Within CRE, we have limited office exposure with a low and improving criticized asset ratio and almost no delinquencies. We continue to watch office closely and believe the overall impact on Fifth Third will be limited. We had deemphasized office even before the pandemic, and we are not currently pursuing new office CRE originations. From an overall credit management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on generating and maintaining high-quality relationships. As many of you know, we have been and remain cautious in our economic outlook. We tightened underwriting standards during COVID, including stressing credits to an up 200-basis-point scenario off the forward curve, which limited our growth but improved the stability of our balance sheet. Since we began tightening underwriting standards, roughly 90% of our commercial portfolio has been re-underwritten. Our criticized assets have been stable over the past several quarters. Across all loan categories, we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress. Moving to the ACL. Our reserves increased $87 million, reflecting the impacts of dividend finance and Moody's macroeconomic forecast, which eroded slightly. The ACL ratio increased nine basis points sequentially. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the unemployment rate reaches 4.3%, while the downside scenario incorporates a peak unemployment rate of 7.8%. We maintained our scenario weightings of 80% to the base and 10% to each of the upside and downside scenarios. Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio increased 25 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at over 9.5%. Our capital position reflects our ability to build capital quickly through our strong earnings generation. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 11% compared to the year ago quarter. We continue to expect a meaningful improvement in our unrealized loss position, assuming the forward curve plays out, resulting in approximately 36% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2024 and approximately 50% by the end of 2025. Looking forward, we expect to build capital at an accelerated pace given our RWA optimization initiatives and by extending our share buyback pause. As Tim mentioned, we will postpone repurchases until we have more clarity on the regulatory environment in order to determine the new level of required capital dollars. Assuming we do not buy back shares through year-end, we would anticipate accreting capital such that our CET1 ratio ends this year at or above 10%. Moving to our current outlook; we expect full year average total loan growth between 1% and 2%, which reflects our cautious outlook on the economic environment and our decision to proactively adapt our balance sheet to the new regulatory regime. We expect total commercial loans to increase in the low single digits area compared to 2022, which implies a decline in the second half of the year relative to the first half. This outlook assumes the revolver utilization rate of 35% in the second quarter remained stable throughout the remainder of 2023. Our commercial loan outlook also assumes that we meaningfully reduced originations in certain areas of the commercial franchise, predominantly in the corporate bank to meet our higher risk-adjusted return thresholds, while continuing to increase the generation in our core middle market business, we expect total consumer loans to be stable to down slightly from reduced originations of the lower-yielding out-of-footprint auto and specialty lending channels, combined with portfolio residential mortgages, partially offset by growth from dividend finance. We currently expect to need approximately $4 billion in dividend loans for this year, which is a modest decrease from our previous expectations. We continue to expect to grow deposits in the back half of 2023, assuming stable or even slightly tighter market liquidity conditions Consistent with our track record over the past year of taking market share and maintaining high levels of core operating relationships in both consumer and commercial. Within that, we continue to expect migration from DDA into interest-bearing products throughout the remainder of 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits declining from 30% in the second quarter to 27% by year-end as we discussed last month. For the third quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to decline 1% to 2% sequentially with commercial down in the low single digits area and consumer stable to slightly down. We expect average deposits to be up 1% on a sequential basis, impacted by our strong finish to the second quarter, some seasonal uplift and the benefits of our multiyear investments in the franchise that Tim discussed earlier. Shifting to the income statement; we estimate full year NII will increase 3% to 5%, consistent with comments from the mid-June investor conference. Our AI guidance assumes a cumulative beta of 53% by the fourth quarter, assuming an additional 25 basis point rate hike in July and no further rate movements in 2023. Our outlook translates to total interest-bearing deposit costs increasing around 40 basis points in the third quarter and another 15 basis points or so in the fourth quarter. Our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances remained relatively stable between now and year-end. As a byproduct of strong deposit growth, combined with lower loan growth and stable securities balances, we expect to hold closer to $15 billion in cash and cash equivalents by year-end. We expect our loan-to-core deposit ratio to end the year in the mid-70s area. It will keep Fifth Third in a strong liquidity position in anticipation of more stringent regulatory environments. We expect third quarter NII to be down approximately 2% to 3% sequentially due to the continued impacts of the balance sheet dynamics I mentioned. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be stable in 2023, resulting from continued success, increasing market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities. with stronger gross treasury management, capital markets, wealth and asset management and mortgage servicing revenue to be offset by higher earnings credit rates on treasury management, subdued leasing remarketing revenue and a reduction in other fees due to lower TRA and private equity income this year. We expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from $46 million in 2022 to $22 million in 2023. We expect third quarter adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the second quarter. We expect to continue generating strong revenue across most fee captions, which we conservatively assume will be more than offset by a slight erosion in debt capital markets and mortgage revenue. reflecting the environmental headwinds as well as lower other noninterest income. We continue to expect full year adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022. If capital markets fees improve relative to our current expectations, we will likely land at the upper end of the range. Our expense outlook incorporates the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on January 1, the mark-to-market impact on nonqualified deferred compensation plans which was a reductant in 2022 expenses but an increase in 2023 and full year impact of investments to grow the dividend finance and provide businesses. Excluding the FDIC assessment and NQDC impacts, we would expect our full year 2023 core expenses to be up 3%. Our guidance reflects continued investment in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth in the low double digits for the year. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid- to high single digits area. Our guidance also factors in the run rate benefits from the severance expense recognized in the first half of the year, which reflected proactive actions taken to reduce ongoing expenses given the operating environment. We expect third quarter adjusted noninterest expenses to decrease 1% to 2% compared to the second quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 3% to 4%. This would result in an efficiency ratio of around 56% for the full year. We expect full year total net charge-offs to continue to be in our previously stated 25 basis point to 35 basis point range. However, as you would expect, with normalizing credit costs in this environment from record low levels, there may be a little lumpiness in C&I in the second half such that total Bancorp's third quarter losses are expected to be 35 to 45 basis points and then fourth quarter losses improving relative to the third quarter. Given our reduced loan growth outlook, we expect a lower quarterly build to the ACL in the $25 million to $75 million range, assuming no significant changes in the underlying Moody's economic scenarios. This considers strong production from dividend finance of around $750 million in the third quarter, which, as you know, carries a higher reserve level. In summary, with our proactive balance sheet management, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue generating long-term sustainable value for our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChris Doll: Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A. .\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers: The first question I wanted to ask is -- and I think if I've done the math correctly, the fourth quarter NII could kind of level out, even at the low end of the range, it could kind of level out or at least really slow the rate of decline. And I guess, in your view, what would allow NII to find a bottom at that point? I guess, I asked specifically in the context of you all having been bought the most conservative out there on your funding cost outlook for the second half of the year.\nJames Leonard: Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. It really comes down to the rate environment with the Fed in our forecast, the assumption being that the Fed reaches 5.5%, and holds. And therefore, by the end of the fourth quarter, we've gotten through all of the repricing lag that would occur. So that right now, the third quarter guide is down 2% to 3% and then the full year guide implies a little bit of a step down from third quarter into fourth quarter, and then we'll see what 2024 holds when we get there. Implicit in the guide is an increase in our deposit costs so that the terminal beta is 53%. And I guess, coming out of listening to some of the other earned calls, the one comment we would have is that our June, like everyone else's was quite strong and could -- and I think to the point in your head could result in better NII outcomes than what it reflects. But from our standpoint, spotting one robin doesn't make it spring. And therefore, we're going to continue to be cautious in the outlook and play defense in this environment. We've got a long way to go from the liquidity conditions tightening with at $80 billion a month, $1.5 trillion or more of trade issuance, the student loan repayments kicking back in, and then the competitive dynamics that we're seeing across the footprint. So we're going to play a good defense, and we think defense wins championships in this environment.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Okay. And then I think I take tack one that you might have addressed towards the end of your prepared comments. But as it relates to the reserving needs, which look less in the second half in aggregate than in the first half is. No change to the reserving needs for dividend, right? I think you mentioned that's just due to the anticipated commercial growth.\nJames Leonard: Correct in that the dividend reserve coverage ratio, we're assuming, remains in that 9% area. The reduction in the guide for the ACL build is driven by all of the loan production changes that we are forecasting with the RWA diet and reducing the balance sheet for the new capital regimes that will be forthcoming.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS.\nErika Najarian: My first question is for Jamie. According to your first quarter Q, we're down 100 basis points parallel, I believe, your NII would be up 44 basis points over a full year. A lot of investors are now thinking about the potential for a Fed rate cut in 1Q '24. So I'm wondering, as we think about that 4Q '23 exit rate in all else equal, do you expect relative stability in NII if in the scenario as the Fed cuts? And how does that play out in terms of deposit costs? In other words, is just -- is there an absolute level where deposit costs don't move that much. Do deposit costs continue to increase even in the first few cuts? You are the most trusted CFOs out there. So it would be interesting to hear your perspective on all of that.\nJames Leonard: Now you've just given the publicity then I'm going to have to live up giving you a 2024 NII guide. There's no question that Bryan and I have positioned the balance sheet to be currently neutral to benefiting for the rate cuts when the rate cuts ultimately occur. The down rate scenarios continue to be the most difficult for a bank earnings profile to manage as credit costs would ramp up and recession kicks in. So for us, I believe that the deposit cost pressures will mitigate as the Fed begins a cutting cycle. We just don't see that happening this year, which is why the guide on NII is what it is that we continue to expect a competitive environment. But should the Fed move to the cuts, we really like how the balance sheet is positioned for that environment. Our guide the exit run rate on fourth quarter NII, if you took our guide and multiplied it by 4, it's about where consensus is for 2024. So I don't think there's necessarily a gap at this point in time, but 2024 is a very long way from July 20.\nErika Najarian: Understood. And my second question maybe is for Tim. It took a lot of years of hard work, but Fifth Third has put itself in a position where you're pretty down the middle in terms of the results you're not talking about taking expenses down next year. You're not talking about RWA mitigation. And while I'm sure there's something on LCR and long-term debt as those requirements come in that you're working on, the business seemed to be something that would change strategy. The question really here is as you think is Fifth Third is positioned, and there seems to be now appreciable differences on how peers are positioned for this sort of new world order. How are you going to take advantage of it from a market share perspective? .\nTimothy Spence: Yes. That's a good question, Erika, and I appreciate it. I will say, I think all of the things that you described, the RWA diet, a continuous focus on expenses, thinking about liquidity profile and in particular, the value of different sorts of deposits in the new world are all things we're doing here today. But we have the benefit of having made multiyear investments in either asset classes or in particular, on the operational deposit side of the equation that are benefiting us in this environment, and they're going to continue to be very valuable going forward. I think narrowly, the hardest thing on an organization, if you're trying to deliver predictable long-term results is to have to move into a binge purge mode, right? And whether that is outsized growth followed by shrinking or letting expenses run up, followed by deep cuts later it creates -- the two things happen. One, the first thing that people cut tends to be the last thing that came in the door. And the byproduct of that is your cuts end up being concentrated in the areas you are investing for future growth, one. Two, your people actually become more reticent to stretch and to try to give better outcomes because they don't want to get outsized and have to work backwards. So I think what -- the advantage we're going to have next year and the year after that and the year forward is our ability to be consistent about investing in the franchise. And that will mean that we stay on the pace that we've been on the last several years in building branches. It will mean that we continue to add to the middle market teams because I think the economics of these middle market banking relationships are going to continue to be excellent regardless of what happens to capital and liquidity. And we're going to continue to focus on having the best retail deposit franchise and best treasury management franchise in our peer group.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of John Panc from Evercore.\nJohn Panc: On the -- back to the loss reserve, just to clarify, the $25 million to $75 million build in -- per quarter in the back half for dividends and is that again, is for growth expected in dividend stance, but it's no change in the reserve ratio that you're assigning to that business?\nJames Leonard: Yes. And let me clarify one thing from what you said that just to make sure we're on the same page. Our guide for the ACL is for the total Bancorp balance sheet. However, the primary driver of that ACL build is dividend. Dividend, we expect to do $750 million a quarter of production, that reserve rate ballpark it in the 9% range. But the rest of the balance sheet, as we discussed in the guide is actually going -- from a loan standpoint is actually going to be down a bit. And so the net of those growing dividend, shrinking other parts of the balance sheet, inclusive of auto where we exited the states west of the Mississippi, but for Texas, combined with our efforts in shrinking the corporate banking book will result in a lower ACL build than what we've been running at this year because those other businesses will essentially be reducing the ACL coverage due to lower volumes, whereas dividend call it, in that same area, but the net effect is, let's call it, a build of $25 million to $75 million a quarter going forward.\nJohn Panc: Okay. No, that helps a lot. And then separately, on the credit front, can you just talk a little bit about your C&I portfolio and how that's performing just as we've started to see some larger bankruptcies develop. But curious how the book is performing on the C&I side. And I know you mentioned that commercial book has been re-underwritten. How does that typically work with shared national credits? I know they're about 30% of your book. So how does the reunderwriting work for that portfolio?\nJames Leonard: Yes. Let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Greg Schroeck to add a little bit more color. But in terms of -- as we discussed in the outlook, we continue to have a total Bancorp charge-off guide in the 25 to 35 basis point range. Within commercial over the past couple of years, it's obviously bounced around from 36 bps in 2020 down to 10 bps in '21 and 13 bps last year. And this year on commercial, we continue to be in that 20 to 30 basis point range. And then within total commercial, C&I is expected to be at the high end of that range given some of the lumpiness that we're seeing with a few credits that resulted in a little bit of that uptick in the NPA ratio at the end of the quarter. But with that, I'll turn it over to Greg for thoughts on C&I underwriting and other views.\nGreg Schroeck: Yes. I agree with Jamie. First of all, the portfolio monitoring really doesn't change, whether it's a SNC, middle C&I loan regardless. We have a robust portfolio management structure and discipline in place that keeps us out ahead of these emerging trends. We're really not seeing a significant trends in that C&I book. We're not seeing it certainly in the shared national credit book. So I still feel really good about the middle market. As Jamie said, we're going to have some lumpiness. You've probably seen our guidance into the third quarter from a charge-off perspective. the headline there, I think, is twofold. And we're starting from a very low base. And so because of that low base, one or two loans can move the needle, and that's exactly what happened, right? We've got two credits, one in the professional services industry and the other in the manufacturing that are going to move the needle in the third quarter. But overall, I feel really good about portfolio, and I would expect fourth quarter charge-offs to be back in line with what we saw in the first and second quarter. .\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: I just wanted to ask on the securities book. I know you guys do daily LCR calcs and you got still the two third portfolio in the locked out and bulleted as you contemplate what the LCR requirements might look like, and I know we're going to learn that ton, do you think are you comfortable with the structure of the portfolio and meeting any push down requirements to category 4?\nJames Leonard: Yes, Ken, great question. And embedded in all of our comments and outlook today, we should have outlined the strategy that our approach here for our company is that we fully expect TLAC to get pushed down. We expect the more draconian capital rules on ops risk to get pushed down, but not any of the benefits from the credit rating risk weighting, and we expect to have to be compliant with the full LCR. So that is the underpinning of all of our strategies for managing the balance sheet, and we want to do that expeditiously. And therefore, we are going to be holding higher levels of cash. We will be rotating more into Level 1 securities. But we love the bullet locked-out structure because that provides the shock absorber to potential low rate environment. And so the flip side to all of this will be the AOCI impacts with the capital rules. And so we'll wait to see what those final rules look like, but it sounds like, obviously, AFS inclusion, HTM exclusion. And so we may have to pivot a bit on the HTM classifications given that we've not done anything to date. But that might be an outcome from the brave new world that will have to adapt to.\nKen Usdin: Right. And I guess in the near term, with rates high, the move to cash is actually helpful, right, because you're now earning five and change versus the average yield of the book, which seems like it's kind of just held in. So it's fair to say that, that's kind of what we expect to see as the securities book for now just continues to shrink back down. And as to your point, we just see that cash build continue.\nJames Leonard: Yes. What we did in the second quarter was we let the portfolio cash flows of $600 million roll off and not get reinvested. So essentially, to your point, bolster cash. For the rest of the year, we're assuming stable, give or take, $1 billion. We may let it run down, we may rotate into treasuries just depending on the day and the opportunities. But what you should expect from us is continued rotation into Level 1, whether cash or treasuries.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And if I can ask one quick one. In terms of your deposit growth outlook and the higher beta assumptions, I know you talked about 3% year-over-year household growth. I guess, can you parse out deposit growth just coming from the franchise as opposed to pricing up to get it? .\nJames Leonard: Yes. It's just that there is a several factors impacting that. So in terms of consumer on the household side, we do have a very strong and consistent growth of 3%, but offsetting that tailwind is the headwind from consumer spending and the declines in the average deposit balance. So when you look at the consumer, the average deposit is still 20% higher than pre-COVID levels, but it is down 10% from the COVID average balance peaks. And so we're modeling that, that erosion does continue and therefore, it creates a little bit of a headwind. So for us, the majority of the growth is obviously coming from the Southeast de novo market and they're growing at a 7% rate. But the Midwest, whether it's same-store sales or the total Midwest networks growing households at 2%. So we like what we've been able to do, and I would say it's more about core new customer acquisition than anything else.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess just first question around reserves and less to do with the mechanical finance and what you -- the ACL. But when we think about the 80% base case, Jamie, that you mentioned, I think if I heard you correctly, you said that had an unemployment rate of 4.3%. I guess, philosophically, I guess, Tim, like in the past, you've talked about 2024 could be worse in terms of debt maybe we do get a delayed recession. So just give us a mark-to-market around your operating outlook over the next, I guess, 12 to 24 months. Are you expecting a recession? And if that's the case, shouldn't you be weighted a lot more to the downside than just the 80-10-10 split that you have? .\nTimothy Spence: Yes. So let me answer the question about the outlook, Ebrahim and then I think we'll go to Jamie to talk about the dynamics around the specific ACL. So look, I think our outlook is that it's hard to know. Like I watch -- we watch the same equity market indicators that you do. We see the trends on unemployment. We see that signal around inflation moderating. And I hear a lot from folks about the increased probability for a soft landing. We just don't get paid to manage to a Goldilocks scenario outcome here, right? Because for every positive indicator, you still have like a yield curve that's more inverted than it has been in decades. You have data coming out of the red book that suggests that same-store sales in retail across the US has been negative since the beginning of the year, the consumer spending on a real basis, so take the impact of inflation out, like flat or down in five of the last seven periods you have a negative ISM in terms of what we're seeing their freight levels, whether it's exports and imports or the over-the-road stuff here in the U.S. continuing to be depressed, like those are not positive signs. And if you buy the thesis that the -- what we're experiencing today is the interest rate environment we had 12 months ago, that we're seeing all of that in a world where Fed funds was 150, 175, right? So at least from our point of view, while it's very possible that we end up with a soft landing here. And I think even if we end up with a mild recession that it is not one that's characterized by unemployment levels, that we still are going to end up in a recessionary environment. The last thing I just want to make sure that I flag because I think sometimes words matter is, we talk about an RWA diet where other people talk about balance sheet optimization. What we're really saying is tightening credit supply and higher risk spreads, right? And those things have an impact on M2 that compounds whatever gets done on M1, that are the other factor that's sort of lingering out there that I think that we need to take into account as we're looking at the outcomes. So that's probably a long way of saying, I don't know any more than you do in terms of where we settle, but we're going to always plan around a more conservative outcome because if we're wrong, everybody does well. And if we're right, we're better positioned to deliver stable earnings for you.\nJames Leonard: And in terms of scenario weightings, we anchored to the 80-10-10 distribution because that is the probability assignment by Moody's for each of those scenarios occurring. So that as you saw in this quarter, the scenarios eroded, unemployment ticked up about 30 basis points or so on a peak basis in their baseline scenario. And as Tim mentioned, it's certainly possible that we have a full employment soft recession. But we believe that obviously, the reserve is adequate and at 208 basis points of coverage, we feel good how we're positioned.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Understood. Just as a follow-up to that, I guess spreads widening, tightening credit is one thing. Are you also seeing demand fall off? Like as you look through your commercial customer base, both in West and Southeast, we've heard from some other banks where things have really cooled off in the last month or 2. Are you actually seeing that from your customers where they are pulling back around investment spend and activity?\nTimothy Spence: Yes. We are seeing some softening in demand. There's no question about that. I think in general, part of its conservatism on the part of the clients. I think and the lack of visibility that they have into what the economy is going to look like 18 months from now. I think the other dynamic that we hear from clients is they are saying they're a little bit nervous about credit availability. So there's an interaction effect here that you have to take into account. But I was on the phone with two large clients, one in the medical field, one in the real estate field, in the past 1.5 weeks. And in both cases, they had gone out and surveyed their bank groups, and there were a lot of, hey, we've allocated all the capital we have available to invest in the second half of the year sort of responses that they were hearing back and/or real constraints on the way that they have to spread ancillaries. So I think there is a dynamic that will materialize here where demand will be lower for credit because the cost of credit will be higher. And that's the interaction effect that I think as we roll forward here, we're going to continue to see in addition to just general caution.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mayo from Wells Fargo.\nMichael Mayo: I'm not sure if Jamie was quoting Aristotle earlier. One Robin does not make a spring. But we'll stick to the Aristotle quotes. So excellence is never an accident. So in terms of operating leverage or positive operating leverage, I mean, you did guide revenues lower by 350 basis points, taking the midpoint, and you didn't change expenses, and that's consistent with the industry. It looks like you could still have a shot at positive leverage, but doesn't look that way a whole lot or -- and for next year, and there's only so much you can do about higher rates and inverted curve. But do you think you have a shot for this year? How do you think about next year? Do you double up on your expense plans or do you preserve the infrastructure for potential additional growth?\nTimothy Spence: Yes. Mike, it's Tim. I'm going to take that one. I mean we are working on expenses. The severance item that we called out as part of an exercise that we ran, just to try to rightsize the resource base here for demand, given the outlook in the environment. And as you know, the primary outcome of all of this investment we're making in the core platforms is to bring more automation and straight-through processing to the business, which we think is going to provide a lot of intermediate-term expense positive expense outcomes. I think what we're trying to do is to manage the expense base and the focus on positive operating leverage around sort of three-year increments. So if you look back over the course of the past three years, we have the lowest expense growth. It's something like half of what our peer group average is in terms of noninterest expense, annual compound annual growth. And we were growing revenue at a little more than 2x the rate we were growing expenses during that period. I think we have every intention to do exactly the same thing over the course of the next three years. What we want to make sure that we're doing though is that when we make an investment, we finish the play, we get the outcomes of the investment and we move on. And I try to correct at the midpoint, you run the risk of having started a lot of things. And then you don't get the excellence that you mentioned at the beginning. It's the bench bird cycle I referenced when I talked to Erika.\nMichael Mayo: And I'm sorry, the start of the 3-year period now is -- was when?\nTimothy Spence: The last three years, we will have grown expenses less than anybody else. The next three years, we intend to do the same thing. We intend to generate positive operating leverage over the next three years. The same way we have to last three years.\nMichael Mayo: Got it. And then let's just go back to that quote One Robin does not make a spring. You said June was better, but you're not extrapolating that. Your guidance may be conservative, may not be, but Jamie, what is it that you saw in June and why.\nJames Leonard: Yes. there were two -- yes, two things, Mike, that happened in June that are certainly opportunities for the back half of the year to be better than what we're guiding to. But like most things, I'll give you another quote. The beauty is in of the beholder. So some folks look at the credit spread widening and the C&I coupon expansion that occurred in the market, and we experienced that as well in June. Spreads were up a bit. We're not guiding to continued spread expansion in the back half of the year in C&I. And then on deposits, June was a very good month for the industry, whether you watched the H8 or you've heard from all the banks that have been reporting, and you see it in our numbers. We're up 2% on deposits year-over-year. We're up 1% on an EOP basis sequentially. We had a very nice June from a deposit gathering, a new customer acquisition perspective. So what we're seeing from here is we actually are forecasting on an average basis, some deposit growth in the third quarter. But frankly, if you look at the guide on an average basis, it's about one point lower than our balances. So maybe we do better, maybe not, maybe it gives us a little bit of pricing power to do better on the beta. But with all that being said, we just still are cautious about the liquidity environment in the back half of the year, and we want to make sure that we prioritize stability until these challenges are behind us, and we start to enter into at least a Fed pause cycle, let alone a Fed cut cycle.\nMichael Mayo: And then last follow-up. Just how comfortable are you that your NII guide kind of captures it? And is that the kind of entry point for thinking about 2024?\nBryan Preston: Mike, it's Bryan. We certainly feel comfortable with our guide. As Jamie talked earlier and as we've talked consistently the Fed hiking cycle ends, we expect a quarter or two of impact as the deposit repricing lags play out. And we still feel like we're going to see stability then both from an NII and NIM perspective. and growth as earning asset growth starts to pick up from there or from an NII perspective. And so we feel very well positioned with the actions that we've taken and the optionality that's going to give us as we manage the balance year. But certainly, a lot can change from an outlook perspective, a lot can change in terms of what happens in 2024. But with what we see right now, we feel very good about our guide and what it's going to allow us to grow in 2024.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Jamie. I'd like to come back to Jamie and Greg on credit for a moment. Greg, you talked about -- and we all recognize your credit is very strong. The numbers are very low. But I'm curious, you mentioned about how you guys have a very robust management structure that allowed you to stay ahead of these emerging trends. Can you share with us what is that robust structure. And what do you mean by keeps you ahead of those trends when you say something like that?\nGreg Schroeck: Yes. I think it's the ongoing review of the portfolio. As an example, in the second quarter, our team completed a complete review of our office portfolio, right? And so as we continue to stress that portfolio increasing rates using the forward curve to try to get out ahead of where those cash flows end up if rates continue to increase, but also looking at the softening rental rates in that portfolio in the real estate portfolio. That's how we stay ahead of it. We're not waiting for a covenant to forge, we're not waiting for borrowers to come to us. We're active, proactive in again, stressing the portfolio across the board, not just in commercial real estate. So we see what's coming. I think it's one of the lessons learned and a lot of us have the battles cars from the last crisis of being much more proactive state out ahead of it and then bringing forward solutions to our clients that, again, that are more proactive as opposed to, again, waiting for the covenant defaults, waiting for something to drop off the table. So that's what I'm really referring to in terms of the merchant risk.\nJames Leonard: The other one, Gerard, that we've talked about in the past has been some of the proprietary systems we have from an early warning perspective, keeping an eye on real-time liquidity metrics out of the book that we've learned, whether it's through some of the ABL monitoring that was doing that we've adapted as the best practice inside Fifth Third as well as then what other banks do always with regard to covenant monitoring and other vulnerability assessment.\nGreg Schroeck: Real-time liquidity metrics was kind of what Jamie is referring to.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then just as a follow-up, Greg, you mentioned one to two loans, the little pop that you'll likely see in the third quarter. were those shared national credits? And second, how big were the individual loans? And are you still making shared national credit loans today? .\nGreg Schroeck: So second question, yes, on a select basis, we are still making shared national credit decisions. One of the credits that I was referring to that could impact is a shared national credit. The second one is not.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Chris Doll for some closing remarks.\nChris Doll: Thank you, Rob, and thanks, everyone, for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the IR department if you have any follow-up questions. Rob, you may now disconnect the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

That's how we stay ahead of it. We're not waiting for a covenant to forge, we're not waiting for borrowers to come to us. We're active, proactive in again, stressing the portfolio across the board, not just in commercial real estate. So we see what's coming. I think it's one of the lessons learned and a lot of us have the battles cars from the last crisis of being much more proactive state out ahead of it and then bringing forward solutions to our clients that, again, that are more proactive as opposed to, again, waiting for the covenant defaults, waiting for something to drop off the table. So that's what I'm really referring to in terms of the merchant risk. Real-time liquidity metrics was kind of what Jamie is referring to. So second question, yes, on a select basis, we are still making shared national credit decisions. One of the credits that I was referring to that could impact is a shared national credit. The second one is not."

            "name": "Timothy Spence",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the quarter, I'd like to welcome our new Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck to the call. Greg has been a part of Fifth Third for 35 years, and during that time, you see more than a few credit cycles. He previously held leadership roles in both credit risk and the line of business, including serving as our Chief Commercial Credit Officer for several years and is our Head of Leasing, asset-based lending and structured finance. We're fortunate to have him as part of the Fifth Third executive team. Despite heightened market volatility over the past four months, Fifth Third has delivered consistent top quartile financial results while investing strategically to position the bank for the long term. Our operating priorities have been and continue to be stability, profitability and growth in that order. Earlier today, we reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.87, excluding items noted in the release, a 10% increase compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 9%, reflecting our diverse fee sources and resilient balance sheet. Expenses increased 4%, excluding items noted in the release. And credit quality was strong with net charge-offs and early stage delinquencies remaining below normalized levels. Our key return metrics improved even as we increased our capital levels and credit reserves. We generated an adjusted return on assets of over 1.2% and adjusted return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, of 15.4% and an efficiency ratio below 55% for the quarter. These will be important bellwether metrics for all banks as we adapt to impending regulatory changes. Deposits continue to be in focus for the entire sector in the second quarter. Fifth Third's total period-end deposits increased 1% sequentially and increased 2% year-over-year as compared to a 5% decline for the HA [ph] over the same period. Our commercial banking and commercial banking business segments both generated period-end deposit growth. Given the year-over-year decline in deposit system-wide, it's reasonable to ask how Fifth Third has continued to outperform. The answers are deliberate multiyear strategies to expand distribution in our Southeast markets to launch innovative operational deposit-oriented solutions like momentum banking and our treasury management offerings and our sustained focus on primary household growth. We have added over 70 de novo branches in our Southeast footprint since 2019, more than any other bank except JPMorgan. As a portfolio, these branches are outperforming their original business cases on deposit production with several producing at a rate of 200% to 300% of plan. In consumer, we generated year-over-year net household growth of 3% once again this quarter, continuing a strong multiyear trend and punctuated by 7% year-on-year growth in the Southeast and continued success in our Momentum banking product. In commercial, we have added a record number of new quality middle-market relationships this year, up 30% from 2022. Our embedded payments business, Newline, has also been a strong catalyst for deposit growth. We expect the environment in the back half of the year to remain highly competitive for deposits. While we will continue to protect our house relationships and manage to a strong and stable liquidity profile, we will not match a rational pricing competition in a way that prioritizes headline growth over profitability. Turning to pending regulation. We are taking steps to adapt our balance sheet in anticipation of higher capital and liquidity requirements across the industry. We finished the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 9.5% having accreted around 90 basis points of capital from retained earnings over the course of the past year. We are balancing three capital priorities, continuing to build capital on an accelerated pace, supporting a dividend increase in the third quarter subject to Board approval and supporting clients to drive organic growth. We will continue to pause share repurchases until the final capital rules are published and new capital targets are established. We are also taking several actions to boost on balance sheet liquidity and optimize returns. -- in reducing our indirect auto lending origination volumes by approximately 15% through the exit of noncore states, trimming outsized lines and closely evaluating select areas of our corporate banking business. While we acknowledge the market's more optimistic outlook, we remain vigilant on the potential for a recession in 2024. Our commercial clients continue to perform well, but they are being cautious by slowing their growth plans. Many are closely watching the impact that regulation may have on credit availability and pricing. Consumers have held up well in aggregate, but there has been a divergence between homeowners who were able to lock in historically low mortgage rates and renters who have had to face persistent inflation in their largest monthly expense. Compared to three years ago, homeowners in our deposit base have maintained strong deposit balances, whereas renters deposit balances are down meaningfully. I want to thank our nearly 20,000 employees for their unwavering commitment to serving clients in our communities. Last year, you volunteered more than 117,000 hours to community organizations and you provided leadership to roughly 1,200 not-for-profit boards. Due to your hard work, we have already delivered nearly $30 billion of our 10-year $100 billion commitment to provide affordable housing, access to essential services and renewable energy. In June, we celebrated Fifth Third's 165th anniversary. Given the current pace of technological and regulatory change and the logical questions about market structure and competitive model to follow. It was an interesting time to reflect on our history and what it could tell us about this moment. Since Fifth Third's founding in 1858, the company has withstood a civil war, two World Wars, two global health pandemic and 33 recessions. The company adapted its business model to take advantage of technological innovations including the telephone, electric white bulbs, the automobile and the Internet. We were an early adopter of the wire and ACH Windows, anchored the rollout of the credit card networks in the Midwest, invented the network ATM and were one of the 15 initial launch bankers. We witnessed the creation of the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC and have continued to thrive through many different regulatory regimes. I believe that companies that stand the test of time, develop a character of their own that extends beyond the people who work there. Fifth Third's character is rooted in hard work, ingenuity and insistence on excellence and the sense of responsibility for the communities we serve. I'm as confident as in Fifth Third's positioning, our ability to outperform through the cycle and to deliver innovations that improve lives for all our stakeholders. And frankly, I'm just thankful to be part of [indiscernible] steward the bank into the future. With that, I'll now hand it over to Jamie to provide more details on our financial results and outlook. Yes. That's a good question, Erika, and I appreciate it. I will say, I think all of the things that you described, the RWA diet, a continuous focus on expenses, thinking about liquidity profile and in particular, the value of different sorts of deposits in the new world are all things we're doing here today. But we have the benefit of having made multiyear investments in either asset classes or in particular, on the operational deposit side of the equation that are benefiting us in this environment, and they're going to continue to be very valuable going forward. I think narrowly, the hardest thing on an organization, if you're trying to deliver predictable long-term results is to have to move into a binge purge mode, right? And whether that is outsized growth followed by shrinking or letting expenses run up, followed by deep cuts later it creates -- the two things happen. One, the first thing that people cut tends to be the last thing that came in the door. And the byproduct of that is your cuts end up being concentrated in the areas you are investing for future growth, one. Two, your people actually become more reticent to stretch and to try to give better outcomes because they don't want to get outsized and have to work backwards. So I think what -- the advantage we're going to have next year and the year after that and the year forward is our ability to be consistent about investing in the franchise. And that will mean that we stay on the pace that we've been on the last several years in building branches. It will mean that we continue to add to the middle market teams because I think the economics of these middle market banking relationships are going to continue to be excellent regardless of what happens to capital and liquidity. And we're going to continue to focus on having the best retail deposit franchise and best treasury management franchise in our peer group. Yes. So let me answer the question about the outlook, Ebrahim and then I think we'll go to Jamie to talk about the dynamics around the specific ACL. So look, I think our outlook is that it's hard to know. Like I watch -- we watch the same equity market indicators that you do. We see the trends on unemployment. We see that signal around inflation moderating. And I hear a lot from folks about the increased probability for a soft landing. We just don't get paid to manage to a Goldilocks scenario outcome here, right? Because for every positive indicator, you still have like a yield curve that's more inverted than it has been in decades. You have data coming out of the red book that suggests that same-store sales in retail across the US has been negative since the beginning of the year, the consumer spending on a real basis, so take the impact of inflation out, like flat or down in five of the last seven periods you have a negative ISM in terms of what we're seeing their freight levels, whether it's exports and imports or the over-the-road stuff here in the U.S. continuing to be depressed, like those are not positive signs. And if you buy the thesis that the -- what we're experiencing today is the interest rate environment we had 12 months ago, that we're seeing all of that in a world where Fed funds was 150, 175, right? So at least from our point of view, while it's very possible that we end up with a soft landing here. And I think even if we end up with a mild recession that it is not one that's characterized by unemployment levels, that we still are going to end up in a recessionary environment. The last thing I just want to make sure that I flag because I think sometimes words matter is, we talk about an RWA diet where other people talk about balance sheet optimization. What we're really saying is tightening credit supply and higher risk spreads, right? And those things have an impact on M2 that compounds whatever gets done on M1, that are the other factor that's sort of lingering out there that I think that we need to take into account as we're looking at the outcomes. So that's probably a long way of saying, I don't know any more than you do in terms of where we settle, but we're going to always plan around a more conservative outcome because if we're wrong, everybody does well. And if we're right, we're better positioned to deliver stable earnings for you. Yes. We are seeing some softening in demand. There's no question about that. I think in general, part of its conservatism on the part of the clients. I think and the lack of visibility that they have into what the economy is going to look like 18 months from now. I think the other dynamic that we hear from clients is they are saying they're a little bit nervous about credit availability. So there's an interaction effect here that you have to take into account. But I was on the phone with two large clients, one in the medical field, one in the real estate field, in the past 1.5 weeks. And in both cases, they had gone out and surveyed their bank groups, and there were a lot of, hey, we've allocated all the capital we have available to invest in the second half of the year sort of responses that they were hearing back and/or real constraints on the way that they have to spread ancillaries. So I think there is a dynamic that will materialize here where demand will be lower for credit because the cost of credit will be higher. And that's the interaction effect that I think as we roll forward here, we're going to continue to see in addition to just general caution. Yes. Mike, it's Tim. I'm going to take that one. I mean we are working on expenses. The severance item that we called out as part of an exercise that we ran, just to try to rightsize the resource base here for demand, given the outlook in the environment. And as you know, the primary outcome of all of this investment we're making in the core platforms is to bring more automation and straight-through processing to the business, which we think is going to provide a lot of intermediate-term expense positive expense outcomes. I think what we're trying to do is to manage the expense base and the focus on positive operating leverage around sort of three-year increments. So if you look back over the course of the past three years, we have the lowest expense growth. It's something like half of what our peer group average is in terms of noninterest expense, annual compound annual growth. And we were growing revenue at a little more than 2x the rate we were growing expenses during that period. I think we have every intention to do exactly the same thing over the course of the next three years. What we want to make sure that we're doing though is that when we make an investment, we finish the play, we get the outcomes of the investment and we move on. And I try to correct at the midpoint, you run the risk of having started a lot of things. And then you don't get the excellence that you mentioned at the beginning. It's the bench bird cycle I referenced when I talked to Erika. The last three years, we will have grown expenses less than anybody else. The next three years, we intend to do the same thing. We intend to generate positive operating leverage over the next three years. The same way we have to last three years."

            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were once again strong despite the market headwinds. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of just below 55%, which is a 4-point improvement compared to the prior quarter. Our second quarter adjusted PPNR grew more than 8% compared to both the prior quarter and year ago quarter, driven by the continued diversification and growth of our fee revenue streams combined with disciplined expense management throughout the bank. . Net interest income primate $1.46 billion increased 9% year-over-year, did decline 4% sequentially. Our sequential NII performance was the result of our deliberate actions to grow on balance sheet liquidity to support a defensive balance sheet position, given the uncertain macroeconomic outlook and tightening liquidity conditions. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 54 basis points to 2.3%, which represents a cycle-to-date beta of 45% on interest-bearing deposits, which includes the impact of CDs. Adjusted noninterest income increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, with increases in mortgage fee income and commercial banking revenue partially offset by a decline in deposit service charges due to the impact of earnings credits from higher market rates and the elimination of our consumer NSF fees in July of last year. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 10% compared to the year ago quarter as elevated compensation and benefits expense was driven by nonqualified deferred compensation costs, the minimum wage increase that went into effect in July of 2022 and continued investment in dividend finance. Additionally, expenses increased from higher technology and communications expense and the impact of the increased FDIC assessment that began in January. Excluding the impacts of nonqualified deferred compensation, which are offset by a gross up in securities gains, the FDIC assessment increase and incremental expense growth from dividend finance, Total underlying expenses increased approximately 4% compared to the year ago quarter. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases were stable sequentially in both commercial and consumer portfolios due to our continued discipline with respect to client selection and optimizing returns and also reflecting softening demand. The period-end commercial revolver utilization rate of 35% decreased 2% compared to last quarter. C&I balances were flat compared to the prior quarter as strong middle market loan production and muted payoffs were offset by the lower revolver utilization. Corporate banking production was also tempered due to our focus on optimizing returns on capital in this environment and lower customer demand. Average total consumer portfolio loan and lease balances reflected growth from dividend finance, offset by declines in indirect auto and residential mortgage. Average total deposits were flat compared to the prior quarter as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were offset by a decline in demand deposits. By segment, consumer deposits increased 1% and commercial deposits decreased 1%, while wealth and asset management deposits declined 12%, reflecting the impact of tax payments as well as clients' alternative investment options. June activity reflected continued momentum such that period-end total deposits were up 1% compared to the prior quarter. Notably, we have grown deposits 2% since the end of last June compared to a 5% decline for the top 25 banks as shown in the Fed's H8 data. Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends were stable with our key credit metrics remaining below normalized levels. The net charge-off ratio of 29 basis points increased three basis points compared to the prior quarter. The NPA ratio of 54 basis points was up three basis points compared to the prior quarter. In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which represents 85% of our consumer portfolio. We have also maintained one of the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in nonprime consumer borrowers among our peers. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall CRE concentration as a percent of total loans relative to peers for many years. Within CRE, we have limited office exposure with a low and improving criticized asset ratio and almost no delinquencies. We continue to watch office closely and believe the overall impact on Fifth Third will be limited. We had deemphasized office even before the pandemic, and we are not currently pursuing new office CRE originations. From an overall credit management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on generating and maintaining high-quality relationships. As many of you know, we have been and remain cautious in our economic outlook. We tightened underwriting standards during COVID, including stressing credits to an up 200-basis-point scenario off the forward curve, which limited our growth but improved the stability of our balance sheet. Since we began tightening underwriting standards, roughly 90% of our commercial portfolio has been re-underwritten. Our criticized assets have been stable over the past several quarters. Across all loan categories, we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress. Moving to the ACL. Our reserves increased $87 million, reflecting the impacts of dividend finance and Moody's macroeconomic forecast, which eroded slightly. The ACL ratio increased nine basis points sequentially. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the unemployment rate reaches 4.3%, while the downside scenario incorporates a peak unemployment rate of 7.8%. We maintained our scenario weightings of 80% to the base and 10% to each of the upside and downside scenarios. Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio increased 25 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at over 9.5%. Our capital position reflects our ability to build capital quickly through our strong earnings generation. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 11% compared to the year ago quarter. We continue to expect a meaningful improvement in our unrealized loss position, assuming the forward curve plays out, resulting in approximately 36% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2024 and approximately 50% by the end of 2025. Looking forward, we expect to build capital at an accelerated pace given our RWA optimization initiatives and by extending our share buyback pause. As Tim mentioned, we will postpone repurchases until we have more clarity on the regulatory environment in order to determine the new level of required capital dollars. Assuming we do not buy back shares through year-end, we would anticipate accreting capital such that our CET1 ratio ends this year at or above 10%. Moving to our current outlook; we expect full year average total loan growth between 1% and 2%, which reflects our cautious outlook on the economic environment and our decision to proactively adapt our balance sheet to the new regulatory regime. We expect total commercial loans to increase in the low single digits area compared to 2022, which implies a decline in the second half of the year relative to the first half. This outlook assumes the revolver utilization rate of 35% in the second quarter remained stable throughout the remainder of 2023. Our commercial loan outlook also assumes that we meaningfully reduced originations in certain areas of the commercial franchise, predominantly in the corporate bank to meet our higher risk-adjusted return thresholds, while continuing to increase the generation in our core middle market business, we expect total consumer loans to be stable to down slightly from reduced originations of the lower-yielding out-of-footprint auto and specialty lending channels, combined with portfolio residential mortgages, partially offset by growth from dividend finance. We currently expect to need approximately $4 billion in dividend loans for this year, which is a modest decrease from our previous expectations. We continue to expect to grow deposits in the back half of 2023, assuming stable or even slightly tighter market liquidity conditions Consistent with our track record over the past year of taking market share and maintaining high levels of core operating relationships in both consumer and commercial. Within that, we continue to expect migration from DDA into interest-bearing products throughout the remainder of 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits declining from 30% in the second quarter to 27% by year-end as we discussed last month. For the third quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to decline 1% to 2% sequentially with commercial down in the low single digits area and consumer stable to slightly down. We expect average deposits to be up 1% on a sequential basis, impacted by our strong finish to the second quarter, some seasonal uplift and the benefits of our multiyear investments in the franchise that Tim discussed earlier. Shifting to the income statement; we estimate full year NII will increase 3% to 5%, consistent with comments from the mid-June investor conference. Our AI guidance assumes a cumulative beta of 53% by the fourth quarter, assuming an additional 25 basis point rate hike in July and no further rate movements in 2023. Our outlook translates to total interest-bearing deposit costs increasing around 40 basis points in the third quarter and another 15 basis points or so in the fourth quarter. Our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances remained relatively stable between now and year-end. As a byproduct of strong deposit growth, combined with lower loan growth and stable securities balances, we expect to hold closer to $15 billion in cash and cash equivalents by year-end. We expect our loan-to-core deposit ratio to end the year in the mid-70s area. It will keep Fifth Third in a strong liquidity position in anticipation of more stringent regulatory environments. We expect third quarter NII to be down approximately 2% to 3% sequentially due to the continued impacts of the balance sheet dynamics I mentioned. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be stable in 2023, resulting from continued success, increasing market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities. with stronger gross treasury management, capital markets, wealth and asset management and mortgage servicing revenue to be offset by higher earnings credit rates on treasury management, subdued leasing remarketing revenue and a reduction in other fees due to lower TRA and private equity income this year. We expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from $46 million in 2022 to $22 million in 2023. We expect third quarter adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the second quarter. We expect to continue generating strong revenue across most fee captions, which we conservatively assume will be more than offset by a slight erosion in debt capital markets and mortgage revenue. reflecting the environmental headwinds as well as lower other noninterest income. We continue to expect full year adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022. If capital markets fees improve relative to our current expectations, we will likely land at the upper end of the range. Our expense outlook incorporates the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on January 1, the mark-to-market impact on nonqualified deferred compensation plans which was a reductant in 2022 expenses but an increase in 2023 and full year impact of investments to grow the dividend finance and provide businesses. Excluding the FDIC assessment and NQDC impacts, we would expect our full year 2023 core expenses to be up 3%. Our guidance reflects continued investment in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth in the low double digits for the year. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid- to high single digits area. Our guidance also factors in the run rate benefits from the severance expense recognized in the first half of the year, which reflected proactive actions taken to reduce ongoing expenses given the operating environment. We expect third quarter adjusted noninterest expenses to decrease 1% to 2% compared to the second quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 3% to 4%. This would result in an efficiency ratio of around 56% for the full year. We expect full year total net charge-offs to continue to be in our previously stated 25 basis point to 35 basis point range. However, as you would expect, with normalizing credit costs in this environment from record low levels, there may be a little lumpiness in C&I in the second half such that total Bancorp's third quarter losses are expected to be 35 to 45 basis points and then fourth quarter losses improving relative to the third quarter. Given our reduced loan growth outlook, we expect a lower quarterly build to the ACL in the $25 million to $75 million range, assuming no significant changes in the underlying Moody's economic scenarios. This considers strong production from dividend finance of around $750 million in the third quarter, which, as you know, carries a higher reserve level. In summary, with our proactive balance sheet management, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue generating long-term sustainable value for our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. It really comes down to the rate environment with the Fed in our forecast, the assumption being that the Fed reaches 5.5%, and holds. And therefore, by the end of the fourth quarter, we've gotten through all of the repricing lag that would occur. So that right now, the third quarter guide is down 2% to 3% and then the full year guide implies a little bit of a step down from third quarter into fourth quarter, and then we'll see what 2024 holds when we get there. Implicit in the guide is an increase in our deposit costs so that the terminal beta is 53%. And I guess, coming out of listening to some of the other earned calls, the one comment we would have is that our June, like everyone else's was quite strong and could -- and I think to the point in your head could result in better NII outcomes than what it reflects. But from our standpoint, spotting one robin doesn't make it spring. And therefore, we're going to continue to be cautious in the outlook and play defense in this environment. We've got a long way to go from the liquidity conditions tightening with at $80 billion a month, $1.5 trillion or more of trade issuance, the student loan repayments kicking back in, and then the competitive dynamics that we're seeing across the footprint. So we're going to play a good defense, and we think defense wins championships in this environment. Correct in that the dividend reserve coverage ratio, we're assuming, remains in that 9% area. The reduction in the guide for the ACL build is driven by all of the loan production changes that we are forecasting with the RWA diet and reducing the balance sheet for the new capital regimes that will be forthcoming. Now you've just given the publicity then I'm going to have to live up giving you a 2024 NII guide. There's no question that Bryan and I have positioned the balance sheet to be currently neutral to benefiting for the rate cuts when the rate cuts ultimately occur. The down rate scenarios continue to be the most difficult for a bank earnings profile to manage as credit costs would ramp up and recession kicks in. So for us, I believe that the deposit cost pressures will mitigate as the Fed begins a cutting cycle. We just don't see that happening this year, which is why the guide on NII is what it is that we continue to expect a competitive environment. But should the Fed move to the cuts, we really like how the balance sheet is positioned for that environment. Our guide the exit run rate on fourth quarter NII, if you took our guide and multiplied it by 4, it's about where consensus is for 2024. So I don't think there's necessarily a gap at this point in time, but 2024 is a very long way from July 20. Yes. And let me clarify one thing from what you said that just to make sure we're on the same page. Our guide for the ACL is for the total Bancorp balance sheet. However, the primary driver of that ACL build is dividend. Dividend, we expect to do $750 million a quarter of production, that reserve rate ballpark it in the 9% range. But the rest of the balance sheet, as we discussed in the guide is actually going -- from a loan standpoint is actually going to be down a bit. And so the net of those growing dividend, shrinking other parts of the balance sheet, inclusive of auto where we exited the states west of the Mississippi, but for Texas, combined with our efforts in shrinking the corporate banking book will result in a lower ACL build than what we've been running at this year because those other businesses will essentially be reducing the ACL coverage due to lower volumes, whereas dividend call it, in that same area, but the net effect is, let's call it, a build of $25 million to $75 million a quarter going forward. Yes. Let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Greg Schroeck to add a little bit more color. But in terms of -- as we discussed in the outlook, we continue to have a total Bancorp charge-off guide in the 25 to 35 basis point range. Within commercial over the past couple of years, it's obviously bounced around from 36 bps in 2020 down to 10 bps in '21 and 13 bps last year. And this year on commercial, we continue to be in that 20 to 30 basis point range. And then within total commercial, C&I is expected to be at the high end of that range given some of the lumpiness that we're seeing with a few credits that resulted in a little bit of that uptick in the NPA ratio at the end of the quarter. But with that, I'll turn it over to Greg for thoughts on C&I underwriting and other views. Yes, Ken, great question. And embedded in all of our comments and outlook today, we should have outlined the strategy that our approach here for our company is that we fully expect TLAC to get pushed down. We expect the more draconian capital rules on ops risk to get pushed down, but not any of the benefits from the credit rating risk weighting, and we expect to have to be compliant with the full LCR. So that is the underpinning of all of our strategies for managing the balance sheet, and we want to do that expeditiously. And therefore, we are going to be holding higher levels of cash. We will be rotating more into Level 1 securities. But we love the bullet locked-out structure because that provides the shock absorber to potential low rate environment. And so the flip side to all of this will be the AOCI impacts with the capital rules. And so we'll wait to see what those final rules look like, but it sounds like, obviously, AFS inclusion, HTM exclusion. And so we may have to pivot a bit on the HTM classifications given that we've not done anything to date. But that might be an outcome from the brave new world that will have to adapt to. Yes. What we did in the second quarter was we let the portfolio cash flows of $600 million roll off and not get reinvested. So essentially, to your point, bolster cash. For the rest of the year, we're assuming stable, give or take, $1 billion. We may let it run down, we may rotate into treasuries just depending on the day and the opportunities. But what you should expect from us is continued rotation into Level 1, whether cash or treasuries. Yes. It's just that there is a several factors impacting that. So in terms of consumer on the household side, we do have a very strong and consistent growth of 3%, but offsetting that tailwind is the headwind from consumer spending and the declines in the average deposit balance. So when you look at the consumer, the average deposit is still 20% higher than pre-COVID levels, but it is down 10% from the COVID average balance peaks. And so we're modeling that, that erosion does continue and therefore, it creates a little bit of a headwind. So for us, the majority of the growth is obviously coming from the Southeast de novo market and they're growing at a 7% rate. But the Midwest, whether it's same-store sales or the total Midwest networks growing households at 2%. So we like what we've been able to do, and I would say it's more about core new customer acquisition than anything else. And in terms of scenario weightings, we anchored to the 80-10-10 distribution because that is the probability assignment by Moody's for each of those scenarios occurring. So that as you saw in this quarter, the scenarios eroded, unemployment ticked up about 30 basis points or so on a peak basis in their baseline scenario. And as Tim mentioned, it's certainly possible that we have a full employment soft recession. But we believe that obviously, the reserve is adequate and at 208 basis points of coverage, we feel good how we're positioned. Yes. there were two -- yes, two things, Mike, that happened in June that are certainly opportunities for the back half of the year to be better than what we're guiding to. But like most things, I'll give you another quote. The beauty is in of the beholder. So some folks look at the credit spread widening and the C&I coupon expansion that occurred in the market, and we experienced that as well in June. Spreads were up a bit. We're not guiding to continued spread expansion in the back half of the year in C&I. And then on deposits, June was a very good month for the industry, whether you watched the H8 or you've heard from all the banks that have been reporting, and you see it in our numbers. We're up 2% on deposits year-over-year. We're up 1% on an EOP basis sequentially. We had a very nice June from a deposit gathering, a new customer acquisition perspective. So what we're seeing from here is we actually are forecasting on an average basis, some deposit growth in the third quarter. But frankly, if you look at the guide on an average basis, it's about one point lower than our balances. So maybe we do better, maybe not, maybe it gives us a little bit of pricing power to do better on the beta. But with all that being said, we just still are cautious about the liquidity environment in the back half of the year, and we want to make sure that we prioritize stability until these challenges are behind us, and we start to enter into at least a Fed pause cycle, let alone a Fed cut cycle. The other one, Gerard, that we've talked about in the past has been some of the proprietary systems we have from an early warning perspective, keeping an eye on real-time liquidity metrics out of the book that we've learned, whether it's through some of the ABL monitoring that was doing that we've adapted as the best practice inside Fifth Third as well as then what other banks do always with regard to covenant monitoring and other vulnerability assessment."

As Jamie talked earlier and as we've talked consistently the Fed hiking cycle ends, we expect a quarter or two of impact as the deposit repricing lags play out. And we still feel like we're going to see stability then both from an NII and NIM perspective. and growth as earning asset growth starts to pick up from there or from an NII perspective. And so we feel very well positioned with the actions that we've taken and the optionality that's going to give us as we manage the balance year. But certainly, a lot can change from an outlook perspective, a lot can change in terms of what happens in 2024. But with what we see right now, we feel very good about our guide and what it's going to allow us to grow in 2024."

        "content": "Chris Doll: Good morning everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third\u2019s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning our President and CEO, Tim Spence and CFO, Jamie Leonard will provide an overview of our first quarter results and outlook. Our Treasurer, Bryan Preston has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements and our materials which can be found on our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding to the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third\u2019s performance. These statements speak only as of April 20th 2023 and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\nTimothy Spence: Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The past six weeks have seen a great deal of volatility in the banking sector. Markets have been trading on narratives over fundamentals and the term regional bank has been used to describe such a broad cross section of business models that it has lost any real descriptive value. While we at Fifth Third take any instability in our sector very seriously, there was no crisis inside our four walls. We\u2019ve been running the company with the expectation for a higher, for a longer rate environment for many quarters now. We\u2019ve consistently communicated in these calls and at investor conferences. As our first quarter results demonstrate our balance sheet remains well fortified, and our capacity to generate strong profitability through the cycle is strong. Excluding items noted in the release, we reported earnings per share of $0.83, a 20% increase compared to the year ago quarter. We generated nine points of year-over-year positive operating leverage driven by an 18% increase in revenue. During the quarter we held average and period end deposits flat sequentially despite the industry wide impact of quantitative tightening and normal seasonal pressures. Our key credit metrics remain near historical lows with net charge-offs of 26 basis points coming in at the low end of our guidance range. NPAs NPLs and early stage delinquency ratios remained below normalized levels, and criticized assets decrease modestly during the quarter. Moreover, we accomplished all this while also being recognized by Ethisphere as one of only two U.S. banks on their world's most ethical companies list. We were named by Fortune as one of America\u2019s most innovative companies. And we saw our FinTech platform provide named by Fast Company as one of the world's most innovative businesses. The strong outcomes achieved this quarter and in particular in the month of March highlight the strength, granularity and well balanced nature of our deposit franchise. In the weekend, following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank alone, we open more new commercial deposit accounts than we would in a typical month. Similarly, our consumer household growth accelerated after the March turmoil. Our commercial deposit franchises led by our peer leading treasury management business where we rank in the top 10 nationally and most major commercial payment types, 88% of our commercial deposit balances are attached to relationships that utilize TM services today, and the average age of our commercial deposit relationships is 24 years. These characteristics contribute strongly to stability regardless of balance size. Our consumer deposit base is granular with nearly 90% of total consumer deposits, FDIC insured and is anchored by our flagship mass market momentum banking offering and strong branch presence in the markets we serve. Annual consumer household growth finished the quarter above 3% led by our southeast markets above 7%. During the quarter, we opened five branches in our southeast markets on top of the 70 add ins in the past three years, and we expect to open an additional 30 branches by the end of 2023. All said, end of period total deposit balances ended the quarter above the level on March 8. Looking forward while we face the same headwinds that all banks do from increased deposit competition, economic uncertainty and the potential for regulatory change, I am confident in Fifth Third\u2019s ability to achieve top quartile returns through the cycle with a focus on stability, profitability and growth. Our long-term discipline managing interest rate and liquidity risks positions us well to generate differentiated outcomes in a range of economic environment. From a credit risk perspective, our low CRE concentration and commercial and in particular in office CRE, along with our focus on homeowners in consumer should prove to be significant advantages. Jamie will provide more information on our forward guidance, but the implied profitability and return metrics for our full year 2023 expectations are well ahead of our core 2019 results. Considering the uncertain and environment, we have elected to deposit [Ph] share repurchases for the second quarter and we\u2019ll evaluate resuming them in the second half of the year. Last, but certainly not least, I want to thank our 20,000 employees for their hard work and dedication and supporting our customers, communities and shareholders. Your commitment to living our purpose and making sure we do the right thing every day is evidence. With that, I\u2019ll now hand it over to Jamie to provide more details on our financial results and outlook.\nJames Leonard: Thank you, Tim. And thank all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were strong despite the market volatility during the quarter. Average and period and total deposit balances were flat compared to the prior quarter. Average core deposits declined in line with our guidance of down 1%. We grew loans modestly during the quarter while adding new quality relationships in both commercial and net new households and consumer. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of 59% and a seasonally challenged quarter, which is a six point improvement compared to the year ago quarter. Our first quarter core PPNR grew nearly 40% compared to last year, reflecting the diversification and growth of our revenue streams combined with disciplined expense management. Net interest income of approximately $1.52 billion increased 27% year over year, but declined 4% sequentially. Our sequential NII performance was impacted by our shift to a more defensive balance sheet position given the volatile environment, the impact of lower day count and seasonally strong investment portfolio income in the prior quarter. Fee income exceeded our expectations despite the market related headwinds, and we remain disciplined on expenses while continuing to invest in our businesses. PPNR was impacted by the expenses associated with higher than expected fee income. Our NIM declined six basis points for the quarter, while interest bearing deposit costs increased 64 basis points to 176 basis points, reflecting a cycle to date interest bearing deposit beta of 36% through the first quarter, which includes the impact of CDs. Total adjusted non-interest income increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter driven by -- commercial banking and mortgage fee income, which more than offset a decline in deposit service charges due to the elimination of consumer NSF fees last year and the impact of higher earnings credits from higher market rates this year. Growth in commercial banking fee income was primarily driven by increased loan syndication, fixed income sales and trading and M&A advisory revenue, partially offset by a decline in corporate bond fees. The improvement in mortgage revenue was driven by increased servicing fees and lower asset decay. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 6% compared to the year ago quarter, excluding the impact of non-qualified deferred compensation expenses from both periods. Expense growth was elevated due to the dividend finance acquisition in the second quarter of 2022 and growth in the provide franchise. Excluding the FinTech growth impacts and the FDIC assessment, total expenses increased approximately 3% compared to the year ago quarter as discipline throughout the bank, combined with automation initiatives were offset by compensation associated with our minimum wage hike, higher fee income and higher technology and communications expense, reflecting our focus on platform modernization initiatives. Moving to the balance sheet, total average portfolio loans and leases increased 1% sequentially reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Commercial was led by C&I where payoffs were muted and production was stable in our regional middle market banking business but down in our corporate bank. The subdued production and the corporate bank reflects our focus on optimizing returns on capital in this environment, combined with less robust demand. Compared to a year ago quarter, C&I loans, excluding PPP have increased 13%. The period and commercial revolver utilization rate remains stable compared to last quarter at 37%. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increase 2% compared to the prior quarter led by dividend finance while balances from the rest of our consumer captions remained relatively stable. Average total deposits were flat compared to the prior quarter, as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were offset by a decline in demand deposits. By segment, wealth and asset management average balances increased sequentially, consumer was stable and commercial modestly declined consistent with normal first quarter seasonality. Period and total deposits were also flat compared to the prior quarter. Notably, we have grown deposits 1% since the end of last June compared to a 4% decline for the top 25 banks as shown in the Feds AJ data. We have included additional materials in our earnings presentation to highlight some of the key attributes of our high quality deposit franchise that may be relevant in this environment. Moving to Credit, as Tim mentioned, credit trends remain healthy and our key credit metrics remained well below normalized levels. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased four basis points sequentially to 26 basis points and remained below 2019 levels. The net charge-off ratio of 26 basis points increased four basis points sequentially, and was at the low end of our guidance range. The NPA ratio of 51 basis points was up two basis points compared to a year ago. From a credit management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on high quality relationships. In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We have also maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in nonprime consumer borrowers among our peers. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in CRE at 14% of total loans. Across all commercial portfolios, we continue to closely monitor exposures where your inflation and higher rates may cause stress and continue to closely watch the leveraged loan portfolio and office CRE. Office loans of $1.6 billion represented just 1.3% of total loans, with a criticized ratio of 8.2% and only one basis point of delinquencies. While the leveraged loan portfolio has declined 65% since 2016, and is now less than $3 billion outstanding today. We have focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong, stable results through the cycle. Moving to the ACL. Our reserve change this quarter was a net increase of $37 million, or a build of $86 million excluding the onetime impact of adopting the accounting standard eliminating TDR accounting, which reduced the reserve by $49 million. Our bill primarily reflected loan growth, notably from dividend finance loans which contributed $88 million of the increase. The ACL ratio increased one basis point sequentially, or five basis points excluding the accounting change. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the unemployment rate reaches 4% while the downside scenario underlying our allowance coverage incorporates a peak unemployment rate of 7.8%. We maintained our scenario weightings of 80% to the base and 10% to each of the upside and downside scenarios. Moving to Capital, our CET1 ratio remained relatively stable compared to last quarter, and in the first quarter at 9.25%. Our capital position reflects our strong earnings generation offset by the impacts of returning capital in the form of dividends and repurchases, risk weighted asset growth primarily in consumer loans and a seven basis point decline from the CECL phase in. Our tangible book value per share increased 11% sequentially, partially impacted by our AOCI position, which improves 17%. Tangible book value grew 7% excluding AOCI compared to the year ago quarter. Moving to our current outlook, we expect full year average total loan growth between 2% and 3% which reflects our cautious outlook on the economic environment. We expect total commercial loans to increase in the low to mid-single digits area compared to 2022 which implies modest incremental growth from the first quarter through year end given our outlook for a tempered lending environment in the second half of the year. We expect line utilization rates to remain stable. We expect total consumer loan growth to also be modest as a strong increase from dividend finance will be mostly offset by a decline in auto and mortgage. We continue to expect approximately $4.5 billion in dividend loan production for the year given the secular tailwinds and our investments in the business combined with market share gains. We expect deposits to be stable or grow from the first quarter average level as we progress throughout 2023 consistent with our strong customer acquisition trends. Within that, we expect continued migration from DDA into interest bearing products throughout the remainder of 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits, declining from 32% today to 30% by year end. For the second quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% sequentially with growth fairly balanced between commercial and consumer portfolios. We expect average deposits to also be stable to up 1% on a sequential basis. Shifting to the income statement, we expect full year NII will increase 7% to 10%. As other banks have noted, industry wide deposit pricing pressures intensified in the wake of the Silicon Valley and Signature Bank failures. Therefore, as shown in our presentation materials, we are providing NII guidance under a range of deposit betas given potential diverging levels of intensity with respect to deposit competition going forward. The upper end of our NII guidance assumes an approximate terminal beta of 43%, and the lower end assumes approximately a 49% terminal beta compared to our January expectation of 42%. The midpoint of our NII outlook translates to a 47% beta with total interest bearing deposit costs increasing 45 basis points or so in the second quarter, and another 25 basis points in the second half of the year. Our outlook also considers the lag effects from previous rate hikes and continued DDA migration and assumes the Fed hikes 25 basis points in May, and then holds short term rates of 525 basis points for the remainder of the year. Our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances decline a couple billion dollars between now and year end, and that we hold closer to $10 billion in excess cash for most of the year. Assuming we continue to defensively position the balance sheet for the remainder of the year by maintaining an elevated excess cash position combined with continued intense deposit competition, we are assuming NIM will be in the 320 to 325 range for the year. We expect second quarter NII to be down approximately 1% sequentially reflecting the deposit loan and cash dynamics I mentioned. We expect adjusted non-interest income to be stable to up 1% in 2023, reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments and talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger gross treasury management revenue, capital markets fees wealth and asset management revenue and mortgage servicing to be partially offset by higher earnings credit rates on TM, subdued lease remarketing revenue and a reduction and other fees reflecting lower TRA and private equity income this year. We expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from 46 million in 2022 to 22 million in 2023. We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 2% to 3% compared to the first quarter. We expect to continue generating strong revenue across most fee captions and that will be partially offset by a slowdown in debt capital markets revenue. We continue to expect full year adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022. Our expense outlook incorporates the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on January 1. The mark-to-mark can impact on non-qualified deferred compensation plans which was a reduction in 2022 expenses, and the full year impact of investments to grow the dividend finance and provide businesses. Excluding the dividend acquisition, FDIC assessment and NQDC impacts, we would expect our full year 2023 core expenses to be up less than 3%. Our guidance reflects continued investment in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth in the low double digits for the year. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid to high single digits area. Our guidance also factors the run rate benefits from the severance expense recognized in the first quarter, which reflected proactive actions taken to reduce on-going expenses given the operating environment. We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest expenses to decrease 8% to 9% compared to the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 6% to 8%, resulting in PPNR growth in the 9% to 10% range. This would result in an efficiency ratio below 55% for the full year. We expect second quarter PPNR to increase 10% to 11% compared to the first quarter, and for second quarter efficiency ratio to be around 54%. We continue to expect second quarter and full year 2023 net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis points range. Given our expected period and loan growth, including continued strong production from dividend finance we continue to expect a quarterly build to the ACL of approximately $100 million, assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios. In summary, with our strong PPNR growth engine, discipline, credit risk management, and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.\nChris Doll: Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nScott Siefers: Good Morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Let\u2019s see, Tim, you talked about the much higher than typical commercial account openings in during all the turmoil. Can you talk about sort of early reads on what has happened with those and sort of generally speaking how you\u2019d expect commercial customers to behave going forward, whether they\u2019ll keep the same amount with their primary institution or diversify sort of permanently? How would that all work in your mind?\nTimothy Spence: Yes, so good. Good morning, Scott. Thanks for the question. Just a note for everybody. We know you have a busy day here. So with the exception of the soliloquy that Jamie has prepared on regulation going forward, we\u2019re going to try to keep our answers. pretty crisp. We were delighted to see the activity obviously and to see that continue to carry forward through the end of the quarter. All but I literally had single digits you could count on, I think one hand and two fingers, the number of the accounts that we opened, that didn\u2019t fund up between the that weekend immediately following Silicon Valley and the end of the quarter. So I\u2019m very pleased with the activity level there. I think in terms of account behavior going forward, I think we\u2019re going to see a much more prominent bifurcation and behavior between operational accounts and non-operational accounts, right. In effect on the corporate treasurer side, cash as an investment versus cash as a tool in terms of the way that you manage the business. And that is reflected in the operational account behavior that we saw during the period I think probably contributed very significantly to the stability. The Fifth Third experienced in terms of commercial account balances. But Jamie, you have anything you want to add?\nJames Leonard: Yes, and Scott, what we also saw in the first quarter was that clients were focused on getting money to the best vehicle possible. So for us during the quarter, we moved almost a billion dollars more into the money market portal that we manage for them. And even with that incremental movement, we were only down about a billion dollars in commercial and a seasonally challenged quarter when last year, we were down 2 billion in the quarter, seasonally and the year before that we were down 3 billion. So to Tim\u2019s point, the money has been moving to the optimal investment vehicles. But the good news for us is we were able to overcome that headwind and actually posted a very solid commercial deposit quarter.\nScott Siefers: Perfect, thank you. And then Jamie, maybe additional color on you gave the thoughts on non-interest bearing the total deposits and certainly that go forward mixer and of your mix. What in your thinking makes that the right number? Why not -- why not lower, why not higher? What was sort of the inside baseball on that?\nJames Leonard: Yes, the last tightening cycle, we moved down five points. This time we\u2019re forecasting to go down eight to finish the year at a 30% DDA to core deposit level. Given that our rate outlook now has the 525 and a lot longer hold with no cut. We think we\u2019ll see continued migration and higher earnings credit rates that will result in more DDA migration. And then the challenge over time is, can you sell enough treasury management services to rebuild that DDA balance and given our strong treasury management business, we feel confident in our ability to do it. So hopefully, we do bottom out at 30. But for every 1% more than that, it translates to 40 to 50 million of NII erosion. So, it\u2019s, while not tremendous impact, we would still want to ensure that we get that 30% higher as we head into 2024 and things like that.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. All right. Thank you, everyone.\nJames Leonard: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Tim. Hi, Jamie.\nJames Leonard: Morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Jamie, you\u2019ve touched on the credit and how strong it is particularly in the commercial real estate office. I think when you guys look at the scene I portfolio is there anything on the horizon whether it\u2019s I know your leverage loan balances, as you pointed out, are down dramatically from 2016. What are you guys seeing or sensing on the scene in the C&I portfolio not CRE?\nJames Leonard: Yes, on C&I, that was the driver of the NPA increase this quarter. So on the surface NPAs, were up seven basis points, this sector that drove it the most within C&I would be restaurants, entertainment as well as professional services. But with that said, the delinquency levels in commercial and certainly in C&I continue to be benign. And Tim and I were looking back at where we were on NPAs. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we were at 62 basis points versus the 51 that we\u2019re at today. And if you look at the 10 year average, for us, we\u2019re at a 69 basis point average. So while we\u2019re up that seven basis points sequentially, it\u2019s really more of a normalization. And we\u2019re still 25% or so below a normal run rate when it comes to commercial NPA. So it\u2019s really normalization within some of these sectors. And for us, at least right now, it\u2019s entertainment and professional services.\nTimothy Spence: And if I if I just add one thing on that drawing, scale is going to matter in terms of the clients that you bank, in C&I, because if you think about the dynamics that are creating headwinds for the economy, they\u2019re related to your ability to manage input costs, or production. And ultimately, right the higher costs of carrying inventory to offset concerns around supply chain resiliency on an on-going basis. So when you the sense you get I do when I\u2019m out talking with clients is the manufacturing businesses and the businesses attached to the resurgence of manufacturing in the U.S. are doing really, really well. The businesses that are attached to more discretionary spending. The larger clients have been able to pass input cost increases higher cost of labor through the smaller ones are having a more difficult time. And I think that arm wrestling we're seeing going on right now as an example between the not for profit hospitals and the health. The health care insurance companies is a really good example of where the larger not for profits are having a easier go of extracting concessions to cover increases in nursing costs and otherwise, and the smaller ones, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s been more of a standoff.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Then, as a follow up question, Jamie in the outlook on in interest revenue obviously, you guys got it down a little bit. But if you\u2019ve had to paint two scenarios, one is the bullish scenario, what would rates have to do where you could actually see maybe deposit betas stall out faster? Or net interest revenue picks up? And then what\u2019s the more cautionary view? Is it higher rate, not the frozen rate, five and a quarter, but we get the six and a half or something like that on Fed Funds rates in the first quarter of 2024? Can you give us those two variables?\nJames Leonard: Yes, I would say that. On the positive side of net interest income, if the industry and the competitive dynamics settled down over the next couple of months, couple of quarters, then we would expect that we would operate in that low to mid 40s beta and that would deliver the higher end of our NII guide. We\u2019re a little cautious though, in what we\u2019re seeing from a competitive standpoint, as banks are clearly focused on driving, more insured retail deposit growth, and therefore the retail beta is the wildcard in our guide, and why we show the range of deposit betas that could play out and therefore the range of the NII guide is a little wider than what we normally would do just given the uncertainty with how competition will react. So in the near term, that is the wildcard that perhaps retail deposit betas which had been very well behaved actually double by the end of the year. And that would take us to the low end of the guide. I think longer-term when it comes to rates progressing beyond five and a quarter. It really comes down to what are the credit implications as the Fed reaches an even higher level. We think the magnitude of the rate increases have certainly created some shock across the country. And you saw that obviously, in what we\u2019re calling the March Madness. But I think from an NII perspective, those higher rates could continue to be productive as long as the deposit beta dynamics stay in the 40% range. But if competition heats up, and we get into a 60% plus beta environment, that would be unproductive to NII.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please proceed.\nKen Usdin: Hey guys, good morning. As you as you as you think further out, I know Jamie would talked about that, that trying to channel that downside, NIM. Obviously, the rate environment has changed and all the points about the mix and the deposit growth have as well. But just in terms of just how the how you expect the balance sheet mix to change over time, given that you\u2019re running down the securities book and your points about the DDA mix. How do you just think about that NIM protection angle, and does it make you think any differently about your, the way you built the swaps portfolio and protecting that? Thanks.\nJames Leonard: Yes, we feel very good about how the balance sheet is positioned, especially for a downgrade environment. Obviously, the swaps we\u2019re very pleased with the entry points there. We\u2019ve talked at length about in 2025, there\u2019ll be a nice increased NII as the new swaps kick in. In terms of the investment portfolio positioning, we\u2019ll have a bit of a decline in the second quarter as we don\u2019t reinvest cash flows, but from there should be relatively stable. We may continue to reposition non-HQLA and the level ones but ultimately that\u2019ll be regulatory dependent, but overall feel good about the bullet locked out nature, the structure that we have. So I think for us, it\u2019s going to be more of operating in a high 70s loan to deposit ratio and continuing to maintain that while being very disciplined on credit which is why the loan growth guide was trimmed a bit to that up, up 2% to 3% level.\nKen Usdin: Got it. And then on the same point about that deposit repricing isn\u2019t when the Fed does got in and obviously a lot of banks are guiding with the with the curve right now, how does your models work in terms of timing of Fed cuts versus your ability then change the direction of deposit pricing?\nJames Leonard: Yes, I mean, in general, it\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s a balance of that nature of when the cuts actually occur. If you\u2019re in a foreign liquidity environment where things still are relatively tight, the Fed has gotten inflation under control, but there\u2019s not a big credit event obviously, the measured cuts would be one where you\u2019re going to have a little bit more challenging time, reversing all the beta, you\u2019re still going to get some of the beta out. But in this scenario, where the Fed is having to loosen liquidity conditions pretty rapidly, you\u2019re going to have an opportunity to get a little bit more aggressive on your rate cuts from there and get some more of that beta out. So it really is going to be a little bit of a balance of how things play out. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time positioning the commercial book in particular, to make sure that we stay with the appropriate amount of price sensitivity there so that we can reprice down as necessary. We\u2019re up to about $20 billion of index deposits. So we\u2019re taking a lot of actions to make sure that we\u2019re well positioned, whether they stay high, or if they cut that we\u2019ve got the flexibility to navigate through those different environments.\nKen Usdin: Understood, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please proceed.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning.\nJames Leonard: Morning, Erica.\nErika Najarian: My first question is on the potential coming regulatory environment. And Jamie, you probably need something stronger than coffee for this question. But the first is on CT1, you generated 30 basis points of capital organically this quarter. And I\u2019m wondering as there\u2019s no NPR yet, but the market is anticipating tighter capital and liquidity standards. Tim, how do you think about the endpoint of capital for an institution like [Indiscernible] from this nine and a quarter? And how should we think about, what that sort of endpoint is over the medium term, and the role of share repurchases, and potentially more RWA optimization?\nTimothy Spence: Sure. I\u2019m going to let Jamie start on that one, Erica, and then I\u2019ll follow.\nJames Leonard: So from a short term perspective, obviously pausing the buybacks, and given the second quarter guide, we would expect to your point that we would continue to generate, call it 25 basis points of capital, even with some RWA growth in the second quarter. I do believe that it will be dependent on what the regulations ultimately come out with in order to then answer the medium term part of your question, because if I were king for a day, I would not change the AOCI opt out rules because this was not a capital crisis. I think the capital regime works as stated. But should they decide either to eliminate, held to maturity and force everybody in the AFS and then force AFS into an AOCI mark, perhaps the core earnings capacity of the company along with you, we included in the deck additional capital accretion measures, that we would improve the AOCI levels by 45%, by the end of next year. But it would be a manageable item for us; we just don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessary. We have a balance sheet that our target capital level is 9%. All stress testing says 9% is great. But, in this environment, we\u2019re going to accrete capital here in the short term and will get to 950. And hopefully have a little more clarity for everybody next quarter.\nTimothy Spence: And I think just to add two thoughts. Our capital stress testing indicates you could run the bank at below 9%, which is the reason that hasn\u2019t been the binding constraint for us. We just elect to do it at the level we do because we like stability, right? And I think we were clear with everybody when we reset the capital target last year, we did it because we were concerned about uncertainty in the Outlook, and we felt that it was prudent to start building capital early as opposed to having to do it later. So I am pleased in our positioning, I think more broadly one caution I would give everybody is I think some will take the discussion about change in regulation on capital liquidity and just bake it into models. Without assuming that there\u2019s any sort of evolution in the business model. The FDIC has been publishing quarterly data on the sector, I think since 1934. At least the dataset goes back that far. And there\u2019s been more than one regulatory regime change during that period. And if you adjust for tax, the tax policy at a given point in time, the return levels in the sector have been remarkably consistent. So to the extent that more banks are required to hold more capital, or more liquidity, or to change the structure of funding, I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that the business model is going to evolve, as well.\nErika Najarian: Got it. It\u2019s amazing how resilient banks can be when there\u2019s some level to rates. Right. And just a follow up question to that, for -- this management team is sort of well known for being more forward thinking, whether it\u2019s your balance sheet resilience to what\u2019s been happening in the right environment, or that, ACL ratio. And as we think about, like you mentioned Tim sort of the market trying to force the regional banks into a tighter regime in terms of how they\u2019re valuing the stocks, versus what we know to be, what tends to be a very slow regulatory process in terms of NPR comment period season, how do you balance that sort of market demand for higher capital? And TLAC eligible debt, greater cash liquidity versus the, the regulatory timeline? And what, that we don\u2019t know, nothing concrete today?\nTimothy Spence: I mean, I think the answer is you the way that you manage that proactively as you would have started doing something on each of those topics last year, right. So we were in the market, after every earnings call last year, four times. And as a result, have the lowest incremental need in the event that TLAC had no phase in period, right. As an example, you were deliberate about the way that you manage the ACL to reflect uncertainty in the forward outlook, and therefore you\u2019re carrying good coverage today, right, which we certainly feel we are. And you would have allowed yourself to a CRE capital during a period when the market was certainly more robust for regional banks, which I think, of course we did as well. I think lastly, what we\u2019re going to see here coming out of this, even if there is no change in regulation, as we all will flow, the empirical data from March Madness, through our models, and it\u2019s going to dictate a very different value for non-operational money and operational money, right. And the by-product of that is the banks that have good core retail deposit franchises, and who have good commercial operational commercial franchises. So linked to payment activity, treasury management services, and otherwise, that that is going to be the place that you want to be because while we think the Fed obviously at some point, rates are going to stay higher than zero on an absolute basis, and our ability to make money on both sides of the balance sheet is going to be a big driver who does well if there is more capital requirements or liquidity requirements are higher. Thank you.\nErika Najarian: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.\nMichael Mayo: Hi. So you think you expect deposits to be stable or increased from here but for NII to go down in the second quarter. Did I get that correctly? So the driver on NII is really twofold. One is the DDA mix, into interest bearing. And then the second element of the guide is that the movement up in rates in March to have a full quarter effect of that rate increase will bleed through into the second quarter and then that\u2019ll be offset by some benefits from day count as well as some of the consumer loan growth. And how are you or are you becoming more cautious, firm wide and why? So you trend your loan growth guidance down by 1% and in terms of maybe expenses, are you ratcheting that back? Are you preparing for tougher times? Or are you preserving the infrastructure for the potential for growth? That maybe others don\u2019t expect?\nTimothy Spence: Yes. So I mean us, Mike, we like to try to toe the line. We\u2019re an and company more than we are and more companies. There\u2019s no question that I think we all feel more cautious about the prospect for loan growth. Part of that is the Feds been abundantly clear, they\u2019re going to tamp down demand, right, no matter what it takes that but I note that the 1% decline for us comes on top of what I think was already the lowest full year loan growth guidance. So we have been pretty cautious as it related to loan growth. And in terms of expenses, I think you noted the actions we took during the quarter; we continue to be surgical about pruning the branch network, which creates the capacity to invest in the southeast. We had little more than 12 million bucks and severance that rolled through attached to expense actions that were designed to take capacity out of businesses that we just don\u2019t believe are going to need it, given the outlook. And I think the discipline that we have had, which is we believe in self-funding investments, because it drives good discipline around capital allocation, and effort is going to be the same here. So we do not intend to pause, the strategic investments we\u2019re making in the southeast or the investments we\u2019re making in the technology platform, those are going to be too valuable for the franchise in the long-term. But we are not going to be spending money on a discretionary basis that we don\u2019t think, is going to generate a near term return, outside of our strategic investments.\nMichael Mayo: And then last one was interesting, as you talked about, you said, you could go ahead and recognize your security losses and AFS. It\u2019d be manageable. And I guess you could sell those or do all sorts of things with that. So you have the capacity. I guess, how much more in TLAC would you need? You said you\u2019ve been in the market for the last four quarters. And if you had to go ahead and do that and be the only bank that did that, would that set you apart? Would that just be uneconomic?\nJames Leonard: Yes, just to clarify on the AFS, my comment was about the AOCI, should it be a capital requirement that we would have significant improvement based on the implied forward curve through the end of 2024 about 45% of that would roll down the curve, given the bullet structure of the portfolio, not necessarily selling at all. So we do like the portfolio. But in terms of the TLAC challenge. At the end of the year, our gap to the 6%, RWA bank level would be about $4 billion. So for a bank our size that is certainly manageable, and then the question then becomes, what would the regulations change with what you would do with the proceeds. So right now, we\u2019re sitting on $10 billion of excess cash, which is, frankly, the biggest driver of the NIM erosion as we look forward on a full year basis, because that 10 billion of excess cash costs about 16 basis points of NIM. And so if we were to issue 4 billion more in debt, obviously, we would prefer to lend it to customers. But if the liquidity rules tighten, and we have to hold a higher Reg YY liquidity buffer, then we will be forced than any of their just holding an in cash or buying more level ones. And so it starts to become a challenge with the distribution of the proceeds. When you say what, what it sets you apart, and what your earnings profile improve, I think it would just be a gross up on the balance sheet and, and really not productive. And so that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t done it.\nMichael Mayo: That\u2019s clear. Lastly, $4 billion gap for TLAC, how much have you issued or obviously have?\nJames Leonard: We haven't issued any this year, but total long term debt is $13 billion right now.\nBryan Preston: Yes, Mike this is Bryan. That\u2019s about 6.6% of assets, pre-COVID, we were at 9% of total assets. And that gap is about $5 billion. So we\u2019re just getting back to levels where we were before COVID. So that TLAC requirement is just not a big deal for us relative to our historic balance sheet structure.\nMichael Mayo: Right. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Please proceed.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nJames Leonard: Good morning, John.\nJohn Pancari: Just a question on the securities book, I appreciate the detail you gave on 525 on the commercial mortgage backed securities, I know there are 52% of your securities book. Can you maybe give us an update there? Are you seeing any stress there in terms of the performance of those securities amid the commercial real estate stress? And then, what type of stress and would be needed to pose risks to valuations or other than temporary impairment in that portfolio? Thanks.\nBryan Preston: Absolutely. It\u2019s Bryan again, so you need to break the CMBS portfolio into two components, the agency portfolio, which is effective it is Fannie, Freddie, and Ginnie guaranteed, so that portfolio looks just like RMBS that many people are invested in. So from a credit perspective, no issues on $29 billion of that portfolio, as its GSE guaranteed. The non-agency portfolio, which is only $5 billion, it is all super senior AAA rated. And we perform very significant analysis from a stress perspective, and from an underwriting perspective, every time that we buy and, and as well as when we monitor the portfolio. To give you some color on our recent stress tests that we\u2019ve performed. We assume a 50% decrease in property values across all the underlying properties within the structures. And even in that scenario, we would record we would realize no losses on that portfolio and still have 23% heart enhancement. The Office loans within that portfolio are about 30% of the underlying loans. If we assume that from a weighted average perspective that does office loans, that the underlying properties would experience a 90% decrease, that\u2019s when we would get to our first dollar of credit loss on that portfolio. So we feel very confident and there would be significant loan losses across the entire industry before we\u2019d even recognize our first dollar loss on this on the structure associated in this portfolio.\nJohn Pancari: Got it? Thank you, it\u2019s very helpful. And then separately. I was just wondering if you can update us on the status of your core systems conversion, the March Madness at all impact the progression of the conversion of the timing of the expected conversion? And then lastly, can you maybe help us with the sizing up of the cost of the conversion and how much is expected to be capitalized?\nJames Leonard: Yes, John it\u2019s Jamie. Thanks for the question. As you saw in the expense numbers, this quarter, we did have continued ramp up in technology cost that ultimately is a good thing, because it means we\u2019re getting things accomplished. And we continue to track on all of our deadlines for this year. We have new ledger going in in the third quarter, followed by CD platform as well as continued rollout of the nCino platform across the commercial business. And then we\u2019re really at this point about halfway through the game, because 2024, 2025 has additional deadlines associated with it on ATM and TM billing as well as the core checking conversion, but so far, so good. We do capitalize and follow the appropriate accounting standards on the total spend here. I think the spend over a multiyear period could reach as much as $100 million, of which a little less than half would be capitalized. And from there, I think you just continue to see us invest in cloud core technology. And that\u2019s part of what\u2019s driving that expense growth. You\u2019re seeing both in the first quarter and for the year.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Thank you, Jamie very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nManan Gosalia: Hey, good morning. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on why you expect deposits to grow as we get into the remainder of the year, what are you seeing in your underlying account openings and conversations with clients that gives you the confidence in that outcome? I guess my question is, why shouldn\u2019t some of these new deposits just go back to the banks, where they have longer relationships? So once the volatility in the in the system settles down.\nTimothy Spence: Yes good question. So I don\u2019t think we took a lot of deposit share from banks that were non-operational in nature. The new accounts that we opened Manan were linked to treasury management sales and inclusive of our embedded banking business. And we\u2019re had been on the sales pipeline, in some cases for as long as 18 months, and there had been technology work that ended up getting accelerated. In a handful of other places like we do a very good business with payroll processors. We were a net beneficiary of folks who needed the payments infrastructure that Fifth Third provides, and those relationships which were not on the sales pipeline previously moved. And because they\u2019re embedded in the day to day operations of the business, they tend to be very sticky. And I mean, look that you kind of have to go back to first principles for us on the deposits to say why do we believe that we can continue to be stable or to generate a little bit of growth. So big part of the growth that we\u2019re generating on the retail side is coming out of that sort of sustained primary household growth that we\u2019ve been able to generate. We\u2019ve run in the 2% to 3% range for several years now. We\u2019ve breached 3% in the first quarter. We were running faster than that. And that is led by the southeast markets where I think the year-over-year growth rate was like 7.3%. So very significant there. In addition to that, the branches we\u2019ve added in the southeast are driving really, really strong growth. So if you look at the southeast, overall, same store sales and deposits were a plus 5% year-over-year for the quarter, if you include the de novo the markets like North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida in totality grew 10% year-over-year, and if you just annualized the first quarter, over the fourth quarter, they grew 20% in terms of deposits, so really strong production come in from those investments. And then I think we\u2019ve talked a lot about the treasury management business, but that on the commercial side of the equation continues to be the thing. That is the driver, we have a disclosure in one of the slides here on the percentage of commercial relationships that are linked to Treasury Management, it\u2019s about 88%. If memory serves, maybe slide nine. And then the length of a that balance weighted average relationship tenure and commercial is 24 years. So we\u2019re not talking about people who were parking money here, because we were a ratepayer, I think we have only about a half a billion dollars in total in all deposits in the bank that are priced ahead of Fed funds. And it\u2019s reasonable to assume that whether it\u2019s because the Fed raises or because we take other actions that that number is going to be zero by the end of June. So we just have a very stable deposit base, the growth is coming from investments that are multiyear in nature, and that are proven in terms of their ability to support the company and very little deposit gathering activity that would have been on economic relative to alternative funding sources, less than a half a billion dollars, I believe in total.\nManan Gosalia: Got it, very helpful. And then maybe as a follow up, and maybe the response to this is the same. But as I look at the deposit beta assumptions on slide 11, they look pretty conservative relative to the rest of the street. But if I look at the slope of their line, it is flattening as we look into the forecast period. So why shouldn\u2019t we expect the same rate of change that we\u2019ve seen there more recently?\nTimothy Spence: Yes, our base view, as I said in our prepared remarks are the midpoint of our guide is a 47% beta. And that is really driven by our assumption that the battle for retail deposits continues to be very competitive, and that that retail beta actually doubles over the course of the year. If that were to not happen, then we would be at the at the low end. So on the commercial and wealth and asset management side, the betas have been running, 65% to 70%. And those betas will flatten out as the Fed stops hiking. So part of what\u2019s assumed in the slide is that the Fed gets to 525 and stops and so that would have a flattening effect. And the reality here is that there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to how competition is going to behave over the next several quarters. And you can see on the slide thus far, we\u2019ve done well versus the industry from a deposit beta standpoint, but we definitely want to defend our book as well as continue to have strong new customer acquisition.\nManan Gosalia: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please proceed.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning.\nTimothy Spence: Morning, Ebrahim.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Just two quick follow ups, one on credit. I think, Jamie, you mentioned about 80% base case, unemployment 4%. Give us a sense of just sensitivity if that 4% were to be 5%, what does that mean for your allowance or the consumer allowance?\nJames Leonard: Yes, the ACL would go up 250 million for every 1% assuming all other assumptions stay, as is.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Okay, helpful. And other quick follow up on going back to Tim, your comments around capital. And Matt, given just the uncertainty around regulations, Mac, macro economy, the nine and a quarter CT1 like, do you? Should we anticipate that drifts higher at least for the next few quarters until there\u2019s more visibility? Or do you expect to be more proactive and return back to sort of buybacks in the back half of the year?\nTimothy Spence: Yes, I think just given the guidance that we provided, if you assume no buybacks in the second quarter, which is right, it would imply we get to nine five by June 30. Ebrahim, I, Jamie and I both feel confident we could run the business at nine and a quarter, it just feels prudent at this point in time to make sure that the environment does fully settle out before we resume repurchases.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And just on the environment. I think last quarter, we talked about things worsening maybe back half of this year into 24. Do you have any better visibility in terms of just the shape of the credit cycle, how deep it could be? And just when we begin to actually see the first sort of deterioration, show up in the numbers on credit metrics.\nTimothy Spence: We continue to think the back half of this year it is the beginning of next is probably the right period. I think we have been operating under the belief that some of the rosier data that came out in the winter was a little bit of a head fake because you had unseasonably good weather and the by-product of that was you had spending in a variety of under other indicators, Flash more positive than I think people had anticipated. And in part, that\u2019s why you saw the Fed, ramp up rhetoric. Again, the IFM indices are, from my point of view, the best thing to watch here, they certainly are in our footprint, and they all are signaling a slowdown. And the Fed is not going to be able to relent and get inflation under control just based on what we hear from clients without sticking at, a five plus level for some extended period of time. And when that happens, that\u2019s very restrictive, right things are going to break. My own view is that this is light, we\u2019re likely to return to a period where there\u2019s more regional divergence than you\u2019ve seen. And the most recent two cycles. I\u2019m I am very happy to be Midwest and southeast Bank is a moment like the data that\u2019s come out of the Census Bureau on spending on factories, right, we had 108 billion in spending on factories last year, which was an all-time record that Financial Times did nice work on commitments that have been made, there\u2019s more than 200 billion in capital commitments. This is all stuff that\u2019s tied to the $2 trillion that the government intends to invest and rebuilding supply chains here in the U.S. And if you just look at the manufacturing jobs that were added last year, like there were 348,000 manufacturing jobs added in the U.S., compared to I think 6000 in 2010, as an example and 60% of those were in our footprint. So the markets that are going to benefit from the government\u2019s investment in infrastructure and domestic supply chain. And that sort of broader trend and reshoring are going to do better than markets that were more reliant on technology and professional services or that have more profound challenges as it relates to state budget deficits, or challenged city centers, there just is going to be a divergence that materializes there. So I at least think you should be more focused on regional economic data than on the economy overall, as you think about where losses may materialize.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That\u2019s great color. Thanks.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Christopher Marinec from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed.\nChristopher Marinec: Thanks for taking my question. Tim, just want to ask about dividend finance kind of skewing the loan growth this year maybe in a positive way to where the loan growth ex dividend is very conservative. Is that a fair way of thinking it through?\nTimothy Spence: Yes. Yes, the two areas of the portfolio where there is any material loan growth this year Chris are the dividend finance portfolio as we see the benefit of the balances rolling on because we are portfolio in their production. They were originated to sell before we bought them. And then in C&I which is really good core steady production in the middle market where I have been a part because of the dynamics around manufacturing, you\u2019re seeing really solid production out of our legacy markets in the Midwest and the continued growth and provide right which is of course linked to healthcare and primarily, non-elective dental invent.\nChristopher Marinec: Got it. And the rest is rolling off and not\u2026\nTimothy Spence: It\u2019s kind of receivable or in modest decline.\nChristopher Marinec: Got it? Very well. Thank you, Tim. I appreciate it.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Doll for closing remarks.\nChris Doll: Thanks, Molly. And thanks everyone for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the IR department if you have any follow up questions. Molly, you can now disconnect the call.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Timothy Spence",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The past six weeks have seen a great deal of volatility in the banking sector. Markets have been trading on narratives over fundamentals and the term regional bank has been used to describe such a broad cross section of business models that it has lost any real descriptive value. While we at Fifth Third take any instability in our sector very seriously, there was no crisis inside our four walls. We've been running the company with the expectation for a higher, for a longer rate environment for many quarters now. We've consistently communicated in these calls and at investor conferences. As our first quarter results demonstrate our balance sheet remains well fortified, and our capacity to generate strong profitability through the cycle is strong. Excluding items noted in the release, we reported earnings per share of $0.83, a 20% increase compared to the year ago quarter. We generated nine points of year-over-year positive operating leverage driven by an 18% increase in revenue. During the quarter we held average and period end deposits flat sequentially despite the industry wide impact of quantitative tightening and normal seasonal pressures. Our key credit metrics remain near historical lows with net charge-offs of 26 basis points coming in at the low end of our guidance range. NPAs NPLs and early stage delinquency ratios remained below normalized levels, and criticized assets decrease modestly during the quarter. Moreover, we accomplished all this while also being recognized by Ethisphere as one of only two U.S. banks on their world's most ethical companies list. We were named by Fortune as one of America's most innovative companies. And we saw our FinTech platform provide named by Fast Company as one of the world's most innovative businesses. The strong outcomes achieved this quarter and in particular in the month of March highlight the strength, granularity and well balanced nature of our deposit franchise. In the weekend, following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank alone, we open more new commercial deposit accounts than we would in a typical month. Similarly, our consumer household growth accelerated after the March turmoil. Our commercial deposit franchises led by our peer leading treasury management business where we rank in the top 10 nationally and most major commercial payment types, 88% of our commercial deposit balances are attached to relationships that utilize TM services today, and the average age of our commercial deposit relationships is 24 years. These characteristics contribute strongly to stability regardless of balance size. Our consumer deposit base is granular with nearly 90% of total consumer deposits, FDIC insured and is anchored by our flagship mass market momentum banking offering and strong branch presence in the markets we serve. Annual consumer household growth finished the quarter above 3% led by our southeast markets above 7%. During the quarter, we opened five branches in our southeast markets on top of the 70 add ins in the past three years, and we expect to open an additional 30 branches by the end of 2023. All said, end of period total deposit balances ended the quarter above the level on March 8. Looking forward while we face the same headwinds that all banks do from increased deposit competition, economic uncertainty and the potential for regulatory change, I am confident in Fifth Third's ability to achieve top quartile returns through the cycle with a focus on stability, profitability and growth. Our long-term discipline managing interest rate and liquidity risks positions us well to generate differentiated outcomes in a range of economic environment. From a credit risk perspective, our low CRE concentration and commercial and in particular in office CRE, along with our focus on homeowners in consumer should prove to be significant advantages. Jamie will provide more information on our forward guidance, but the implied profitability and return metrics for our full year 2023 expectations are well ahead of our core 2019 results. Considering the uncertain and environment, we have elected to deposit [Ph] share repurchases for the second quarter and we'll evaluate resuming them in the second half of the year. Last, but certainly not least, I want to thank our 20,000 employees for their hard work and dedication and supporting our customers, communities and shareholders. Your commitment to living our purpose and making sure we do the right thing every day is evidence. With that, I'll now hand it over to Jamie to provide more details on our financial results and outlook. Yes, so good. Good morning, Scott. Thanks for the question. Just a note for everybody. We know you have a busy day here. So with the exception of the soliloquy that Jamie has prepared on regulation going forward, we're going to try to keep our answers. pretty crisp. We were delighted to see the activity obviously and to see that continue to carry forward through the end of the quarter. All but I literally had single digits you could count on, I think one hand and two fingers, the number of the accounts that we opened, that didn't fund up between the that weekend immediately following Silicon Valley and the end of the quarter. So I'm very pleased with the activity level there. I think in terms of account behavior going forward, I think we're going to see a much more prominent bifurcation and behavior between operational accounts and non-operational accounts, right. In effect on the corporate treasurer side, cash as an investment versus cash as a tool in terms of the way that you manage the business. And that is reflected in the operational account behavior that we saw during the period I think probably contributed very significantly to the stability. The Fifth Third experienced in terms of commercial account balances. But Jamie, you have anything you want to add? And if I if I just add one thing on that drawing, scale is going to matter in terms of the clients that you bank, in C&I, because if you think about the dynamics that are creating headwinds for the economy, they're related to your ability to manage input costs, or production. And ultimately, right the higher costs of carrying inventory to offset concerns around supply chain resiliency on an on-going basis. So when you the sense you get I do when I'm out talking with clients is the manufacturing businesses and the businesses attached to the resurgence of manufacturing in the U.S. are doing really, really well. The businesses that are attached to more discretionary spending. The larger clients have been able to pass input cost increases higher cost of labor through the smaller ones are having a more difficult time. And I think that arm wrestling we're seeing going on right now as an example between the not for profit hospitals and the health. The health care insurance companies is a really good example of where the larger not for profits are having a easier go of extracting concessions to cover increases in nursing costs and otherwise, and the smaller ones, it's \u2013 it's been more of a standoff. Sure. I'm going to let Jamie start on that one, Erica, and then I'll follow. And I think just to add two thoughts. Our capital stress testing indicates you could run the bank at below 9%, which is the reason that hasn't been the binding constraint for us. We just elect to do it at the level we do because we like stability, right? And I think we were clear with everybody when we reset the capital target last year, we did it because we were concerned about uncertainty in the Outlook, and we felt that it was prudent to start building capital early as opposed to having to do it later. So I am pleased in our positioning, I think more broadly one caution I would give everybody is I think some will take the discussion about change in regulation on capital liquidity and just bake it into models. Without assuming that there's any sort of evolution in the business model. The FDIC has been publishing quarterly data on the sector, I think since 1934. At least the dataset goes back that far. And there's been more than one regulatory regime change during that period. And if you adjust for tax, the tax policy at a given point in time, the return levels in the sector have been remarkably consistent. So to the extent that more banks are required to hold more capital, or more liquidity, or to change the structure of funding, I think it's reasonable to expect that the business model is going to evolve, as well. I mean, I think the answer is you the way that you manage that proactively as you would have started doing something on each of those topics last year, right. So we were in the market, after every earnings call last year, four times. And as a result, have the lowest incremental need in the event that TLAC had no phase in period, right. As an example, you were deliberate about the way that you manage the ACL to reflect uncertainty in the forward outlook, and therefore you're carrying good coverage today, right, which we certainly feel we are. And you would have allowed yourself to a CRE capital during a period when the market was certainly more robust for regional banks, which I think, of course we did as well. I think lastly, what we're going to see here coming out of this, even if there is no change in regulation, as we all will flow, the empirical data from March Madness, through our models, and it's going to dictate a very different value for non-operational money and operational money, right. And the by-product of that is the banks that have good core retail deposit franchises, and who have good commercial operational commercial franchises. So linked to payment activity, treasury management services, and otherwise, that that is going to be the place that you want to be because while we think the Fed obviously at some point, rates are going to stay higher than zero on an absolute basis, and our ability to make money on both sides of the balance sheet is going to be a big driver who does well if there is more capital requirements or liquidity requirements are higher. Thank you. Yes. So I mean us, Mike, we like to try to toe the line. We're an and company more than we are and more companies. There's no question that I think we all feel more cautious about the prospect for loan growth. Part of that is the Feds been abundantly clear, they're going to tamp down demand, right, no matter what it takes that but I note that the 1% decline for us comes on top of what I think was already the lowest full year loan growth guidance. So we have been pretty cautious as it related to loan growth. And in terms of expenses, I think you noted the actions we took during the quarter; we continue to be surgical about pruning the branch network, which creates the capacity to invest in the southeast. We had little more than 12 million bucks and severance that rolled through attached to expense actions that were designed to take capacity out of businesses that we just don't believe are going to need it, given the outlook. And I think the discipline that we have had, which is we believe in self-funding investments, because it drives good discipline around capital allocation, and effort is going to be the same here. So we do not intend to pause, the strategic investments we're making in the southeast or the investments we're making in the technology platform, those are going to be too valuable for the franchise in the long-term. But we are not going to be spending money on a discretionary basis that we don't think, is going to generate a near term return, outside of our strategic investments. Yes good question. So I don't think we took a lot of deposit share from banks that were non-operational in nature. The new accounts that we opened Manan were linked to treasury management sales and inclusive of our embedded banking business. And we're had been on the sales pipeline, in some cases for as long as 18 months, and there had been technology work that ended up getting accelerated. In a handful of other places like we do a very good business with payroll processors. We were a net beneficiary of folks who needed the payments infrastructure that Fifth Third provides, and those relationships which were not on the sales pipeline previously moved. And because they're embedded in the day to day operations of the business, they tend to be very sticky. And I mean, look that you kind of have to go back to first principles for us on the deposits to say why do we believe that we can continue to be stable or to generate a little bit of growth. So big part of the growth that we're generating on the retail side is coming out of that sort of sustained primary household growth that we've been able to generate. We've run in the 2% to 3% range for several years now. We've breached 3% in the first quarter. We were running faster than that. And that is led by the southeast markets where I think the year-over-year growth rate was like 7.3%. So very significant there. In addition to that, the branches we've added in the southeast are driving really, really strong growth. So if you look at the southeast, overall, same store sales and deposits were a plus 5% year-over-year for the quarter, if you include the de novo the markets like North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida in totality grew 10% year-over-year, and if you just annualized the first quarter, over the fourth quarter, they grew 20% in terms of deposits, so really strong production come in from those investments. And then I think we've talked a lot about the treasury management business, but that on the commercial side of the equation continues to be the thing. That is the driver, we have a disclosure in one of the slides here on the percentage of commercial relationships that are linked to Treasury Management, it's about 88%. If memory serves, maybe slide nine. And then the length of a that balance weighted average relationship tenure and commercial is 24 years. So we're not talking about people who were parking money here, because we were a ratepayer, I think we have only about a half a billion dollars in total in all deposits in the bank that are priced ahead of Fed funds. And it's reasonable to assume that whether it's because the Fed raises or because we take other actions that that number is going to be zero by the end of June. So we just have a very stable deposit base, the growth is coming from investments that are multiyear in nature, and that are proven in terms of their ability to support the company and very little deposit gathering activity that would have been on economic relative to alternative funding sources, less than a half a billion dollars, I believe in total. Yes, our base view, as I said in our prepared remarks are the midpoint of our guide is a 47% beta. And that is really driven by our assumption that the battle for retail deposits continues to be very competitive, and that that retail beta actually doubles over the course of the year. If that were to not happen, then we would be at the at the low end. So on the commercial and wealth and asset management side, the betas have been running, 65% to 70%. And those betas will flatten out as the Fed stops hiking. So part of what's assumed in the slide is that the Fed gets to 525 and stops and so that would have a flattening effect. And the reality here is that there's a lot of uncertainty as to how competition is going to behave over the next several quarters. And you can see on the slide thus far, we've done well versus the industry from a deposit beta standpoint, but we definitely want to defend our book as well as continue to have strong new customer acquisition. Morning, Ebrahim. Yes, I think just given the guidance that we provided, if you assume no buybacks in the second quarter, which is right, it would imply we get to nine five by June 30. Ebrahim, I, Jamie and I both feel confident we could run the business at nine and a quarter, it just feels prudent at this point in time to make sure that the environment does fully settle out before we resume repurchases. We continue to think the back half of this year it is the beginning of next is probably the right period. I think we have been operating under the belief that some of the rosier data that came out in the winter was a little bit of a head fake because you had unseasonably good weather and the by-product of that was you had spending in a variety of under other indicators, Flash more positive than I think people had anticipated. And in part, that's why you saw the Fed, ramp up rhetoric. Again, the IFM indices are, from my point of view, the best thing to watch here, they certainly are in our footprint, and they all are signaling a slowdown. And the Fed is not going to be able to relent and get inflation under control just based on what we hear from clients without sticking at, a five plus level for some extended period of time. And when that happens, that's very restrictive, right things are going to break. My own view is that this is light, we're likely to return to a period where there's more regional divergence than you've seen. And the most recent two cycles. I'm I am very happy to be Midwest and southeast Bank is a moment like the data that's come out of the Census Bureau on spending on factories, right, we had 108 billion in spending on factories last year, which was an all-time record that Financial Times did nice work on commitments that have been made, there's more than 200 billion in capital commitments. This is all stuff that's tied to the $2 trillion that the government intends to invest and rebuilding supply chains here in the U.S. And if you just look at the manufacturing jobs that were added last year, like there were 348,000 manufacturing jobs added in the U.S., compared to I think 6000 in 2010, as an example and 60% of those were in our footprint. So the markets that are going to benefit from the government's investment in infrastructure and domestic supply chain. And that sort of broader trend and reshoring are going to do better than markets that were more reliant on technology and professional services or that have more profound challenges as it relates to state budget deficits, or challenged city centers, there just is going to be a divergence that materializes there. So I at least think you should be more focused on regional economic data than on the economy overall, as you think about where losses may materialize. Yes. Yes, the two areas of the portfolio where there is any material loan growth this year Chris are the dividend finance portfolio as we see the benefit of the balances rolling on because we are portfolio in their production. They were originated to sell before we bought them. And then in C&I which is really good core steady production in the middle market where I have been a part because of the dynamics around manufacturing, you're seeing really solid production out of our legacy markets in the Midwest and the continued growth and provide right which is of course linked to healthcare and primarily, non-elective dental invent. It's kind of receivable or in modest decline."

            "name": "James Leonard",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim. And thank all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were strong despite the market volatility during the quarter. Average and period and total deposit balances were flat compared to the prior quarter. Average core deposits declined in line with our guidance of down 1%. We grew loans modestly during the quarter while adding new quality relationships in both commercial and net new households and consumer. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of 59% and a seasonally challenged quarter, which is a six point improvement compared to the year ago quarter. Our first quarter core PPNR grew nearly 40% compared to last year, reflecting the diversification and growth of our revenue streams combined with disciplined expense management. Net interest income of approximately $1.52 billion increased 27% year over year, but declined 4% sequentially. Our sequential NII performance was impacted by our shift to a more defensive balance sheet position given the volatile environment, the impact of lower day count and seasonally strong investment portfolio income in the prior quarter. Fee income exceeded our expectations despite the market related headwinds, and we remain disciplined on expenses while continuing to invest in our businesses. PPNR was impacted by the expenses associated with higher than expected fee income. Our NIM declined six basis points for the quarter, while interest bearing deposit costs increased 64 basis points to 176 basis points, reflecting a cycle to date interest bearing deposit beta of 36% through the first quarter, which includes the impact of CDs. Total adjusted non-interest income increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter driven by -- commercial banking and mortgage fee income, which more than offset a decline in deposit service charges due to the elimination of consumer NSF fees last year and the impact of higher earnings credits from higher market rates this year. Growth in commercial banking fee income was primarily driven by increased loan syndication, fixed income sales and trading and M&A advisory revenue, partially offset by a decline in corporate bond fees. The improvement in mortgage revenue was driven by increased servicing fees and lower asset decay. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 6% compared to the year ago quarter, excluding the impact of non-qualified deferred compensation expenses from both periods. Expense growth was elevated due to the dividend finance acquisition in the second quarter of 2022 and growth in the provide franchise. Excluding the FinTech growth impacts and the FDIC assessment, total expenses increased approximately 3% compared to the year ago quarter as discipline throughout the bank, combined with automation initiatives were offset by compensation associated with our minimum wage hike, higher fee income and higher technology and communications expense, reflecting our focus on platform modernization initiatives. Moving to the balance sheet, total average portfolio loans and leases increased 1% sequentially reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Commercial was led by C&I where payoffs were muted and production was stable in our regional middle market banking business but down in our corporate bank. The subdued production and the corporate bank reflects our focus on optimizing returns on capital in this environment, combined with less robust demand. Compared to a year ago quarter, C&I loans, excluding PPP have increased 13%. The period and commercial revolver utilization rate remains stable compared to last quarter at 37%. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increase 2% compared to the prior quarter led by dividend finance while balances from the rest of our consumer captions remained relatively stable. Average total deposits were flat compared to the prior quarter, as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were offset by a decline in demand deposits. By segment, wealth and asset management average balances increased sequentially, consumer was stable and commercial modestly declined consistent with normal first quarter seasonality. Period and total deposits were also flat compared to the prior quarter. Notably, we have grown deposits 1% since the end of last June compared to a 4% decline for the top 25 banks as shown in the Feds AJ data. We have included additional materials in our earnings presentation to highlight some of the key attributes of our high quality deposit franchise that may be relevant in this environment. Moving to Credit, as Tim mentioned, credit trends remain healthy and our key credit metrics remained well below normalized levels. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased four basis points sequentially to 26 basis points and remained below 2019 levels. The net charge-off ratio of 26 basis points increased four basis points sequentially, and was at the low end of our guidance range. The NPA ratio of 51 basis points was up two basis points compared to a year ago. From a credit management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on high quality relationships. In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We have also maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in nonprime consumer borrowers among our peers. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in CRE at 14% of total loans. Across all commercial portfolios, we continue to closely monitor exposures where your inflation and higher rates may cause stress and continue to closely watch the leveraged loan portfolio and office CRE. Office loans of $1.6 billion represented just 1.3% of total loans, with a criticized ratio of 8.2% and only one basis point of delinquencies. While the leveraged loan portfolio has declined 65% since 2016, and is now less than $3 billion outstanding today. We have focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong, stable results through the cycle. Moving to the ACL. Our reserve change this quarter was a net increase of $37 million, or a build of $86 million excluding the onetime impact of adopting the accounting standard eliminating TDR accounting, which reduced the reserve by $49 million. Our bill primarily reflected loan growth, notably from dividend finance loans which contributed $88 million of the increase. The ACL ratio increased one basis point sequentially, or five basis points excluding the accounting change. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the unemployment rate reaches 4% while the downside scenario underlying our allowance coverage incorporates a peak unemployment rate of 7.8%. We maintained our scenario weightings of 80% to the base and 10% to each of the upside and downside scenarios. Moving to Capital, our CET1 ratio remained relatively stable compared to last quarter, and in the first quarter at 9.25%. Our capital position reflects our strong earnings generation offset by the impacts of returning capital in the form of dividends and repurchases, risk weighted asset growth primarily in consumer loans and a seven basis point decline from the CECL phase in. Our tangible book value per share increased 11% sequentially, partially impacted by our AOCI position, which improves 17%. Tangible book value grew 7% excluding AOCI compared to the year ago quarter. Moving to our current outlook, we expect full year average total loan growth between 2% and 3% which reflects our cautious outlook on the economic environment. We expect total commercial loans to increase in the low to mid-single digits area compared to 2022 which implies modest incremental growth from the first quarter through year end given our outlook for a tempered lending environment in the second half of the year. We expect line utilization rates to remain stable. We expect total consumer loan growth to also be modest as a strong increase from dividend finance will be mostly offset by a decline in auto and mortgage. We continue to expect approximately $4.5 billion in dividend loan production for the year given the secular tailwinds and our investments in the business combined with market share gains. We expect deposits to be stable or grow from the first quarter average level as we progress throughout 2023 consistent with our strong customer acquisition trends. Within that, we expect continued migration from DDA into interest bearing products throughout the remainder of 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits, declining from 32% today to 30% by year end. For the second quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% sequentially with growth fairly balanced between commercial and consumer portfolios. We expect average deposits to also be stable to up 1% on a sequential basis. Shifting to the income statement, we expect full year NII will increase 7% to 10%. As other banks have noted, industry wide deposit pricing pressures intensified in the wake of the Silicon Valley and Signature Bank failures. Therefore, as shown in our presentation materials, we are providing NII guidance under a range of deposit betas given potential diverging levels of intensity with respect to deposit competition going forward. The upper end of our NII guidance assumes an approximate terminal beta of 43%, and the lower end assumes approximately a 49% terminal beta compared to our January expectation of 42%. The midpoint of our NII outlook translates to a 47% beta with total interest bearing deposit costs increasing 45 basis points or so in the second quarter, and another 25 basis points in the second half of the year. Our outlook also considers the lag effects from previous rate hikes and continued DDA migration and assumes the Fed hikes 25 basis points in May, and then holds short term rates of 525 basis points for the remainder of the year. Our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances decline a couple billion dollars between now and year end, and that we hold closer to $10 billion in excess cash for most of the year. Assuming we continue to defensively position the balance sheet for the remainder of the year by maintaining an elevated excess cash position combined with continued intense deposit competition, we are assuming NIM will be in the 320 to 325 range for the year. We expect second quarter NII to be down approximately 1% sequentially reflecting the deposit loan and cash dynamics I mentioned. We expect adjusted non-interest income to be stable to up 1% in 2023, reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments and talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger gross treasury management revenue, capital markets fees wealth and asset management revenue and mortgage servicing to be partially offset by higher earnings credit rates on TM, subdued lease remarketing revenue and a reduction and other fees reflecting lower TRA and private equity income this year. We expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from 46 million in 2022 to 22 million in 2023. We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 2% to 3% compared to the first quarter. We expect to continue generating strong revenue across most fee captions and that will be partially offset by a slowdown in debt capital markets revenue. We continue to expect full year adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022. Our expense outlook incorporates the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on January 1. The mark-to-mark can impact on non-qualified deferred compensation plans which was a reduction in 2022 expenses, and the full year impact of investments to grow the dividend finance and provide businesses. Excluding the dividend acquisition, FDIC assessment and NQDC impacts, we would expect our full year 2023 core expenses to be up less than 3%. Our guidance reflects continued investment in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth in the low double digits for the year. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid to high single digits area. Our guidance also factors the run rate benefits from the severance expense recognized in the first quarter, which reflected proactive actions taken to reduce on-going expenses given the operating environment. We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest expenses to decrease 8% to 9% compared to the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 6% to 8%, resulting in PPNR growth in the 9% to 10% range. This would result in an efficiency ratio below 55% for the full year. We expect second quarter PPNR to increase 10% to 11% compared to the first quarter, and for second quarter efficiency ratio to be around 54%. We continue to expect second quarter and full year 2023 net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis points range. Given our expected period and loan growth, including continued strong production from dividend finance we continue to expect a quarterly build to the ACL of approximately $100 million, assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios. In summary, with our strong PPNR growth engine, discipline, credit risk management, and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Yes, and Scott, what we also saw in the first quarter was that clients were focused on getting money to the best vehicle possible. So for us during the quarter, we moved almost a billion dollars more into the money market portal that we manage for them. And even with that incremental movement, we were only down about a billion dollars in commercial and a seasonally challenged quarter when last year, we were down 2 billion in the quarter, seasonally and the year before that we were down 3 billion. So to Tim's point, the money has been moving to the optimal investment vehicles. But the good news for us is we were able to overcome that headwind and actually posted a very solid commercial deposit quarter. Yes, the last tightening cycle, we moved down five points. This time we're forecasting to go down eight to finish the year at a 30% DDA to core deposit level. Given that our rate outlook now has the 525 and a lot longer hold with no cut. We think we'll see continued migration and higher earnings credit rates that will result in more DDA migration. And then the challenge over time is, can you sell enough treasury management services to rebuild that DDA balance and given our strong treasury management business, we feel confident in our ability to do it. So hopefully, we do bottom out at 30. But for every 1% more than that, it translates to 40 to 50 million of NII erosion. So, it's, while not tremendous impact, we would still want to ensure that we get that 30% higher as we head into 2024 and things like that. Thanks. Morning. Yes, on C&I, that was the driver of the NPA increase this quarter. So on the surface NPAs, were up seven basis points, this sector that drove it the most within C&I would be restaurants, entertainment as well as professional services. But with that said, the delinquency levels in commercial and certainly in C&I continue to be benign. And Tim and I were looking back at where we were on NPAs. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we were at 62 basis points versus the 51 that we're at today. And if you look at the 10 year average, for us, we're at a 69 basis point average. So while we're up that seven basis points sequentially, it's really more of a normalization. And we're still 25% or so below a normal run rate when it comes to commercial NPA. So it's really normalization within some of these sectors. And for us, at least right now, it's entertainment and professional services. Yes, I would say that. On the positive side of net interest income, if the industry and the competitive dynamics settled down over the next couple of months, couple of quarters, then we would expect that we would operate in that low to mid 40s beta and that would deliver the higher end of our NII guide. We're a little cautious though, in what we're seeing from a competitive standpoint, as banks are clearly focused on driving, more insured retail deposit growth, and therefore the retail beta is the wildcard in our guide, and why we show the range of deposit betas that could play out and therefore the range of the NII guide is a little wider than what we normally would do just given the uncertainty with how competition will react. So in the near term, that is the wildcard that perhaps retail deposit betas which had been very well behaved actually double by the end of the year. And that would take us to the low end of the guide. I think longer-term when it comes to rates progressing beyond five and a quarter. It really comes down to what are the credit implications as the Fed reaches an even higher level. We think the magnitude of the rate increases have certainly created some shock across the country. And you saw that obviously, in what we're calling the March Madness. But I think from an NII perspective, those higher rates could continue to be productive as long as the deposit beta dynamics stay in the 40% range. But if competition heats up, and we get into a 60% plus beta environment, that would be unproductive to NII. Yes, we feel very good about how the balance sheet is positioned, especially for a downgrade environment. Obviously, the swaps we're very pleased with the entry points there. We've talked at length about in 2025, there'll be a nice increased NII as the new swaps kick in. In terms of the investment portfolio positioning, we'll have a bit of a decline in the second quarter as we don't reinvest cash flows, but from there should be relatively stable. We may continue to reposition non-HQLA and the level ones but ultimately that'll be regulatory dependent, but overall feel good about the bullet locked out nature, the structure that we have. So I think for us, it's going to be more of operating in a high 70s loan to deposit ratio and continuing to maintain that while being very disciplined on credit which is why the loan growth guide was trimmed a bit to that up, up 2% to 3% level. Yes, I mean, in general, it's going to be, it's a balance of that nature of when the cuts actually occur. If you're in a foreign liquidity environment where things still are relatively tight, the Fed has gotten inflation under control, but there's not a big credit event obviously, the measured cuts would be one where you're going to have a little bit more challenging time, reversing all the beta, you're still going to get some of the beta out. But in this scenario, where the Fed is having to loosen liquidity conditions pretty rapidly, you're going to have an opportunity to get a little bit more aggressive on your rate cuts from there and get some more of that beta out. So it really is going to be a little bit of a balance of how things play out. We've spent a lot of time positioning the commercial book in particular, to make sure that we stay with the appropriate amount of price sensitivity there so that we can reprice down as necessary. We're up to about $20 billion of index deposits. So we're taking a lot of actions to make sure that we're well positioned, whether they stay high, or if they cut that we've got the flexibility to navigate through those different environments. Morning, Erica. So from a short term perspective, obviously pausing the buybacks, and given the second quarter guide, we would expect to your point that we would continue to generate, call it 25 basis points of capital, even with some RWA growth in the second quarter. I do believe that it will be dependent on what the regulations ultimately come out with in order to then answer the medium term part of your question, because if I were king for a day, I would not change the AOCI opt out rules because this was not a capital crisis. I think the capital regime works as stated. But should they decide either to eliminate, held to maturity and force everybody in the AFS and then force AFS into an AOCI mark, perhaps the core earnings capacity of the company along with you, we included in the deck additional capital accretion measures, that we would improve the AOCI levels by 45%, by the end of next year. But it would be a manageable item for us; we just don't believe it's necessary. We have a balance sheet that our target capital level is 9%. All stress testing says 9% is great. But, in this environment, we're going to accrete capital here in the short term and will get to 950. And hopefully have a little more clarity for everybody next quarter. Yes, just to clarify on the AFS, my comment was about the AOCI, should it be a capital requirement that we would have significant improvement based on the implied forward curve through the end of 2024 about 45% of that would roll down the curve, given the bullet structure of the portfolio, not necessarily selling at all. So we do like the portfolio. But in terms of the TLAC challenge. At the end of the year, our gap to the 6%, RWA bank level would be about $4 billion. So for a bank our size that is certainly manageable, and then the question then becomes, what would the regulations change with what you would do with the proceeds. So right now, we're sitting on $10 billion of excess cash, which is, frankly, the biggest driver of the NIM erosion as we look forward on a full year basis, because that 10 billion of excess cash costs about 16 basis points of NIM. And so if we were to issue 4 billion more in debt, obviously, we would prefer to lend it to customers. But if the liquidity rules tighten, and we have to hold a higher Reg YY liquidity buffer, then we will be forced than any of their just holding an in cash or buying more level ones. And so it starts to become a challenge with the distribution of the proceeds. When you say what, what it sets you apart, and what your earnings profile improve, I think it would just be a gross up on the balance sheet and, and really not productive. And so that's why we haven't done it. We haven't issued any this year, but total long term debt is $13 billion right now. Good morning, John. Yes, John it's Jamie. Thanks for the question. As you saw in the expense numbers, this quarter, we did have continued ramp up in technology cost that ultimately is a good thing, because it means we're getting things accomplished. And we continue to track on all of our deadlines for this year. We have new ledger going in in the third quarter, followed by CD platform as well as continued rollout of the nCino platform across the commercial business. And then we're really at this point about halfway through the game, because 2024, 2025 has additional deadlines associated with it on ATM and TM billing as well as the core checking conversion, but so far, so good. We do capitalize and follow the appropriate accounting standards on the total spend here. I think the spend over a multiyear period could reach as much as $100 million, of which a little less than half would be capitalized. And from there, I think you just continue to see us invest in cloud core technology. And that's part of what's driving that expense growth. You're seeing both in the first quarter and for the year. Yes, the ACL would go up 250 million for every 1% assuming all other assumptions stay, as is."

            "name": "Bryan Preston",
            "content": "Yes, Mike this is Bryan. That's about 6.6% of assets, pre-COVID, we were at 9% of total assets. And that gap is about $5 billion. So we're just getting back to levels where we were before COVID. So that TLAC requirement is just not a big deal for us relative to our historic balance sheet structure. Absolutely. It's Bryan again, so you need to break the CMBS portfolio into two components, the agency portfolio, which is effective it is Fannie, Freddie, and Ginnie guaranteed, so that portfolio looks just like RMBS that many people are invested in. So from a credit perspective, no issues on $29 billion of that portfolio, as its GSE guaranteed. The non-agency portfolio, which is only $5 billion, it is all super senior AAA rated. And we perform very significant analysis from a stress perspective, and from an underwriting perspective, every time that we buy and, and as well as when we monitor the portfolio. To give you some color on our recent stress tests that we've performed. We assume a 50% decrease in property values across all the underlying properties within the structures. And even in that scenario, we would record we would realize no losses on that portfolio and still have 23% heart enhancement. The Office loans within that portfolio are about 30% of the underlying loans. If we assume that from a weighted average perspective that does office loans, that the underlying properties would experience a 90% decrease, that's when we would get to our first dollar of credit loss on that portfolio. So we feel very confident and there would be significant loan losses across the entire industry before we'd even recognize our first dollar loss on this on the structure associated in this portfolio."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Curoe, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMatt Curoe: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's third quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, our Chairman, CEO and President, Tim Spence, and CFO, Bryan Preston, will provide an overview of our third quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of October 18, 2024. And Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\nTim Spence: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate uncertain ones. Our focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order has served us well in this dynamic operating environment and continues to produce strong and predictable results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.78 or $0.85 excluding certain items outlined on Page 2 of the release, exceeding the guidance we provided in our Q2 earnings call. We produced a return on equity of 12.8%, the best among peers who have reported thus far and the most stable on a trailing 12-months basis. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 56.1% in the third quarter. Headcount declined 1% year-over-year despite continued investments in our growth strategies. We achieved sequential positive operating leverage for the second consecutive quarter without the need to expend shareholder capital on an investment portfolio restructuring charge and are in a position to achieve positive operating leverage on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. Despite changes throughout the year on interest rates, economic activity and market demand, as we come into the home stretch for 2024, I am pleased to say that Fifth Third should deliver NII, fees, expenses and credit costs within the full year guidance ranges we provided back in our January earnings call. Before I hand the call over to Bryan to provide additional detail on our financial results and outlook, I would like to take a minute to highlight the ways in which our strategic growth investments, which have been consistent over several years, are providing long-term organic growth that is not macro environment dependent. In our consumer bank, consumer households grew 2.7% over the prior year, punctuated by 6% household growth in the Southeast. The release of the FDIC's annual summary of deposits during the quarter provided an additional means to benchmark our performance. For the second year in a row, Fifth Third was number one among all large banks in year-over-year retail deposit growth measured on a capped branch deposit basis. We maintained or improved our market position in every market where we compete. In our Midwest markets, we maintained our number two overall position behind JPMorgan. In our Southeast markets, we maintained our number six overall position and significantly closed the gap to our top five goal. We grew retail deposits nearly 16% year-over-year and gained meaningful market share in 14 of our 15 focused MSAs in the Southeast. We will open up 19 de novo branch locations in the fourth quarter and plan to accelerate the pace of openings through 2028, at which time we will have nearly half our network from more than 500 branches in total in the Southeast. In our Commercial Bank, we continue to expand our middle market presence and to invest in commercial payments. Over the past 12-months, we have increased relationship manager headcount by over 20% in our Southeast and expansion markets, including opening commercial banking offices in Birmingham, Kansas City, and in the Central Valley. Third quarter middle market loan production was the highest in five quarters, led by the Southeast markets, which were up 20% sequentially and over 30% over the prior year. Our Commercial Payments business grew net fee equivalent revenues by 10% year-over-year in the quarter and we processed $4.3 trillion in dollar volume. Newline and our managed service offerings continue to lead the way in terms of growth that is delinked from our balance sheet. Over 40% of all new commercial payments relationships added this year have been payments led with no credit attached. In our Wealth and Asset Management business, we achieved record quarterly revenues growing by 12% year-over-year. Total assets under management have grown $12 billion in the past year or up 21% to $69 billion. Our Fifth Third Private Bank, Fifth Third Securities, and Fifth Third Wealth Advisors business units all continue to generate strong performance. Turning to capital, our strong profitability and disciplined balance sheet management are providing growth capacity and the opportunity to increase capital return to shareholders. This quarter, we increased our common dividend by 6% to $0.37 per share and executed $200 million in share repurchases. Even with these actions, our CET1 ratio increased to 10.8%. This will allow us to increase share repurchases in the fourth quarter to $300 million with the potential to increase further depending on the level of loan growth realized during the quarter. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and the beginning of next, while we feel more optimistic today about the near-term outlook for the economy, we also recognize that crosscurrents, including reversals in interest rate rallies, volatility in jobs reports, stickiness in inflation, and geopolitical uncertainty could produce a wide range of potential economic outcomes. We will continue to manage Fifth Third with a focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order and to stay liquid and conservatively positioned while investing with the long-term in mind. Lastly, I'd like to take a moment to express our sympathies to all those who have been impacted by Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. We recognize the hardships that arise from such devastated events, and I would like to also thank all our employees who have answered the call to support our customers and communities at this time. In the day since the hurricanes, we've worked tirelessly to reopen branches and check-in on customers. We staffed the Fifth Third Financial Empowerment Bus to enable those who lost power and Internet access to apply for FEMA disaster relief. Your dedication to serve in the face of these natural disasters is inspiring. Thank you for living our core values. With that, I will turn it over to Bryan to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook.\nBryan Preston: Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. We're pleased that our third quarter results once again demonstrate the strength of our company. Our well positioned balance sheet and diversified fee income streams drove 3% sequential adjusted revenue growth. Net revenue performance combined with our ongoing expense discipline resulted in 5% sequential pre-provision net revenue growth in the third quarter on an adjusted basis. As Tim mentioned, our profitability remains strong, which allowed us to continue to accrete capital while we are purchasing shares and raising the quarterly common dividend 6%. Our CET1 ratio grew to 10.8% at the end of the quarter and our tangible book value per share, inclusive of AOCI, increased 14% compared to June 30, and 47% from a year ago. Highlighted on Page 2 of our release, our reported results were impacted by certain items, including costs related to the Visa, Mastercard interchange litigation and some severance recognized during the quarter as we continue to work to drive efficiencies and automation. Net interest income for the quarter was over $1.4 billion and increased 2% sequentially and net interest margin improved 2 basis points. Increased yields on new loan production were the primary driver of this improvement and more than offset the impact of increased interest bearing core deposit costs, which were well managed and up only 2 basis points compared to the prior quarter. With the Fed Funds rate cut at the end of the quarter, in September, we experienced our first month over month decrease in interest bearing core deposit costs during this rate cycle. While total average portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially, we are seeing some signs of life. Loan production rebounded for both middle market and corporate banking with strong contributions from the Georgia and Chicago regions, as well as the energy and TMT verticals. For the commercial portfolio, average loans decreased 1% primarily due to increased paydowns and softness in revolver utilization, which declined 1% during the quarter to 35%. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were up 1% from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in indirect auto originations, which continued to be a significant contributor to our fixed rate asset repricing. During the quarter, we saw a 200 basis points of pickup on the front book, back book repricing in this portfolio. Diving further into deposits. Average core deposits were up 1% sequentially, driven by higher money market balances, offset by a decrease in savings and CDs. This core deposit balance performance combined with our well timed long-term debt issuance during the quarter has allowed us to pay down higher cost short-term wholesale borrowings. As a result, our rates paid on total interest bearing liabilities decreased 1 basis point sequentially. Our current focus remains on prudently managing deposit costs as we have officially entered the rate cutting cycle. Since mid-2023, we have been increasing our testing of price sensitivity in our deposit book to be well prepared for this phase of the cycle. We remain confident in our ability to manage liability costs to drive net interest income performance in the fourth quarter and beyond. Demand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits were 24% during the third quarter, down 1% from the prior quarter. This level is consistent with our expectations from July and we expect DDA mix to stay around 24% for the remainder of the year. By segment, average consumer and wealth deposits were stable sequentially, while commercial deposits increased 3%. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 132% and our loan to core deposit ratio was 71%, down 1% from the prior quarter. Moving on to fees. Excluding the impacts of the security gains and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter. As Tim mentioned, our commercial payments and wealth businesses delivered strong fee results with both achieving double-digit revenue growth over the prior year, driven by our sustained strategic organic growth investments in products and sales personnel. In commercial payments, revenue increased 10% as we continue to acquire new clients in traditional treasury management products, our managed service offerings and in Newline. In wealth, our AUM increased to $69 billion up 21% over the prior year, driven by strong inflows from Fifth Third Wealth Advisors and market performance. Fees were $163 million this quarter were a record high led by strong transactional activity at Fifth Third Securities and the fee benefit from the AUM growth. Our capital markets business rebounded this quarter as bond issuance and trading, as well as rate hedging activities picked up. Fees grew 9% over the prior year, also led by our debt capital markets business. The security gains of $10 million were from the mark-to-market impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which is more than offset in compensation expense. Moving to expenses, excluding these items noted on Page 2 of our release, our adjusted non-interest expense was up 3% from the year ago quarter and increased 2% sequentially, primarily due to increases in performance based compensation due to the strong fee generation, the impact of the previously mentioned non-qualified deferred compensation mark-to-market, and continued investments in technology, branches, and sales personnel. Shifting to credit, the net charge-off ratio was 48 basis points, slightly better than our expectations from early September and down 1 basis point sequentially. Commercial charge-offs were 40 basis points, down 5 basis points sequentially and consumer charge-offs were 62 basis points, up 5 basis points from a seasonally low second quarter. Early stage delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased 2 basis points to 24 basis points, which remain near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade. NPAs increased $82 million during the quarter and the NPA ratio increased 7 basis points to 62 basis points, in line with our 10 year average and remains below the peer median level. Commercial NPAs increased $60 million from the prior quarter. Within our C&I portfolio, NPAs increased $20 million due to increased inflow activity, which given the nature of the commercial business will be uneven from quarter-to-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, C&I NPAs are down $7 million. Our CRE portfolio continues to perform well with no net charge-offs during the quarter and an NPA ratio of only 46 basis points, the increase in our commercial mortgage NPAs is related to a single senior living credit in our owner occupied portfolio. Consumer NPAs increased to $20 million from the prior quarter. Approximately half of this increase was driven by a recent change in policy related to our consumer nonaccrual processes to better align our policies across asset classes and primarily impacted our return to accrual timing for loans that are paying in full and current. Overall, we are not seeing any broad credit weakening across industries or geographies. From a credit perspective, we do not expect Hurricane Helene to have a material impact on losses and we are continuing to assess the impact of Hurricane Milton. Our ACL coverage ratio increased 1 basis point to 2.09% and included an $18 million reserve bill. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Moving to capital, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.8%, significantly exceeding our buffered minimum of 7.7%, reflecting strong capital levels. Our pro-forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the securities portfolio is 8.7%. We expect continued improvement in the unrealized losses in our securities portfolio, given that 59% of the AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked out securities, which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. Assuming the forward curve is realized, approximately 24% of the AOCI related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025, increasing tangible book value per share by 6% before considering any future earnings. 61% of the securities related AOCI should accrete back to equity by the end of 2028. During the quarter, we completed $200 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 4.9 million shares. As we assess our capital priorities, we continue to believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level. Moving to our current outlook, we anticipate continued growth in NII and NIM during the Q4, with NII up 1% sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower deposit rates and the continued benefit of fixed rate asset repricing, partially offset by the decrease in yield from our floating rate loan portfolio. This outlook assumes a 25 basis point cut in November and a 50 basis point cut in December. We would not expect any change to this outlook if fewer rate cuts were to occur. We expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% from the third quarter, with middle market and auto production offsetting mix demand in other asset classes. Fourth quarter adjusted noninterest income is anticipated to rise 3% to 4% compared to the strong Q3, largely due to a continued rebound in capital markets revenue and continued growth in commercial payments. Additionally, we expect fourth quarter TRA revenue to be $10 million down from $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter total adjusted noninterest expenses are expected to be stable compared to the third quarter as the increases in revenue-based compensation and the investments in branches and technology are largely offset by efficiencies achieved in other areas. Fourth quarter net charge-offs are projected to be similar or slightly down from the third quarter. Given the expected increase in loans during the fourth quarter, we anticipate an ACL build of $20 million to $40 million assuming no major change to the economic outlook. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis, and our PPNR guidance for the full year remains in line with our guidance from back in January. Our net interest income trajectory exiting the year continues to position us for record results in 2025, assuming no major economic or interest rate outlook changes. Finally, moving to capital. With our consistent and strong earnings, we now expect to increase our share repurchases in the fourth quarter to $300 million with potential further repurchases depending on the level of loan growth throughout the quarter. In summary, with our well positioned balance sheet, growing revenue streams and disciplined expense and credit risk management, we are set to generate strong and stable capital accretion, top quartile profitability and long-term value for shareholders, customers, communities and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call up for Q&A.\nMatt Curoe: Thanks, Bryan. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and then return to queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the call. Bryan, I was hoping you might be able to discuss sort of just the main puts and takes you see in the fourth quarter NII guide in particular. Curious about how you're thinking about the further trajectory of deposit betas, and sort of how that evolves over time given that you've had you've been very transparent about it and have an optimistic outlook there as well.\nBryan Preston: Yeah. Absolutely. We continue to feel really good about the trajectory of the NII as well as the performance on the deposit front. As you know, we've spent a lot of time being prepared for this point in the cycle and things are playing out basically as we expected. When we look at both our results and peer results, the natural transition that you would expect is broker deposits, wholesale funding borrowings to start to come down. That's what we're seeing at the same play out. And then also then to start to see when that has been fully realized that movement in the beta. And that's exactly what we're seeing from us and the competition. For us, $35 billion of the index deposits, we were able to get the beta out of those as expected. To date, we're about in the mid-40s in terms of the betas that we've achieved since the 50 basis point rate cut. And we still have $13 billion, $14 billion of CDs that will be approaching maturities, about 75% of our CD portfolio matures between now and end of first quarter, as well as some additional promos that we'll see maturities on, and we'll continue to grind through the deposit costs in other areas of the book. So continue to feel really good about that as the trajectory plays out. And then the fixed rate asset repricing, that benefit continues to be a sequential tailwind for us and that's going to continue into the fourth quarter of next year. And that will be a big driver of the increase in NII from here.\nScott Siefers: Okay, perfect. Thank you. Maybe looking at a little further, I know you've discussed generating record NII in 2025. Would love to hear any updated thoughts there, I guess, including what kind of lending rebound might be required to achieve that. It sounded like, you know, maybe a bit more optimistic on what, lending demand might look like given some of the signs of life you referred to in your opening remarks.\nBryan Preston: Yeah. We are seeing some more activity there. We don't need, we don't need heroic loan growth to deliver record NII. The -- how the NII is delivered is obviously going to be very environment dependent. So shape of the curve is going to matter. We do expect to start to see some tailwinds on the loan growth side given what we've seen. The decreases from a commercial perspective, we think for the most part are behind us and we're seeing nice tailwinds in the consumer businesses that will be a big driver of how we transition into a loan growth from here. So we would like to see a little bit of loan growth. That certainly would be helpful in terms of delivering that record NII, but we feel good about the trajectory from here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.\nGerard Cassidy: Can you guys -- I posed this question to one of your peers yesterday and when I framed it out part of the response was it was a rosy outlook. So I'll give that as a caveat to you. But can you share with us, I'm curious and we're not -- I'm not asking for a specific '25 guidance, but if the Fed continues with dropping rates the way they appear to be in terms of the forward curve and their own outlook and we actually go from an inverted yield curve that we've lived with for over 2 years now to a positively sloping curve where the front end drops to 3%, 3.5%, the long end stays around 4% to 4.5%. Can you share with us what kind of impact that may have on your net interest income growth for 2025?\nBryan Preston: Yes. Obviously, Gerard, we'll give more detail in next year on 2025. But if we can actually get a little bit more steepness in the curve, get the inversion out of the curve, that is very powerful for us from an NII perspective from here, because we would expect to see some relief on the liability side of the balance sheet. We do continue to have confidence that we will get cost out. And the thing that's not reflected in our forward guidance right now is an assumption that we're going to be able to maintain the fixed rate asset spreads. We do assume that there is compression as rates come down. And if we were to get to a normal shaped curve, there would be even more benefit then from the fixed rate asset we\u2019re pricing. And we would also have a little bit of opportunity to get some a little bit more economics out of duration in the security portfolio and then the swap portfolio over time. So that'd be a really productive environment for us. And we would see it over time, you would see a significant expansion of your net.\nTim Spence: Yes. And at least for what it's worth, Gerard, I don't know that I see your outlook as being overly rosy in that regard. I just think it's probably a reflection of what both the Fed's actions and the data would tell us is realistic. It probably feels rosy because we just haven't seen it in an environment like that over a very long time, very long time period, right, 20 years or something like that, right? Either we had absolute rates of zero on the front end and a little bit of slope, but we've had this situation now where the front end was elevated and you had a historic level of inversion without a recession. If the Fed manages to land the plane here, the front end comes down. I think our view has been that the 10 year was probably going to be stickier. It just you're talking about on an intermediate term basis, inherently more inflationary dynamics, including the domestic manufacturing industrial policy, the green energy transition, the historic level of fiscal deficits that we're running, like those are all things that should work against the long end of the curve moving meaningfully lower. And potentially even you could see if the Fed settles out at the 3% or 3.5%, the long end of the curve move up a little bit. So you get more of a normal term premium. That sort of an environment, if it doesn't come along with some other issue, would be a really wonderful one for the balance sheet portion of our revenue.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then can you guys remind us, you talked about lifting up the buyback a bit in the fourth quarter. Bryan, you talked about how the tangible book value accretion, how it's going to come through just the burn off of that securities portfolio through the end of \u201825. Can you remind us in an environment where you know what the Basel III endgame requirements are, which hopefully we will obviously by this time next year. What should we expect in terms of how much of the capital that you guys are comfortable giving back to shareholders as a percentage of earnings, for example, in dividends and buybacks?\nBryan Preston: Yeah. Our target right now in normalized environments, we like being in, say a 35% to 45% range from a dividend payout ratio perspective. The share buyback ultimately is driven by how much capacity we have relative to organic growth, because we do -- our preference would be to continue to invest on the organic front when we see good risk adjusted returns. And then with what's left, we manage capital via the share buybacks. Continue to feel good with the capital generation that we've been seeing that $200 million or $300 million of share buybacks feel about the right level. This quarter, we saw a little bit of benefit in RWA, which allows us to potentially have a little bit more share buyback. But with some loan growth coming in next year, hopefully, we'll be talking about a little bit lower buyback over time just because we've got a lot more organic opportunities to invest in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hey. Just to follow-up on the, you said the loan production is the highest in five quarters and then quarter over quarter loan growth is flat, right? So if you could just give a little bit more detail like how much would loans have grown without paydowns? And why aren't you seeing more of this? It sounds like you said there's signs of life, but is it bigger than a bread box sort of what you think might come ahead?\nBryan Preston: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. The paydowns for the quarter were around, say, $900 million a bit elevated from what we would typically see in some of the portfolios, as well as we had a utilization headwind of about 1%, because we did see the revolver utilization move down. That 1% decrease is another say $800 million. So the combination of those two were a decent driver ultimately from an overall average loan growth and in the period loan growth perspective. We're not expecting continued pressures at this point and we've seen utilization stabilize in the second half of the quarter and in the beginning of this quarter. So that doesn't feel like a headwind for us right now. The capital markets activity, obviously, it was a very robust capital markets activity in the second quarter compared to third quarter, we do think that fed into some of the pay down behaviors that we're seeing. But from here, we're expecting to get back to a little bit more normalized level and we think that helps then with loan growth from here.\nMike Mayo: And as far as at the end of Penta win kind of expectations for the next several quarters over the next year, are you willing to give us any number yet? Do you think it will be more than 1% or 2% or I mean, I'm sure you're going to --?\nBryan Preston: Yes, I mean, we gave average loan growth guide, obviously of up 1% sequentially. We'll get into 2025 in more detail next year. But in general, our objective would be to grow with the market plus a point or 2. Historically, the banking industry grows in line with GDP, nominal GDP type levels. And if we get back to that kind of environment and the industry gets back to overall aggregate growth, we would expect to be in line, if not outperforming the industry.\nTim Spence: Yes. I think Mike, it's Tim. The one thing I maybe I'd add here, I am of the view that the factors that would lead to a more favorable environment for loan growth inside the banking system are potentially in front of us. Subject to one, who wins the election and probably more importantly, one of the things that both candidates are campaigning on actually make their way into policy and how they elect to govern. What we hear from clients when I'm out in the field is that, so one, the elevated level of rates have been challenging because there's a capital investments that don't make sense, that just don't pencil out in an environment where rates are higher. Two, because they are uncertain about what we're going to see in the election, they have been using cash flow from the businesses to pay down debt in lieu of investing it in other places. And three, you have this big buildup in inventory in the 2021, 2022, 2023 timeframe associated with people moving. I think we refer to it as the shift from just in time to just in case in inventories. As rates came up, we have seen I think the term for it that one of our distribution clients, our wholesale distribution clients use when I was out with them last week was destocking. So, less inventory, less bill of material across supply chains, which in turn and a focus on more inventory turns, just getting the balance sheet to work harder, which reduces the revolving credit borrowing needs. Like that can't go to zero, so you're not going to have a headwind there. If interest rates come down and more M&A and capital investment starts to make sense that hasn't worked, you should see a pickup on that front. And then if we continue to see more certainty as it relates to the trajectory of the economy and have the uncertainty attached to the election out of the equation, I think we could see a better environment across the banking system. And that coupled with the sales headcounts that we continue to make, we referenced that in the prepared remarks, should support the -- at to above market growth rate on the lending side of the equation that Bryan referenced earlier.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess just a couple of follow-ups. One, maybe starting with loan growth. Tim, you mentioned 2 things. 1, from a Fifth Third standpoint, are we still lapping derisking or running off the Shared National Credit book? I think it's down 11% year-over-year. Just give us a sense of is that book going to continue to decline as you kind of reduce your exposure there? And secondly, in your business, are you seeing any competition from non-bank, direct lenders, private credit that looks different today than it would have three, four, five years ago?\nTim Spence : Yeah, sure. Good question. So we should be at the inflection point on the sort of impact of the RWA guide by the end of the year. I think we talked last year about the fact that we were trying to get everything done in the fourth quarter. There would be a little bit of a spillover into the first as you just got through normal timing. But we should be reaching the inflection point on that front where you don't have the less derisking, you bring in a focus on what would the profitability, the unit economics of those relationships look like in a world where you had a different perspective on capital levels and the value of the corporate cash that comes along with some of those larger relationships. As it relates to private credit, we do see it at the margins, principally in leveraged lending space. What I would tell you has happened is their focus on less structure, faster execution then has a little bit of a bleed over in other areas. And there is no question that the things that some of the private lenders are willing to do are not in line with the way that we want to run our portfolio. I think it was the Financial Times, the journal, but there was a piece about a week ago in the paper that talked about payment in kind or where I come from negative amortization lending was between 1/4 and 1/3 of the portfolios at most of the major private credit shops. That is definitely not something you would ever see at Fifth Third in an environment where the economic backdrop is benign and where you don't have a large percentage of your companies operating at distressed levels. It's just odd to see that amount of PIC lending going on. So, they're willing to do those things and we're not. By definition, they're going to scrape the most indebted companies out of the banking sector.\nBryan Preston: And Ebrahim, it's Bryan. We put a little bit of detail on the PIC portfolio on Slide 24 of our slide. Yeah, $31 billion portfolio, it's down 11% year-over-year. So we are still facing lapping some of that headwind.\nEbrahim Poonawala: But was the point that we are at a point where the 31.2 is close to where this book should bottom out?\nBryan Preston: I think you're going to continue to see some runoff, but we do think you're getting back to the point where you'll start to see some production coming in and offsetting it. It may not be exactly at the floor, but the decreases should definitely be moderating.\nTim Spence : The CIB pipeline, the middle market pipeline, which I think we referenced in response to Mike's question is that an all-time record level and the CIB pipeline, which would be where the majority of the Shared National credits would originate is at the highest level it has been in the year. So that you're seeing the turn there, which should support the decline in runoff increase in production and then inflection point in loan balances.\nEbrahim Poonawala: And just the other question on capital allocation means your stock has done well. I'm not saying it's expensive, but it stayed well on tangible book when you look at it. Why not hold excess capital as opposed to picking up the pace of buybacks given that we might be in an improving economy, if that happens more capital good for growth. If it's worse it adds defensibility. Just talk through in terms of how you go through capital allocation and the whole discussion or analysis around holding on and building some more excess dry powder as opposed to accelerating buybacks from here?\nBryan Preston: Yes. I mean, we feel really good, [indiscernible] about the earnings trajectory of the company. And we think given that, we feel like our stock is continues to be a good bargain for us and we think it's a good investment for us from a corporate perspective. We look at a couple of things on that front. We're generating a lot of capital every quarter. And so that actually gives us the ability to be very dynamic with our capital allocation decisions. We have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to generate the capital necessary for organic growth. And then if we wanted to slow down capital distribution via share buybacks because we see more opportunity or we need to get more defensive, we would be able to do that. Another component is just when you think about our industry and the 10% cost of equity, sitting on excess capital is a high cost for our shareholders. And so being in a position as we are right now and being able to go ahead and make some decisions and deploy at a time where we continue to feel really positive about our trajectory as a company and knowing that we have the flexibility with the income profile and the stability that we have going forward to degenerate the capital when we would need to, and if we think different opportunities would present themselves. That's really the thought process on how we're thinking about capital allocation from here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of UBS.\nErika Najarian: My first question is for you, Bryan. So you indicated that your deposit beta so far on the recent cuts are in the mid-40s. As we think about the speed of index deposit repricing and then retail, could you give us a sense of what you think the cadence could be as we go through the next 5 quarters? So a few of your peers have noted that it might not be a straight line, you know, path to the terminal beta given how quickly corporate can reprice and, you know, retail has sort of been awoken, so to speak, in terms of higher rates. So if you could speak to that and maybe speak a little bit to as you think about your deposits, you know, we haven't seen a neutral rate that's not zero for so long. So maybe help us, get a sense that if we get a neutral rate of, you know, 2.75% or 3%, what do you think your natural spread is or natural deposit rate is in that environment?\nBryan Preston: Yeah. I mean, that is -- that is obviously a very interesting question. The shape of the curve is going to matter a lot, in that scenario as well. When we think about the when we think about the pacing of how the beta will come through, like you said, it is the commercial deposits will come through very quickly. The retail takes a little bit longer. The two primary drivers for us on that, it's the guarantee periods on the promotional offerings, which tend to be between say 45 and 90 days. And then it's the maturities of your CD portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, 75% of our CDs will mature between now and the end of first quarter. So to get the rest of the beta and get to that kind of cumulative beta that we have been targeting where high 50s kind of beta, For us, it will take about 2 quarters because the CD repricing is going to be a component of that now that that's $13 billion in book. From a natural level perspective, I think that is really tough to estimate. I mean, we're sitting here, at peak rates, we were at a 2.99-ish, was our peak interest bearing core deposit cost versus 5.50 Fed Funds level. We would expect to see a little bit of compression potentially in that spread. But being able to maintain 150 to 200 basis points of deposit spread seems like a potentially achievable scenario. One big question on that, Eric, another one that would obviously be a big question which is where, you have those demand through the loan growth change over time. And if you got -- if you\u2019ve done a decent curve shape back to Gerard's question and you've got opportunities for loan growth. You're going to have some opportunities to be a little bit more competitive to raise more deposits and ultimately drive better NII. And at the end of the day, we're not managing the deposit betas, we're managing the NII and profitability trajectory and those are the decisions and the trade-offs we'll make.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And my second question is for Tim. Tim, the feedback from investors has always been quite positive in terms of the forward looking way of how you look at the world. And as we think about 2025, I guess, it doesn't it feels like given record NII and your fee income should benefit if activity levels come back in general in an even bigger way next year. It feels like the expense run rate that you posted year-over-year this quarter to 3% sounds it feels more appropriate. Obviously assuming that revenues grow above that. As we think about 2025, is it right for us to until we get guides from you, put growth and expenses as a placeholder? And as we think about 2025, what are the big projects that you feel like you're ready to retackle and revisit that you may have pulled back on in \u201824 because the NII dollars were coming down?\nTim Spence : Yeah. So thank you. I think there was a compliment and a question in there. I appreciate both. You've heard me reference, I think the old saying that Cincinnati invented hustle in the past. That dates back to Pete Rose's nickname and the fact that he sprinted to first base on a walk. I think that ethos is, I think, a part of the way that we try to run the company, right, is to sprint to first on a walk. So we try to work on next year's problems and the year after that this year as opposed to waiting for that environment to materialize. And that's part of why I think we made the NIM turn, right, our NIM trough and then grew in the first quarter before most of our peers. The NII inflected positive in the second quarter over the first quarter, which was before most of the peers. We got to real sequential positive operating leverage this quarter versus the last quarter and we're saying we'll get there year over year next year. Like none of that involved us holding back on investments we thought were important to the company or would make sense, right? We have -- we're going to have built 30 plus branches this year in an environment where we were trying to manage expenses. We continued forward on the platform modernization. The acquisitions we made on the commercial payment side of fintech companies last year, we've continued to feed this year. And the hiring, as I mentioned, on the sales force and both in wealth management and in the middle market have been pretty significant. So you should expect us to do the same sorts of things next year and to expect the company through other efficiency initiatives to help self-fund the investments along the way. We don't view strategic planning as an investment request process. It's principally a resource allocation process. So I don't know that I helped you with a specific number for 2025, you have to wait till January to get that. But the annualized expense run rate of the bank over a period of time has been call it 3%, if you look at it. So that's certainly if you were going to use the past, averaged through more benign periods and more challenging periods would be where you'd start.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia of Morgan Stanley.\nManan Gosalia: I wanted to ask about index deposits. Can you talk about how they've behaved over time? So I guess the question is that as rates fall and the rates on those index deposits fall, is there a chance that some of those move into other deposit products with exception pricing? Or does that not really happen based on historical experience?\nBryan Preston: You'll see some people that try to do some negotiations on deposit costs. Those are things that always occur, but those are things that we are typically able to manage fairly well. The reality is you get paid a better spread as a depository on an index deposit because you're taking the risk ultimately on market movements. Whereas on a managed account, it's typically a wider spread because we have more ability to manage it. So we it's something that we've had good experience with behaving, controlling it through our pricing and through our discipline around that process. We're not overly concerned about reverse migration from index back into managed rate being a headwind from a beta perspective.\nManan Gosalia: Got it. And then maybe just separately on credit, on Slide 28, you're showing NCOs and NPAs reaching normalized levels. I know you noted that you're not seeing any signs of credit weakening. Can you give us some more color there? What gives you some confidence that things are just normalizing here? Is it that rates are going down, so that helps you on the credit side? Is it just what you're seeing on the roll rates? Maybe what helps this to stabilize from here?\nGreg Schroeck: Yes, it's Greg. I'll take that one. A couple of things, you look at our delinquency, the delinquencies continue to be at all-time low levels. Our criticized assets actually went down by $8 million quarter-over-quarter. We had the increase in NPAs. On the commercial side, those were driven by 5 names and 5 different industries. We've been very consistent in talking about a very diverse portfolio, and it continues to be very diverse. On the consumer side, we're seeing a little bit of softness on dividend, see a little bit of softness in the RV portfolio. When you look at the 2022, 2023 origination vintages, they're underperforming across many of the consumer asset classes. We see the same thing in the portfolio, specifically in dividend and RV. But the securitization data from other originators will tell you the same thing. We're actually outperforming those indexes, that securitization data by almost 50, 60 basis points. And so I would expect dividend to be a little bit elevated for the next quarter or two, but I'm highly confident that we will work through those vintages and it comes back down to more normalized level in that 125 level. So we're just not seeing anything within the portfolio, it's commercial or consumer that's causing additional concerns, it's been pretty stable. Our borrowers have continued to behave. We see the commercial real estate portfolio. We've got virtually no delinquencies, very, very minimal non-performing assets in that commercial real estate portfolio. So across the board, that diversification, that strategic play of building out a through the cycle portfolio has played well for us, and I would expect that to continue in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning. On Slide 10, you've got some pie charts here you showed before just showing the mix shift from the Midwest to being more balanced. And, I guess the question is, as we look out the next few years, you show the split getting to 50-50, which is still a pretty meaningful reshift from here. So how do you get there? Is it simply harvesting what you've done, a combination of harvesting and building? Is there a buy component of that as well?\nTim Spence: Yeah, there's no buy component in there. That's the old fashioned way, which is one new branch at a time and the right marketing and product strategies to support the increase in distribution. So if you look at the branches we've built, Matt, they're performing very well. We've talked in the past about the fact that the performance at this stage and having built more than 100 of them is pretty predictable. And they reach a point where they sort of saturate their catchment area in about seven years, right? They break even within two and then they make this pivot to continuing growth. So the average age of the de novo right now is going to be like call it 2 years, 2.5 years at most. So there is a 5-year tailwind we'll get from the 100 that are already in the ground and operational. Plus we have been building about 30 to 35 a year that number should move up into the sort of 40 to 50 range on an annualized basis, just based on what we have in the pipeline. And as those branches come online, you will see that mix shift play out first in the allocation of the physical distribution and then behind that over time as they mature the mix of the deposit base on the retail side overall.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay. So that's super helpful. So a lot of maturing of what you've already done will move the needle quite a bit. And then just --\nTim Spence: It will. I don't see it short over your retail deposit growth that I cited from the FDIC summary deposits. It's visible there.\nMatt O'Connor: Thank you. And then, just separately, I know there's been a lot of discussion on net interest income and kind of drivers of the NIM. And I'm sorry if I missed it, but have you guys talked about this concept of like normalized NIM, looking at a few years as you get the fixed rate asset repricing and whatever rates do break the forward curve, any concept of normalized NIM?\nBryan Preston : Yeah. I mean, that's, again, it's another tough one. Because what does the environment look like? What does the shape of the curve look like out in the future? If you just take the cash position that we're holding today, we're at we're north of $20 billion of cash. We're up almost $9 billion year-over-year. Every $1 billion of excess cash that we're holding is a basis point to have on NIM. So just getting $10 billion out over the next year and hopefully having some opportunities to deploy that into the loan portfolio that could add 15 to 20 basis points to our NIM alone. We're going to see NIM growth from here just with the continued repricing of the portfolio. From a fixed rate asset perspective, that will continue to take that just takes a little bit more time to play out. But if you get a little bit of relief on the front end, a more normalized curve, it's front and down, I mean, it's not unreasonable to think we could be talking about getting back to what was 315 to 325 NIM in a reasonable time horizon.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott.\nChristopher Marinac: I wanted to ask about some of the large banks who have been placed under regulatory orders this year. Does that create new business opportunities for you beyond your already organic pipeline?\nTim Spence: I mean, I think any time there is a limit on someone else's ability to grow, it means that the rest of the industry has to have the capacity to be able to absorb the growth in the market. So I guess in that sense, yes, just tactically. I think more strategically, the more disciplined you are about the way you run your business, the better you do in moments when there's any sort of disruption somewhere else, right? So I wouldn't wish significant regulatory problems on anybody. There\u2019s no fun to work through, but they do tend to create opportunities at the margins for other banks that are in a strong position and have the ability to grow in an environment where others may not.\nChristopher Marinac: Great, Tim. Thank you for that. And just a quick follow-up on, sort of adjusted returns over time. Does lower interest rates help you get your returns or does it make it more challenging?\nBryan Preston: Lower interest rates, as long as that comes along with a, normalization of the yield curve that would certainly be very helpful to returns over time. A low flat curve is a challenging environment for the banking system.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.\nMike Mayo: Hey. I was just wondering, this is a big picture question. You guys give the sense that you're investing more for growth than others. Do you have any metric on how much you make in your organic investments and what sort of returns you get on those? I'm thinking about the Southeast branches or wealth or commercial payments and it kind of goes back to that earlier question, maybe you shouldn't buy back so much stock if you have so many opportunities for growth or high class problem if you get there?\nTim Spence: Yes, I mean, we look at all of these things. The easiest comparable across the different investment types is probably just IRR, Mike, right, and time to breakeven. So the IRR of the branches in the Southeast has been running in the 18% to 20% range and the time to breakeven has been a couple of years, right? If you were to look at the small acquisitions we've made to support commercial payments, we were targeting IRRs in the 20s in those cases in part because you had a more nascent business and it\u2019s less predictable after than when you built 100 branches and you know what you're going to get out of the next location that you build. So in general, we feel really good about anything that we can get done in that sort of 15% to 25% range, subject to the execution risk that's attached. The more uncertain, the more nascent the strategy, the higher the return you would expect to get out of it and then what proven strategies. Obviously, lower the execution risk premium that you would need to place on them. I don't think we are constraining the investment rate. Like if you just look at the Southeast, JPMorgan has built the most branches down there over the course of the past five years, they're at 180 or something like that. I think Fifth Third is number two and I believe BofA is number three and then there's a pretty wide gap between that and everybody else. And I know I don't have to tell you that we're a little bit smaller than BofA and JPMorgan. So we are -- we think being appropriately aggressive in terms of the investment rate down there. And at least at the moment, I don't know that if we said, hey, we're not going to buy back stock, we don't have an alternative use for that capital on an organic basis that we would be thinking that we would deploy it toward.\nBryan Preston : And Mike, we are accelerating the investments, as Tim mentioned, on improving strategies. It's part of why we're going from almost 20 to 30 branch builds a year to 50 plus branch builds a year. So we have more confidence that gives us point of view of an area we want to invest in. And then the other limiter for us is always going to be the analysts that are worried about positive operating leverage because that's the trade-off we care about as well.\nMike Mayo: Just to push back on that last point, I mean, I hear you if you get those sorts of IRRs and you're accelerating your branch build, but it's come set at a time when I think some of the Southeast competitors have woken up, recovered, like you less unrealized securities losses going from defense to offense. Do you have that change versus the last few years? And you also have the likes of some of those big banks that you mentioned with spending so much more in technology and digital. So don't you think it might be tougher in the next few years than it's been in the past few years?\nTim Spence : I don't know. I don't think that the Southeast was uncompetitive the last five years, right? I think that -- what you're just -- you're constantly looking at is, are we making the right set of investments given the competitors that we have and our value proposition relative to others. I completely agree the amount of money that is getting deployed into technology investment on the part of the large banks is eye-popping. But if you look at the value proposition, like go pull up the consumer -- lead consumer checking account offering for any of those large banks and for Fifth Third or some other regional and tell me how that materialized into some substantially better value proposition. I actually think in many cases what you would see is the opposite as it's been the regionals who led on consumer prep friendly product innovation. It's definitely been true of Fifth Third, but it's not just been Fifth Third in terms of the offerings there. So we are not running the bank to be able to take share in uncompetitive environments. We run the bank to be able to take share in very competitive environments. And I expect the level of competition is going to stay high, not that it's going to get better or for that matter get worse.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Matt for closing remarks.\nMatt Curoe : Thank you, and thanks everyone for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up calls or questions. Operator, we may now disconnect the call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tim Spence",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate uncertain ones. Our focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order has served us well in this dynamic operating environment and continues to produce strong and predictable results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.78 or $0.85 excluding certain items outlined on Page 2 of the release, exceeding the guidance we provided in our Q2 earnings call. We produced a return on equity of 12.8%, the best among peers who have reported thus far and the most stable on a trailing 12-months basis. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 56.1% in the third quarter. Headcount declined 1% year-over-year despite continued investments in our growth strategies. We achieved sequential positive operating leverage for the second consecutive quarter without the need to expend shareholder capital on an investment portfolio restructuring charge and are in a position to achieve positive operating leverage on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. Despite changes throughout the year on interest rates, economic activity and market demand, as we come into the home stretch for 2024, I am pleased to say that Fifth Third should deliver NII, fees, expenses and credit costs within the full year guidance ranges we provided back in our January earnings call. Before I hand the call over to Bryan to provide additional detail on our financial results and outlook, I would like to take a minute to highlight the ways in which our strategic growth investments, which have been consistent over several years, are providing long-term organic growth that is not macro environment dependent. In our consumer bank, consumer households grew 2.7% over the prior year, punctuated by 6% household growth in the Southeast. The release of the FDIC's annual summary of deposits during the quarter provided an additional means to benchmark our performance. For the second year in a row, Fifth Third was number one among all large banks in year-over-year retail deposit growth measured on a capped branch deposit basis. We maintained or improved our market position in every market where we compete. In our Midwest markets, we maintained our number two overall position behind JPMorgan. In our Southeast markets, we maintained our number six overall position and significantly closed the gap to our top five goal. We grew retail deposits nearly 16% year-over-year and gained meaningful market share in 14 of our 15 focused MSAs in the Southeast. We will open up 19 de novo branch locations in the fourth quarter and plan to accelerate the pace of openings through 2028, at which time we will have nearly half our network from more than 500 branches in total in the Southeast. In our Commercial Bank, we continue to expand our middle market presence and to invest in commercial payments. Over the past 12-months, we have increased relationship manager headcount by over 20% in our Southeast and expansion markets, including opening commercial banking offices in Birmingham, Kansas City, and in the Central Valley. Third quarter middle market loan production was the highest in five quarters, led by the Southeast markets, which were up 20% sequentially and over 30% over the prior year. Our Commercial Payments business grew net fee equivalent revenues by 10% year-over-year in the quarter and we processed $4.3 trillion in dollar volume. Newline and our managed service offerings continue to lead the way in terms of growth that is delinked from our balance sheet. Over 40% of all new commercial payments relationships added this year have been payments led with no credit attached. In our Wealth and Asset Management business, we achieved record quarterly revenues growing by 12% year-over-year. Total assets under management have grown $12 billion in the past year or up 21% to $69 billion. Our Fifth Third Private Bank, Fifth Third Securities, and Fifth Third Wealth Advisors business units all continue to generate strong performance. Turning to capital, our strong profitability and disciplined balance sheet management are providing growth capacity and the opportunity to increase capital return to shareholders. This quarter, we increased our common dividend by 6% to $0.37 per share and executed $200 million in share repurchases. Even with these actions, our CET1 ratio increased to 10.8%. This will allow us to increase share repurchases in the fourth quarter to $300 million with the potential to increase further depending on the level of loan growth realized during the quarter. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and the beginning of next, while we feel more optimistic today about the near-term outlook for the economy, we also recognize that crosscurrents, including reversals in interest rate rallies, volatility in jobs reports, stickiness in inflation, and geopolitical uncertainty could produce a wide range of potential economic outcomes. We will continue to manage Fifth Third with a focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order and to stay liquid and conservatively positioned while investing with the long-term in mind. Lastly, I'd like to take a moment to express our sympathies to all those who have been impacted by Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. We recognize the hardships that arise from such devastated events, and I would like to also thank all our employees who have answered the call to support our customers and communities at this time. In the day since the hurricanes, we've worked tirelessly to reopen branches and check-in on customers. We staffed the Fifth Third Financial Empowerment Bus to enable those who lost power and Internet access to apply for FEMA disaster relief. Your dedication to serve in the face of these natural disasters is inspiring. Thank you for living our core values. With that, I will turn it over to Bryan to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook. Yes. And at least for what it's worth, Gerard, I don't know that I see your outlook as being overly rosy in that regard. I just think it's probably a reflection of what both the Fed's actions and the data would tell us is realistic. It probably feels rosy because we just haven't seen it in an environment like that over a very long time, very long time period, right, 20 years or something like that, right? Either we had absolute rates of zero on the front end and a little bit of slope, but we've had this situation now where the front end was elevated and you had a historic level of inversion without a recession. If the Fed manages to land the plane here, the front end comes down. I think our view has been that the 10 year was probably going to be stickier. It just you're talking about on an intermediate term basis, inherently more inflationary dynamics, including the domestic manufacturing industrial policy, the green energy transition, the historic level of fiscal deficits that we're running, like those are all things that should work against the long end of the curve moving meaningfully lower. And potentially even you could see if the Fed settles out at the 3% or 3.5%, the long end of the curve move up a little bit. So you get more of a normal term premium. That sort of an environment, if it doesn't come along with some other issue, would be a really wonderful one for the balance sheet portion of our revenue. Yes. I think Mike, it's Tim. The one thing I maybe I'd add here, I am of the view that the factors that would lead to a more favorable environment for loan growth inside the banking system are potentially in front of us. Subject to one, who wins the election and probably more importantly, one of the things that both candidates are campaigning on actually make their way into policy and how they elect to govern. What we hear from clients when I'm out in the field is that, so one, the elevated level of rates have been challenging because there's a capital investments that don't make sense, that just don't pencil out in an environment where rates are higher. Two, because they are uncertain about what we're going to see in the election, they have been using cash flow from the businesses to pay down debt in lieu of investing it in other places. And three, you have this big buildup in inventory in the 2021, 2022, 2023 timeframe associated with people moving. I think we refer to it as the shift from just in time to just in case in inventories. As rates came up, we have seen I think the term for it that one of our distribution clients, our wholesale distribution clients use when I was out with them last week was destocking. So, less inventory, less bill of material across supply chains, which in turn and a focus on more inventory turns, just getting the balance sheet to work harder, which reduces the revolving credit borrowing needs. Like that can't go to zero, so you're not going to have a headwind there. If interest rates come down and more M&A and capital investment starts to make sense that hasn't worked, you should see a pickup on that front. And then if we continue to see more certainty as it relates to the trajectory of the economy and have the uncertainty attached to the election out of the equation, I think we could see a better environment across the banking system. And that coupled with the sales headcounts that we continue to make, we referenced that in the prepared remarks, should support the -- at to above market growth rate on the lending side of the equation that Bryan referenced earlier. Yeah, sure. Good question. So we should be at the inflection point on the sort of impact of the RWA guide by the end of the year. I think we talked last year about the fact that we were trying to get everything done in the fourth quarter. There would be a little bit of a spillover into the first as you just got through normal timing. But we should be reaching the inflection point on that front where you don't have the less derisking, you bring in a focus on what would the profitability, the unit economics of those relationships look like in a world where you had a different perspective on capital levels and the value of the corporate cash that comes along with some of those larger relationships. As it relates to private credit, we do see it at the margins, principally in leveraged lending space. What I would tell you has happened is their focus on less structure, faster execution then has a little bit of a bleed over in other areas. And there is no question that the things that some of the private lenders are willing to do are not in line with the way that we want to run our portfolio. I think it was the Financial Times, the journal, but there was a piece about a week ago in the paper that talked about payment in kind or where I come from negative amortization lending was between 1/4 and 1/3 of the portfolios at most of the major private credit shops. That is definitely not something you would ever see at Fifth Third in an environment where the economic backdrop is benign and where you don't have a large percentage of your companies operating at distressed levels. It's just odd to see that amount of PIC lending going on. So, they're willing to do those things and we're not. By definition, they're going to scrape the most indebted companies out of the banking sector. The CIB pipeline, the middle market pipeline, which I think we referenced in response to Mike's question is that an all-time record level and the CIB pipeline, which would be where the majority of the Shared National credits would originate is at the highest level it has been in the year. So that you're seeing the turn there, which should support the decline in runoff increase in production and then inflection point in loan balances. Yeah. So thank you. I think there was a compliment and a question in there. I appreciate both. You've heard me reference, I think the old saying that Cincinnati invented hustle in the past. That dates back to Pete Rose's nickname and the fact that he sprinted to first base on a walk. I think that ethos is, I think, a part of the way that we try to run the company, right, is to sprint to first on a walk. So we try to work on next year's problems and the year after that this year as opposed to waiting for that environment to materialize. And that's part of why I think we made the NIM turn, right, our NIM trough and then grew in the first quarter before most of our peers. The NII inflected positive in the second quarter over the first quarter, which was before most of the peers. We got to real sequential positive operating leverage this quarter versus the last quarter and we're saying we'll get there year over year next year. Like none of that involved us holding back on investments we thought were important to the company or would make sense, right? We have -- we're going to have built 30 plus branches this year in an environment where we were trying to manage expenses. We continued forward on the platform modernization. The acquisitions we made on the commercial payment side of fintech companies last year, we've continued to feed this year. And the hiring, as I mentioned, on the sales force and both in wealth management and in the middle market have been pretty significant. So you should expect us to do the same sorts of things next year and to expect the company through other efficiency initiatives to help self-fund the investments along the way. We don't view strategic planning as an investment request process. It's principally a resource allocation process. So I don't know that I helped you with a specific number for 2025, you have to wait till January to get that. But the annualized expense run rate of the bank over a period of time has been call it 3%, if you look at it. So that's certainly if you were going to use the past, averaged through more benign periods and more challenging periods would be where you'd start. Yeah, there's no buy component in there. That's the old fashioned way, which is one new branch at a time and the right marketing and product strategies to support the increase in distribution. So if you look at the branches we've built, Matt, they're performing very well. We've talked in the past about the fact that the performance at this stage and having built more than 100 of them is pretty predictable. And they reach a point where they sort of saturate their catchment area in about seven years, right? They break even within two and then they make this pivot to continuing growth. So the average age of the de novo right now is going to be like call it 2 years, 2.5 years at most. So there is a 5-year tailwind we'll get from the 100 that are already in the ground and operational. Plus we have been building about 30 to 35 a year that number should move up into the sort of 40 to 50 range on an annualized basis, just based on what we have in the pipeline. And as those branches come online, you will see that mix shift play out first in the allocation of the physical distribution and then behind that over time as they mature the mix of the deposit base on the retail side overall. It will. I don't see it short over your retail deposit growth that I cited from the FDIC summary deposits. It's visible there. I mean, I think any time there is a limit on someone else's ability to grow, it means that the rest of the industry has to have the capacity to be able to absorb the growth in the market. So I guess in that sense, yes, just tactically. I think more strategically, the more disciplined you are about the way you run your business, the better you do in moments when there's any sort of disruption somewhere else, right? So I wouldn't wish significant regulatory problems on anybody. There's no fun to work through, but they do tend to create opportunities at the margins for other banks that are in a strong position and have the ability to grow in an environment where others may not. Yes, I mean, we look at all of these things. The easiest comparable across the different investment types is probably just IRR, Mike, right, and time to breakeven. So the IRR of the branches in the Southeast has been running in the 18% to 20% range and the time to breakeven has been a couple of years, right? If you were to look at the small acquisitions we've made to support commercial payments, we were targeting IRRs in the 20s in those cases in part because you had a more nascent business and it's less predictable after than when you built 100 branches and you know what you're going to get out of the next location that you build. So in general, we feel really good about anything that we can get done in that sort of 15% to 25% range, subject to the execution risk that's attached. The more uncertain, the more nascent the strategy, the higher the return you would expect to get out of it and then what proven strategies. Obviously, lower the execution risk premium that you would need to place on them. I don't think we are constraining the investment rate. Like if you just look at the Southeast, JPMorgan has built the most branches down there over the course of the past five years, they're at 180 or something like that. I think Fifth Third is number two and I believe BofA is number three and then there's a pretty wide gap between that and everybody else. And I know I don't have to tell you that we're a little bit smaller than BofA and JPMorgan. So we are -- we think being appropriately aggressive in terms of the investment rate down there. And at least at the moment, I don't know that if we said, hey, we're not going to buy back stock, we don't have an alternative use for that capital on an organic basis that we would be thinking that we would deploy it toward. I don't know. I don't think that the Southeast was uncompetitive the last five years, right? I think that -- what you're just -- you're constantly looking at is, are we making the right set of investments given the competitors that we have and our value proposition relative to others. I completely agree the amount of money that is getting deployed into technology investment on the part of the large banks is eye-popping. But if you look at the value proposition, like go pull up the consumer -- lead consumer checking account offering for any of those large banks and for Fifth Third or some other regional and tell me how that materialized into some substantially better value proposition. I actually think in many cases what you would see is the opposite as it's been the regionals who led on consumer prep friendly product innovation. It's definitely been true of Fifth Third, but it's not just been Fifth Third in terms of the offerings there. So we are not running the bank to be able to take share in uncompetitive environments. We run the bank to be able to take share in very competitive environments. And I expect the level of competition is going to stay high, not that it's going to get better or for that matter get worse."

            "name": "Bryan Preston",
            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. We're pleased that our third quarter results once again demonstrate the strength of our company. Our well positioned balance sheet and diversified fee income streams drove 3% sequential adjusted revenue growth. Net revenue performance combined with our ongoing expense discipline resulted in 5% sequential pre-provision net revenue growth in the third quarter on an adjusted basis. As Tim mentioned, our profitability remains strong, which allowed us to continue to accrete capital while we are purchasing shares and raising the quarterly common dividend 6%. Our CET1 ratio grew to 10.8% at the end of the quarter and our tangible book value per share, inclusive of AOCI, increased 14% compared to June 30, and 47% from a year ago. Highlighted on Page 2 of our release, our reported results were impacted by certain items, including costs related to the Visa, Mastercard interchange litigation and some severance recognized during the quarter as we continue to work to drive efficiencies and automation. Net interest income for the quarter was over $1.4 billion and increased 2% sequentially and net interest margin improved 2 basis points. Increased yields on new loan production were the primary driver of this improvement and more than offset the impact of increased interest bearing core deposit costs, which were well managed and up only 2 basis points compared to the prior quarter. With the Fed Funds rate cut at the end of the quarter, in September, we experienced our first month over month decrease in interest bearing core deposit costs during this rate cycle. While total average portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially, we are seeing some signs of life. Loan production rebounded for both middle market and corporate banking with strong contributions from the Georgia and Chicago regions, as well as the energy and TMT verticals. For the commercial portfolio, average loans decreased 1% primarily due to increased paydowns and softness in revolver utilization, which declined 1% during the quarter to 35%. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were up 1% from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in indirect auto originations, which continued to be a significant contributor to our fixed rate asset repricing. During the quarter, we saw a 200 basis points of pickup on the front book, back book repricing in this portfolio. Diving further into deposits. Average core deposits were up 1% sequentially, driven by higher money market balances, offset by a decrease in savings and CDs. This core deposit balance performance combined with our well timed long-term debt issuance during the quarter has allowed us to pay down higher cost short-term wholesale borrowings. As a result, our rates paid on total interest bearing liabilities decreased 1 basis point sequentially. Our current focus remains on prudently managing deposit costs as we have officially entered the rate cutting cycle. Since mid-2023, we have been increasing our testing of price sensitivity in our deposit book to be well prepared for this phase of the cycle. We remain confident in our ability to manage liability costs to drive net interest income performance in the fourth quarter and beyond. Demand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits were 24% during the third quarter, down 1% from the prior quarter. This level is consistent with our expectations from July and we expect DDA mix to stay around 24% for the remainder of the year. By segment, average consumer and wealth deposits were stable sequentially, while commercial deposits increased 3%. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 132% and our loan to core deposit ratio was 71%, down 1% from the prior quarter. Moving on to fees. Excluding the impacts of the security gains and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter. As Tim mentioned, our commercial payments and wealth businesses delivered strong fee results with both achieving double-digit revenue growth over the prior year, driven by our sustained strategic organic growth investments in products and sales personnel. In commercial payments, revenue increased 10% as we continue to acquire new clients in traditional treasury management products, our managed service offerings and in Newline. In wealth, our AUM increased to $69 billion up 21% over the prior year, driven by strong inflows from Fifth Third Wealth Advisors and market performance. Fees were $163 million this quarter were a record high led by strong transactional activity at Fifth Third Securities and the fee benefit from the AUM growth. Our capital markets business rebounded this quarter as bond issuance and trading, as well as rate hedging activities picked up. Fees grew 9% over the prior year, also led by our debt capital markets business. The security gains of $10 million were from the mark-to-market impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which is more than offset in compensation expense. Moving to expenses, excluding these items noted on Page 2 of our release, our adjusted non-interest expense was up 3% from the year ago quarter and increased 2% sequentially, primarily due to increases in performance based compensation due to the strong fee generation, the impact of the previously mentioned non-qualified deferred compensation mark-to-market, and continued investments in technology, branches, and sales personnel. Shifting to credit, the net charge-off ratio was 48 basis points, slightly better than our expectations from early September and down 1 basis point sequentially. Commercial charge-offs were 40 basis points, down 5 basis points sequentially and consumer charge-offs were 62 basis points, up 5 basis points from a seasonally low second quarter. Early stage delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased 2 basis points to 24 basis points, which remain near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade. NPAs increased $82 million during the quarter and the NPA ratio increased 7 basis points to 62 basis points, in line with our 10 year average and remains below the peer median level. Commercial NPAs increased $60 million from the prior quarter. Within our C&I portfolio, NPAs increased $20 million due to increased inflow activity, which given the nature of the commercial business will be uneven from quarter-to-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, C&I NPAs are down $7 million. Our CRE portfolio continues to perform well with no net charge-offs during the quarter and an NPA ratio of only 46 basis points, the increase in our commercial mortgage NPAs is related to a single senior living credit in our owner occupied portfolio. Consumer NPAs increased to $20 million from the prior quarter. Approximately half of this increase was driven by a recent change in policy related to our consumer nonaccrual processes to better align our policies across asset classes and primarily impacted our return to accrual timing for loans that are paying in full and current. Overall, we are not seeing any broad credit weakening across industries or geographies. From a credit perspective, we do not expect Hurricane Helene to have a material impact on losses and we are continuing to assess the impact of Hurricane Milton. Our ACL coverage ratio increased 1 basis point to 2.09% and included an $18 million reserve bill. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Moving to capital, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.8%, significantly exceeding our buffered minimum of 7.7%, reflecting strong capital levels. Our pro-forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the securities portfolio is 8.7%. We expect continued improvement in the unrealized losses in our securities portfolio, given that 59% of the AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked out securities, which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. Assuming the forward curve is realized, approximately 24% of the AOCI related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025, increasing tangible book value per share by 6% before considering any future earnings. 61% of the securities related AOCI should accrete back to equity by the end of 2028. During the quarter, we completed $200 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 4.9 million shares. As we assess our capital priorities, we continue to believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level. Moving to our current outlook, we anticipate continued growth in NII and NIM during the Q4, with NII up 1% sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower deposit rates and the continued benefit of fixed rate asset repricing, partially offset by the decrease in yield from our floating rate loan portfolio. This outlook assumes a 25 basis point cut in November and a 50 basis point cut in December. We would not expect any change to this outlook if fewer rate cuts were to occur. We expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% from the third quarter, with middle market and auto production offsetting mix demand in other asset classes. Fourth quarter adjusted noninterest income is anticipated to rise 3% to 4% compared to the strong Q3, largely due to a continued rebound in capital markets revenue and continued growth in commercial payments. Additionally, we expect fourth quarter TRA revenue to be $10 million down from $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter total adjusted noninterest expenses are expected to be stable compared to the third quarter as the increases in revenue-based compensation and the investments in branches and technology are largely offset by efficiencies achieved in other areas. Fourth quarter net charge-offs are projected to be similar or slightly down from the third quarter. Given the expected increase in loans during the fourth quarter, we anticipate an ACL build of $20 million to $40 million assuming no major change to the economic outlook. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis, and our PPNR guidance for the full year remains in line with our guidance from back in January. Our net interest income trajectory exiting the year continues to position us for record results in 2025, assuming no major economic or interest rate outlook changes. Finally, moving to capital. With our consistent and strong earnings, we now expect to increase our share repurchases in the fourth quarter to $300 million with potential further repurchases depending on the level of loan growth throughout the quarter. In summary, with our well positioned balance sheet, growing revenue streams and disciplined expense and credit risk management, we are set to generate strong and stable capital accretion, top quartile profitability and long-term value for shareholders, customers, communities and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call up for Q&A. Yeah. Absolutely. We continue to feel really good about the trajectory of the NII as well as the performance on the deposit front. As you know, we've spent a lot of time being prepared for this point in the cycle and things are playing out basically as we expected. When we look at both our results and peer results, the natural transition that you would expect is broker deposits, wholesale funding borrowings to start to come down. That's what we're seeing at the same play out. And then also then to start to see when that has been fully realized that movement in the beta. And that's exactly what we're seeing from us and the competition. For us, $35 billion of the index deposits, we were able to get the beta out of those as expected. To date, we're about in the mid-40s in terms of the betas that we've achieved since the 50 basis point rate cut. And we still have $13 billion, $14 billion of CDs that will be approaching maturities, about 75% of our CD portfolio matures between now and end of first quarter, as well as some additional promos that we'll see maturities on, and we'll continue to grind through the deposit costs in other areas of the book. So continue to feel really good about that as the trajectory plays out. And then the fixed rate asset repricing, that benefit continues to be a sequential tailwind for us and that's going to continue into the fourth quarter of next year. And that will be a big driver of the increase in NII from here. Yeah. We are seeing some more activity there. We don't need, we don't need heroic loan growth to deliver record NII. The -- how the NII is delivered is obviously going to be very environment dependent. So shape of the curve is going to matter. We do expect to start to see some tailwinds on the loan growth side given what we've seen. The decreases from a commercial perspective, we think for the most part are behind us and we're seeing nice tailwinds in the consumer businesses that will be a big driver of how we transition into a loan growth from here. So we would like to see a little bit of loan growth. That certainly would be helpful in terms of delivering that record NII, but we feel good about the trajectory from here. Yes. Obviously, Gerard, we'll give more detail in next year on 2025. But if we can actually get a little bit more steepness in the curve, get the inversion out of the curve, that is very powerful for us from an NII perspective from here, because we would expect to see some relief on the liability side of the balance sheet. We do continue to have confidence that we will get cost out. And the thing that's not reflected in our forward guidance right now is an assumption that we're going to be able to maintain the fixed rate asset spreads. We do assume that there is compression as rates come down. And if we were to get to a normal shaped curve, there would be even more benefit then from the fixed rate asset we're pricing. And we would also have a little bit of opportunity to get some a little bit more economics out of duration in the security portfolio and then the swap portfolio over time. So that'd be a really productive environment for us. And we would see it over time, you would see a significant expansion of your net. Yeah. Our target right now in normalized environments, we like being in, say a 35% to 45% range from a dividend payout ratio perspective. The share buyback ultimately is driven by how much capacity we have relative to organic growth, because we do -- our preference would be to continue to invest on the organic front when we see good risk adjusted returns. And then with what's left, we manage capital via the share buybacks. Continue to feel good with the capital generation that we've been seeing that $200 million or $300 million of share buybacks feel about the right level. This quarter, we saw a little bit of benefit in RWA, which allows us to potentially have a little bit more share buyback. But with some loan growth coming in next year, hopefully, we'll be talking about a little bit lower buyback over time just because we've got a lot more organic opportunities to invest in. Yeah. Thanks, Mike. The paydowns for the quarter were around, say, $900 million a bit elevated from what we would typically see in some of the portfolios, as well as we had a utilization headwind of about 1%, because we did see the revolver utilization move down. That 1% decrease is another say $800 million. So the combination of those two were a decent driver ultimately from an overall average loan growth and in the period loan growth perspective. We're not expecting continued pressures at this point and we've seen utilization stabilize in the second half of the quarter and in the beginning of this quarter. So that doesn't feel like a headwind for us right now. The capital markets activity, obviously, it was a very robust capital markets activity in the second quarter compared to third quarter, we do think that fed into some of the pay down behaviors that we're seeing. But from here, we're expecting to get back to a little bit more normalized level and we think that helps then with loan growth from here. Yes, I mean, we gave average loan growth guide, obviously of up 1% sequentially. We'll get into 2025 in more detail next year. But in general, our objective would be to grow with the market plus a point or 2. Historically, the banking industry grows in line with GDP, nominal GDP type levels. And if we get back to that kind of environment and the industry gets back to overall aggregate growth, we would expect to be in line, if not outperforming the industry. And Ebrahim, it's Bryan. We put a little bit of detail on the PIC portfolio on Slide 24 of our slide. Yeah, $31 billion portfolio, it's down 11% year-over-year. So we are still facing lapping some of that headwind. I think you're going to continue to see some runoff, but we do think you're getting back to the point where you'll start to see some production coming in and offsetting it. It may not be exactly at the floor, but the decreases should definitely be moderating. Yes. I mean, we feel really good, [indiscernible] about the earnings trajectory of the company. And we think given that, we feel like our stock is continues to be a good bargain for us and we think it's a good investment for us from a corporate perspective. We look at a couple of things on that front. We're generating a lot of capital every quarter. And so that actually gives us the ability to be very dynamic with our capital allocation decisions. We have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to generate the capital necessary for organic growth. And then if we wanted to slow down capital distribution via share buybacks because we see more opportunity or we need to get more defensive, we would be able to do that. Another component is just when you think about our industry and the 10% cost of equity, sitting on excess capital is a high cost for our shareholders. And so being in a position as we are right now and being able to go ahead and make some decisions and deploy at a time where we continue to feel really positive about our trajectory as a company and knowing that we have the flexibility with the income profile and the stability that we have going forward to degenerate the capital when we would need to, and if we think different opportunities would present themselves. That's really the thought process on how we're thinking about capital allocation from here. Yeah. I mean, that is -- that is obviously a very interesting question. The shape of the curve is going to matter a lot, in that scenario as well. When we think about the when we think about the pacing of how the beta will come through, like you said, it is the commercial deposits will come through very quickly. The retail takes a little bit longer. The two primary drivers for us on that, it's the guarantee periods on the promotional offerings, which tend to be between say 45 and 90 days. And then it's the maturities of your CD portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, 75% of our CDs will mature between now and the end of first quarter. So to get the rest of the beta and get to that kind of cumulative beta that we have been targeting where high 50s kind of beta, For us, it will take about 2 quarters because the CD repricing is going to be a component of that now that that's $13 billion in book. From a natural level perspective, I think that is really tough to estimate. I mean, we're sitting here, at peak rates, we were at a 2.99-ish, was our peak interest bearing core deposit cost versus 5.50 Fed Funds level. We would expect to see a little bit of compression potentially in that spread. But being able to maintain 150 to 200 basis points of deposit spread seems like a potentially achievable scenario. One big question on that, Eric, another one that would obviously be a big question which is where, you have those demand through the loan growth change over time. And if you got -- if you've done a decent curve shape back to Gerard's question and you've got opportunities for loan growth. You're going to have some opportunities to be a little bit more competitive to raise more deposits and ultimately drive better NII. And at the end of the day, we're not managing the deposit betas, we're managing the NII and profitability trajectory and those are the decisions and the trade-offs we'll make. You'll see some people that try to do some negotiations on deposit costs. Those are things that always occur, but those are things that we are typically able to manage fairly well. The reality is you get paid a better spread as a depository on an index deposit because you're taking the risk ultimately on market movements. Whereas on a managed account, it's typically a wider spread because we have more ability to manage it. So we it's something that we've had good experience with behaving, controlling it through our pricing and through our discipline around that process. We're not overly concerned about reverse migration from index back into managed rate being a headwind from a beta perspective. Yeah. I mean, that's, again, it's another tough one. Because what does the environment look like? What does the shape of the curve look like out in the future? If you just take the cash position that we're holding today, we're at we're north of $20 billion of cash. We're up almost $9 billion year-over-year. Every $1 billion of excess cash that we're holding is a basis point to have on NIM. So just getting $10 billion out over the next year and hopefully having some opportunities to deploy that into the loan portfolio that could add 15 to 20 basis points to our NIM alone. We're going to see NIM growth from here just with the continued repricing of the portfolio. From a fixed rate asset perspective, that will continue to take that just takes a little bit more time to play out. But if you get a little bit of relief on the front end, a more normalized curve, it's front and down, I mean, it's not unreasonable to think we could be talking about getting back to what was 315 to 325 NIM in a reasonable time horizon. Lower interest rates, as long as that comes along with a, normalization of the yield curve that would certainly be very helpful to returns over time. A low flat curve is a challenging environment for the banking system. And Mike, we are accelerating the investments, as Tim mentioned, on improving strategies. It's part of why we're going from almost 20 to 30 branch builds a year to 50 plus branch builds a year. So we have more confidence that gives us point of view of an area we want to invest in. And then the other limiter for us is always going to be the analysts that are worried about positive operating leverage because that's the trade-off we care about as well."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Audra and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2024 Fifth Third Bancorp Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Matt Curoe. Please go ahead.\nMatt Curoe : Good morning everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning our chairman, CEO, and President, Tim Spence, and CFO, Bryan Preston will provide an overview of our second quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of July 19, 2024, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\nTim Spence : Thanks, Matt and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe great banks distinguish themselves, not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather how they navigate challenging ones. In that context, I am very pleased with how we are executing as a company and what continues to be an uncertain economic and interest rate backdrop. Our focus on stability, profitability, and growth in that order have produced consistent predictable results and strong profitability since the bank failures last spring and we remain confident in our ability to deliver PPNR and earnings outcomes in-line with or better than our original expectations for the full year in 2024. This morning we reported earnings per share of $0.81 or $0.86 excluding certain items outlined on Page 2 of the release, which exceeded the guidance we provided in our first quarter earnings call. Our resilient balance sheet, diversified fee revenues, and expense discipline continued to produce strong profitability. Our adjusted return on tangible common equity of 15.1% and adjusted return on assets of 1.22% over the last 12 months rank as the best of all peers who have reported so far and the most stable when compared to the same period last year. The second quarter marked the first sequential growth in NII since 2022 and NIM improved for the second consecutive quarter. That trajectory, along with the benefits we are seeing from strategic investments and continued expense discipline should allow us to return to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter of this year and carry over into next year. Strategically, our investments in the southeast and middle market expansion markets, in commercial payments, and in wealth and asset management, continue to produce strong growth and market share gains. We grew consumer households by 3% year-over-year in the second quarter, punctuated by 6% growth in our southeast markets. Middle market loan production and new quality relationships were the strongest in Indiana, the Carolinas, Texas, and California. In our industry verticals, production was strongest where federal government spending has had an outsized benefit, including in aerospace and defense contractors and with manufacturing and infrastructure construction firms. Commercial payments revenue grew 12% year-over-year, driven by our investments in our software enabled managed services and Newline our embedded payments business. Commercial payments is a scale business for us. In the first half of 2024 alone, we processed more than $8 trillion in volume. Nearly half of all new treasury management relationships we added year-to-date were payments-led and have no credit extended. Wealth and asset management fee revenues grew 11% year-over-year, and total assets under management grew to $65 billion, a 10% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Fifth Third Securities, the private bank, and Fifth Third Wealth Advisors, the RIA platform we launched in 2022, all generated strong performance. Digital Banker and Global Private Banker recognized us again as the best private bank for high net worth clients for the third consecutive year. Turning to capital, our strong profitability allowed us to resume share repurchases during the quarter while also increasing our CET1 ratio to 10.6%. The Federal Reserve stress test results highlighted our strong capital levels, consistent profitability, and simple yet well-diversified business model. Importantly, we maintain the capacity to increase our dividend, support organic growth, and continue share repurchases. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we remain cautious due to the wide range of potential economic and geopolitical scenarios that could unfold. As a result, we will remain disciplined and will not chase loan growth at the expense of our return targets. We'll continue to maintain flexibility by staying liquid, neutrally positioned, and broadly diversified, while investing in the long-term. Before I hand it over to Bryan to provide additional details on our second quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, I want to express my gratitude to our employees for the consistent hard work, innovation, and passion for service that you bring to our customers. This morning, your money named us the best super regional bank in the US, as part of their 2024 awards for excellence. I'm honored to be part of your team. With that, Bryan over to you.\nBryan Preston : Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Our second quarter results were strong, reflecting our balance sheet strength, diversified revenue streams, and disciplined approach to expense and credit risk management. For more than a year, we have emphasized the importance of maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility in an uncertain economic and interest rate environment. This approach has proven effective as the market's expectations on rate cuts, changed dramatically from the start of 2024. Despite this change in rate outlook, our NII has been consistent with the performance trajectory we discussed back in December, increasing sequentially during the second quarter from the first quarter bottoming, and NIM has increased for two consecutive quarters from the fourth quarter low. Additionally, our full year 2024 NII outlook remains unchanged. As Tim mentioned, our profitability remained strong and stable, which allowed us to resume share repurchases early and grow our CET1 ratio to 10.6% up 13 basis points. As noted on Page 2 of our earnings release, our reported results were impacted by certain items including the valuation of the visa total return swap, an update to the FDIC special assessment, and the impact of certain legal settlements and customer remediations. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net interest income for the quarter increased 1% from the prior quarter to $1.4 billion. And adjusted net interest margin improved 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter. Increased yields on new loan production contributed to this improvement and offset the impact of increased interest bearing core deposit costs, which were well-managed and increased only 4 basis points compared to the prior quarter. While total average portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially, we continue to benefit from fixed rate asset repricing, led by our indirect auto business. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially, primarily reflecting the increase in indirect auto originations, offset by a decrease in other consumer loan balances. Average commercial portfolio loans decreased 1%, due to lower demand from corporate banking borrowers. Period end commercial revolver utilization remained at 36% consistent with the prior quarter. Middle market loan production increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, driven by strong performance in our southeast markets, primarily in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida, as well as continued success in Indiana, Texas, and California. The pipeline for the second half of the year is improving, and we are continuing to invest in our middle market banking teams, including our recently announced expansion in the Alabama market. However, we remain cautious on commercial loan growth expectations in the second half of the year, as customer demand for credit remains muted. Our investment in analytics continues to help us optimize deposit outcomes, demonstrated by our strong deposit growth in 2023 and prudent management of deposit costs in 2024. Our strong track record of liquidity management, combined with data-driven analytics, will aid in maintaining pricing discipline and optimizing liability costs. Average core deposits were flat sequentially, driven by higher CD and consumer savings and money market balances, offset by lower interest checking and commercial demand balances. Our current focus remains on prudently managing deposit costs with the Fed on hold and preparing for potential rate cuts later this year. By segment, average consumer deposits increased 2% sequentially while both commercial and wealth deposits decreased 2%. The Southeast branch investments are driving both strong household growth and granular insured deposits. Demand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits were 25% as of the end of the second quarter, stable with the prior quarter, as migration of DDA balances continued to slow. Consistent with our prior expectations for a higher for longer rate environment, we expect DDA mix to fall below 25% during the third quarter and stay around 24% for the remainder of the year. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 137% and our loan to core deposit ratio with 72%. We are well-positioned to continue to grow net interest income and our balance sheet provides flexibility to navigate the evolving economic and interest rate conditions. Moving on to fees. Excluding the impacts of security gains and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income decreased $32 million or 4% compared to the year ago quarter. This year-over-year decrease is attributable to a $34 million private equity gain recognized in the second quarter of 2023. Within our businesses, commercial payments and wealth and asset management fees continue to deliver strong results, both achieving double-digit revenue growth over the prior year, driven by our continued strategic growth investments in products and sales personnel. These areas are not only fast growing but are sizable contributors to fee income and profitability today given our strength and scale in these businesses. We expect these businesses to continue to deliver strong revenue growth. Our market-sensitive businesses such as mortgage and commercial customer hedging have been impacted by the higher rate environment, the reduced demand for credit, and reduced market volatility. The combined impact for these businesses was a $20 million decrease versus the prior year. Leasing business revenue was down $9 million versus the prior year due to our decision to de-emphasize operating leases, but it is offset by a $9 million decrease in leasing business expense. The securities gains of $3 million reflected the mark-to-market impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which is more than offset in compensation expense. While we have continued to invest in strategic growth initiatives and technology, we managed our adjusted non-interest expense flat to the year-ago quarter due to our focus on expense discipline and the ongoing benefits from the process automation efforts. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 7% sequentially, primarily due to seasonal items during the first quarter related to compensation awards and payroll taxes. Moving to credit, consistent with our guidance, the net charge-off ratio was 49 basis points, up 11 basis points sequentially, driven by two commercial credits for which we had previously established specific reserves. Consumer charge-offs were 57 basis points, a reduction of 10 basis points sequentially, primarily due to improvement in our indirect consumer-secured portfolio. Other credit metrics showed strong sequential improvement with the ratio of early-stage delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreasing 3 basis points to 26 basis points, which is near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade. NPAs decreased by $100 million, or 13% during the quarter, and the NPA ratio decreased 9 basis points to [55] (ph) basis points. In commercial, our credit discipline is grounded in generating and maintaining granular, high-quality relationships and by managing concentration risks to any asset class, region, or industry. We continue to see no material signs of broad-based industry or geographic weakness and believe potential future commercial credit losses will be idiosyncratic in nature. In consumer, our focus remains on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures. We have maintained our conservative underwriting policies and will continue to evaluate our positioning as economic conditions change. Our ACL coverage ratio decreased 4 basis points to 2.08% and included a $47 million reserve release, driven by the previously mentioned specific reserves. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Moving to capital, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.6%, significantly exceeding our new buffered minimum of 7.7%, reflecting strong capital levels. As we assess our capital priorities, we believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level. During the quarter, we completed $125 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 3.5 million shares. Our pro forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the securities portfolio, is 8.0%. We expect continued improvement in the unrealized securities losses in our portfolio, given that 61% of the AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked-out securities, which provide the high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. Assuming the forward curve is realized, approximately 26% of the AOCI related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025, increasing tangible book value per share by 10%, before considering any future earnings. 62% of the securities-related AOCI will accrete back to equity by the end of 2028. Moving to our current outlook. While the rate environment and customer credit demand have played out differently than we were expecting at the start of the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver PPNR and earnings outcomes in-line with or better than our original expectations for the full year. We expect full-year NII to decrease 2% to 4% consistent with our guidance from January. This outlook assumes the forward curve as of early July, which projected two rate cuts in the second half of the year, September and December. We also believe we can deliver this NII outcome with no interest rate cuts and no loan growth in the second half of 2024. Given the year-to-date trends in customer activity, we now expect full-year average total loans to be down 3% compared to 2023. Average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 are expected to be stable to up 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, with similar performance in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. Customer demand is the primary driver of this change, given the interest rate environment and other economic uncertainties. If there's more economic optimism in the second half of the year, we would expect to see loan growth in-line or better than market growth. We are forecasting fourth quarter average core deposit growth of 2% to 3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Our forecast also assumes commercial revolver utilization and our cash and other short-term investments remain relatively stable throughout the remainder of 2024. We expect full-year adjusted non-interest income to be stable to down 1% in 2024, reflecting the impact of weaker than previously expected credit demand and customer hedging activities. We expect strong growth in commercial payments and wealth and asset management revenue to continue. In response to this expectation of lower customer activity in the second half. We expect to manage full year adjusted non-interest expense stable to 2023 levels. Our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid-single digits and sales additions in middle market, commercial payments, and wealth. We will open 30 to 35 new branches in our higher growth markets and have already closed a similar number of branches in 2024. Our outlook still projects an efficiency ratio of around 57% for the full year. For full year 2024, the net charge-off outlook remains in the 35 to 45 basis points range. While we expect to resume provision builds in connection with loan growth and mix in the second half of 2024, we expect the second half build to be less than the first half of 2024 release. Therefore, we expect full-year provision to be a 0 to $10 million release, assuming no change to credit quality of the portfolio or projected economic conditions. Moving to our quarterly outlook, we expect NII and NIM growth to continue in both the third and fourth quarter. We expect NII in the third quarter to be up 2% sequentially, reflecting the impact of slowing deposit cost pressures and the continued benefit of our fixed rate asset repricing. Our current outlook assumes interest-bearing core deposit costs, which were 295 basis points in the second quarter of 2024, to increase just 4 basis points sequentially if we see no rate cuts. We expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% from the second quarter. We expect modest middle market, auto, and solar production to offset continued low credit demand from corporate banking customers. We expect third quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 1% to 2% compared to the second quarter, largely reflecting strength in commercial payments and wealth and asset management and a modest increase in commercial banking revenue. We expect third quarter total adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 1% compared to the second quarter, due to the impact of the previously discussed investments in branches, technology, and sales personnel. Third quarter net charge-offs are projected to be in the 40 basis points to 45 basis point range. As mentioned in the [four-year] (ph) outlook, loan growth and mix are expected to drive a provision build, which should be around $25 million in the third quarter, assuming no change to the economic outlook. The trajectory of our income statement performance should deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter 2024 and a net interest income exit rate for the year that positions us for record results in 2025, assuming no major economic or interest rate outlook changes. Finally, moving to capital. With our consistent and strong earnings, we expect to execute share repurchases of $200 million per quarter in the second half of 2024, assuming a stable economic and credit outlook and capital rules that are no worse than the current NPR. In summary, with our well-positioned balance sheet, disciplined expense and credit risk management, and diversified revenue streams, we are positioned to generate sustained, top quartile profitability and deliver long-term value for our shareholders, customers, communities, and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call up for Q&A.\nMatt Curoe : Thanks, Bryan. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala at Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning.\nTim Spence: Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hi Tim. Maybe first question For Bryan, just looking at Slide 49 in the deck around rate sensitivity, it implies that rate cuts should benefit NII. So you talked about the second half guide, I think as we think about 2025. But just talk to us around the comfort level. I think it says 75% to 80% effective betas on the downside. Just talk to us in terms of the deposit beta assumptions. What's contractual within your deposit mix that should repriced lower, and is it fair to assume that rate cuts are positive for Fifth Third?\nBryan Preston: Thank you, Ebrahim. We certainly believe that rate cuts are positive for Fifth Third\u2019s. If you look at slide 42, we actually give a little bit more detail on the mix of the interest-bearing deposit book. 64% of our book right now would be classified in kind of the higher beta categories. This represents our index deposits, which are up to $35 billion. The CDs that we have in place, we've done a nice job of managing the maturity of the CD bucket so that most of our CDs will mature by the end of the year. That's another $14 billion of balances and our promotional balances as well. So we have a lot of captions where within that book that we are going to be able to reprice down. Overall, that's about 64% of the deposits. We certainly have some lower rate buckets still that we think the betas are effectively zero. We have a high amount of confidence though that we're going to be able to get cost out and be able to manage. We really only need to be in a kind of mid-50s to low-60s beta to be able to be neutral to liability sensitive and we're confident we can deliver that.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's clear. And I guess maybe one for you, Tim. I think you put it back in terms of your loan growth much earlier this cycle. As you think about with creditors, your comments on reserve outlook, is it all clear if you get rate cuts, do you just worry less about something really bad happening systemically on credit quality for Fifth Third? And then the other side of that is what's the trigger that leads to that growth? I heard you say you should have about average loan growth if things pick up. What's the catalyst we should be working for? Thanks.\nTim Spence: Yeah. Good question. I think that's the million dollar question for the industry right there. There's no question that if we see some relief on rates, it is a positive, both for loan demand and for credit quality. Jamie Leonard, and I have been out in several of the markets this quarter doing market visits, and we've been running a straw poll on where rates need to be before activity picks up. And the wisdom of the crowds, at least inside Fifth Third at the moment is about 4.5% the Meridian, where we'll see a pickup in more activity. That said, while rates would be constructive, I think, I continue always to worry about the broader macro issues. We've got land wars and two volatile regions in the US right now. We have an election that's upcoming. We have massive fiscal deficits in the US. We have a ton of Treasury Issuance that's going to be required to reload the TGA at some point here, and they're going to have to turn that out, and that's going to put pressure on the long-end of the curve. And while I think we have some stability here, I'm uncomfortable with the level of support that the federal government is having to provide to keep GDP growth at where it is at the moment. I mean, the jobs numbers, this most recent batch, unless I'm mistaken, a third of the new jobs that were created, were created by the government. When we look at our footprint and we look at where the activity is, where there's federal stimulus, we're seeing robust activity everywhere else. We've got a client in Tennessee tell us that the current environment was quote, half speed ahead, right. So we will continue to be mindful about that. I'm a believer that in uncertain environments, you have to focus on getting growth from the businesses that you know and the strategies that are proven. You're not going to see us stretching into categories we don't know or doing things that we're uncomfortable with from a credit perspective and where we have to bet on a favorable macro to bail us out in terms of getting repaid.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's great, color. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Siefers at Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Let's see -- actually, Bryan, I was hoping you could speak a little bit about the fee trajectory. You discussed sort of the second quarter softness a month or so ago, feels like it might persist a bit into the third quarter, but I imagine we are still feeling like that'll rebound. Just hoping you could maybe share some thoughts on sort of when and how that ends up looking. You know, there's just a little more color on the fee trajectory, please.\nBryan Preston: Yeah, absolutely, Scott. You know, the second to third quarter increase, we're talking about not too aggressive of a fee growth perspective. We continue to expect continued performance out of our wealth and asset management business, as well as commercial payments. Payments has been taken along at $3 million to $4 million a quarter increases, and we expect that to continue and feel really good about it. We're also going to see some seasonal impacts actually come out associated with our mortgage business. We've benefited a lot from the servicing portfolio, all the servicing ads that we did right at the end of the low rate cycle has benefited us and generated a lot of great income, but there is a seasonal headwind, 1Q to 2Q that we felt that was about $7 million. That's not going to repeat. So we're set up really well for that 2Q to 3Q growth that we've laid out. And then in the fourth quarter, we'll get some additional seasonal benefit out of the MSR. The payments and card spend will continue to pick up, especially the seasonal card spending consumer. We'll get the $10 million TRA benefit. And then we always see some pickup in both commercial banking and leasing in the fourth quarter that should both generate some additional income as well. That gets us to that little bit higher growth rate trajectory that you could see that's implied throughout in 3Q and 4Q.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Okay, good. And then maybe switching gears just a second, something you might be able to sort of put into context, the CFPB news from earlier this month, that just based on my read, kind of felt like we closed the book on the account issues from a few years ago, which is good. But then there were the auto-related items. So I know there are just sort of questions floating out there about sort of cost to comply, cost to remediate, what's within the existing outlook. Can you maybe address those kind of broadly, please?\nTim Spence: Yeah, Scott, it's Tim. I'm happy to do that. And I think you hit on the most important thing here, which is the best thing for you to do is focus on the statements of fact as opposed to the press releases on this one. I think that by the Bureau's own statements of fact here, these were old issues. So one was nearly five years old, the other was nearly 10 years old respectively. There are things that we identified and reported. And in case of auto, we completely canceled the program before they ever even started their investigation. And I think while of course, we always take anything that impacts customers seriously, Fifth Third the size of the fines, which are a fraction of what you've seen in other places, probably speak for themselves in terms of the limited scope of the issues here. We elected to close these things out because given the fact that they were small in the past, it just didn't make sense to continue to spend more money litigating than it was going to spend to settle. So, you know, we put them in the rearview mirror. We have the one-time expense this quarter, and that's where it is going to stay. You shouldn't expect any incremental ongoing expense because these are issues that are so old, anything that needed to be done was already done from an ongoing [operational perspective] (ph).\nScott Siefers: Okay, wonderful. Good. Thank you for taking the questions.\nTim Spence: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Mayo at Wells Fargo.\nTim Spence: Hi Mike.\nMike Mayo: I [might want to requeue] (ph).\nOperator: We'll go next to Ken Usdin at Jefferies.\nKen Usdin: Hey, good morning, guys. On the deposit side, I heard your comment about 4 basis points increase in 3Q with no cuts. And I'm just wondering, you talked about the mid-50s to 60 downside beta. Can you give us a little bit of context on how that starts and then how that moves forward? And you talked about having a two-thirds of your deposit-based high beta, but just wondering like how you kind of expect some of the pricing stuff you've been doing to grow deposits in the southeast to juxtapose against that downside beta. Thanks.\nBryan Preston: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Ken. Great question. You know, what we would tell you is that what it will create is, it will create some opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive on some of the rate cuts associated with the CDs and the promo portfolios that we've seen. Historically, when we've navigated through these down rate cycles, those first couple cuts on the consumer side do have a pretty decent impact on customer mentality and sentiment and your ability to create some sticky balances. We've been through this a few times now where we've seen the ability to convert those balances into a lower rate balance and cause them to stick around. And on the other side of that, the commercial balances, in particular the index balances, those are immediate impacts and will just move with the market. We have really no concern around that index strategy. It's another one that we've executed in prior cycles. I think we've done a nice job of kind of navigating and managing those balances up in those index portfolios as we've reached the grades. It gives us a lot of confidence in the ability to very quickly get those costs out.\nKen Usdin: Okay, got it. And then just calling up on your comments about record [25 versus 23] (ph) NII, can you talk just about how much of that do you expect to be growth related and how much of that you expect to be just the outcome of rate scenarios?\nBryan Preston: I would actually tell you that most of it is just the natural transition of the balance sheet in the business today. I think our NII story is actually pretty simple. Right now it's the continued fixed rate asset pricing and slowing deposit cost. And if you look at just the trends that we're laying out, you know, we're adding about $8 million a quarter right now, just on the natural repricing of the existing balance sheet. And you think with, we've talked a lot about $4 billion to fixed rate asset repricing. That's happening at about 200 basis points. That's $20 million a quarter. And then the deposit costs up 4 bps this quarter on $120 billion interest bearing book [versus 12] (ph) of incremental costs to take us down to that net 8. We get a little bit of continued slowing on deposit cost side. That can approach $10 million, $15 million, $20 million a quarter. Day count, we're going to pick up $10 million here in the third quarter. And then that sets us up for an exit rate where if you just take the 4 times the fourth quarter math, you're right around what is our record NII of [$58 million, $52 million] (ph). Throw on a little earning asset or loan growth on top of that and the path is there for us. That's what gives us confidence. The big wild card, like we always talk about, is just how competitive deposit pricing ultimately ends up being. But if we start to see rate cuts, we would expect to see some decent relief on the liability side.\nTim Spence: Yeah, Ken, it's Tim. We talked a while ago, and maybe we haven't been doing enough of this recently, but about the power of having these intermediate duration fixed rate loan origination platforms was, by that I really mean you think about provide, you think about the auto business, you think about dividends. Like if you just look at the yields on the indirect auto and specialty business year-over-year, we've added almost 100 basis points to the yield in the portfolio. And if you look at the solar product, it's north of 200 basis points that we have been able to add year-over-year. And that just speaks to the power of both the one, the sort of origination capacity that exists there that we can dial up in an environment where spreads widen and it makes sense for us to do it. And two, the fact that these are asset classes that are going to reprice a lot faster than the 3% mortgages that were originated at the low point in the rate cycle and that are going to persist much longer than the jumbo mortgages and the other fixed rate product that you see being available to banks out in the market today, which are all likely to prepay if we get any sort of meaningful movement out of the Fed. So that will be an important part of the way that we continue to drive outcomes, even in an environment where you don't get a meaningful improvement in loan demand across the industry.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Thank you for that color.\nOperator: We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy at RBC.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Tim. Hi, Bryan.\nTim Spence: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Tim, Bryan, can you give us a little color? On slide 29, the transfers to non-accrual status of loans fell nicely this quarter and when you go back you know you give it -- give us the data back to the second quarter of 2023, and it's a meaningful drop from those levels. Any color that you can give us on what led to that drop? And then second, and I apologize if you addressed this already, on the commercial loan charge-off number that jumped in the quarter, were there any specific idiosyncratic loans that caused that to happen?\nGreg Schroeck: Gerard, hey it's Greg. Great question. So I'll answer the second one first. So yeah we had the two names that Bryan mentioned that were two different industries. We're not seeing any thematic concerning trends emerging out of the [technical difficulty] geographically by [technical difficulty]. But we've talked about lumpiness on the commercial side. And that's what we experienced this quarter. We're normalizing off very low loss rates, and so when we have one or two of these episodic events, they're going to get highlighted, and that's what we saw. But as Bryan mentioned, they were not a surprise. We had reserves against those two loans, and so we think we're through those. The overall credit metrics remain really solid. Our delinquencies were down quarter-over-quarter. The NPAs that you referred to were down 13%, quarter-over-quarter at 55 basis points. That's below our 10-year average. We're up 1 basis point year-over-year on NPAs, and it's really across the Board. We had about $80 million in commercial losses this quarter, but we are down almost $100 million. So we are working the portfolio very hard. We're working out of some of the NPA loans without experiencing the loss rates, but it's really across the board. What we're not seeing the NPAs are in the commercial real estate portfolio. We had about $3 million in NPAs there. So that portfolio continues to perform very, very well. It had virtually no delinquencies in that portfolio. So it's really across the board where we're seeing the improvement in our NPA numbers. Had a little bit on the consumer side, both sides have been driven on the commercial side.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good, thank you for the color. And then second, when you look at your Shared National Credit portfolio and you give us good details, once again on the Slide 25, the financial services slice of that portfolio, how much, if any -- is in sectors that is considered private equity or private credit? Because as we all know, it seems like the banking industry has been de-risked since the financial crisis and the private equity, private credit side of the equation might be taking on more of that risk. Do you guys have many loans to the Blackstone\u2019s or the Carlisle\u2019s or any of those types of companies and where there might be indirect exposure to that industry?\nGreg Schroeck: Yeah, another great question. So we've got subscription lines to some of those type of companies, highly rated borrowers. But as you know, those are mostly predicated on and underwritten, overcollateralized to the LP Capital. But we're not in that leverage -- on leverage space. We're not active there. We've got a couple direct lending lines of credit. They're totaled about $30 million, so about [$15 million fee] (ph). So we're not active in that space.\nGerard Cassidy: Good, okay, good. Thank you again.\nGreg Schroeck: Thank you.\nTim Spence: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next to Bill Carache at Wolfe Research.\nBill Carache: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on your credit commentary and ask for your thoughts on the longer-term trajectory of charge-offs given what you're seeing in both consumer and commercial. Crystal clear on all the sources of uncertainty that you highlighted, Tim, but if we assume that the soft landing scenario materializes and think about the loss content implicit in your loan book today, would you expect Fifth Third\u2019s MCR rates to level off from here, drift a little bit higher, revert to 2019 levels. I know you can't give 2025 guidance, but any help on how you're thinking about that long-term trajectory would be super helpful.\nGreg Schroeck: Yeah, it's Greg again. So Yeah, certainly, as Tim mentioned, any kind of rate cut is going to help us from an overall asset quality. It will on the consumer side. It will on the commercial side. It takes a little while for those rate cuts to play through the portfolio. So as Bryan mentioned in his prepared remarks, we still feel good about the 40 basis points or 45 basis points for the rest of this year. Then we'll see how the rest of the marketplace plays out. But as I just mentioned in the previous question, still feel really good about the overall metrics of the portfolio. Our NPA rates is a good indicator of potential loss rates moving forward, and those numbers continue to come down and improve. And so I think even without rate increases, still feel really good about our portfolio, get a little bit of goodness from the rates and yeah, I think it certainly helps as we get into 2025.\nBill Carache: Thanks, That's helpful. And then separately, you talked about some of the variables impacting the curve. Can you discuss how a Fifth Third\u2019s position for either a flatter or a steeper yield curve environment?\nGreg Schroeck: Yeah, absolutely. You know, we're typically, our normal business is about two-thirds sensitive to the front end of the curve. You know, I will tell you with our current cash position, we're probably closer to 75% sensitive on the front end of the curve. So relief on the front end is part of what would be the big driver from an asset sensitivity perspective. And the interesting thing about how this environment could play out is we could potentially get some of that relief on the front end of the curve and still benefit from the fixed rate asset repricing that we're expecting over the next couple of years. Because what's rolling off right now is a lot of that loans that were originated in those periods of really low interest rates. So even if you see a little bit of lower rates on the longer-end of the curve, you would still have a nice pickup relative to the [prompt of back] (ph) with dynamic. So that front end relief and as Tim mentioned around our concerns around their -- concerns around continued treasury issuance, if that's the scenario that were to play out, it would be one that would be a nice situation from an NII perspective. But it would probably continue the longer-end of the curve could cause some additional challenges for the economy from a growth perspective.\nBill Carache: Understood. Very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.\nTim Spence: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Erika Najarian at UBS.\nErika Najarian: Hi.\nTim Spence: Hi, Erika.\nErika Najarian: Hey, just a few follow up questions. Your cash position was twice that of last year. You know, as we think about, obviously that makes you more sensitive to short rates coming down. How do we think about how you are managing that cash position from an interest rate standpoint versus an anticipation of liquidity rules coming standpoint? And maybe give us a sense of how much is there sort of supervisor encouragement today to keep, \u201cliquid liquidity\u201d as we anticipate new rules?\nBryan Preston: Yeah, I would tell you that we are very focused internally on maintaining plenty of liquidity to deal with any uncertainty associated with potential rules, as well as the market. So that has just been a big driver of our positioning and why we've done that. But the other thing that it allows for us, yes it is a good liquidity risk management tool, but it does allow us to have a little bit more confidence on the interest rate risk management side as well, because we can be more aggressive on our liability management actions because of that cash position. So it really is the combination of that liquidity and liability management benefits that we are focused on and why we continue to keep those levels that we have. As rates come down, and as we get through that environment and see stability in the market from a liquidity perspective, we really have an ability to take that down over time. As you pointed out, it was a big increase year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was a 20 basis point impact on our NIM. So, getting back to more normalized levels would be a nice trend for us from a NIM perspective.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And I'll follow up with that on the liability side later. So I wanted to squeeze in the second question, and this is for you Tim. Tim, I think that you and management and the board have done such a great job in terms of the makeover of Fifth Third and now investors, essentially take for granted and see you as a high quality bank among your peers. To that end, it seems like the CFPB stuff in terms of your response to Scott's question is in the rearview mirror. The one question I keep getting from investors is, are you still the proper owner for dividend? And it made sense in terms of when you did the deal and obviously solar is the future, but it's clearly something that is a product that's sold, not bought. And given all the litigation against you, it just doesn't feel on brand from a quality perspective in terms of how you've rebuilt Fifth Third\u2019s. So how are you thinking about, it's so small, but it comes up in conversations often, right? Like the impact to your stock, it feels like more than the impact to earning. So, love your thoughts here.\nTim Spence: Sure. So, just to make sure that I'm clear, and I know you were, But I mean, dividend has nothing to do with the CFPB. So those are two separate issues. Right, right. Okay. Yeah. look, on the dividend front, we are believers that the best way to get growth is to attach yourself to long-term secular trends. So the focus on the Southeast was to get the bank linked to the demographic migration that was going to support the growth in that market. The focus on commercial payments has been about attaching ourselves to this trend of digitization in general and in particular the intermediation of these legacy workflows with software. And in the case of dividend and what we've elected to do on the project finance on the commercial solar side of the equation. The focus is on both the diversification of energy sources with a focus on renewable, and I think in particular in the case of dividend, the need that we are going to have across the country to have more distributed power generation and storage, if we're going to avoid rolling brownouts and other sorts of issues that come from the fact that we have a very old energy infrastructure. And in particular now with the explosion in data centers that are going to be required to support AI and otherwise, a lot of very power intensive commercial applications. So we view the residential solar and battery storage, as an important part of the way that our customers and people we don't do business with today are going to be able to meet their power needs in the future. And I actually think that for our products like this with an intermediate duration and a super prime credit risk profile, banks are the best source of liquidity, not the worst. The focus is just making sure that you do business with the best because you're right, the same way that in auto we're reliant on the quality of care that the dealer provides to ensure that you know our borrower has a good experience, we are reliant on the quality of the installer and you know the actions that we took shortly after acquiring dividend to refocus the business on the 150 best installers in the portfolio are going to continue to be, we think a very viable and high quality way to go to market.\nErika Najarian: And just to follow up here, I'm sorry that I'm taking up a third question. Are you confident that after the vendor changes that you've made that, Fifth Third is not going to be in the news with like, you know, some older lady saying like she got sold solar panels, you can't afford, right? That's the risk. I totally get the secular trend. And everything that you have said makes so much elegant sense, but I think that's the risk that investors are trying to -- make sure that \u2013 it\u2019s not embedded in your stock, which is obviously not an EPS impact necessarily, but a reputational litigation.\nTim Spence: Sure. There were some installer failures. As interest rates rose because the volume went down. I think as a matter of policy here, we take care of the customer. So if an installer is unable to complete a job, we complete it on behalf of the installers. We have done that in every case where we had an installer who was unable to complete a project and get it to PTO and you would expect that we \u2013 you should expect that we're going to continue to do that. That's the standard of care that we would provide for any customer inside the bank regardless of the channel that they came through regardless of the product. And so as those installer failures work their way through the system, we're going to take care of the customer.\nErika Najarian: Thank you so much, Tim.\nOperator: We'll go next to Manan Gosalia at Morgan Stanley.\nManan Gosalia: Hey, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on your comments on the level of cash. You noted that the LCR is 137%. Is there room to take on a little bit more duration and deploy some of this excess liquidity because you really need to be that far above the 100% threshold?\nTim Spence: No, I think the other issue that you're facing right now is you're actually not getting paid to extend your duration given the inversion of the yield curve. I mean, the 10-year rate this morning is 4.2%, but we're earning [5.5%, 5.40%, 5.5%] (ph) on the front end of the curve. And given our rate outlook, we just don't think it makes sense at this point to be adding duration, giving up earnings today when we think over the horizon that we are not sure that [4.20%] (ph) is a good entry point.\nManan Gosalia: Got it. And then Bryan, at our conference last month, you noted that you were seeing some competition driving loan spreads lower across the industry, and that's not necessarily a level that you're always comfortable with. Has that continued since then? And if yes, I know you don't want to lean in here, but with deposit costs coming down, is there some more room to lean in there and do?\nBryan Preston: We're looking for the spots where it makes sense to continue to evaluate where loan growth should come from. As Tim talked about, we're certainly not going to sacrifice on earning appropriate returns as part of this. But just given some of the confidence that we have in terms of that we think we are going to see a cut this year, that we are going to start to see some relief and we are starting to see a little bit of the animal spirits in the market start to build. Like our pipelines are looking better than where they were three months ago, six months ago. So we think there's going to be opportunity to continue to see some growth in those areas and feel good about positioning.\nManan Gosalia: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next to Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bank.\nTim Spence: Hey, Matt.\nMatt O'Connor: Hi, guys. There was an article earlier this week just talking about risk in the commercial bond market. And you guys have commercial real estate bond market that is. You guys have a good Slide on 43, just reminding all of us that a lot of it or most of it is agency. Can you talk to the non-agency CMBF and I guess kind of like almost like dumbed down what these [technical difficulty].\nTim Spence: You cut out there right at the end. Could you repeat the end of the question?\nMatt O'Connor: Just a line [technical difficulty] there thanks.\nBryan Preston: Yeah. So we obviously have had a very cautious outlook from a commercial real estate perspective for a really long time. We do think that there is some value in participating in the market, and so where we've chosen to do that is in that non-agency portfolio in structured form. Because we do think those structural enhancements create a lot of credit protections for us. The article that you were mentioning this week was in regards to a specific structure called a SASB, a Single Asset Single Borrower structure, which funny enough, basically every commercial real estate loan is a Single Asset Single Borrower structure. But in our case for our broader portfolio, we have very little SASB within our portfolio. I had mentioned about a month ago at Morgan Stanley that amount was about $150 million for us and all of our bonds in that structure are continuing to be performing very, very strongly. The broader structure, we have nearly 40% credit enhancement that is in front of us from a first loss perspective. And the weighted average loan-to-value on the non-agency portfolio is still around 60%. We use some advanced analytic tools that the industry has available and we stress the portfolio regularly. As part of our process, our credit underwriting team underwrites and evaluates the top 10 loans in every structure to make sure that we are comfortable. We monitor the portfolio very closely and continue to have no concerns on what we're seeing.\nMatt O'Connor: Okay, perfect. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Christopher Marinac at Janney Montgomery Scott.\nChristopher Marinac: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the commercial criticized and the fact that you had some of the charge-offs this quarter, would that improve those? And do you see any other kind of upgrade trends that could happen in future quarters?\nBryan Preston: I mean yeah, the charge-offs are going to make both of those loans. And overall, charge-offs are coming out of the criticize. So yeah, any time we're going to have commercial charge-offs, it's going to improve. We were pretty stable quarter-over-quarter in our criticize. And we're starting to see it level off. And so we\u2019re not overly worried that we're going to see continued increases based on what we know today, based on unforeseen economic conditions.\nTim Spence: Yeah, I think that the trend in criticized in general has actually been encouraging from my perspective. Greg, you may want to talk about this, but the only real growth we've seen in criticized are a few ABL facilities. If you look at it over the last 12 months, and we're well secured there and well within the collateral.\nGreg Schroeck: Exactly right. That was the driver of our first quarter increase in criticized assets. About 16% of our criticized assets are in that ADL fully conforming. We're not doing [SOFR] (ph), we're within assets. So I think the loss content. Now that said, you could have a weakness or well-defined weakness that we'll work out of. But I feel good about the trending that we've seen. And for the rest of this year, again based on what I know today, you know I would expect stable, criticized levels.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. Thank you both for the background. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Gerard Cassidy at RBC.\nTim Spence: Welcome back.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. I got a follow-up for you. Talking about loan growth, I noticed there was a small uptick in growth in the home equity portfolio. I think it was Slide 35, you guys showed this data. What's the opportunity for you? Because one of your Bank Americas are in uptick as well in home equity lending. In view of the fact that people are not refinancing their houses because of where rates are but there is a ton of equity in houses. Have you guys considered looking at this and maybe as an area of potential growth? I know the home equity has got a bad reputation from what happened in [\u201808, \u201809] (ph), but obviously the world is different today. Any of your thoughts here?\nBryan Preston: Yeah, I tell people here all the time that the first rule of whole is that you have to stop digging. So it is nice after many years of having brackets around the change in balance number for home equity to see a turn of the tide there. I would not anticipate that it's a big driver of our loan growth over the course of the next few quarters, not because we wouldn't like it to be, but if you look at the amount of spending and home improvement in general right now, just look at the big home improvement retailers, you'll see that that's a category that remains pretty depressed. That said, I do think that the right strategy here for homeowners who have these 3% fixed rate mortgages is going to be to improve where they are as opposed to moving. And home equity is a great way to do that. So we would like to see more growth in home equity. We like the credit quality there. It just -- it's going to be slow and steady here in terms of the pickup.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Appreciate the color.\nTim Spence: Absolutely.\nOperator: And that does conclude our Q&A session. I want to now turn the conference back over to Matt Curoe for closing remarks.\nMatt Curoe : Thank you, Audra, And thanks everyone for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the Investor Relations Department if you have any follow-up questions. Audra, you may now disconnect the call.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Greg Schroeck",
            "content": "Gerard, hey it's Greg. Great question. So I'll answer the second one first. So yeah we had the two names that Bryan mentioned that were two different industries. We're not seeing any thematic concerning trends emerging out of the [technical difficulty] geographically by [technical difficulty]. But we've talked about lumpiness on the commercial side. And that's what we experienced this quarter. We're normalizing off very low loss rates, and so when we have one or two of these episodic events, they're going to get highlighted, and that's what we saw. But as Bryan mentioned, they were not a surprise. We had reserves against those two loans, and so we think we're through those. The overall credit metrics remain really solid. Our delinquencies were down quarter-over-quarter. The NPAs that you referred to were down 13%, quarter-over-quarter at 55 basis points. That's below our 10-year average. We're up 1 basis point year-over-year on NPAs, and it's really across the Board. We had about $80 million in commercial losses this quarter, but we are down almost $100 million. So we are working the portfolio very hard. We're working out of some of the NPA loans without experiencing the loss rates, but it's really across the board. What we're not seeing the NPAs are in the commercial real estate portfolio. We had about $3 million in NPAs there. So that portfolio continues to perform very, very well. It had virtually no delinquencies in that portfolio. So it's really across the board where we're seeing the improvement in our NPA numbers. Had a little bit on the consumer side, both sides have been driven on the commercial side. Yeah, another great question. So we've got subscription lines to some of those type of companies, highly rated borrowers. But as you know, those are mostly predicated on and underwritten, overcollateralized to the LP Capital. But we're not in that leverage -- on leverage space. We're not active there. We've got a couple direct lending lines of credit. They're totaled about $30 million, so about [$15 million fee] (ph). So we're not active in that space. Thank you. Yeah, it's Greg again. So Yeah, certainly, as Tim mentioned, any kind of rate cut is going to help us from an overall asset quality. It will on the consumer side. It will on the commercial side. It takes a little while for those rate cuts to play through the portfolio. So as Bryan mentioned in his prepared remarks, we still feel good about the 40 basis points or 45 basis points for the rest of this year. Then we'll see how the rest of the marketplace plays out. But as I just mentioned in the previous question, still feel really good about the overall metrics of the portfolio. Our NPA rates is a good indicator of potential loss rates moving forward, and those numbers continue to come down and improve. And so I think even without rate increases, still feel really good about our portfolio, get a little bit of goodness from the rates and yeah, I think it certainly helps as we get into 2025. Yeah, absolutely. You know, we're typically, our normal business is about two-thirds sensitive to the front end of the curve. You know, I will tell you with our current cash position, we're probably closer to 75% sensitive on the front end of the curve. So relief on the front end is part of what would be the big driver from an asset sensitivity perspective. And the interesting thing about how this environment could play out is we could potentially get some of that relief on the front end of the curve and still benefit from the fixed rate asset repricing that we're expecting over the next couple of years. Because what's rolling off right now is a lot of that loans that were originated in those periods of really low interest rates. So even if you see a little bit of lower rates on the longer-end of the curve, you would still have a nice pickup relative to the [prompt of back] (ph) with dynamic. So that front end relief and as Tim mentioned around our concerns around their -- concerns around continued treasury issuance, if that's the scenario that were to play out, it would be one that would be a nice situation from an NII perspective. But it would probably continue the longer-end of the curve could cause some additional challenges for the economy from a growth perspective. Exactly right. That was the driver of our first quarter increase in criticized assets. About 16% of our criticized assets are in that ADL fully conforming. We're not doing [SOFR] (ph), we're within assets. So I think the loss content. Now that said, you could have a weakness or well-defined weakness that we'll work out of. But I feel good about the trending that we've seen.

            "name": "Tim Spence",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe great banks distinguish themselves, not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather how they navigate challenging ones. In that context, I am very pleased with how we are executing as a company and what continues to be an uncertain economic and interest rate backdrop. Our focus on stability, profitability, and growth in that order have produced consistent predictable results and strong profitability since the bank failures last spring and we remain confident in our ability to deliver PPNR and earnings outcomes in-line with or better than our original expectations for the full year in 2024. This morning we reported earnings per share of $0.81 or $0.86 excluding certain items outlined on Page 2 of the release, which exceeded the guidance we provided in our first quarter earnings call. Our resilient balance sheet, diversified fee revenues, and expense discipline continued to produce strong profitability. Our adjusted return on tangible common equity of 15.1% and adjusted return on assets of 1.22% over the last 12 months rank as the best of all peers who have reported so far and the most stable when compared to the same period last year. The second quarter marked the first sequential growth in NII since 2022 and NIM improved for the second consecutive quarter. That trajectory, along with the benefits we are seeing from strategic investments and continued expense discipline should allow us to return to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter of this year and carry over into next year. Strategically, our investments in the southeast and middle market expansion markets, in commercial payments, and in wealth and asset management, continue to produce strong growth and market share gains. We grew consumer households by 3% year-over-year in the second quarter, punctuated by 6% growth in our southeast markets. Middle market loan production and new quality relationships were the strongest in Indiana, the Carolinas, Texas, and California. In our industry verticals, production was strongest where federal government spending has had an outsized benefit, including in aerospace and defense contractors and with manufacturing and infrastructure construction firms. Commercial payments revenue grew 12% year-over-year, driven by our investments in our software enabled managed services and Newline our embedded payments business. Commercial payments is a scale business for us. In the first half of 2024 alone, we processed more than $8 trillion in volume. Nearly half of all new treasury management relationships we added year-to-date were payments-led and have no credit extended. Wealth and asset management fee revenues grew 11% year-over-year, and total assets under management grew to $65 billion, a 10% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Fifth Third Securities, the private bank, and Fifth Third Wealth Advisors, the RIA platform we launched in 2022, all generated strong performance. Digital Banker and Global Private Banker recognized us again as the best private bank for high net worth clients for the third consecutive year. Turning to capital, our strong profitability allowed us to resume share repurchases during the quarter while also increasing our CET1 ratio to 10.6%. The Federal Reserve stress test results highlighted our strong capital levels, consistent profitability, and simple yet well-diversified business model. Importantly, we maintain the capacity to increase our dividend, support organic growth, and continue share repurchases. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we remain cautious due to the wide range of potential economic and geopolitical scenarios that could unfold. As a result, we will remain disciplined and will not chase loan growth at the expense of our return targets. We'll continue to maintain flexibility by staying liquid, neutrally positioned, and broadly diversified, while investing in the long-term. Before I hand it over to Bryan to provide additional details on our second quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, I want to express my gratitude to our employees for the consistent hard work, innovation, and passion for service that you bring to our customers. This morning, your money named us the best super regional bank in the US, as part of their 2024 awards for excellence. I'm honored to be part of your team. With that, Bryan over to you. Good morning. Yeah. Good question. I think that's the million dollar question for the industry right there. There's no question that if we see some relief on rates, it is a positive, both for loan demand and for credit quality. Jamie Leonard, and I have been out in several of the markets this quarter doing market visits, and we've been running a straw poll on where rates need to be before activity picks up. And the wisdom of the crowds, at least inside Fifth Third at the moment is about 4.5% the Meridian, where we'll see a pickup in more activity. That said, while rates would be constructive, I think, I continue always to worry about the broader macro issues. We've got land wars and two volatile regions in the US right now. We have an election that's upcoming. We have massive fiscal deficits in the US. We have a ton of Treasury Issuance that's going to be required to reload the TGA at some point here, and they're going to have to turn that out, and that's going to put pressure on the long-end of the curve. And while I think we have some stability here, I'm uncomfortable with the level of support that the federal government is having to provide to keep GDP growth at where it is at the moment. I mean, the jobs numbers, this most recent batch, unless I'm mistaken, a third of the new jobs that were created, were created by the government. When we look at our footprint and we look at where the activity is, where there's federal stimulus, we're seeing robust activity everywhere else. We've got a client in Tennessee tell us that the current environment was quote, half speed ahead, right. So we will continue to be mindful about that. I'm a believer that in uncertain environments, you have to focus on getting growth from the businesses that you know and the strategies that are proven. You're not going to see us stretching into categories we don't know or doing things that we're uncomfortable with from a credit perspective and where we have to bet on a favorable macro to bail us out in terms of getting repaid. Yeah, Scott, it's Tim. I'm happy to do that. And I think you hit on the most important thing here, which is the best thing for you to do is focus on the statements of fact as opposed to the press releases on this one. I think that by the Bureau's own statements of fact here, these were old issues. So one was nearly five years old, the other was nearly 10 years old respectively. There are things that we identified and reported. And in case of auto, we completely canceled the program before they ever even started their investigation. And I think while of course, we always take anything that impacts customers seriously, Fifth Third the size of the fines, which are a fraction of what you've seen in other places, probably speak for themselves in terms of the limited scope of the issues here. We elected to close these things out because given the fact that they were small in the past, it just didn't make sense to continue to spend more money litigating than it was going to spend to settle. So, you know, we put them in the rearview mirror. We have the one-time expense this quarter, and that's where it is going to stay. You shouldn't expect any incremental ongoing expense because these are issues that are so old, anything that needed to be done was already done from an ongoing [operational perspective] (ph). Thank you. Hi Mike. Yeah, Ken, it's Tim. We talked a while ago, and maybe we haven't been doing enough of this recently, but about the power of having these intermediate duration fixed rate loan origination platforms was, by that I really mean you think about provide, you think about the auto business, you think about dividends. Like if you just look at the yields on the indirect auto and specialty business year-over-year, we've added almost 100 basis points to the yield in the portfolio. And if you look at the solar product, it's north of 200 basis points that we have been able to add year-over-year. And that just speaks to the power of both the one, the sort of origination capacity that exists there that we can dial up in an environment where spreads widen and it makes sense for us to do it. And two, the fact that these are asset classes that are going to reprice a lot faster than the 3% mortgages that were originated at the low point in the rate cycle and that are going to persist much longer than the jumbo mortgages and the other fixed rate product that you see being available to banks out in the market today, which are all likely to prepay if we get any sort of meaningful movement out of the Fed. So that will be an important part of the way that we continue to drive outcomes, even in an environment where you don't get a meaningful improvement in loan demand across the industry. Good morning. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, Erika. Sure. So, just to make sure that I'm clear, and I know you were, But I mean, dividend has nothing to do with the CFPB. So those are two separate issues. Right, right. Okay. Yeah. look, on the dividend front, we are believers that the best way to get growth is to attach yourself to long-term secular trends.

The focus on commercial payments has been about attaching ourselves to this trend of digitization in general and in particular the intermediation of these legacy workflows with software. And in the case of dividend and what we've elected to do on the project finance on the commercial solar side of the equation. The focus is on both the diversification of energy sources with a focus on renewable, and I think in particular in the case of dividend, the need that we are going to have across the country to have more distributed power generation and storage, if we're going to avoid rolling brownouts and other sorts of issues that come from the fact that we have a very old energy infrastructure. And in particular now with the explosion in data centers that are going to be required to support AI and otherwise, a lot of very power intensive commercial applications. So we view the residential solar and battery storage, as an important part of the way that our customers and people we don't do business with today are going to be able to meet their power needs in the future.

Sure. There were some installer failures. As interest rates rose because the volume went down. I think as a matter of policy here, we take care of the customer. So if an installer is unable to complete a job, we complete it on behalf of the installers. We have done that in every case where we had an installer who was unable to complete a project and get it to PTO and you would expect that we \u2013 you should expect that we're going to continue to do that. That's the standard of care that we would provide for any customer inside the bank regardless of the channel that they came through regardless of the product. And so as those installer failures work their way through the system, we're going to take care of the customer. No, I think the other issue that you're facing right now is you're actually not getting paid to extend your duration given the inversion of the yield curve. I mean, the 10-year rate this morning is 4.2%, but we're earning [5.5%, 5.40%, 5.5%] (ph) on the front end of the curve. And given our rate outlook, we just don't think it makes sense at this point to be adding duration, giving up earnings today when we think over the horizon that we are not sure that [4.20%] (ph) is a good entry point. Hey, Matt. You cut out there right at the end. Could you repeat the end of the question? Yeah, I think that the trend in criticized in general has actually been encouraging from my perspective. Greg, you may want to talk about this, but the only real growth we've seen in criticized are a few ABL facilities. If you look at it over the last 12 months, and we're well secured there and well within the collateral. Welcome back. Absolutely."

Our second quarter results were strong, reflecting our balance sheet strength, diversified revenue streams, and disciplined approach to expense and credit risk management. For more than a year, we have emphasized the importance of maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility in an uncertain economic and interest rate environment. This approach has proven effective as the market's expectations on rate cuts, changed dramatically from the start of 2024. Despite this change in rate outlook, our NII has been consistent with the performance trajectory we discussed back in December, increasing sequentially during the second quarter from the first quarter bottoming, and NIM has increased for two consecutive quarters from the fourth quarter low. Additionally, our full year 2024 NII outlook remains unchanged. As Tim mentioned, our profitability remained strong and stable, which allowed us to resume share repurchases early and grow our CET1 ratio to 10.6% up 13 basis points. As noted on Page 2 of our earnings release, our reported results were impacted by certain items including the valuation of the visa total return swap, an update to the FDIC special assessment, and the impact of certain legal settlements and customer remediations. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net interest income for the quarter increased 1% from the prior quarter to $1.4 billion. And adjusted net interest margin improved 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter. Increased yields on new loan production contributed to this improvement and offset the impact of increased interest bearing core deposit costs, which were well-managed and increased only 4 basis points compared to the prior quarter. While total average portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially, we continue to benefit from fixed rate asset repricing, led by our indirect auto business. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially, primarily reflecting the increase in indirect auto originations, offset by a decrease in other consumer loan balances. Average commercial portfolio loans decreased 1%, due to lower demand from corporate banking borrowers. Period end commercial revolver utilization remained at 36% consistent with the prior quarter. Middle market loan production increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, driven by strong performance in our southeast markets, primarily in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida, as well as continued success in Indiana, Texas, and California. The pipeline for the second half of the year is improving, and we are continuing to invest in our middle market banking teams, including our recently announced expansion in the Alabama market. However, we remain cautious on commercial loan growth expectations in the second half of the year, as customer demand for credit remains muted. Our investment in analytics continues to help us optimize deposit outcomes, demonstrated by our strong deposit growth in 2023 and prudent management of deposit costs in 2024. Our strong track record of liquidity management, combined with data-driven analytics, will aid in maintaining pricing discipline and optimizing liability costs. Average core deposits were flat sequentially, driven by higher CD and consumer savings and money market balances, offset by lower interest checking and commercial demand balances. Our current focus remains on prudently managing deposit costs with the Fed on hold and preparing for potential rate cuts later this year. By segment, average consumer deposits increased 2% sequentially while both commercial and wealth deposits decreased 2%. The Southeast branch investments are driving both strong household growth and granular insured deposits. Demand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits were 25% as of the end of the second quarter, stable with the prior quarter, as migration of DDA balances continued to slow. Consistent with our prior expectations for a higher for longer rate environment, we expect DDA mix to fall below 25% during the third quarter and stay around 24% for the remainder of the year. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 137% and our loan to core deposit ratio with 72%. We are well-positioned to continue to grow net interest income and our balance sheet provides flexibility to navigate the evolving economic and interest rate conditions. Moving on to fees. Excluding the impacts of security gains and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income decreased $32 million or 4% compared to the year ago quarter. This year-over-year decrease is attributable to a $34 million private equity gain recognized in the second quarter of 2023. Within our businesses, commercial payments and wealth and asset management fees continue to deliver strong results, both achieving double-digit revenue growth over the prior year, driven by our continued strategic growth investments in products and sales personnel. These areas are not only fast growing but are sizable contributors to fee income and profitability today given our strength and scale in these businesses. We expect these businesses to continue to deliver strong revenue growth. Our market-sensitive businesses such as mortgage and commercial customer hedging have been impacted by the higher rate environment, the reduced demand for credit, and reduced market volatility. The combined impact for these businesses was a $20 million decrease versus the prior year. Leasing business revenue was down $9 million versus the prior year due to our decision to de-emphasize operating leases, but it is offset by a $9 million decrease in leasing business expense. The securities gains of $3 million reflected the mark-to-market impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which is more than offset in compensation expense. While we have continued to invest in strategic growth initiatives and technology, we managed our adjusted non-interest expense flat to the year-ago quarter due to our focus on expense discipline and the ongoing benefits from the process automation efforts. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 7% sequentially, primarily due to seasonal items during the first quarter related to compensation awards and payroll taxes. Moving to credit, consistent with our guidance, the net charge-off ratio was 49 basis points, up 11 basis points sequentially, driven by two commercial credits for which we had previously established specific reserves. Consumer charge-offs were 57 basis points, a reduction of 10 basis points sequentially, primarily due to improvement in our indirect consumer-secured portfolio. Other credit metrics showed strong sequential improvement with the ratio of early-stage delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreasing 3 basis points to 26 basis points, which is near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade. NPAs decreased by $100 million, or 13% during the quarter, and the NPA ratio decreased 9 basis points to [55] (ph) basis points. In commercial, our credit discipline is grounded in generating and maintaining granular, high-quality relationships and by managing concentration risks to any asset class, region, or industry. We continue to see no material signs of broad-based industry or geographic weakness and believe potential future commercial credit losses will be idiosyncratic in nature. In consumer, our focus remains on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures. We have maintained our conservative underwriting policies and will continue to evaluate our positioning as economic conditions change. Our ACL coverage ratio decreased 4 basis points to 2.08% and included a $47 million reserve release, driven by the previously mentioned specific reserves. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Moving to capital, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.6%, significantly exceeding our new buffered minimum of 7.7%, reflecting strong capital levels. As we assess our capital priorities, we believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level. During the quarter, we completed $125 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 3.5 million shares. Our pro forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the securities portfolio, is 8.0%. We expect continued improvement in the unrealized securities losses in our portfolio, given that 61% of the AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked-out securities, which provide the high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. Assuming the forward curve is realized, approximately 26% of the AOCI related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025, increasing tangible book value per share by 10%, before considering any future earnings. 62% of the securities-related AOCI will accrete back to equity by the end of 2028. Moving to our current outlook. While the rate environment and customer credit demand have played out differently than we were expecting at the start of the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver PPNR and earnings outcomes in-line with or better than our original expectations for the full year. We expect full-year NII to decrease 2% to 4% consistent with our guidance from January. This outlook assumes the forward curve as of early July, which projected two rate cuts in the second half of the year, September and December. We also believe we can deliver this NII outcome with no interest rate cuts and no loan growth in the second half of 2024. Given the year-to-date trends in customer activity, we now expect full-year average total loans to be down 3% compared to 2023. Average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 are expected to be stable to up 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, with similar performance in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. Customer demand is the primary driver of this change, given the interest rate environment and other economic uncertainties. If there's more economic optimism in the second half of the year, we would expect to see loan growth in-line or better than market growth. We are forecasting fourth quarter average core deposit growth of 2% to 3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Our forecast also assumes commercial revolver utilization and our cash and other short-term investments remain relatively stable throughout the remainder of 2024. We expect full-year adjusted non-interest income to be stable to down 1% in 2024, reflecting the impact of weaker than previously expected credit demand and customer hedging activities. We expect strong growth in commercial payments and wealth and asset management revenue to continue. In response to this expectation of lower customer activity in the second half. We expect to manage full year adjusted non-interest expense stable to 2023 levels. Our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid-single digits and sales additions in middle market, commercial payments, and wealth. We will open 30 to 35 new branches in our higher growth markets and have already closed a similar number of branches in 2024. Our outlook still projects an efficiency ratio of around 57% for the full year. For full year 2024, the net charge-off outlook remains in the 35 to 45 basis points range. While we expect to resume provision builds in connection with loan growth and mix in the second half of 2024, we expect the second half build to be less than the first half of 2024 release. Therefore, we expect full-year provision to be a 0 to $10 million release, assuming no change to credit quality of the portfolio or projected economic conditions. Moving to our quarterly outlook, we expect NII and NIM growth to continue in both the third and fourth quarter. We expect NII in the third quarter to be up 2% sequentially, reflecting the impact of slowing deposit cost pressures and the continued benefit of our fixed rate asset repricing. Our current outlook assumes interest-bearing core deposit costs, which were 295 basis points in the second quarter of 2024, to increase just 4 basis points sequentially if we see no rate cuts. We expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% from the second quarter. We expect modest middle market, auto, and solar production to offset continued low credit demand from corporate banking customers. We expect third quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 1% to 2% compared to the second quarter, largely reflecting strength in commercial payments and wealth and asset management and a modest increase in commercial banking revenue. We expect third quarter total adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 1% compared to the second quarter, due to the impact of the previously discussed investments in branches, technology, and sales personnel. Third quarter net charge-offs are projected to be in the 40 basis points to 45 basis point range. As mentioned in the [four-year] (ph) outlook, loan growth and mix are expected to drive a provision build, which should be around $25 million in the third quarter, assuming no change to the economic outlook. The trajectory of our income statement performance should deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter 2024 and a net interest income exit rate for the year that positions us for record results in 2025, assuming no major economic or interest rate outlook changes. Finally, moving to capital. With our consistent and strong earnings, we expect to execute share repurchases of $200 million per quarter in the second half of 2024, assuming a stable economic and credit outlook and capital rules that are no worse than the current NPR. In summary, with our well-positioned balance sheet, disciplined expense and credit risk management, and diversified revenue streams, we are positioned to generate sustained, top quartile profitability and deliver long-term value for our shareholders, customers, communities, and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call up for Q&A. Thank you, Ebrahim. We certainly believe that rate cuts are positive for Fifth Third's. If you look at slide 42, we actually give a little bit more detail on the mix of the interest-bearing deposit book. 64% of our book right now would be classified in kind of the higher beta categories. This represents our index deposits, which are up to $35 billion. The CDs that we have in place, we've done a nice job of managing the maturity of the CD bucket so that most of our CDs will mature by the end of the year. That's another $14 billion of balances and our promotional balances as well. So we have a lot of captions where within that book that we are going to be able to reprice down. Overall, that's about 64% of the deposits. We certainly have some lower rate buckets still that we think the betas are effectively zero. We have a high amount of confidence though that we're going to be able to get cost out and be able to manage. We really only need to be in a kind of mid-50s to low-60s beta to be able to be neutral to liability sensitive and we're confident we can deliver that. Yeah, absolutely, Scott. You know, the second to third quarter increase, we're talking about not too aggressive of a fee growth perspective. We continue to expect continued performance out of our wealth and asset management business, as well as commercial payments. Payments has been taken along at $3 million to $4 million a quarter increases, and we expect that to continue and feel really good about it. We're also going to see some seasonal impacts actually come out associated with our mortgage business. We've benefited a lot from the servicing portfolio, all the servicing ads that we did right at the end of the low rate cycle has benefited us and generated a lot of great income, but there is a seasonal headwind, 1Q to 2Q that we felt that was about $7 million. That's not going to repeat. So we're set up really well for that 2Q to 3Q growth that we've laid out. And then in the fourth quarter, we'll get some additional seasonal benefit out of the MSR. The payments and card spend will continue to pick up, especially the seasonal card spending consumer. We'll get the $10 million TRA benefit. And then we always see some pickup in both commercial banking and leasing in the fourth quarter that should both generate some additional income as well. That gets us to that little bit higher growth rate trajectory that you could see that's implied throughout in 3Q and 4Q. Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Ken. Great question. You know, what we would tell you is that what it will create is, it will create some opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive on some of the rate cuts associated with the CDs and the promo portfolios that we've seen. Historically, when we've navigated through these down rate cycles, those first couple cuts on the consumer side do have a pretty decent impact on customer mentality and sentiment and your ability to create some sticky balances. We've been through this a few times now where we've seen the ability to convert those balances into a lower rate balance and cause them to stick around. And on the other side of that, the commercial balances, in particular the index balances, those are immediate impacts and will just move with the market. We have really no concern around that index strategy. It's another one that we've executed in prior cycles. I think we've done a nice job of kind of navigating and managing those balances up in those index portfolios as we've reached the grades. It gives us a lot of confidence in the ability to very quickly get those costs out. I would actually tell you that most of it is just the natural transition of the balance sheet in the business today. I think our NII story is actually pretty simple. Right now it's the continued fixed rate asset pricing and slowing deposit cost. And if you look at just the trends that we're laying out, you know, we're adding about $8 million a quarter right now, just on the natural repricing of the existing balance sheet. And you think with, we've talked a lot about $4 billion to fixed rate asset repricing. That's happening at about 200 basis points. That's $20 million a quarter. And then the deposit costs up 4 bps this quarter on $120 billion interest bearing book [versus 12] (ph) of incremental costs to take us down to that net 8. We get a little bit of continued slowing on deposit cost side. That can approach $10 million, $15 million, $20 million a quarter. Day count, we're going to pick up $10 million here in the third quarter. And then that sets us up for an exit rate where if you just take the 4 times the fourth quarter math, you're right around what is our record NII of [$58 million, $52 million] (ph). Throw on a little earning asset or loan growth on top of that and the path is there for us. That's what gives us confidence. The big wild card, like we always talk about, is just how competitive deposit pricing ultimately ends up being. But if we start to see rate cuts, we would expect to see some decent relief on the liability side. Yeah, I would tell you that we are very focused internally on maintaining plenty of liquidity to deal with any uncertainty associated with potential rules, as well as the market. So that has just been a big driver of our positioning and why we've done that. But the other thing that it allows for us, yes it is a good liquidity risk management tool, but it does allow us to have a little bit more confidence on the interest rate risk management side as well, because we can be more aggressive on our liability management actions because of that cash position. So it really is the combination of that liquidity and liability management benefits that we are focused on and why we continue to keep those levels that we have. As rates come down, and as we get through that environment and see stability in the market from a liquidity perspective, we really have an ability to take that down over time. As you pointed out, it was a big increase year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was a 20 basis point impact on our NIM. So, getting back to more normalized levels would be a nice trend for us from a NIM perspective. We're looking for the spots where it makes sense to continue to evaluate where loan growth should come from. As Tim talked about, we're certainly not going to sacrifice on earning appropriate returns as part of this. But just given some of the confidence that we have in terms of that we think we are going to see a cut this year, that we are going to start to see some relief and we are starting to see a little bit of the animal spirits in the market start to build. Like our pipelines are looking better than where they were three months ago, six months ago. So we think there's going to be opportunity to continue to see some growth in those areas and feel good about positioning. Yeah. So we obviously have had a very cautious outlook from a commercial real estate perspective for a really long time. We do think that there is some value in participating in the market, and so where we've chosen to do that is in that non-agency portfolio in structured form. Because we do think those structural enhancements create a lot of credit protections for us. The article that you were mentioning this week was in regards to a specific structure called a SASB, a Single Asset Single Borrower structure, which funny enough, basically every commercial real estate loan is a Single Asset Single Borrower structure. But in our case for our broader portfolio, we have very little SASB within our portfolio. I had mentioned about a month ago at Morgan Stanley that amount was about $150 million for us and all of our bonds in that structure are continuing to be performing very, very strongly. The broader structure, we have nearly 40% credit enhancement that is in front of us from a first loss perspective. And the weighted average loan-to-value on the non-agency portfolio is still around 60%. We use some advanced analytic tools that the industry has available and we stress the portfolio regularly. As part of our process, our credit underwriting team underwrites and evaluates the top 10 loans in every structure to make sure that we are comfortable. We monitor the portfolio very closely and continue to have no concerns on what we're seeing. I mean yeah, the charge-offs are going to make both of those loans. And overall, charge-offs are coming out of the criticize. So yeah, any time we're going to have commercial charge-offs, it's going to improve. We were pretty stable quarter-over-quarter in our criticize. And we're starting to see it level off. And so we're not overly worried that we're going to see continued increases based on what we know today, based on unforeseen economic conditions. Yeah, I tell people here all the time that the first rule of whole is that you have to stop digging. So it is nice after many years of having brackets around the change in balance number for home equity to see a turn of the tide there. I would not anticipate that it's a big driver of our loan growth over the course of the next few quarters, not because we wouldn't like it to be, but if you look at the amount of spending and home improvement in general right now, just look at the big home improvement retailers, you'll see that that's a category that remains pretty depressed. That said, I do think that the right strategy here for homeowners who have these 3% fixed rate mortgages is going to be to improve where they are as opposed to moving. And home equity is a great way to do that. So we would like to see more growth in home equity. We like the credit quality there. It just -- it's going to be slow and steady here in terms of the pickup."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand over the call to Matt Curoe. You may now begin the conference.\nMatt Curoe: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's first quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, our Chairman, CEO and President, Tim Spence, and CFO, Bryan Preston, will provide an overview of our first quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of April 19, 2024. And Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim.\nTim Spence: Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe that great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate challenging ones. In that sense, the uncertainty we face in the current environment provides us with an opportunity to demonstrate that our focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order will produce consistently strong, some might even say boring, financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.70, or $0.76 excluding the Visa, Mastercard settlement litigation charges and the additional FDIC special assessment. All major income statement captions were in line with or better than the guidance that we provided in our January earnings call. Our adjusted return on equity and return on assets are the highest of all peers who have reported thus far and the most stable when compared to results from the first quarter of 2023. We grew period-end deposits compared to the prior quarter and generated annualized consumer household growth of 3%, punctuated by 7% growth in our Southeast markets. Since 2018, we have built more than 100 de novo branches in the Southeast. As a portfolio, they are exceeding our expectations, having achieved 112% of their household growth goals and 132% of the deposit goals built into the business cases. Florida is our top performing de novo market, with deposit dollars at 195% in gold. J.D. Power also recently named Fifth Third number one for retail banking customer satisfaction in the Florida market. Importantly, net interest margins improved in the quarter, driven by stabilizing deposit costs with interest-bearing deposit costs increasing only 1 basis point sequentially. Consistent with our guidance last year, the fourth quarter of 2023 marked the low point for NIM and we believe the first quarter of 2024 will mark the low point for NII. While end-of-period loan balances were down 1% compared to the prior quarter, we saw solid middle market loan growth across our footprint with Tennessee, the Carolinas, Kentucky, Indiana and Texas achieving the strongest results. Our footprint continues to benefit in an outsized way from federal incentives to bolster investments in domestic manufacturing and energy infrastructure. The Midwest and Southeast have received more investment per capita than other US regions in industries as diverse as multimodal logistics, semiconductors, batteries and pet food. Treasury management and wealth and asset management were the strongest contributors to fee income, driven by the strategic investments we have been making in both areas. Treasury management revenue grew 11% year-over-year, driven by our software-enabled managed services payments offerings, and Newline, our embedded payments business. Over one-third of the new treasury management relationships added in the quarter were payments led and had no credit extended. Wealth and asset management fee revenues grew 10% year-over-year, highlighted by strong growth in Fifth Third Wealth Advisors. The RIA platform we launched in 2022, which recently crossed $1 billion in assets under management. Our credit performance remained stable, highlighted by continued strength in our commercial real estate portfolio. We posted another quarter of zero net charge-offs in CRE and have less than $3 million of NPAs in our non-owner-occupied portfolio. While we expect that broader credit trends will continue to normalize, our emphasis on client selection and credit discipline helps to ensure that we have a well-diversified portfolio, not overly concentrated in any asset class, industry or geography. Expenses are well controlled. Adjusted for discrete items highlighted in the release, expenses declined 1% year-over-year driven by savings realized through process automation and our focus on value streams. Expense discipline is what has allowed us to make the long-term investments in our business necessary to generate superior returns and operating leverage through the cycle. Looking forward to the rest of the year, we remain cautious given the wide range of potential economic and geopolitical scenarios that could materialize. Depending on how you read the most recent data, inflation is either sticky at 3%, slowly moving down to 2%, or moving back up past 4%. Geopolitical tensions remain elevated and deficit spending, green energy investments and the domestication of supply chains are all inherently inflationary in the medium term. We believe the best way to manage in uncertain times is to stay liquid, stay neutrally positioned and stay broadly diversified while investing with the long-term in mind. That is what we intend to do. I want to thank our employees. Your hustle, heart and dedication are why we've been recognized thus far in 2024 as one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune, one of the Best Brands for Customer Service by Forbes, and one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. Thank you for keeping our shareholders, customers and communities at the center of everything we do. With that, I'll now turn it over to Bryan to provide additional details on our first quarter results and our current outlook for 2024.\nBryan Preston: Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Our first quarter results were a strong start to the year, reflecting our balance sheet strength, disciplined expense and credit risk management and diversified fee revenue streams. We saw new household growth accelerate and new quality relationships in commercial post steady gains. For over a year, we have highlighted the importance of maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility in an uncertain economic and interest rate environment. Our first quarter results evidence the strength of our current position, which should produce strong and stable returns across a wide range of economic outcomes. This approach has served us well as rate cut expectations are pushed out. As Tim mentioned, our profitability remains strong as we have the highest ROA and ROE, and among the best efficiency ratios of our peers that have reported to date in a quarter in which we have outsized seasonal compensation expenses. On a year-over-year basis, we were the most stable for both ROA and ROE, and among the most stable for NII and the efficiency ratio. Our consistent and strong earnings added 15 basis points to CET1 during the quarter inclusive of absorbing 8 basis points impact from the CECL phase in. Turning to the income statement. Net interest income for the quarter was $1.4 billion and consistent with our expectations. Interest-bearing deposit costs were well managed and increased only 1 basis point compared to the prior quarter. The balance sheet continues to be reflective of defensive positioning with optionality to navigate the changing economic and interest rate environments. Net interest margin improved 1 basis point for the quarter. Increased yields on new production of fixed rate consumer loans and day count benefits contribute to the growth and were partially offset by the deposit balance migration from demand to interest-bearing accounts. This increase in NIM is the first sequential improvement since the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the impacts of security gains and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income decreased 1% from a year ago quarter due to lower revenue in commercial banking, leasing and mortgage, partially offset by strong growth in treasury management and wealth and asset management fees, where both saw double-digit revenue growth over the prior year. The securities gains of $10 million reflected the mark-to-market impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which is more than offset in compensation expense. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 1% compared to the year ago quarter due to our continued focus on expense discipline and the ongoing benefits from our process automation efforts. While expenses are down versus the prior year, we continue to invest in opening new branches and increase marketing spend to drive household growth. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 8% sequentially as expected due to seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes in addition to $15 million of expense from the previously mentioned non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially. Average commercial portfolio loans decreased 2% due to lower demand from corporate banking borrowers and the average balance impact of last year's RWA diet, which reduced both total commitments and loan balances during the second half of 2023. Middle market loans increased during the quarter as we drive for more granularity and our winning private bank relationships. As Tim discussed, we saw solid middle market loan growth across our footprint. Period-end commercial revolver utilization was 36%, a 1% increase from the prior quarter, also driven by middle market. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially due to the overall slowdown in residential mortgage originations given the rate environment, offset by growth from solar energy installation loans and indirect auto originations. Average core deposits decreased 1% sequentially, driven primarily by normal seasonality within our business. Decreases in DDA balances and CDs were partially offset by increases in interest checking. By segment, average consumer deposits decreased 1% sequentially, while both commercial and wealth deposits were flat. Consumer deposits rebounded towards the end of the quarter to finish slightly higher than at the start of the quarter. As Tim mentioned, we are very pleased with the results of our multiyear Southeast branch investments, which are driving both strong household growth and granular insured deposits. DDA as a percent of core deposits was 25% as of the end of the first quarter compared to 26% in the prior quarter. Migration of DDA balances continued during the first quarter and we expect that trend to carry on in 2024, but at a slower pace than in prior quarters. We ended the quarter with full category 1 LCR compliance at 135% and our loan to core deposit ratio was 71%. The strong funding profile continues to provide us with great flexibility. Moving to credit. Asset quality trends remained well behaved and below historical averages. The net charge-off ratio was 38 basis points, which was up 6 basis points sequentially and consistent with our guidance. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased 2 basis points sequentially to 29 bps. The NPA ratio increased 5 basis points to 64 basis points. We have maintained our credit discipline by generating and maintaining granular high-quality relationships and by managing concentration risks to any asset class, region or industry. In consumer, our focus remains on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained our conservative underwriting policies. We continue to see the expected normalization of delinquency and credit loss trends from the historically low levels experienced over the last couple of years. From an overall credit risk management perspective, we assess forward-looking client vulnerabilities based on firm-specific and industry trends and closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher for longer interest rates may cause stress. Moving to the ACL. Our reserve coverage ratio remained unchanged at 2.12% and included a $16 million reserve release, driven by lower end-of-period loan balances and modest improvements in the economic scenarios. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Moving to capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.44% and we continue to believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level. As a reminder, at the beginning of the quarter, we moved $12.6 billion of securities to held to maturity. This represented one quarter of our AFS portfolio and was done when the five- and 10-year treasury rates were below 4%. The move reduced AOCI volatility to capital due to our investment portfolio by around 50% during the first quarter. Our pro forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the AFS securities portfolio, is 7.8%. We expect improvement in the unrealized securities losses in our portfolio given that 60% of the AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked-out securities, which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. Approximately 26% of the AOCI related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025 and approximately 62% by the end of 2028 assuming the forward curve plays out. Moving to our current outlook. We expect full year average total loans to be down 2% compared to 2023, consistent with our prior expectations. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of the 2023 RWA diet on average balances as well as lower mortgage production due to the higher interest rate environment. While we expect full year average total loans to decrease, we expect average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, with both commercial and consumer balances up low single-digits by the end of 2024. We are also assuming commercial revolver utilization remains stable. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect average total loan balances to be stable. We expect softness in commercial due to uncertainty on the interest rate and economic outlooks to be offset by consumer loan growth, which is expected to be up due to solar and auto originations. Our retail household growth and commercial payments growth remained robust in the first quarter, and those outcomes will drive deposit growth in 2024. However, we are mindful of potential economic and market headwinds for monetary policy. Therefore, we are forecasting full year average core deposit growth of only 2% to 3% compared to our 5% growth realized in 2023. While we expect DDA migration to continue given the high absolute level of interest rates, the pace of migration has declined. If rates remain at current levels, we expect to see the DDA mix dip below 25% during the middle of the year. Shifting to the income statement. Given the stabilization in our deposit costs and the benefit we are seeing from the repricing of our fixed rate loan book, we continue to expect the full year NII to decrease 2% to 4%, and as Tim mentioned, we expect the NII and NIM trough is behind us. This outlook is consistent with the forward curve as of early April, which projected three total cuts. However, our balance sheet is neutrally positioned so that even with zero cuts in 2024, we expect stability in our NII outlook. The primary risk to our NII performance would be a reacceleration of deposit competition. Our forecast also assumes our cash and other short-term investments, which ended the quarter at over $25 billion, remain relatively stable throughout the remainder of 2024. We expect NII in the second quarter to be stable to up 1% sequentially, reflecting the impact of slowing deposit cost pressures and the benefit of our fixed rate loan repricing. Our current outlook assumes interest-bearing deposit costs, which were 291 basis points in the first quarter of 2024, would increase about 6 basis points sequentially if we see no rate cuts. We expect adjusted non-interest income to be up 1% to 2% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance, reflecting growth in treasury management, capital market fees and wealth and asset management revenue. We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 2% to 4% compared to the first quarter, largely reflecting higher commercial banking revenue. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect full year adjusted non-interest expense to be up 1% compared to 2023. Our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid-single digits and sales force additions in middle market, treasury management and wealth. We will also open 30 to 35 new branches in our higher-growth markets and close a similar number of branches in 2024. We expect second quarter total adjusted non-interest expense to be down approximately 6% compared to the first quarter due to the seasonal compensation and benefits cost in the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be down 1% to 2% and PPNR to decline in the 4% to 5% range. This outcome will result in an efficiency ratio of around 57% for the full year, a modest increase relative to 2023, driven by the decrease in NII. We continue to expect positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024. Our outlook for 2024 net charge-offs remains in the 35 basis point to 45 basis point range as credit continues to normalize, with second quarter net charge-offs also in the 35 basis point to 45 basis point range. We expect to resume provision builds in connection with loan growth assuming no change to the economic outlook. Loan growth and mix is expected to drive a $75 million to $100 million build for the full year with the second quarter build being approximately zero to $25 million. As we mentioned last quarter, our consistent and strong earnings provides us the flexibility to resume share repurchases of $300 million to $400 million in the second half of 2024, including $100 million to $200 million in the third quarter, assuming a stable economic and credit outlook and capital rules that are no worse than the current NPR. In summary, with our well-positioned balance sheet, disciplined expense and credit risk management and diversified revenue growth, we will continue to generate long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers, communities and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open up the call for Q&A.\nMatt Curoe: Thanks, Bryan. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMike Mayo: Hi. Can you hear me?\nTim Spence: We can. Good morning, Mike.\nMike Mayo: Hey. I'm just trying to figure out how you get away with interest-bearing deposit cost going up only 1 basis point quarter-over-quarter when the group is like around up 10 basis points? And I mean, is this sustainable? Is it due to your tech? Is it because of your Southeast expansion? What's your secret here, or maybe it's just ways to bite you in future quarters? Thanks.\nBryan Preston: Thank, Mike. It's Bryan. Great question. I think one of the things on this front, we very early last year made the decision to grow deposits very aggressively. We viewed it as a very consistent theme with being focused on the long-term, focused on stability, and quite honestly, focused on returns. We viewed it as worst case. We're going to generate some low cost wholesale funding with no prepayment penalties. Best case, it gave us an opportunity to have 12 million interactions with prospects and customers. And we have a lot of confidence in our ability to win relationships, when we can get our team in front of our customers. And so with that, as we've moved into this more stable environment, there clearly was some costs as we brought those promo balances in, but it gives us an ability to actually manage and recycle interest expense where we're able to pulse offers through different markets, where we can basically harvest some savings and reintroduce that back into interest expense on new offers and ultimately have a lower net overall cost. We just feel like it's being very efficient with every dollar we're utilizing. As I mentioned in the guidance, there's certainly some risk that the competition can reaccelerate, but it does feel like overall deposit competition did soften at the end of last year and that continued to [indiscernible].\nMike Mayo: And just to follow up, I mean, you are expanding share in the Southeast. You said you went from, what, 8% to 6% year-over-year. I mean, don't you need to price competitively and offer higher rates to gain that share?\nTim Spence: We definitely took advantage of the fact that we have I think at this point with the investments that have been made down there, Mike, a higher natural share than we did existing market share rights. So, we were able to use the Southeast as a mechanism to raise deposits without repricing existing relationships to the same degree that we would have if we were using those rate offers in markets where we had high existing shares. I think though, what's important is that what's driving the growth in the Southeast is the household growth. And those relationships are that vast majority momentum banking relationships, which means the core deposit product is a non-interest-bearing deposit product. So, the 7% growth in the Southeast when you break it apart, the research triangle is like 25% year-over-year. Most of the major markets in Florida were in the mid to high teens, Tampa 11% or 12%, Broward County and north in Southeast Florida 17%, 18% year-over-year household growth rates. So, we're gaining share in a way that then allows us to make decisions about whether we want to move more of the deposit wallet where obviously rate is part of it, or where then we have the opportunity to introduce the fee-based businesses on the consumer side of the equation, and in commercial third of the relationships that we added in treasury managers, we mentioned this last quarter, were payments led. So, they're not driven by deposit rates or credit as the entry point.\nMike Mayo: All right. Thank you.\nTim Spence: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Was hoping you could spend a moment discussing on demand trends in more detail. Kind of soft for the group, though, you noted some specific states that have generated stronger middle market growth. And then maybe within the response, if you could also please discuss the outlooks for the specialty businesses such as dividend and provide?\nTim Spence: Yeah, sure. Happy to. I'll start that one, and if need be, Bryan can fill in here, Scott. So, I mean, listen, I think in general, the commentary we've provided about what we hear from clients is more or less the same. They are not pessimistic at that current point, but they're also not leaning forward in the saddle here, whether it's capital investments or pushing forward on M&A opportunities or building inventories or otherwise. The prospect we now face with rates being higher for longer definitely will weigh on plans. And so, I do expect that in general that if we're going to get growth, we have to get it principally through taking market share. I mean, the byproduct of that is that the places where we are expecting to see growth in the second half of the year are the places where we made investments to be able to do it. So, middle market C&I was strong in the first quarter. I gave a little bit of a breakout on the markets. A driver there in the Midwest and the Southeast both is the benefit that we get, the early benefit that you see from the federal stimulus programs on manufacturing, energy transition, infrastructure and otherwise, because our regions have gotten a disproportionate share of those dollars. I think in addition to that, we have a much larger sales force in the Southeast today than we did three years ago, and again the byproduct of that is we will continue to see an accretion of market share attached to those investments as those RMs become fully productive. Texas has been a really nice story for us. We've been in Texas for a little more than a decade now. We have I think it's 175 employees there roughly and it's a really nice complement to the strong commercial banking team that we built out in California a few years back in terms of expanding the middle market footprint. So, we expect to see growth in that area. And then lastly, on the industry vertical side, aerospace, defense, transportation and TMT are the places where the pipelines have -- we're seeing some pickup in the pipelines.\nScott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. And then, Bryan, I was hoping you could discuss -- I know that the numbers aren't huge here, but maybe you could discuss sort of the fluctuations in kind of reserve building versus reserve releasing outlook. I know it sounded like from your comments it'll be a little reserve build in connection with loan growth, but I think you were among the fewer sort of mid quarter when you said maybe a little release. So, just curious sort of the puts and takes as you see now.\nBryan Preston: Yeah. Thanks, Scott. I think the main thing there is two items. For the guidance for the rest of the year, that is under the assumption that there is no change to the economic outlooks as provided by Moody's. A big driver of the release this quarter was the economic outlook from Moody's did get better. So that was a factor. We also had end-to-period decrease in loans sequentially. So that was an item that drove the release as well. Next quarter, we did guide to stability on loans. So that's what we're saying kind of zero to $25 million. Mix could cause a little bit of build, but we do expect end-of-period loan growth in the second half of the year and that's where you get the larger numbers.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Okay. Wonderful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital. Your line is now open.\nGerard Cassidy: Hello. Can you hear me?\nTim Spence: We can. There we are. Good morning, Gerard. We couldn't for a minute there.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Tim. Yeah, thank you. Bryan, just to pick up on your comments about Moody's and the outlook, can you share with us how it's kind of evolved over the last two or three quarters? And what is their current outlook for the US economy in '24? Are they still calling for a slowdown or a recession, or are they actually in the camp now that we're going to have positive real GDP growth for 2024?\nBryan Preston: Their baseline scenario has had a bit of stability. It's certainly -- I don't think it is a significant -- there's no slowdown in 2024. They continue to push out their baseline expectations. They've also improved their downside scenario. That's had a little bit of a bigger impact on our reserve calculation. But overall, they're now in the camp of the economy continues to be moving well, and I don't think that they're expecting a significant slowdown at this point in 2024.\nGerard Cassidy: Got it. Thank you. And then, Tim, coming back to the growth, particularly in the commercial side, you gave us some very strong numbers, of course, particularly in your Southeast franchise. Can you take it a little deeper or give us a little more color? Once you bring on these clients like you mentioned about the customers that came in this quarter based on payments, how long does it take to get them to a return that you find -- passes your hurdle rate and you guys are happy with it? Is it a 12-month, 24-month period? Can you walk us through that kind of waterfall on how you get there? How many more products do they need in addition to payments or in addition to a loan to get them to your return levels?\nTim Spence: Yeah, sure. So, I'm going to do payments first and then we'll start with the loan, because payments is easy. So, the payments clients meet their return thresholds essentially out of the gate, Gerard, because you don't have credit attached, which means the capital you're holding is op risk capital. And it can take as long as 30 to 45 days to board a client, but because of some investments we made fortuitously for us prior to the deposit crisis last spring, we can board a client provided that the client is ready to do it in six days now on average. And that then allows for a very quick ramp and that's what's supporting the -- I think it's 11% growth in commercial payments fees year-over-year, that current pace. A high single-digit pace has been the goal there for a while and it requires us to get ramped quickly every time we add a new client. On the credit side of the equation, I think the beauty of the focus that we have on granularity right now is when we move a middle market relationship, it's generally a single bank relationship. And that means the credit comes on. It will take a month or two to move payables and receivables and otherwise and to get the payments flowing, but you hit the return threshold very quickly I would say generally well within a year on what we do in middle market. Where we are playing either at the upper end of middle market or in corporate banking, the return profile can develop over a longer period because quite often then the ancillary that we're focused on is not payments. It's the capital markets revenues. Where we lead, we get the returns quickly. Where we are a participant, we're a participant because we believe we can grow the relationship over time. And then, there is a strong discipline here to go back through the book every year. We do an operating review in every region with every corporate vertical and we have them show us the 25 lowest returning relationships in their portfolio, and there's either a relationship plan that we believe, or we exit.\nGerard Cassidy: And real quick, Tim, just to follow-up on that payments, the new customers that you've referenced.\nTim Spence: Yeah.\nGerard Cassidy: Are you -- are those customers that don't have a payments product already or are you taking them from a fintech company or a competitor?\nTim Spence: The disproportionate share of the clients that we are moving with conventional payments products and managed services are moving from another bank. So, it would be either they are a business that doesn't run with any leverage and that relationship moves, or they make a decision to move their payables or receivables business to Fifth Third because we can provide a superior service. So, that is a share shift. In the case of the embedded payments businesses, we are quite often helping people to build products into their software applications that didn't necessarily exist previously or where they had a smaller bank who had agreed to provide simple services and they're looking for somebody who's more robust controls the ability to support higher volumes. And then, in the case of the work we're doing on the technology side now, a simpler process to do integration and future product development.\nGerard Cassidy: Appreciate all the color. Thank you, Tim.\nTim Spence: Absolutely.\nOperator: Question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Good morning.\nTim Spence: Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess just one question for you, Tim. You've been fairly cautious on the macro outlook the last 12, 18 months. Has that changed today? And the reason I'm asking is I'm trying to sync that up with your messaging around buybacks both in terms of the back half and third quarter seem quite front-footed. So, just give us a sense of, do you feel better about economic outlook in your markets today than you did six or 12 months ago? And just broadly as a result of that, how are you thinking about capital allocation where should we expect some -- this level of sort of second half buybacks continuing absent growth reaccelerating next year? Thanks.\nTim Spence: Yeah. Ebrahim, thank you. And as you know, we're big believers in accountability here. So, I actually asked Matt to go back and look through the Q&A in the scripts from prior quarters to see when we got the first question on higher for longer rates, and you were the one that asked it, so -- in the fourth quarter of '22 earnings call. What we said was we thought the market was overly optimistic on how quickly inflation would come down, and I don't remember what event it was last December. But the comment that I made then was that we thought either the bond market or the equity market were wrong. The question was just which one. And then, if we had to guess, it was bonds. So, I think for certain we know now that the bond market was the side of the trade that was wrong at the beginning of the year. The factors that have influenced our more cautious outlook are pretty much exactly the same today as they were the last time we talked about it. We just view the current fiscal and monetary policies to be at odds and that the fiscal side in particular is unsustainable and inflationary over time. And the longer it goes on, right, the more that the Fed will need to remain higher for longer, which puts pressure on the long end of the curve. And then, I think as a knock on to that, we know that longer rates stay elevated, the more likely it is that you see adverse consequences either in asset prices or in credit performance. The big question is just how long does that take, right? When does that play out? And that is an area where we have low conviction. So, what we are trying to do and what we will always try to do in low conviction environments is be liquid, be neutral and be diversified. Because historically, when you had a change, things slowly but suddenly or slowly then suddenly sort of a dynamic plays out in terms of big environmental shifts. On capital priorities, we do continue to expect to buy back between $300 million and $400 million in shares in the second half of the year. Our level of confidence in that just comes from the strength of the capital generation of the franchise. As Bryan and I both mentioned, we had the highest ROE and the most stable ROE, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis of any of our investor peers, and that is the basis of the confidence. If the environment ends up softening and we don't see the loan growth, that will then create a capital opportunity because the capital need to support organic growth won't be there. So, you do have a buffer here if we do see a turn in the environment and softening in loan growth expectations. And if not, then we have more than enough capital generation to do $300 million to $400 million in second half of the year.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. That was helpful. And to be clear, it wasn't a planted question. But the other thing that caught my attention, you mentioned Texas and obviously you mentioned so we think about that Fifth Third Southeast. Just talk to us, remind us in terms of the strategy in Texas. Are we opening a lot of de novo branches there? And I'm assuming there's no near term M&A, but that does open up potential opportunities I guess down the road? Thanks.\nTim Spence: Yeah, absolutely. So, we got into Texas in 2012 when we formed our energy vertical. We have deeply experienced folks there who have done a really excellent job. And then, over the course of the past several years added middle market offices in Houston and Dallas, where we were able to attract very strong talents from trillionaire banks, who understand the focus we have on whole relationships and we're able to do what I think for us is a little bit unique, which is a heavy focus on C&I and then the delivery of the value-added services, whether they're capital markets or payments as opposed to a focus on either loan-only relationships or buying participations or investor real estate or otherwise. That business now also has specialty products, so ABL equipment leasing coverage. It has coverage dedicated treasury management. It has wealth and asset management support and then a non-public branch office, which allows us to do things on the pub fund side. What it does not have today is any retail banking presence. I wouldn't rule that out, but those are very large markets that we're talking about here. They're not markets of between 0.5 million and 3 million people, which has been the expansion strategy in the Southeast. So, any effort that we elect to make with branches in those markets will be a thing that we communicate to you in advance, because we'll be talking about committing 50 to 100 branches in a single city in many cases as opposed to what we're doing in the Southeast right now, which is really building 10 to 25 at an individual market level and getting to that top five presence that we know we need to be able to support the primary banking model.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator: Question comes from John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nTim Spence: Good morning.\nJohn Pancari: On the NII outlook of down 2% to 4%, I know previously your -- last quarter your forecast was forward curve as well and you had five or six cuts in that assumption and now you're sticking to the forward curve, so much less of three cuts I'd say is in the forward curve now. However, your NII guide has remained intact despite that. Can you maybe just talk a little bit around it -- around the ability to keep that outlook without changing it? And then, what does that mean in terms of your margin forecast? I know you indicated that it's bottomed as well as NII now, but as you look through the year, what type of trajectory do you see in the margin? Thanks.\nBryan Preston: Yeah, John, thanks for the question. It's one where the main thing that I would highlight for you is that we continue to have very strong benefits from the fixed rate asset repricing at this point. And you can see this -- for us, you can see that in our actual numbers. Year-over-year our indirect secured consumer business, which is primarily our indirect auto business, that's up 100 basis points year-over-year on a $15 billion portfolio. So, $150 million of annualized benefit in a year where we were actually constraining production in auto because of the RWA diet. So, those businesses we have, those medium-term fixed rate lending assets, whether it's the auto business, RV Marine, whether it's solar provide, generate a lot of power for us in terms of earnings capacity. Over the next 12 months, we'll have enough fixed rate assets reprice that will generate $350 million, $400 million plus of annualized NII benefit. So, even in a higher rate environment and with the curve selling off some, that benefit is increasing for us. So that is a good outcome for us that helps support and offset some continued migration from a DDA perspective, as well as some continued forecasted increases in deposit costs overall. We're not making any assumptions that the deposit environment and the competition and the increasing cost is over, but it is definitely moderating. From a NIM perspective, we do expect positive NIM from here as well. We're only talking about a couple of few basis points a quarter trajectory. A big wild card on the magnitude of the NIM increases just ultimately is where the cash position ends up. If we continue to have really strong performance out of our deposit franchise above the 2% to 3% that we're guiding to, NIM will be a little bit lower, but NII will be better as a result of that. But overall, we feel really good about the absolute positioning.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Thanks, Bryan. Very helpful. And then separately on the credit side, NPA is up a bit this quarter. If you could just give us a little bit of color on what you're seeing in terms of credit migration and maybe by sector. We're hearing a bit of stress on the transportation sector. We have aviation credit impacted some of the names as well as some banks flagging healthcare. So, if you could just give us a little bit of color there and maybe also your confidence in your 35 basis point to 45 basis point charge-off guidance? Thanks.\nGreg Schroeck: Yeah, great. Thanks. Great question. So, of the $59 million increase that we saw in NPAs this quarter, $49 million of it was in commercial, two names, not in the industries that you had indicated. We had a retail trade name and a senior living trade name. So, we are continuing to see stress on the healthcare side, specifically in the senior living. That's not a huge portfolio for us and we think we have our hands around it, continue to review that portfolio on a consistent basis. So, not overly concerned. The thing that we have been consistently saying and we continue to see is we just -- we are not seeing trends by geography, by product, by industry. Our issues that have bubbled up have been more episodic and we've been able to deal with those episodic events on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So, I am not expecting to see a linear increase in our NPAs. To your last question, I still feel very good about the guidance. Bryan talked about earlier, 35 basis point to 45 basis point for the year based on -- again, Tim mentioned our commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform very, very well. The rest of our C&I borrowers continue to perform well. They've done a nice job with expense cutting. They've done a nice job passing along pricing. They're operating about as efficiently as we've seen them. We're taking a cautious view as well, not sure where rates are going to go. So, we're not seeing a lot of CapEx. But overall, we like the behaviors of our C&I portfolio, and I think the results of our commercial real estate portfolio speak for themselves.\nJohn Pancari: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nTim Spence: Absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKen Usdin: Thank you. Good morning. Just want to follow-up with Bryan. Bryan, you mentioned the annualized dollar impact from those fixed rate securities and loans. I think you said previously that was $12 billion. I'm just wondering if you have an understanding of what you know will be also repricing in '25, and is that -- I would assume that would also then be incremental to that annualized benefit you referred to earlier?\nBryan Preston: That's right. We do have a similar amount that will happen in '25. And actually, we've been in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion a quarter repricing overall on the portfolio between loans and investment portfolio. The investment portfolio has actually been, say, $600 million to $800 million a quarter range. That number is actually going to start accelerating later this year as we start to get some maturities on the bullet/locked-out structures. We're expecting over $1 billion in the fourth quarter and a pace similar to that in 2025. So, this benefit and the repricing is going to continue and actually pick up a little bit and that's where the higher for longer environment, as long as the frontend stays relatively stable, because that will help keep deposit costs stable, the higher long end will actually help and contribute to higher income over time.\nKen Usdin: Okay. And then also you mentioned keeping the cash and securities at around the same level. Can you talk about just how you're preparing for liquidity rules and what that will mean in terms of that -- how you think about the mix of -- across portfolios and the amount of cash you want to keep?\nBryan Preston: Yeah. We are there today for whatever comes out from a liquidity rule perspective. So, we will not have to make any material changes to the balance sheet compared to what we have today. What will happen over time as the loss position on the investment portfolio burns off, that will actually increase the liquidity contribution from the investment portfolio, so we can take the cash -- start to take the cash position down. Also we will start to remix the composition of our investment portfolio to continue to shift more into level one securities which will also help us take the cash position down over time. So, it will be just a natural transition where the balance sheet will get a little bit lighter from a cash and securities perspective as time passes. But we're very well positioned for any pending liquidity rules.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Thank you, Bryan.\nOperator: Next question comes from Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nVivek Juneja: Thanks. Tim and Bryan, a question for you on the Southeast. How much do you have in deposits there now? And what are you doing in terms of consumer side loans? Where do those stand relative to deposits?\nTim Spence: Sure. Let me start on the consumer loan side and then Bryan will fill in on the detail on deposits. So, the balance sheet in the Southeast on the consumer side for the core banking relationships is a net funding provider for us. Vivek, the sort of general development of a customer relationship is acquire the primary DDA via direct marketing and the work that we do around the new branches as we build them. The payments products are an important part of primacy. So, credit card would come after that. And then, from there, you have the episodic opportunities whether that's home equity, because there is some improvement going on or mortgage, although there obviously hasn't been a lot of that in the environment over the course of the past few years. The auto business, the dividend solar finance business in particular do have strong production in Florida, just because of the size of the population relative to the other states where we do business. But they're really unconnected to deposits. Bryan, you want to talk about the individual markets and deposit balances?\nBryan Preston: Yeah, absolutely. We've got about overall about $31 billion in deposits in the Southeast now. About -- over half of that relates to the consumer franchise. So, we're doing very strong in consumer on that front. And as Tim mentioned, we are -- it is a net provider of funding. We only have about $18 billion worth of loans in the Southeast.\nVivek Juneja: And I would imagine most of those are on the commercial side, as Tim said, at this point?\nBryan Preston: Yes.\nTim Spence: Yeah, absolutely.\nVivek Juneja: Separate question. Solar, I noticed your growth has slowed as you've been indicating. Any update on what you're thinking in terms of originations, loan growth as well as credit?\nTim Spence: Yeah. Well, I'll start and we'll get Greg to answer on credit. We are still number two, right? We are the number two largest financer in the residential solar market. And the byproduct of that is our growth opportunity has as much to do with the market size as it does anything else at this stage. And right now with rates being high and with net metering having been rolled back in a couple of places, you just have an affordability issue where the cost of purchasing energy off the grid is cheaper than it would be to finance solar installations. I think the other dynamic is that as rates rise, and this is I think ironically it's the same phenomenon in auto is as rates rise, the mix of leased financed installation shifts toward leases, which means as a lender, the solar is going to be down. I think the estimate from the industry is like 13%, 14% this year, Vivek, in terms of total installations. You're going to see a more significant decline in the financing volumes. So, we built our plan around being down 30% year-over-year. And I think in a higher for longer environment, that's probably right. If it's any softer than that, it's just going to be a byproduct of this continued dynamic on the lease versus finance, and does it make sense to -- can you offset energy costs on a zero basis with the cost of the equipment that's being installed. Greg?\nGreg Schroeck: And on the credit side, the solar dividend credit losses are performing right as we model right around 1.3%. We actually think we'll run a little bit better for the remainder of this year. Early volume within the portfolio is seasoning. So, we saw a little bit of seasonality this quarter, but we feel good about what we're seeing. And we certainly have more optimistic view for the rest of this year.\nBryan Preston: And then just on the volume front for originations for solar, I know this question came up earlier as well, we're probably talking closer to $1.7 billion to $2 billion of originations this year, just given the dynamics that Tim mentioned earlier.\nVivek Juneja: Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nManan Gosalia: Hey, good morning. I wanted to touch on deposit competition. You compete with several of the money center banks in several markets. How are you thinking about deposit competition as QT continues, as RRP balances continue to decline and the focus shifts back to bank deposits? How do you think deposit competition will trend in that environment?\nBryan Preston: We think that is certainly a big question for us and for the industry, and it's one of the items why we highlighted that our NII guidance at this point is less rate environment dependent and more dependent on just the overall level of deposit competition. As you mentioned, we do compete against the money center banks as well as a lot of regionals across our different markets. In the Midwest, we compete against JPMorgan primarily. They're the number one bank in most of our markets. We're the number two bank in those markets. So, we see them and face off against them. And obviously, in the Southeast, we deal with Bank of America, Wells and Truist, so very significant competition. In general, it does feel like the broader liquidity environment has stabilized versus what we saw midyear last year. So, even with a little bit of weakness from an overall industry deposit perspective at this point unless something really breaks in the liquidity system, we're not expecting the significant food fight for cash that happened last year as people were just scrambling to show that they had a stable balance sheet. But it does mean that over time that you're likely to see just a potential increase in competition. The big counter for this is really going to be whether or not loan growth shows up or not. If there's no loan growth for the industry, there's not going to be a need for significant competition for deposits. And so, broadly speaking, we think competition probably stays lighter than what we saw last year, especially in a stable environment, also at a time where we think the whole industry is going to be focused on maintaining profitability. So, we do think that will moderate some of the pressures, but the bottoming of the RRP and potential decreases in bank reserves as QT continues, certainly could create some pressure in the medium term.\nManan Gosalia: Got it. And then maybe a bigger picture question. Tim, in your annual letter, you talked about rationalizing the business model in response to the tougher regulatory environment. You used the RWA data as an example. Bigger picture, what do you think the evolution of the model for Fifth Third and other banks of your size will look like going forward? Maybe there's more partnerships with private credit or there's a pivot to more fee-based businesses. But in what ways will Fifth Third look different in five or seven years from now versus today?\nTim Spence: Yeah. So, a few things just on the industry in general and Fifth Third on that front. One, we've got to find a way to reignite growth in labor productivity, right? I think that's true of the economy in total, but you'd see the same thing if you look at the banking sector is despite all the investments that have been made in technology over the course of the past 10, 15 years. Aside from branch rationalizations, you can't really point to a lot of examples where there were big productivity lifts. So, whether it's the cloud platforms we're putting in, where we should be able to drive more straight-through processing, or the use of AI or otherwise, overheads have to come down. That is going to be an important point of focus for us through the value streams and through the tech modernization work that we're doing. I think secondarily, there are going to be businesses that regional banks or community banks just don't compete in, in the future, if there isn't a rationalization of the way that the non-credit wallet is shared. And large public companies would be a good example of that space, right? We did our diet last year. We walked away from companies where we were an important lender, but we weren't getting a fair share of the ancillaries because they were being consumed by the money center banks. That's either going to require the money centers to make larger individual commitments in order to justify the ancillary or it's going to require that the treasurers that those companies reallocate the wallet proportionally. So, I and -- my own view is at least initially you're going to see a shift there. I think private credit is going to be an interesting one to watch. Like there isn't a great track record historically for people growing as fast as private credit is growing and completely avoiding mistakes. I also have a hard time figuring out what the comparative advantage is there that's defensible if the model works. And I would prefer always, since we are a good deposit gathering institution, that we'd be able, if there's good money to be made and the valuations that are being placed on these credit fund providers, certainly suggest there is, that we'd be holding those assets on balance sheet. So that is not been an immediate point of focus for us. And then lastly, as we've talked about in the past, it's hard to imagine that whether it's 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000, it's hard to imagine that there are going to be 4,000 banks. And you're just going to have to see some consolidation and people retreating to places where they have density and focusing on markets where they can neutralize the scale advantages that the large banks have because you're the same size in the area where you compete versus being seven, eight, nine, 10 ranked in every market across the US, which is just fundamentally less defensible business strategy.\nManan Gosalia: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Christopher Marinac from Janney. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Marinac: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about possible changes on risk grades in criticized and classifieds. I know it might be premature to see anything upgraded, but just curious on the path of those that you saw and how that may evolve this year.\nGreg Schroeck: Yeah, it's a great question. So again, probably not going to be linear, it's going to be lumpy. It has been for us in the past given current previous comments I made about episodic, more episodic events and the fact that we're just not seeing trending by industry, by geography. And so, I would expect it to continue to be lumpy. But as I said earlier, we're still liking the way our C&I portfolio is behaving. We like our commercial real estate track record an awful lot. But with higher for longer, maybe higher forever interest rates, we're going to continue to see stress and we're going to continue to proactively manage the portfolio as we have. We're not doing deep dives because on an ongoing basis, we are stressing the C&I portfolio by 200 basis points. We're getting out ahead of any potential issues, but that could lead to some criticized assets, a special mention. We're doing the same thing, do something on the commercial real estate side, exit stress testing. So, we're taking a look at maturities and we're stressing by 100 basis points a forward curve on what that loan looks like at maturity. And so, if we see weakness there, we could see an elevation in criticized assets, but 99% of our accruing criticized assets are current, right? And if you include our non-accrual, we're still 93%, 94% current within that portfolio. So, we'll see episodic kind of lumpiness for the remainder of the year.\nChristopher Marinac: Great. Thank you for that. And just a quick follow-up. I mean, the loss content ultimately is reflected in the reserve. So that would have to change a lot for you to kind of change your guide on reserve overall?\nGreg Schroeck: Exactly.\nTim Spence: Thanks for that, Chris. I think we don't have any other questions in the queue, but we'd be remiss if we didn't say congratulations to [Erica] (ph) and her family since she wasn't able to join us today before we wrap up our call.\nMatt Curoe: Thanks, Tim. And thanks, Ellie, and thanks everyone for joining -- for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any other follow-up questions. Ellie, you may now disconnect the call.\nOperator: Thank you for everyone attending the call today. We all hope you have a wonderful day. Stay safe.",

            "name": "Greg Schroeck",
            "content": "Yeah, great. Thanks. Great question. So, of the $59 million increase that we saw in NPAs this quarter, $49 million of it was in commercial, two names, not in the industries that you had indicated. We had a retail trade name and a senior living trade name. So, we are continuing to see stress on the healthcare side, specifically in the senior living. That's not a huge portfolio for us and we think we have our hands around it, continue to review that portfolio on a consistent basis. So, not overly concerned. The thing that we have been consistently saying and we continue to see is we just -- we are not seeing trends by geography, by product, by industry. Our issues that have bubbled up have been more episodic and we've been able to deal with those episodic events on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So, I am not expecting to see a linear increase in our NPAs. To your last question, I still feel very good about the guidance. Bryan talked about earlier, 35 basis point to 45 basis point for the year based on -- again, Tim mentioned our commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform very, very well. The rest of our C&I borrowers continue to perform well. They've done a nice job with expense cutting. They've done a nice job passing along pricing. They're operating about as efficiently as we've seen them. We're taking a cautious view as well, not sure where rates are going to go. So, we're not seeing a lot of CapEx. But overall, we like the behaviors of our C&I portfolio, and I think the results of our commercial real estate portfolio speak for themselves. And on the credit side, the solar dividend credit losses are performing right as we model right around 1.3%. We actually think we'll run a little bit better for the remainder of this year. Early volume within the portfolio is seasoning. So, we saw a little bit of seasonality this quarter, but we feel good about what we're seeing.

            "name": "Tim Spence",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe that great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate challenging ones. In that sense, the uncertainty we face in the current environment provides us with an opportunity to demonstrate that our focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order will produce consistently strong, some might even say boring, financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.70, or $0.76 excluding the Visa, Mastercard settlement litigation charges and the additional FDIC special assessment. All major income statement captions were in line with or better than the guidance that we provided in our January earnings call. Our adjusted return on equity and return on assets are the highest of all peers who have reported thus far and the most stable when compared to results from the first quarter of 2023. We grew period-end deposits compared to the prior quarter and generated annualized consumer household growth of 3%, punctuated by 7% growth in our Southeast markets. Since 2018, we have built more than 100 de novo branches in the Southeast. As a portfolio, they are exceeding our expectations, having achieved 112% of their household growth goals and 132% of the deposit goals built into the business cases. Florida is our top performing de novo market, with deposit dollars at 195% in gold. J.D. Power also recently named Fifth Third number one for retail banking customer satisfaction in the Florida market. Importantly, net interest margins improved in the quarter, driven by stabilizing deposit costs with interest-bearing deposit costs increasing only 1 basis point sequentially. Consistent with our guidance last year, the fourth quarter of 2023 marked the low point for NIM and we believe the first quarter of 2024 will mark the low point for NII. While end-of-period loan balances were down 1% compared to the prior quarter, we saw solid middle market loan growth across our footprint with Tennessee, the Carolinas, Kentucky, Indiana and Texas achieving the strongest results. Our footprint continues to benefit in an outsized way from federal incentives to bolster investments in domestic manufacturing and energy infrastructure. The Midwest and Southeast have received more investment per capita than other US regions in industries as diverse as multimodal logistics, semiconductors, batteries and pet food. Treasury management and wealth and asset management were the strongest contributors to fee income, driven by the strategic investments we have been making in both areas. Treasury management revenue grew 11% year-over-year, driven by our software-enabled managed services payments offerings, and Newline, our embedded payments business. Over one-third of the new treasury management relationships added in the quarter were payments led and had no credit extended. Wealth and asset management fee revenues grew 10% year-over-year, highlighted by strong growth in Fifth Third Wealth Advisors. The RIA platform we launched in 2022, which recently crossed $1 billion in assets under management. Our credit performance remained stable, highlighted by continued strength in our commercial real estate portfolio. We posted another quarter of zero net charge-offs in CRE and have less than $3 million of NPAs in our non-owner-occupied portfolio. While we expect that broader credit trends will continue to normalize, our emphasis on client selection and credit discipline helps to ensure that we have a well-diversified portfolio, not overly concentrated in any asset class, industry or geography. Expenses are well controlled. Adjusted for discrete items highlighted in the release, expenses declined 1% year-over-year driven by savings realized through process automation and our focus on value streams. Expense discipline is what has allowed us to make the long-term investments in our business necessary to generate superior returns and operating leverage through the cycle. Looking forward to the rest of the year, we remain cautious given the wide range of potential economic and geopolitical scenarios that could materialize. Depending on how you read the most recent data, inflation is either sticky at 3%, slowly moving down to 2%, or moving back up past 4%. Geopolitical tensions remain elevated and deficit spending, green energy investments and the domestication of supply chains are all inherently inflationary in the medium term. We believe the best way to manage in uncertain times is to stay liquid, stay neutrally positioned and stay broadly diversified while investing with the long-term in mind. That is what we intend to do. I want to thank our employees. Your hustle, heart and dedication are why we've been recognized thus far in 2024 as one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune, one of the Best Brands for Customer Service by Forbes, and one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. Thank you for keeping our shareholders, customers and communities at the center of everything we do. With that, I'll now turn it over to Bryan to provide additional details on our first quarter results and our current outlook for 2024. We can. Good morning, Mike. We definitely took advantage of the fact that we have I think at this point with the investments that have been made down there, Mike, a higher natural share than we did existing market share rights. So, we were able to use the Southeast as a mechanism to raise deposits without repricing existing relationships to the same degree that we would have if we were using those rate offers in markets where we had high existing shares. I think though, what's important is that what's driving the growth in the Southeast is the household growth. And those relationships are that vast majority momentum banking relationships, which means the core deposit product is a non-interest-bearing deposit product. So, the 7% growth in the Southeast when you break it apart, the research triangle is like 25% year-over-year. Most of the major markets in Florida were in the mid to high teens, Tampa 11% or 12%, Broward County and north in Southeast Florida 17%, 18% year-over-year household growth rates. So, we're gaining share in a way that then allows us to make decisions about whether we want to move more of the deposit wallet where obviously rate is part of it, or where then we have the opportunity to introduce the fee-based businesses on the consumer side of the equation, and in commercial third of the relationships that we added in treasury managers, we mentioned this last quarter, were payments led. So, they're not driven by deposit rates or credit as the entry point. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Happy to. I'll start that one, and if need be, Bryan can fill in here, Scott. So, I mean, listen, I think in general, the commentary we've provided about what we hear from clients is more or less the same. They are not pessimistic at that current point, but they're also not leaning forward in the saddle here, whether it's capital investments or pushing forward on M&A opportunities or building inventories or otherwise. The prospect we now face with rates being higher for longer definitely will weigh on plans. And so, I do expect that in general that if we're going to get growth, we have to get it principally through taking market share. I mean, the byproduct of that is that the places where we are expecting to see growth in the second half of the year are the places where we made investments to be able to do it. So, middle market C&I was strong in the first quarter. I gave a little bit of a breakout on the markets. A driver there in the Midwest and the Southeast both is the benefit that we get, the early benefit that you see from the federal stimulus programs on manufacturing, energy transition, infrastructure and otherwise, because our regions have gotten a disproportionate share of those dollars. I think in addition to that, we have a much larger sales force in the Southeast today than we did three years ago, and again the byproduct of that is we will continue to see an accretion of market share attached to those investments as those RMs become fully productive. Texas has been a really nice story for us. We've been in Texas for a little more than a decade now. We have I think it's 175 employees there roughly and it's a really nice complement to the strong commercial banking team that we built out in California a few years back in terms of expanding the middle market footprint. So, we expect to see growth in that area. And then lastly, on the industry vertical side, aerospace, defense, transportation and TMT are the places where the pipelines have -- we're seeing some pickup in the pipelines. We can. There we are. Good morning, Gerard. We couldn't for a minute there. Yeah, sure. So, I'm going to do payments first and then we'll start with the loan, because payments is easy. So, the payments clients meet their return thresholds essentially out of the gate, Gerard, because you don't have credit attached, which means the capital you're holding is op risk capital. And it can take as long as 30 to 45 days to board a client, but because of some investments we made fortuitously for us prior to the deposit crisis last spring, we can board a client provided that the client is ready to do it in six days now on average. And that then allows for a very quick ramp and that's what's supporting the -- I think it's 11% growth in commercial payments fees year-over-year, that current pace. A high single-digit pace has been the goal there for a while and it requires us to get ramped quickly every time we add a new client. On the credit side of the equation, I think the beauty of the focus that we have on granularity right now is when we move a middle market relationship, it's generally a single bank relationship. And that means the credit comes on. It will take a month or two to move payables and receivables and otherwise and to get the payments flowing, but you hit the return threshold very quickly I would say generally well within a year on what we do in middle market. Where we are playing either at the upper end of middle market or in corporate banking, the return profile can develop over a longer period because quite often then the ancillary that we're focused on is not payments. It's the capital markets revenues. Where we lead, we get the returns quickly. Where we are a participant, we're a participant because we believe we can grow the relationship over time. And then, there is a strong discipline here to go back through the book every year. We do an operating review in every region with every corporate vertical and we have them show us the 25 lowest returning relationships in their portfolio, and there's either a relationship plan that we believe, or we exit. Yeah. The disproportionate share of the clients that we are moving with conventional payments products and managed services are moving from another bank. So, it would be either they are a business that doesn't run with any leverage and that relationship moves, or they make a decision to move their payables or receivables business to Fifth Third because we can provide a superior service. So, that is a share shift. In the case of the embedded payments businesses, we are quite often helping people to build products into their software applications that didn't necessarily exist previously or where they had a smaller bank who had agreed to provide simple services and they're looking for somebody who's more robust controls the ability to support higher volumes. And then, in the case of the work we're doing on the technology side now, a simpler process to do integration and future product development. Absolutely. Good morning. Yeah. Ebrahim, thank you. And as you know, we're big believers in accountability here. So, I actually asked Matt to go back and look through the Q&A in the scripts from prior quarters to see when we got the first question on higher for longer rates, and you were the one that asked it, so -- in the fourth quarter of '22 earnings call. What we said was we thought the market was overly optimistic on how quickly inflation would come down, and I don't remember what event it was last December. But the comment that I made then was that we thought either the bond market or the equity market were wrong. The question was just which one. And then, if we had to guess, it was bonds. So, I think for certain we know now that the bond market was the side of the trade that was wrong at the beginning of the year. The factors that have influenced our more cautious outlook are pretty much exactly the same today as they were the last time we talked about it. We just view the current fiscal and monetary policies to be at odds and that the fiscal side in particular is unsustainable and inflationary over time. And the longer it goes on, right, the more that the Fed will need to remain higher for longer, which puts pressure on the long end of the curve. And then, I think as a knock on to that, we know that longer rates stay elevated, the more likely it is that you see adverse consequences either in asset prices or in credit performance. The big question is just how long does that take, right? When does that play out? And that is an area where we have low conviction. So, what we are trying to do and what we will always try to do in low conviction environments is be liquid, be neutral and be diversified. Because historically, when you had a change, things slowly but suddenly or slowly then suddenly sort of a dynamic plays out in terms of big environmental shifts. On capital priorities, we do continue to expect to buy back between $300 million and $400 million in shares in the second half of the year. Our level of confidence in that just comes from the strength of the capital generation of the franchise. As Bryan and I both mentioned, we had the highest ROE and the most stable ROE, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis of any of our investor peers, and that is the basis of the confidence. If the environment ends up softening and we don't see the loan growth, that will then create a capital opportunity because the capital need to support organic growth won't be there. So, you do have a buffer here if we do see a turn in the environment and softening in loan growth expectations. And if not, then we have more than enough capital generation to do $300 million to $400 million in second half of the year. Yeah, absolutely. So, we got into Texas in 2012 when we formed our energy vertical. We have deeply experienced folks there who have done a really excellent job. And then, over the course of the past several years added middle market offices in Houston and Dallas, where we were able to attract very strong talents from trillionaire banks, who understand the focus we have on whole relationships and we're able to do what I think for us is a little bit unique, which is a heavy focus on C&I and then the delivery of the value-added services, whether they're capital markets or payments as opposed to a focus on either loan-only relationships or buying participations or investor real estate or otherwise. That business now also has specialty products, so ABL equipment leasing coverage. It has coverage dedicated treasury management. It has wealth and asset management support and then a non-public branch office, which allows us to do things on the pub fund side. What it does not have today is any retail banking presence. I wouldn't rule that out, but those are very large markets that we're talking about here. They're not markets of between 0.5 million and 3 million people, which has been the expansion strategy in the Southeast. So, any effort that we elect to make with branches in those markets will be a thing that we communicate to you in advance, because we'll be talking about committing 50 to 100 branches in a single city in many cases as opposed to what we're doing in the Southeast right now, which is really building 10 to 25 at an individual market level and getting to that top five presence that we know we need to be able to support the primary banking model. Good morning. Absolutely. Sure. Let me start on the consumer loan side and then Bryan will fill in on the detail on deposits. So, the balance sheet in the Southeast on the consumer side for the core banking relationships is a net funding provider for us. Vivek, the sort of general development of a customer relationship is acquire the primary DDA via direct marketing and the work that we do around the new branches as we build them. The payments products are an important part of primacy. So, credit card would come after that. And then, from there, you have the episodic opportunities whether that's home equity, because there is some improvement going on or mortgage, although there obviously hasn't been a lot of that in the environment over the course of the past few years. The auto business, the dividend solar finance business in particular do have strong production in Florida, just because of the size of the population relative to the other states where we do business. But they're really unconnected to deposits. Bryan, you want to talk about the individual markets and deposit balances? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Well, I'll start and we'll get Greg to answer on credit. We are still number two, right? We are the number two largest financer in the residential solar market. And the byproduct of that is our growth opportunity has as much to do with the market size as it does anything else at this stage. And right now with rates being high and with net metering having been rolled back in a couple of places, you just have an affordability issue where the cost of purchasing energy off the grid is cheaper than it would be to finance solar installations. I think the other dynamic is that as rates rise, and this is I think ironically it's the same phenomenon in auto is as rates rise, the mix of leased financed installation shifts toward leases, which means as a lender, the solar is going to be down. I think the estimate from the industry is like 13%, 14% this year, Vivek, in terms of total installations. You're going to see a more significant decline in the financing volumes. So, we built our plan around being down 30% year-over-year. And I think in a higher for longer environment, that's probably right. If it's any softer than that, it's just going to be a byproduct of this continued dynamic on the lease versus finance, and does it make sense to -- can you offset energy costs on a zero basis with the cost of the equipment that's being installed. Greg? Yeah. So, a few things just on the industry in general and Fifth Third on that front. One, we've got to find a way to reignite growth in labor productivity, right? I think that's true of the economy in total, but you'd see the same thing if you look at the banking sector is despite all the investments that have been made in technology over the course of the past 10, 15 years. Aside from branch rationalizations, you can't really point to a lot of examples where there were big productivity lifts. So, whether it's the cloud platforms we're putting in, where we should be able to drive more straight-through processing, or the use of AI or otherwise, overheads have to come down. That is going to be an important point of focus for us through the value streams and through the tech modernization work that we're doing. I think secondarily, there are going to be businesses that regional banks or community banks just don't compete in, in the future, if there isn't a rationalization of the way that the non-credit wallet is shared. And large public companies would be a good example of that space, right? We did our diet last year. We walked away from companies where we were an important lender, but we weren't getting a fair share of the ancillaries because they were being consumed by the money center banks. That's either going to require the money centers to make larger individual commitments in order to justify the ancillary or it's going to require that the treasurers that those companies reallocate the wallet proportionally. So, I and -- my own view is at least initially you're going to see a shift there. I think private credit is going to be an interesting one to watch. Like there isn't a great track record historically for people growing as fast as private credit is growing and completely avoiding mistakes. I also have a hard time figuring out what the comparative advantage is there that's defensible if the model works. And I would prefer always, since we are a good deposit gathering institution, that we'd be able, if there's good money to be made and the valuations that are being placed on these credit fund providers, certainly suggest there is, that we'd be holding those assets on balance sheet. So that is not been an immediate point of focus for us. And then lastly, as we've talked about in the past, it's hard to imagine that whether it's 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000, it's hard to imagine that there are going to be 4,000 banks. And you're just going to have to see some consolidation and people retreating to places where they have density and focusing on markets where they can neutralize the scale advantages that the large banks have because you're the same size in the area where you compete versus being seven, eight, nine, 10 ranked in every market across the US, which is just fundamentally less defensible business strategy. Thanks for that, Chris. I think we don't have any other questions in the queue, but we'd be remiss if we didn't say congratulations to [Erica] (ph) and her family since she wasn't able to join us today before we wrap up our call."

            "content": "Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Our first quarter results were a strong start to the year, reflecting our balance sheet strength, disciplined expense and credit risk management and diversified fee revenue streams. We saw new household growth accelerate and new quality relationships in commercial post steady gains. For over a year, we have highlighted the importance of maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility in an uncertain economic and interest rate environment. Our first quarter results evidence the strength of our current position, which should produce strong and stable returns across a wide range of economic outcomes. This approach has served us well as rate cut expectations are pushed out. As Tim mentioned, our profitability remains strong as we have the highest ROA and ROE, and among the best efficiency ratios of our peers that have reported to date in a quarter in which we have outsized seasonal compensation expenses. On a year-over-year basis, we were the most stable for both ROA and ROE, and among the most stable for NII and the efficiency ratio. Our consistent and strong earnings added 15 basis points to CET1 during the quarter inclusive of absorbing 8 basis points impact from the CECL phase in. Turning to the income statement. Net interest income for the quarter was $1.4 billion and consistent with our expectations. Interest-bearing deposit costs were well managed and increased only 1 basis point compared to the prior quarter. The balance sheet continues to be reflective of defensive positioning with optionality to navigate the changing economic and interest rate environments. Net interest margin improved 1 basis point for the quarter. Increased yields on new production of fixed rate consumer loans and day count benefits contribute to the growth and were partially offset by the deposit balance migration from demand to interest-bearing accounts. This increase in NIM is the first sequential improvement since the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the impacts of security gains and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income decreased 1% from a year ago quarter due to lower revenue in commercial banking, leasing and mortgage, partially offset by strong growth in treasury management and wealth and asset management fees, where both saw double-digit revenue growth over the prior year. The securities gains of $10 million reflected the mark-to-market impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which is more than offset in compensation expense. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 1% compared to the year ago quarter due to our continued focus on expense discipline and the ongoing benefits from our process automation efforts. While expenses are down versus the prior year, we continue to invest in opening new branches and increase marketing spend to drive household growth. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 8% sequentially as expected due to seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes in addition to $15 million of expense from the previously mentioned non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially. Average commercial portfolio loans decreased 2% due to lower demand from corporate banking borrowers and the average balance impact of last year's RWA diet, which reduced both total commitments and loan balances during the second half of 2023. Middle market loans increased during the quarter as we drive for more granularity and our winning private bank relationships. As Tim discussed, we saw solid middle market loan growth across our footprint. Period-end commercial revolver utilization was 36%, a 1% increase from the prior quarter, also driven by middle market. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially due to the overall slowdown in residential mortgage originations given the rate environment, offset by growth from solar energy installation loans and indirect auto originations. Average core deposits decreased 1% sequentially, driven primarily by normal seasonality within our business. Decreases in DDA balances and CDs were partially offset by increases in interest checking. By segment, average consumer deposits decreased 1% sequentially, while both commercial and wealth deposits were flat. Consumer deposits rebounded towards the end of the quarter to finish slightly higher than at the start of the quarter. As Tim mentioned, we are very pleased with the results of our multiyear Southeast branch investments, which are driving both strong household growth and granular insured deposits. DDA as a percent of core deposits was 25% as of the end of the first quarter compared to 26% in the prior quarter. Migration of DDA balances continued during the first quarter and we expect that trend to carry on in 2024, but at a slower pace than in prior quarters. We ended the quarter with full category 1 LCR compliance at 135% and our loan to core deposit ratio was 71%. The strong funding profile continues to provide us with great flexibility. Moving to credit. Asset quality trends remained well behaved and below historical averages. The net charge-off ratio was 38 basis points, which was up 6 basis points sequentially and consistent with our guidance. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased 2 basis points sequentially to 29 bps. The NPA ratio increased 5 basis points to 64 basis points. We have maintained our credit discipline by generating and maintaining granular high-quality relationships and by managing concentration risks to any asset class, region or industry. In consumer, our focus remains on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained our conservative underwriting policies. We continue to see the expected normalization of delinquency and credit loss trends from the historically low levels experienced over the last couple of years. From an overall credit risk management perspective, we assess forward-looking client vulnerabilities based on firm-specific and industry trends and closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher for longer interest rates may cause stress. Moving to the ACL. Our reserve coverage ratio remained unchanged at 2.12% and included a $16 million reserve release, driven by lower end-of-period loan balances and modest improvements in the economic scenarios. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Moving to capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.44% and we continue to believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level. As a reminder, at the beginning of the quarter, we moved $12.6 billion of securities to held to maturity. This represented one quarter of our AFS portfolio and was done when the five- and 10-year treasury rates were below 4%. The move reduced AOCI volatility to capital due to our investment portfolio by around 50% during the first quarter. Our pro forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the AFS securities portfolio, is 7.8%. We expect improvement in the unrealized securities losses in our portfolio given that 60% of the AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked-out securities, which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. Approximately 26% of the AOCI related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025 and approximately 62% by the end of 2028 assuming the forward curve plays out. Moving to our current outlook. We expect full year average total loans to be down 2% compared to 2023, consistent with our prior expectations. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of the 2023 RWA diet on average balances as well as lower mortgage production due to the higher interest rate environment. While we expect full year average total loans to decrease, we expect average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, with both commercial and consumer balances up low single-digits by the end of 2024. We are also assuming commercial revolver utilization remains stable. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect average total loan balances to be stable. We expect softness in commercial due to uncertainty on the interest rate and economic outlooks to be offset by consumer loan growth, which is expected to be up due to solar and auto originations. Our retail household growth and commercial payments growth remained robust in the first quarter, and those outcomes will drive deposit growth in 2024. However, we are mindful of potential economic and market headwinds for monetary policy. Therefore, we are forecasting full year average core deposit growth of only 2% to 3% compared to our 5% growth realized in 2023. While we expect DDA migration to continue given the high absolute level of interest rates, the pace of migration has declined. If rates remain at current levels, we expect to see the DDA mix dip below 25% during the middle of the year. Shifting to the income statement. Given the stabilization in our deposit costs and the benefit we are seeing from the repricing of our fixed rate loan book, we continue to expect the full year NII to decrease 2% to 4%, and as Tim mentioned, we expect the NII and NIM trough is behind us. This outlook is consistent with the forward curve as of early April, which projected three total cuts. However, our balance sheet is neutrally positioned so that even with zero cuts in 2024, we expect stability in our NII outlook. The primary risk to our NII performance would be a reacceleration of deposit competition. Our forecast also assumes our cash and other short-term investments, which ended the quarter at over $25 billion, remain relatively stable throughout the remainder of 2024. We expect NII in the second quarter to be stable to up 1% sequentially, reflecting the impact of slowing deposit cost pressures and the benefit of our fixed rate loan repricing. Our current outlook assumes interest-bearing deposit costs, which were 291 basis points in the first quarter of 2024, would increase about 6 basis points sequentially if we see no rate cuts. We expect adjusted non-interest income to be up 1% to 2% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance, reflecting growth in treasury management, capital market fees and wealth and asset management revenue. We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 2% to 4% compared to the first quarter, largely reflecting higher commercial banking revenue. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect full year adjusted non-interest expense to be up 1% compared to 2023. Our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid-single digits and sales force additions in middle market, treasury management and wealth. We will also open 30 to 35 new branches in our higher-growth markets and close a similar number of branches in 2024. We expect second quarter total adjusted non-interest expense to be down approximately 6% compared to the first quarter due to the seasonal compensation and benefits cost in the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be down 1% to 2% and PPNR to decline in the 4% to 5% range. This outcome will result in an efficiency ratio of around 57% for the full year, a modest increase relative to 2023, driven by the decrease in NII. We continue to expect positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024. Our outlook for 2024 net charge-offs remains in the 35 basis point to 45 basis point range as credit continues to normalize, with second quarter net charge-offs also in the 35 basis point to 45 basis point range. We expect to resume provision builds in connection with loan growth assuming no change to the economic outlook. Loan growth and mix is expected to drive a $75 million to $100 million build for the full year with the second quarter build being approximately zero to $25 million. As we mentioned last quarter, our consistent and strong earnings provides us the flexibility to resume share repurchases of $300 million to $400 million in the second half of 2024, including $100 million to $200 million in the third quarter, assuming a stable economic and credit outlook and capital rules that are no worse than the current NPR. In summary, with our well-positioned balance sheet, disciplined expense and credit risk management and diversified revenue growth, we will continue to generate long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers, communities and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open up the call for Q&A. Thank, Mike. It's Bryan. Great question. I think one of the things on this front, we very early last year made the decision to grow deposits very aggressively. We viewed it as a very consistent theme with being focused on the long-term, focused on stability, and quite honestly, focused on returns. We viewed it as worst case. We're going to generate some low cost wholesale funding with no prepayment penalties. Best case, it gave us an opportunity to have 12 million interactions with prospects and customers. And we have a lot of confidence in our ability to win relationships, when we can get our team in front of our customers. And so with that, as we've moved into this more stable environment, there clearly was some costs as we brought those promo balances in, but it gives us an ability to actually manage and recycle interest expense where we're able to pulse offers through different markets, where we can basically harvest some savings and reintroduce that back into interest expense on new offers and ultimately have a lower net overall cost. We just feel like it's being very efficient with every dollar we're utilizing. As I mentioned in the guidance, there's certainly some risk that the competition can reaccelerate, but it does feel like overall deposit competition did soften at the end of last year and that continued to [indiscernible]. Yeah. Thanks, Scott. I think the main thing there is two items. For the guidance for the rest of the year, that is under the assumption that there is no change to the economic outlooks as provided by Moody's. A big driver of the release this quarter was the economic outlook from Moody's did get better. So that was a factor. We also had end-to-period decrease in loans sequentially. So that was an item that drove the release as well. Next quarter, we did guide to stability on loans. So that's what we're saying kind of zero to $25 million. Mix could cause a little bit of build, but we do expect end-of-period loan growth in the second half of the year and that's where you get the larger numbers. Their baseline scenario has had a bit of stability. It's certainly -- I don't think it is a significant -- there's no slowdown in 2024. They continue to push out their baseline expectations. They've also improved their downside scenario. That's had a little bit of a bigger impact on our reserve calculation. But overall, they're now in the camp of the economy continues to be moving well, and I don't think that they're expecting a significant slowdown at this point in 2024. Yeah, John, thanks for the question. It's one where the main thing that I would highlight for you is that we continue to have very strong benefits from the fixed rate asset repricing at this point. And you can see this -- for us, you can see that in our actual numbers. Year-over-year our indirect secured consumer business, which is primarily our indirect auto business, that's up 100 basis points year-over-year on a $15 billion portfolio. So, $150 million of annualized benefit in a year where we were actually constraining production in auto because of the RWA diet. So, those businesses we have, those medium-term fixed rate lending assets, whether it's the auto business, RV Marine, whether it's solar provide, generate a lot of power for us in terms of earnings capacity. Over the next 12 months, we'll have enough fixed rate assets reprice that will generate $350 million, $400 million plus of annualized NII benefit. So, even in a higher rate environment and with the curve selling off some, that benefit is increasing for us. So that is a good outcome for us that helps support and offset some continued migration from a DDA perspective, as well as some continued forecasted increases in deposit costs overall. We're not making any assumptions that the deposit environment and the competition and the increasing cost is over, but it is definitely moderating. From a NIM perspective, we do expect positive NIM from here as well. We're only talking about a couple of few basis points a quarter trajectory. A big wild card on the magnitude of the NIM increases just ultimately is where the cash position ends up. If we continue to have really strong performance out of our deposit franchise above the 2% to 3% that we're guiding to, NIM will be a little bit lower, but NII will be better as a result of that. But overall, we feel really good about the absolute positioning. That's right. We do have a similar amount that will happen in '25. And actually, we've been in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion a quarter repricing overall on the portfolio between loans and investment portfolio. The investment portfolio has actually been, say, $600 million to $800 million a quarter range. That number is actually going to start accelerating later this year as we start to get some maturities on the bullet/locked-out structures. We're expecting over $1 billion in the fourth quarter and a pace similar to that in 2025. So, this benefit and the repricing is going to continue and actually pick up a little bit and that's where the higher for longer environment, as long as the frontend stays relatively stable, because that will help keep deposit costs stable, the higher long end will actually help and contribute to higher income over time. Yeah. We are there today for whatever comes out from a liquidity rule perspective. So, we will not have to make any material changes to the balance sheet compared to what we have today. What will happen over time as the loss position on the investment portfolio burns off, that will actually increase the liquidity contribution from the investment portfolio, so we can take the cash -- start to take the cash position down. Also we will start to remix the composition of our investment portfolio to continue to shift more into level one securities which will also help us take the cash position down over time. So, it will be just a natural transition where the balance sheet will get a little bit lighter from a cash and securities perspective as time passes. But we're very well positioned for any pending liquidity rules. Yeah, absolutely. We've got about overall about $31 billion in deposits in the Southeast now. About -- over half of that relates to the consumer franchise. So, we're doing very strong in consumer on that front. And as Tim mentioned, we are -- it is a net provider of funding. We only have about $18 billion worth of loans in the Southeast. Yes. And then just on the volume front for originations for solar, I know this question came up earlier as well, we're probably talking closer to $1.7 billion to $2 billion of originations this year, just given the dynamics that Tim mentioned earlier. We think that is certainly a big question for us and for the industry, and it's one of the items why we highlighted that our NII guidance at this point is less rate environment dependent and more dependent on just the overall level of deposit competition. As you mentioned, we do compete against the money center banks as well as a lot of regionals across our different markets. In the Midwest, we compete against JPMorgan primarily. They're the number one bank in most of our markets. We're the number two bank in those markets. So, we see them and face off against them. And obviously, in the Southeast, we deal with Bank of America, Wells and Truist, so very significant competition. In general, it does feel like the broader liquidity environment has stabilized versus what we saw midyear last year. So, even with a little bit of weakness from an overall industry deposit perspective at this point unless something really breaks in the liquidity system, we're not expecting the significant food fight for cash that happened last year as people were just scrambling to show that they had a stable balance sheet. But it does mean that over time that you're likely to see just a potential increase in competition. The big counter for this is really going to be whether or not loan growth shows up or not. If there's no loan growth for the industry, there's not going to be a need for significant competition for deposits. And so, broadly speaking, we think competition probably stays lighter than what we saw last year, especially in a stable environment, also at a time where we think the whole industry is going to be focused on maintaining profitability. So, we do think that will moderate some of the pressures, but the bottoming of the RRP and potential decreases in bank reserves as QT continues, certainly could create some pressure in the medium term."
