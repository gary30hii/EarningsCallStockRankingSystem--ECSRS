After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Molly Sorg, Head of Investor Relations for Vistra. Please go ahead Ms. Sorg.\nMolly Sorg: Thank you Carol, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast discussing fourth quarter and full-year 2020 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistra corp.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-K and the related earnings release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Burke, President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Sides two and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non--GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.\nCurtis Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning everybody. We appreciate your interest in this call. Today, this morning, I would like to start out with the elephant in the room. We had a rough week last week, to say the least and for our investors who are listening to this call, I want to say on behalf of everybody at Vistra that we are disappointed and our inability to deal with this unprecedented event in a way that was favorable for the company. But I can assure you that we did everything we could to try to count come out on top. And I would like to take you through a little bit and Jim Burke will to the events that ensued. And what we tried to do to deal with those events, what happens, and also just to tell you on the front end, that it has taken us until middle of this week, to really sought out what really ultimately ended-up happening. And, and so therefore, we felt it was imperative that we have this discussion, even though we have not sorted out everything, that we have this discussion today, and started the process, have a conversation about, what actually happened, and then we will get to the final numbers. I can assure you that there isn't anybody more disappointed than us. And it is disappointing to me, that we let you down, because we pride ourselves in execution. And I think we have done a darn good job of it over the five years I have been here. And within literally an hour or two, our worlds kind of turned upside down. First of all, it was for Texas, maybe for those of us who lived in the northeast or the North know that, may not have looked as a big deal. But in Texas, it was an unprecedented event, the infrastructure, and I don't mean just the electric infrastructure. But I'm talking about housing and other things are built really for the heat. You don't see this kind of event. And I think history tells us that this was one of these, so called one in 100 years now, it did happen. And the reality is, even if it is one in 100, it can happen. So, there is no excuse. But it tells you the depth of what happens is, as I understand it, the coldest three days stretch that they can that they have on record in Texas, the 14th through to 16th. So, what did that mean? Well, that meant that we had unprecedented demand. So, - to take you back, and I think it is important to lay this out. I think it was the ninth of February. Steve Moscato, who is on this call, came to me and said our meteorologists that we have on staff came to him and said, we have got an unprecedented event from a we ran the numbers, and we were seeing load in 72,000 to 74,000 megawatts. Now, let's put that in perspective. The worst case scenario or the or the one of the - I guess you call it that, that that overcrowded perform was about 67,000 megawatts or so maybe 67 or 68. And Steve was concerned, not just because of the load. But we also were looking at wind forecasts. And we were concerned about solar. And the fact of the matter was that we didn't have enough steel on the ground to cover that load. So, and I have been testifying to this in Texas, I'm still here in Austin. Last couple days, and I will be talking more again today. But we did vote to Orca. And because they had I think it was about 65,000 megawatts for Monday. And this is by the way for Monday, Tuesday, 15th and 16th. Just to give you a timeline. So we were out in front of it. I have testified to this, I believe, and now that I have been lifting the other testimony that I believe, or Pat thought to say that they had it under control, and I will tell you in a minute what happened. And I think they weren't even prepare it for what ends up happening. But the bottom line is the company positioned itself relative to that to be long or flat. And in some instances we were short going into that, but then we went out and bought power at very high prices, because we believe that power was going to go to the cap, that it was not if it was wind. And so we were prepared, we also spent, and we have been open about this, about $10 million in preparation. We brought on about 200 additional contractors on site. We essentially did our whole winter readiness in Texas all over again, which we normally do in the fall. - And we felt very well prepared going into that. And then Monday came and I was on the phone with Steve and it was 1:00 AM, and Steve like he always does, we talk about, okay, here it comes. We think load shreds going to begin. And of course, we were supposed to be rolling blackouts, and then it started. I mean, we all saw it because, we were 30 minutes on, 15 off, and that went on for a relatively short period of time. And then Steve told me that we almost lost the entire grid. Frequencies were erratic, it tripped a couple of our units, and then shortly after that, everything locked down. And for what we find out on testimony, now, the transmission distribution entities, not ERCOT, essentially locked down each of their systems at wherever they were, because they were afraid they were going to lose the system. Now we have a book, and then all of a sudden that book of business changed. Loads, we are down to about some 40,000. And the reason they locked it down is because we were losing generation on the grid left and right. And the reason we were losing generation on the grid was predominantly because gas pressures, but also there were outages. Unfortunately for NRG, and this is public South Texas project Fripp. And I think this was a component of events for ERCOT. And for the two years, that all of a sudden they were managing a very different risk profile with a about 30,000 megawatts of generation, and they could not run a system on rolling blackouts with that level of generation. And so they just had to preserve the system. So that was the first event that changed our books. How did it change? It, locked whatever loads you had in your area based on what was on at that time. So if you were rolling blackouts and you were on, North Texas was on which we were that throws that at a particular level. And then we started getting our gas Trek because of pressures. So all of a sudden our book went from a flat, so long books into a, a book that was long, short, mixed, and we were scrambling at that point. And then upon our right on that, we had gas contracts, people declared force measure. So we had gas and then we didn't have gas. All that happened within a very short period of time. And we were managing a different reality at that point in time. And so frankly, we had millions of people without power in the state of Texas. We were scrambling to get gas. Gas prices shot through the roof. And we said this is a survival mode we turned our attention to preserving the Texas market and the grid and putting every megawatt we could. We said to ourselves we have to put everything on it and we will count this up at the end, But the one thing we know we need to do is serve customers, stabilize the grid, and then we will sort it out later. And that is what we did. And I look back on that every day and over the nights when I can't sleep. And I say to myself, \"What could we have done different, Curt? How could we have played this differently?\" And I think those decisions, as I play them over and over again were right. Now we had some things. And by the way, I know it doesn't matter in life. You know what, it doesn't matter if you lose the Super Bowl. No one goes and says, \"Oh, that is just because you know you had a mistake or the rep had a call.\" You lost. And so I get that. I'm just trying to explain to you what we were trying to do to manage this situation that was unprecedented to us, and we were trying to do the best that we could. And it took us frankly until the middle of this week, in fact all the way up to last night, we were having a Board meeting to really get a sense of what that range would be and so we still don't know exactly what all these numbers are because we are still getting in - because ERCOT shut down for a while, it wasn't providing voices. We didn't know what the load looked like, and we are beginning to get that picture. So if you think about what happened, there was a confluence of events. But the biggest which - that we have not seen it is all the way from the wellhead, we were having freeze ups. So there wasn't enough gas to inject into the pipelines. We had gas processing facilities that were having winter issues. And one of the biggest things that happened is that the TDUs didn't have an updated list of critical infrastructure. And so all of a sudden, they couldn't help it. They just shut down what they didn't think was critical. And all of a sudden, we had gas compressors that are run on electricity that pack the pipes, they were shut off. They weren't listed as critical infrastructure. We had gas processing facilities that were shut off because they weren't listed as critical infrastructure. And we had wells, producing wells that were shut off for the same reason. So then we had to triage. We had to go upstream, looking for people and saying and finding out what was wrong, why we weren't getting gas. And we were helping people with the TDUs turn back on critical infrastructure. And in order to get that to happen, it took a couple of days then for those to get on, and then you have to - in order to repressurize the pipe, it takes a good day to do that. So it took the balance of the week to get gas restored. So we had a significant amount of curtailments, and we are buying gas at a very high price. Now, one on us is we had some problems with our coal fleet. We had just some toll issues at Martin Lake, which were derates. We didn't come off-line. We just didn't produce at a maximum. And then we had you guys may know this, but Okra, we ship coal. We mine lignite and we ship it, and we had the rails froze up, and then we had plugging, and that took us down for about a day and a half. Now why does that matter? Well, it matters a lot because Oak Grove has about $5 a megawatt hour cost structure as opposed to having to essentially replace it with gas at hundreds of dollars in MMBTU. So the margin that we were getting for that days and a half was less. Now we got it back. That was a good thing, but we lost for about days and a half days. That was a lot of money that we lost, and Jim is going to go through these numbers. The other thing I heard is that there was a pricing glitch on Monday. So we are in what we call an EEA3, which is the highest alert at ERCOT. That means you have really no reserves. In fact, we had 30,000 megawatts of negative reserves. Where was the price? Price was trading at LNPs, in some instances $1,000 below our cost. And so we are calling ERCOT. What is going on? Well, we determined there was a pricing, let's call it anomaly. We went to the PUC the next day. And they came out with an order and said, \"We are going to reprice that at the cap, and then we are going to have it stay at the cap until we come out of EEA3.\" Frankly, the right decision, and that was a big deal for us. Inexplicably, 18-hours later they reversed the decision, and they decide to do it prospectively, but not retroactively. And they claim that during the wee hours of the morning on Monday, that people relied on that price. Ridiculous. And so Monday was a big day for us because we were long that day. Because the gas infrastructure was just beginning to come off, and so we lost that value. Now that is something that we could - are still take a hard look at, but that was tough. Again, \"Curt, what does it matter? It still happened to you.\" Yes, it did, but we didn't expect it. Nobody expected when we are in EEA3, that the price would be anything but at the cap. How could it be when you have negative reserves? It absolutely is preposterous, and yet that is what happened. So all of those things happened. We didn't know what the book was. We went through that week. We performed actually relatively well. We put on 25% to 30% of all megawatts on the grid relative to our 18% market share. Good. Again, no good deed goes unpunished. The problem was we had a mismatch when they locked the system down between megawatts and load. And the other thing is we were producing from higher-cost assets than we expected. So our cost of goods sold mix was not helpful. So I have taken you really through the two first slides. I will say a little bit about the market because I think the other very fair question is, \"Okay, well, what's this mean for the Texas market?\" And frankly, I thought it was the best market in the country. And this event has made me think. Not just me, but a lot of people think about it. But I still believe the basic tenets of a very good market are here. But I think the one thing that we are going to have to work on with the policy makers, the regulators, and I think we have good momentum on this, is that the grid in Texas today when we put in the all energy market and the price caps, is a grid that is different than the one that existed when we went competitive. So when we were competitive, it was a very different grid house where we have a lot less dispatchable resources. In fact, we have less dispatchable resources than our peak loads. So we rely much more heavily on renewables. Renewables are good. Nothing wrong with that. But it changes the risk profile. Renewables during this event were at capacity factors from 5% to sort of 15%. They didn't really contribute a lot during this event. And that is why I said when we were at 74,000 peak load, we didn't have enough megawatts in the system. Again, it wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when. And we were telling people that. So on the market design, reserves has to be, in my mind, the number one - emphasis. And so there is a number of ways to get more reserves on the system. But I also think that we have to take a hard look at the balance between market and the competitive markets and reliability. And I think that puts a lot of things on the table. That puts could be potentially greater reserves that ERCOT has to acquire in order to maintain the system. It could be a capacity market. I know that that may be blast for me to some in Texas, but I think it has to be on the table. But what I think comes out of this is still a very good competitive market that still has opportunities for people to do well, but moves on the spectrum of competitiveness to reliability, move that a little more toward the middle. But we are going to sort through that and more will come out of that, but I'm confident that Texas will rise to the occasion. This economy mandates it, and the policymakers in the governor and others know that this economic engine is powered by electricity. And with electrification coming, we have got to get it right. And we are a big player. We have a big seat at the table. We have a lot of good ideas, and I think the market actually advances to a good point. Now the weather event, I mean we are believers in climate change. We don't know this type of event becomes more frequent. But I think if you just let history tell you something, that this is not a frequent event, but it could happen. And so we have to adapt. We have to. And it is not huge numbers, but we are going to have to batten down the hatch, so to speak, and to harden our assets. The one thing I'm going to be on a say about is making sure that the gas and electric systems work seamlessly, that the TDUs upgrade their critical infrastructure, and that the gas system puts the money in, just like we, do to harden the system. It cannot be acceptable to not deliver gas at the maximum pressures in the middle of a natural disaster. And you can't say, \"Well, my hands are clean on this. I don't regulate that.\" Well, let's change the regulations then. So we have work to do, but I still have confidence, very much so, in the market. Now, this has been difficult. We hope that we hope to maintain your trust in us. But at the very least, we hope to earn it back. I'm disappointed. And it hurts, but it is what it is. And it is easy to lead when things are going well, and I think it is time to lead going forward. And I believe that the franchise is in place, the financial strength that we worked so hard to build, thank goodness, has helped us through this. And our better days are still ahead of us. And the integrated model still works, and we just have to do some things, some tweaks. We have to work on the market design, but I still have faith in this business and in these markets because they are too important. Electricity is the lifeblood of the economy. We have to get this right. there is no choice when you say, \"Well, how do I trust that?\" Texas can never go through this again, and they know that. So that is what I trust. And we are a big player here. And so what comes out the back end of this, I believe, is going to be good for Texas, good for the market and good for Vistra. So with that, I'm going to move into, and I just hate this, but I will move into 2020. Not that I hate 2020, or maybe I do. But I will moved into 2020 because we had such a great year, and this event has overshadowed it. And the men and women have worked so hard at Vistra in 2020 in the face of COVID, in the face of social issues and everything that is been thrown at us, performed as about as good as anybody could have expected. It enabled us to pay down a significant amount of debt. Our retail business was exceptional, getting close to almost $1 billion of EBITDA. We continue on the cost savings front. And by the way, I'm not going to throw a number out there today and say that we are going to save a bunch of hundreds of millions of dollars. We have a lean business, and I'm not going to starve this business. You cannot starve power plants for maintenance costs. It will bite you in 2022 and 2023. But we will as we always do, and we will double down. We will look for opportunities to optimize earnings going forward once we determine what the full effect of this is. And I'm convinced that we do every year, we will find opportunities and we will let you know what those are. But I'm not going to throw a big number out there that I don't think is good for the company in the long run, and we are playing this for the long run. 2021 and this event are a onetime event, and we are going to move this company forward in a way where it can compete and be even better into the future. In 2020, I'm now on delivering the financial results slide. Just a phenomenal year, $3.77 billion of EBITDA and almost $2.6 billion in free cash flow before growth, almost a 70% conversion ratio. I remember when I was talking to you guys in the Dynegy acquisition, and we put out the - I think it is S-4 and we had a set of projection numbers. And just looking at what we were able to do in 2020 relative to what we had in that is, in my opinion, truly remarkable. And I think we did that with very disciplined investment into the business, and I'm proud of what we were able to do and what the numbers we were able to put up. I think since I took over, we have got I think almost $600 million above midpoint of guidance over those years. What just kills me is we gave it all back and more, but we have been through that story already this morning. I won't take you through it again, but that is tough. You don't want to get back what you have created, and that is a difficult thing for us. The OP initiative continues, and it will continue. We baked that now. That is just a part of who we are. And we like to give this to you just because we want you to know when we tell you we are doing something, that we do it. But it is really embedded in our EBITDA. And then we are on track on our synergies for the - and namely the Crius and Ambit because Dynegy is pretty much done Even on the system side, the technology side, that is pretty much done at this point in time. And the last thing I will say and I will hand it over to Jim. Through all this, we still have - and I'm on the last slide here, prioritizing all stakeholders. Just briefly to touch base, this has been who we are since I have been here. We have been about all stakeholders. We continue to do it. We have made huge advancements on the environmental side with our employees and contractors and customers and suppliers in our communities. We are proud of that, and we expect to continue to do that. And I know we did announce that we had $5 million to help customers. And some people may say, \"Well, there is a cost savings right there, Curt, why did you do that?\" And it is because of what I said earlier, two things. One is we are about helping people. As a company, not just about making money. We do care about that, but we have a bunch of people down here that are in need. This became a survival game. This became a human's needs effort, and we took that seriously, just like we take seriously being the guardians of your investments, we do care also about people. And it is very important to the franchise of our retail businesses that we are out there, and we are helping others. We have not lost those franchises. This weather couldn't take the franchises away from us, and they have extreme value. And we have to keep investing in those franchises, but helping people is also a very important thing. And so we made that hard call in the face of adversity and uncertainty because that is who we are. That is what we are about. So with that, I'm going to give it to Jim. Jim is going to quickly go through financial results. And then I know you guys have Q&A, and we will try to answer everything we can as completely as possible. And so I will turn it over to Jim. Thank you.\nJames Burke: Thanks, Curt. I'm going to quickly cover Slide 16. As Curt said, I know we want to get to Q&A. I want to just hit two slides. Our full-year 2020 retail results were 176 million higher than our full-year 2019 results, driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit, plus strong ERCOT margin performance partially offset by milder weather. The 197 million favorability in our collective generation segments was driven by higher margins in our Texas, East and Sunset segments, including the higher period-over-period benefits from our OPI initiatives, partially offset by lower capacity revenues. As it relates to the impacts of COVID-19, Vistra was able to navigate through the challenges brought on by the pandemic with minimal impacts to our financial performance. On the retail side, we only saw a small uptick in bad debt during the year, while our lower business volumes were offset by higher residential volumes. And as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call in May of 2020, our commercial team executed some opportunistic transactions in anticipation of the market volatility caused by COVID-19, resulting in a positive benefit to Vistra for the year. In addition to these strong financial results, our retail business grew its residential customer count in Texas year-over-year, reflecting strong performance by our legacy brands, while our generation business once again executed with commercial availability of over 95%. On the liquidity side as of year-end 2020, Vistra had total available liquidity of approximately $2.4 billion, which was primarily comprised of cash and availability under its revolving credit facility. This strong liquidity position enabled Vistra to effectively manage the collateral requirements related to the winter storm Uri. As of February 25th, Vistra had more than $1.5 billion of cash and availability under its revolving credit facility to meet any liquidity needs. We can close with Slide 17. Vistra repaid more than $1.5 billion of debt in 2020 to end the year at our long-term leverage target of 2.5 time net debt to adjusted EBITDA. As of February 23rd, we have repurchased approximately 5.9 million shares at an average price of $21.15. $1.375 billion remains available under this authorization. We are continuing to execute on our strategic renewable and energy storage investments, including our Texas Phase I and California battery projects. As we have communicated to you, we will be disciplined as it relates to deploying capital, regularly evaluating all growth projects for financial viability. We will only invest in growth projects if we are confident in the expected returns. As a result of this continuous review, we are currently pausing one growth project in West Texas due to updated economics driven by higher-than-anticipated congestion costs. I know many of you are wondering how our existing capital allocation plan will change as a result of the impacts of this winter storm. We expect to provide an updated capital allocation plan for 2021 on our first quarter earnings call. We remain committed to our dividend trajectory and to maintaining a strong balance sheet. The challenges brought on by the global pandemic in 2020 and this historic winter storm in Texas last week have tested our business model. We truly believe it was a one-time historic event. The winter event was a significant financial hit. Our people worked in very tough conditions to generate as much power for the greatest possible. Importantly, our business still has the strong assets that it had just two weeks ago. Both our customer base and our generation footprint remain intact, and we believe with solid growth prospects. We are a resilient team and we will stay focused on bringing value for our stakeholders over the long term. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question this morning comes from Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: Thanks so much for taking my questions and I really do appreciate the very frank and kind of thorough review that you all provided. So thank you. Just first, maybe on the natural gas supply situation. In terms of just the supplier obligations to you, is there a potential to litigate to the extent that firm supply was not provided or is that not likely?\nCurtis Morgan: No, there is a potential to that.\nStephen Byrd: Okay. In the sense that sort of folks who had some firm supply obligation to you did not provide the gas. And the situations in Texas wouldn't necessarily excuse their delivery obligations?\nCurtis Morgan: Yes. I mean look, so it is going to come down to - and I don't want to actually litigate it, but there are provisions and contracts. Every one of them is a little bit different, and it will come down to whether those provisions applied in this instance or not. And to be a very simple analysis, what I will say is there is potential. We are still doing the analysis as to whether it will make sense or not, and we can update you guys on that. But obviously it is something we need to take a look at, because we thought we had gas at a particular price. And obviously we didn't, and that was a big hit for us. So we will see where the stakes is, but there could be some disputes.\nStephen Byrd: Yes. Understood. And then the ERCOT pricing glitch on Monday, that is obviously - I share your frustration. That just seems like a tremendous just mistake by the - in terms of how the price was set. Is that also possible to - I know there was language about sort of adjusting that. But could that be adjusted? And obviously that would have a very substantial impact to your loss position. So I was just curious how you think about that.\nCurtis Morgan: So I think the interesting thing on that one, Steve, is first of all, yes, it can be disputed. Secondly, it is going to be disputed on both ends. So the prospective increase to the cap and actually keeping it at the cap on Thursday into Friday is going to be something, I think, that is going - not only will be maybe challenged with Public Utility Commission, but it may be challenged at the legislature. So we absolutely believe that when you are in EEA 3 and you don't have reserves, you have negative reserves that you can't be anywhere but the cap. But there is a particular mechanism in pricing scheme that actually kicked in that had the prices being set at LMPs that were below the cap at times. And I think the commission rightly so determined that the price should be at the cap. Ultimately, I think they have the authority to make that order. I think we will likely challenge the notion that you can't retroactively price. But I think there may be others like retailers who may challenge whether it should have been set at the cap. So it is an unfortunate thing because billions of dollars changed hands in a week. People are going to go out of business over it. And I think people are going to try to see what they can do to change the playing field. So we won't really know until we get through all of that math, which I think will go on for some time. But we are probably going to contribute a little bit to the mess because there are some things that we think are legitimate to be - to dispute, and we may do that.\nStephen Byrd: And Curt, just on that, this point about the position gas power plants were in, it strikes me as such a problem from a market design point of view, in the sense that the gas plant owners were in this on Monday, this really tough position. Do you buy gas at very high prices, first, not knowing necessarily whether you are going to dispatch, but secondly, into a price --a power where you are going to lose a lot of money. And yet at the same time, you want to provide as many electrons as you can so the people of Texas. Am I getting that right or I may have misunderstood.\nCurtis Morgan: No, you have got it exactly right, Stephen. And this was the dilemma that we were faced with. With an unknown load, an unknown financial obligation, but an absolute obligation to human needs. And this is the problem, and I said this last night, yesterday to the House and the Senate in Texas that I don't believe Texas can stop this type of an event, and I don't think any state really can'. I don't think they like the price cap. They don't like the grid products. They don't like consumers having it passed on. We don't like consumers having blips like this passed on because they will shop for another supplier or retailer. And so we all agree that the volatility in this market is probably not what it should be. On the other end of the spectrum, I'm not sure that everybody is ready to go to some full capacity market. But I do believe there is something that can be done in between where the price cap comes down and you increase the amount of reserves, which increases the revenues into the market and it increases the steel in the ground. So it brings this thing a little more stable with less layouts and less risk to consumers. Because what's a problem with the model now for us is as a retailer we don't want to increase price to consumers in the middle of this type of an event, yet our suppliers are increasing prices at will. And we get squeezed in the middle. That is an untenable situation. That is not something that can last. And I believe I made some good points and people are beginning to realize that in this market. So I am convinced that market design will help with that. But the other thing is we cannot let the gas system fail again, and it did. And I don't care what anybody says. All the way from the wellhead, I mean we are producing right now oil and gas in North Dakota. Don't tell me it can't be produced in that kind of weather. And so we can't have that happen again. I don't care if we produce more gas than we ever have in Texas because of demand. The reality is the pressures on the lines were not sufficient enough to get gas generators what they need it in order to be at the top. And we are in a virtuous cycle. We need to provide electricity for compressors and for gas processing and for production sites. We need gas bill to produce electricity. So they all have to work together. And sometimes, that is what regulatory - that is what regulation does and that is what policymakers do. And we need to make sure that happens.\nStephen Byrd: Very good. I could ask 50 more questions, but I will hand it over to others.\nCurtis Morgan: Well, I think we are going to give a chance, I hope Tuesday.\nStephen Byrd: Yes, sir, Tuesday I think next week. Thank you.\nCurtis Morgan: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fleishman: Hi good morning, thanks. I will try to limit to the one question and follow-up.\nCurtis Morgan: You can do more than one.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Thanks, Curt. Just I think just a couple of days ago, you raised the dividend, and I think more - frankly, more than you were initially planning to for this year. Could you just talk about your thinking in doing that in the context of everything?\nCurtis Morgan: Yes, that is an excellent question. So you know we moved it in September. And then we decided to just move it a couple of pennies and to $0.60. And it was $10 million, Steve. And we had made the call, and we just didn't go back on it. $10 million's still $10 million. So we decided to go forward with it and thought it was still the right thing. This is one of these things where if you do it, some people say, \"Why the heck are you doing, raising your dividend?\" Regardless of how much it is in the middle of something like this, honestly I think the way we are thinking about this is that this is a onetime event. It is unfortunate, but we are still on the trajectory when 2022 rolls around. We are still back to where we were on our capital allocation plan in 2023 and forward. And so we made the call to continue with that. Relatively small, but still obviously it is an obvious change in the middle of this type of situation. It certainly can be second guessed, but we thought it was the right thing to do to move forward with it. We still are very interested in our dividend. We think it is important to our investors. And so we decided to stick with it. Because we made that decision, Steve, by the way, before this hit. As a Board, we decided to do this, and we did not revisit it. We said we are going to go ahead and move forward with it.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. But I assume you did that with context knowing that you could get - even though this was a big hit, it is manageable in the scheme of the whole company?\nCurtis Morgan: Yes. So from a liquidity standpoint, we feel good. And not only do we feel good with what we have, we feel good with the partnerships we have with a number of different financial institutions that have frankly been very supportive. And they didn't know anything, by the way. They didn't know if we made money or we didn't make money. But they also knew people were winners and losers. And they have come to us and said, \"Look, we believe in your long term. If you need it any kind of liquidity, we would be happy to make our balance sheet available to you to help you through this, if you needed it.\" I\u2019m convinced that this is not a liquidity crisis for this company. This is a short run-material hit. We took a body blow. But I also believe that we will come back or out of this and move forward with strength. And the fact that people are willing to help us out in this, and they understand, they believe in us, that is huge to us. But Steve, I don't see this as a situation we are in dire straits. I would tell you, if we hadn't got our debt down and we are still the old IPP model, we would be in a different place.\nSteven Fleishman: Yes, good. And then just a follow-up is just thinking - trying to ignore 2021 and what happened and looking to 2022 let's say and beyond. Can you just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about both generation, which I think forwards have moved up some? But is there any different strategy there for you? And then retail, how are you thinking about the implications it is for retail at 2022 and onward?\nCurtis Morgan: Yes. So a number that Jim talk a little bit about retail. But I will just say - I'm sorry, what was the first part of that? I got the -.\nSteven Fleishman: Generation and hedging.\nCurtis Morgan: Yes, yes, yes, sorry.\nSteven Fleishman: Ignoring 2021, focusing for the future towards 2022.\nCurtis Morgan: Yes. So I guess gets in a little bit to the capital allocation discussion too. I mean first of all, we still believe probably more so than we ever have, in Texas. Until there is a market design change, the generation is pretty darn important. And now we know obviously supply chain around our generation with gas is even more important than we ever thought. But we still believe that the generation that we have is important. I still think that we are going to see coal retirements. And we believe, probably even more now than ever, because my guess is this is also going to impact development in the ERCOT market. But we think there is value in these - in the projects that we are doing. So we continue to want to do those. I will say, though, Steve, that how we finance those and how we realize the value from them. I think we always have been open-minded, and we will continue to be open-minded about - I'm talking now about the renewable investments that we are doing. And so there could be some things that we do. I think we would like to buy our shares back, and we are going to probably need to do that even more. So the real challenge in 2021 is there is not going to be a lot of money to do that, unless we were to do some project-level financing or something like that, which we will consider. In 2022 and beyond, by the way, retail actually held up through this. And Steve or Jim can get into the details and tell you his thoughts on retail real quick. But we are looking not only to maintain our retail, but we may end up getting - we are a provider of last resort in ERCOT. And we may get some of the customers, if in fact customers drop their customers to the provider of last resort, which is a mechanism in ERCOT. We may get a significant amount of new customers. And we are also open to continuing M&A around retail. So we have been saying we would like to get a little more retail in our business. I think we are continuing that. We like that business. We are good at it. And so I think that hasn't changed. On the generation front. We were sort of reducing our generation exposure a little bit anyway, and we are becoming more and more matched. I know this event obviously shakes people because we ended up being short. It was because of things that we did not, could not have planned for. So I still think that we are going to head down a path where our generation is going to be reduced in terms of megawatts as we retire coal. And we will add some renewables and batteries, and we will still have generation. But I think we will be a much more balanced company as we go forward. Even with this event, we still think that is the right move. I hope that I -- Jim, do you want to say anything about retail quick?\nJames Burke: Yes, sure, I would. Thanks, Curt. Steve, I think over the evolution of the markets here in ERCOT, we have seen these events come every three to five-years. And it disciplines retailers to think differently about some of the collateral requirements and the hedging that is necessary to survive. This event had the chance to really create a runaway scenario for swing for the retail segment, for any retail business in ERCOT. And then the load shed capped out that exposure for some, and it actually it did for our business as well. And so the retail business held well. However, there still are some retail businesses that experienced swing, and they are reporting some results that are unfavorable. I think this business takes more capital than most people think. And it takes more discipline around hedging than most people think. And we found ourselves even in a business that we are very familiar with, having assets ready to run, being in a position to run and having trouble with the fuel supply, which we did not see coming to the extent obviously that had occurred. So I think there is going to be some retail consolidation. I think whether it is through the [indiscernible] process or whether that is through a chance to take a look at some books. I think we are going to come out of this in a relative position in a very strong place. And we look at 2022 and beyond as back to normal. And to your point about the curves, the curves being up in the next several years is a 200 million to 300 million difference than where we were just a few weeks ago. And so we will see how that plays out. But this is a tough one, tough one to get through. But I think coming out on the other side, we are going to be relatively positioned in a good place.\nSteven Fleishman: Great. Thank you.\nCurtis Morgan: Thank you Steve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, thank you for all the color and commentary. I wish you guys the best. Can we talk about capital allocation? I know you mentioned an update coming, but there is some - you just alluded to it, so I want to bring it up more directly here. It seems like there is some latitude in the budget, especially if you think about having a probably disproportionate preference to review buybacks here. How do you think about investments in renewables and the ability not to pursue them, but to monetize those selectively as you complete them? Certainly, it seems like an added source, but also can we address the credit rating and your thought process, perhaps initially with the rating agencies?\nCurtis Morgan: Yes, great questions, Julien. So on the renewables, I think you sort of stated accurately. And I tried to portray this, maybe I didn't do a very good job on it. But I think there are some opportunity to potentially raise capital in a different way, let's put it that way, that could add capital to buy back shares. And I think we would like to buy our shares back. So I think we are going to be very open-minded. These projects have value to them. And now that can be somewhat contingent on also having contracted projects. And of course we have a retail business that we can look at to contract with, but we also can do that externally with third parties. So I think there is some work in 2021, we will do to make sure that. But we are not in a position where we have done it ahead and that we absolutely have to do it, but I think it is worth doing. And we were considering it even before this event, but I think it is an even higher priority. Jim, do you have anything you want to add to that? But that is kind of how I see that. And then I can answer the next piece of it too.\nJames Burke: Our view is very similar to Curt, and I think there may be opportunities to look at current operating assets in the market, are those underway, as current owners or projects might have seen the performance get and how they hedged some of those assets in this market as well. And so I think there could be other opportunities that weren't on the horizon just a few weeks ago.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: It sounds interesting.\nCurtis Morgan: We have looked at that, Julien. And the problem is again if you want to sell it, and return to the hedge, I suppose you could do that. But the values just aren't there. There is so much generation that is either explicitly or implicitly for sale in the market that - and I don't feel like we have to do that. But if we found an opportunity to do that, that made some financial sense, we don't need to own all the megawatts that we have, and so we would consider that. But I'm not - we are not going to rush to that because we are not in a financial distress. And I think we are going to be a little more disciplined. I think I would rather look for ways to save money and to do things like that rather than to force a sale in the middle of a market that is not a particularly good market to sell assets in.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: I understand.\nCurtis Morgan: You asked about the ratings - yes, so rating agencies I will just say this, we have had some early discussions with them. And this is, like it is to you guys, it is an initial shock. They know that we are still disciplined, and we will continue to pay down debt and that we have been that way. And so look, I think we have had constructive discussions. I have nothing to announce at this point in time about that, and they don't either. But I would say the discussions have been constructive. And I'm going to spend some time I could. I was in these hearings all day yesterday. I'm going to spend some time with a couple of the agencies myself because I couldn't make the meetings and talk to them. But I found the discussions to be very open and honest and constructive, and I'm hopeful that we will be okay there.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nCurtis Morgan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from [Shar Prasa] (Ph) from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nJames Kennedy: It is actually James for Shar. Curt, to build off your policy points about middle ground between high-priced assets and a capacity market, I mean we watched the hearings yesterday. It sounds like there is sort of momentum kind of from where we stand today. Could you give us any probability on policy change actually coming out of the spring session in the legislature?\nCurtis Morgan: Yes. So look, we were asked to bring back ideas in a week. This event has really shaken the state of Texas from the very top. I was able to speak with some of the obviously the leadership in the state of Texas, they don't want this to happen again. I think they are beginning to realize that the mix of assets in the market combined with the structure itself is not sustainable, pretty obvious to them. And they also know this was a big weather event. And we can't lose sight of that, that this was an extreme weather event. But at the same time, they have to ask themselves even so, do we really want to even have to take the risk of this type of event. And I think they are asking themselves, and they know the answer, none of them can stomach really the idea that a bunch of this high pricing power is going to get passed on to customers. And so they realize that that is an untenable position to be in for us, and they are worried about having enough generation. And they realize if you don't have a market structure that works, people aren't going to invest. So that tells me that there is a very good probability that we could get something done here, and I would say north of 50%. And I wouldn't normally say that about any process like that, but I see momentum. And I know our company is going to have a seat at the table. And we are going to be working on this extensively in the next few days, because I do not want to lose the momentum. I think we do need a change. And were already considering these things, and so we were prepared. And I think it is time to get everybody together and find a way to move this market. Still using competitive market principles, but I think stabilizing it somewhat.\nJames Kennedy: Got it. Thanks. This will be it.\nCurtis Morgan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [Amit Sakar] (Ph) from BMO. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey Curt, thank you for taking my questions. I\u2019m in Houston. So I hope you will indulge me since I just got the power back. So I figure I have earned it too. I think Curt, you kind of f talked a little bit about the Oak Grove coal supply issues with some of the rail transportation not kind of getting through. I'm just curious, but don't you typically have like a coal power that would represent a couple of weeks of burn? I guess you aren't shipping it coal every day to kind of burn that coal. Can you kind of fill us in a little bit on kind of the issues there?\nCurtis Morgan: Yes, I will, and then Jim can jump in. But it was kind of two things. Getting coal to the coal silos, but it also was wet coal that we actually had. And so what we were - and that was creating issues with the front end process to eventually burn coal. And so it was those two things. So we were trying to get fresh coal in, and then we were having problems with the rail. Because the coal we had on the ground was frozen, and it was also wet in going up and causing problems that we end up having to take the units down. But that is what I understand it. But Jim has been working on this night and day. So why don't we let him also explain his knowledge of what happened?\nJames Burke: Sure. Thanks, Amit, for the question. That is one of the benefits of having a mine operation right there is that we can self-supply we have several days worked at the plant. And then of course we have at the mine, we have much more under whole barn, a covered area. So the thought was when the coal pile, which is right by the plant, is exposed, it froze over, becomes basically chunks of ice that you can't put through the equipment without tearing it up. So the goal is to try to get the dryer coal over from the mine to the plant. And that transportation system is really tough, not just the tracks, but the railcars, the doors that you used to dump the call they are freezing. So they were freezing shut and then we couldn't actually once we got them open, we couldn't get them back closed. And so we had a supply chain even within our own system where it was effectively difficult to work in the freezing conditions that got worse through the middle of the week Before we were able to find ways to work through that. So that wasn't about a rail coming in from elsewhere. It was really between the mine and the plant and trying to get the best fuel we could. At Martin Lake, we obviously do have also a supply on hand. It was a derated plant because of the freezing temperatures and also dealing with the pile, effectively turning into ice. And so we ended up our conveyor systems where we are transporting this call up through to the plants, they are exposed as well in many parts of the country. Those are completely enclosed. So these systems, as Curt mentioned earlier, they were designed for the heat and the warm weather, not the freezing temperatures we were in. So we took de-rates on that plan as well. We ended up at a 70% capacity factor for coal during the week. So the capacity factor is certainly lower than we expected and wanted to have. But that 30% that we were not able to keep going, and that includes the de-rates and being off-line. That just became a very expensive prospect for us. Because as Curt said, we were replacing $5 to $20 a megawatt hour fuel with $2,000 fuel in the form of gas that we were burning in some of our old gas steam units. And so a little bit of miss on the volume there multiplied by the delta on fuel cost was substantial. So we are going to have to look at the coal handling and look at what resiliency we need to build in for this type of a cold weather stretch at our coal plants.\nUnidentified Analyst: And I guess that kind of leads into my follow-up question. Just going back to kind of the press release you guys put out Wednesday, I guess kind of in the midst of all of this. And I have heard - I think you testified to this yesterday in front of legislature as well. If I kind of look at the percentage of load of cut you kind of reserving, and I kind of used Monday as an example since that was kind of the height of this. Is it fair to say if we set aside MGP, assume that ran - that your fossil fleet kind of ran at a kind of a blended kind of capacity factor of like 70%, 75%?\nCurtis Morgan: Yes. And so like with prices kind of on Tuesday and Wednesday kind of clearing at the cap, and it looked like you guys had some length or heat rate length open going into this. I guess I'm still trying to wrap my head around on kind of on why the losses where they were to such an extent. Are you guys kind of saying that because you did such a good job in a light state on in north zone versus say Houston zone that you just - and the demand was so high there relatively, that you guys kind of found yourself short, whereas other kind of generation units that were pointed at Houston zone basically had the benefit of the load just basically being cut, so they basically weren't short anymore? Yes. So I mean - go ahead.\nScott Hudson: I mean yes in essence, this was a very interesting pattern because heading into the weather event when you see what the temperatures were going to be. This looked like we are generators, specialty generators with length would have an opportunity to make potentially a good return on their efforts. And retailers, no matter how much they were headed, whether it was through a P95 or P99 scenario, they were going to swing and likely pay much higher prices to cover their obligation to their customers. So it was originally going to look like a good generator segment opportunity and probably a tough one for retailers. Once the load shed happened and the load shed happened, not just curtailing load for retail but it actually curtailed and contributed to the gas supply issues, the retailers kind of got stopped out on their exposure to the swing. And in some cases depending on how much load was shed, could have become lost on their supply position. And the generators and the ones that were online including ourselves, we could not get the fuel to meet the obligation of what we had sold forward to both third parties as well as our own supply book. So it shifted this load curtailment shifted the entire risk from what should have been on a retail segment back to a generation segment, because of its linkage to the fuel supply challenge on particularly natural gas. And that is we were long. We had an ability to capture this, but you are long if you get the fuel. If you don't get the fuel, you are short. And that is why when we put the press release out, we put a lot of emphasis on the fact that we were having fueling challenges. And we also wanted to do address that our units were winterized, they were there running. And we have an opportunity here if we can solve the field challenges. And despite all that, we were still a disproportionate amount of the generation on the grid. So it played out very differently than we would have thought a week or two ago, but those are the major drivers.\nCurtis Morgan: And Jim, I will just add that what happened is too is Monday, as I said, pricing was not at the cap. For this very strange reason, we were long Monday. Then we started having gas delivery issues, pricing issues as well as pressure issues. And then we lost Oak Grove for about day and a half, which is our low-cost fuel. And so it is like one of these sayings where if it could go bad, it did. And all those things contributed, but a big chunk of it really was around gas. The cost of gas as well as the amount of gas we were getting delivered. And then there was another - that is a big bucket. That is like, I think Jim has said, about two-thirds. And about third of it was around our coal of that total. And I know - because - I mean you can only imagine what I was doing to meet - I was like pulling my hair out. Like I thought we were long. I thought we were in a good position. We are one of the biggest generators in terms of percentage on the grid. You think $9,000 cap, you are thinking everything is going well. But when you start tracing through it, it begins to make sense and unravel as to how our position changed and how we were - had the inability to really do much about it. But we did the right thing, but it was financially not good. And that is a tough thing when you do things and you know that you were doing the right thing and the outcome doesn't swing your way, it is very difficult.\nUnidentified Analyst: I appreciate all the time, Curt. I know you had a hell of a day yesterday. Thank you.\nCurtis Morgan: Yes. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A portion of our call, and I would like to turn it back to Curt Morgan for final comments.\nCurtis Morgan: Well, I appreciate people that are still hanging in there. But thank you very much for your interest in our company. Tough week last week, but this company is strong, resilient. It is a good company, and we are going to come out of this stronger than ever. I hope you all have a great weekend, and look forward to talking to you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you once again for participating.

            "content": "Thank you, Molly, and good morning everybody. We appreciate your interest in this call. Today, this morning, I would like to start out with the elephant in the room. We had a rough week last week, to say the least and for our investors who are listening to this call, I want to say on behalf of everybody at Vistra that we are disappointed and our inability to deal with this unprecedented event in a way that was favorable for the company. But I can assure you that we did everything we could to try to count come out on top. And I would like to take you through a little bit and Jim Burke will to the events that ensued. And what we tried to do to deal with those events, what happens, and also just to tell you on the front end, that it has taken us until middle of this week, to really sought out what really ultimately ended-up happening. And, and so therefore, we felt it was imperative that we have this discussion, even though we have not sorted out everything, that we have this discussion today, and started the process, have a conversation about, what actually happened, and then we will get to the final numbers. I can assure you that there isn't anybody more disappointed than us. And it is disappointing to me, that we let you down, because we pride ourselves in execution. And I think we have done a darn good job of it over the five years I have been here. And within literally an hour or two, our worlds kind of turned upside down. First of all, it was for Texas, maybe for those of us who lived in the northeast or the North know that, may not have looked as a big deal. But in Texas, it was an unprecedented event, the infrastructure, and I don't mean just the electric infrastructure. But I'm talking about housing and other things are built really for the heat. You don't see this kind of event. And I think history tells us that this was one of these, so called one in 100 years now, it did happen. And the reality is, even if it is one in 100, it can happen. So, there is no excuse. But it tells you the depth of what happens is, as I understand it, the coldest three days stretch that they can that they have on record in Texas, the 14th through to 16th. So, what did that mean? Well, that meant that we had unprecedented demand. So, - to take you back, and I think it is important to lay this out. I think it was the ninth of February. Steve Moscato, who is on this call, came to me and said our meteorologists that we have on staff came to him and said, we have got an unprecedented event from a we ran the numbers, and we were seeing load in 72,000 to 74,000 megawatts. Now, let's put that in perspective. The worst case scenario or the or the one of the - I guess you call it that, that that overcrowded perform was about 67,000 megawatts or so maybe 67 or 68. And Steve was concerned, not just because of the load. But we also were looking at wind forecasts. And we were concerned about solar. And the fact of the matter was that we didn't have enough steel on the ground to cover that load. So, and I have been testifying to this in Texas, I'm still here in Austin. Last couple days, and I will be talking more again today. But we did vote to Orca. And because they had I think it was about 65,000 megawatts for Monday. And this is by the way for Monday, Tuesday, 15th and 16th. Just to give you a timeline. So we were out in front of it. I have testified to this, I believe, and now that I have been lifting the other testimony that I believe, or Pat thought to say that they had it under control, and I will tell you in a minute what happened. And I think they weren't even prepare it for what ends up happening. But the bottom line is the company positioned itself relative to that to be long or flat. And in some instances we were short going into that, but then we went out and bought power at very high prices, because we believe that power was going to go to the cap, that it was not if it was wind. And so we were prepared, we also spent, and we have been open about this, about $10 million in preparation. We brought on about 200 additional contractors on site. We essentially did our whole winter readiness in Texas all over again, which we normally do in the fall. - And we felt very well prepared going into that. And then Monday came and I was on the phone with Steve and it was 1:00 AM, and Steve like he always does, we talk about, okay, here it comes. We think load shreds going to begin. And of course, we were supposed to be rolling blackouts, and then it started. I mean, we all saw it because, we were 30 minutes on, 15 off, and that went on for a relatively short period of time. And then Steve told me that we almost lost the entire grid. Frequencies were erratic, it tripped a couple of our units, and then shortly after that, everything locked down. And for what we find out on testimony, now, the transmission distribution entities, not ERCOT, essentially locked down each of their systems at wherever they were, because they were afraid they were going to lose the system. Now we have a book, and then all of a sudden that book of business changed. Loads, we are down to about some 40,000. And the reason they locked it down is because we were losing generation on the grid left and right. And the reason we were losing generation on the grid was predominantly because gas pressures, but also there were outages. Unfortunately for NRG, and this is public South Texas project Fripp. And I think this was a component of events for ERCOT. And for the two years, that all of a sudden they were managing a very different risk profile with a about 30,000 megawatts of generation, and they could not run a system on rolling blackouts with that level of generation. And so they just had to preserve the system. So that was the first event that changed our books. How did it change? It, locked whatever loads you had in your area based on what was on at that time. So if you were rolling blackouts and you were on, North Texas was on which we were that throws that at a particular level. And then we started getting our gas Trek because of pressures. So all of a sudden our book went from a flat, so long books into a, a book that was long, short, mixed, and we were scrambling at that point. And then upon our right on that, we had gas contracts, people declared force measure. So we had gas and then we didn't have gas. All that happened within a very short period of time. And we were managing a different reality at that point in time. And so frankly, we had millions of people without power in the state of Texas. We were scrambling to get gas. Gas prices shot through the roof. And we said this is a survival mode we turned our attention to preserving the Texas market and the grid and putting every megawatt we could. We said to ourselves we have to put everything on it and we will count this up at the end, But the one thing we know we need to do is serve customers, stabilize the grid, and then we will sort it out later. And that is what we did. And I look back on that every day and over the nights when I can't sleep. And I say to myself, \"What could we have done different, Curt? How could we have played this differently?\" And I think those decisions, as I play them over and over again were right. Now we had some things. And by the way, I know it doesn't matter in life. You know what, it doesn't matter if you lose the Super Bowl. No one goes and says, \"Oh, that is just because you know you had a mistake or the rep had a call.\" You lost. And so I get that. I'm just trying to explain to you what we were trying to do to manage this situation that was unprecedented to us, and we were trying to do the best that we could. And it took us frankly until the middle of this week, in fact all the way up to last night, we were having a Board meeting to really get a sense of what that range would be and so we still don't know exactly what all these numbers are because we are still getting in - because ERCOT shut down for a while, it wasn't providing voices. We didn't know what the load looked like, and we are beginning to get that picture. So if you think about what happened, there was a confluence of events. But the biggest which - that we have not seen it is all the way from the wellhead, we were having freeze ups. So there wasn't enough gas to inject into the pipelines. We had gas processing facilities that were having winter issues. And one of the biggest things that happened is that the TDUs didn't have an updated list of critical infrastructure. And so all of a sudden, they couldn't help it. They just shut down what they didn't think was critical. And all of a sudden, we had gas compressors that are run on electricity that pack the pipes, they were shut off. They weren't listed as critical infrastructure. We had gas processing facilities that were shut off because they weren't listed as critical infrastructure. And we had wells, producing wells that were shut off for the same reason. So then we had to triage. We had to go upstream, looking for people and saying and finding out what was wrong, why we weren't getting gas. And we were helping people with the TDUs turn back on critical infrastructure. And in order to get that to happen, it took a couple of days then for those to get on, and then you have to - in order to repressurize the pipe, it takes a good day to do that. So it took the balance of the week to get gas restored. So we had a significant amount of curtailments, and we are buying gas at a very high price. Now, one on us is we had some problems with our coal fleet. We had just some toll issues at Martin Lake, which were derates. We didn't come off-line. We just didn't produce at a maximum. And then we had you guys may know this, but Okra, we ship coal. We mine lignite and we ship it, and we had the rails froze up, and then we had plugging, and that took us down for about a day and a half. Now why does that matter? Well, it matters a lot because Oak Grove has about $5 a megawatt hour cost structure as opposed to having to essentially replace it with gas at hundreds of dollars in MMBTU. So the margin that we were getting for that days and a half was less. Now we got it back. That was a good thing, but we lost for about days and a half days. That was a lot of money that we lost, and Jim is going to go through these numbers. The other thing I heard is that there was a pricing glitch on Monday. So we are in what we call an EEA3, which is the highest alert at ERCOT. That means you have really no reserves. In fact, we had 30,000 megawatts of negative reserves. Where was the price? Price was trading at LNPs, in some instances $1,000 below our cost. And so we are calling ERCOT. What is going on? Well, we determined there was a pricing, let's call it anomaly. We went to the PUC the next day. And they came out with an order and said, \"We are going to reprice that at the cap, and then we are going to have it stay at the cap until we come out of EEA3.\" Frankly, the right decision, and that was a big deal for us. Inexplicably, 18-hours later they reversed the decision, and they decide to do it prospectively, but not retroactively. And they claim that during the wee hours of the morning on Monday, that people relied on that price. Ridiculous. And so Monday was a big day for us because we were long that day. Because the gas infrastructure was just beginning to come off, and so we lost that value. Now that is something that we could - are still take a hard look at, but that was tough. Again, \"Curt, what does it matter? It still happened to you.\" Yes, it did, but we didn't expect it. Nobody expected when we are in EEA3, that the price would be anything but at the cap. How could it be when you have negative reserves? It absolutely is preposterous, and yet that is what happened. So all of those things happened. We didn't know what the book was. We went through that week. We performed actually relatively well. We put on 25% to 30% of all megawatts on the grid relative to our 18% market share. Good. Again, no good deed goes unpunished. The problem was we had a mismatch when they locked the system down between megawatts and load. And the other thing is we were producing from higher-cost assets than we expected. So our cost of goods sold mix was not helpful. So I have taken you really through the two first slides. I will say a little bit about the market because I think the other very fair question is, \"Okay, well, what's this mean for the Texas market?\" And frankly, I thought it was the best market in the country. And this event has made me think. Not just me, but a lot of people think about it. But I still believe the basic tenets of a very good market are here. But I think the one thing that we are going to have to work on with the policy makers, the regulators, and I think we have good momentum on this, is that the grid in Texas today when we put in the all energy market and the price caps, is a grid that is different than the one that existed when we went competitive. So when we were competitive, it was a very different grid house where we have a lot less dispatchable resources. In fact, we have less dispatchable resources than our peak loads. So we rely much more heavily on renewables. Renewables are good. Nothing wrong with that. But it changes the risk profile. Renewables during this event were at capacity factors from 5% to sort of 15%. They didn't really contribute a lot during this event. And that is why I said when we were at 74,000 peak load, we didn't have enough megawatts in the system. Again, it wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when. And we were telling people that. So on the market design, reserves has to be, in my mind, the number one - emphasis. And so there is a number of ways to get more reserves on the system. But I also think that we have to take a hard look at the balance between market and the competitive markets and reliability. And I think that puts a lot of things on the table. That puts could be potentially greater reserves that ERCOT has to acquire in order to maintain the system. It could be a capacity market. I know that that may be blast for me to some in Texas, but I think it has to be on the table. But what I think comes out of this is still a very good competitive market that still has opportunities for people to do well, but moves on the spectrum of competitiveness to reliability, move that a little more toward the middle. But we are going to sort through that and more will come out of that, but I'm confident that Texas will rise to the occasion. This economy mandates it, and the policymakers in the governor and others know that this economic engine is powered by electricity. And with electrification coming, we have got to get it right. And we are a big player. We have a big seat at the table. We have a lot of good ideas, and I think the market actually advances to a good point. Now the weather event, I mean we are believers in climate change. We don't know this type of event becomes more frequent. But I think if you just let history tell you something, that this is not a frequent event, but it could happen. And so we have to adapt. We have to. And it is not huge numbers, but we are going to have to batten down the hatch, so to speak, and to harden our assets. The one thing I'm going to be on a say about is making sure that the gas and electric systems work seamlessly, that the TDUs upgrade their critical infrastructure, and that the gas system puts the money in, just like we, do to harden the system. It cannot be acceptable to not deliver gas at the maximum pressures in the middle of a natural disaster. And you can't say, \"Well, my hands are clean on this. I don't regulate that.\" Well, let's change the regulations then. So we have work to do, but I still have confidence, very much so, in the market. Now, this has been difficult. We hope that we hope to maintain your trust in us. But at the very least, we hope to earn it back. I'm disappointed. And it hurts, but it is what it is. And it is easy to lead when things are going well, and I think it is time to lead going forward. And I believe that the franchise is in place, the financial strength that we worked so hard to build, thank goodness, has helped us through this. And our better days are still ahead of us. And the integrated model still works, and we just have to do some things, some tweaks. We have to work on the market design, but I still have faith in this business and in these markets because they are too important. Electricity is the lifeblood of the economy. We have to get this right. there is no choice when you say, \"Well, how do I trust that?\" Texas can never go through this again, and they know that. So that is what I trust. And we are a big player here. And so what comes out the back end of this, I believe, is going to be good for Texas, good for the market and good for Vistra. So with that, I'm going to move into, and I just hate this, but I will move into 2020. Not that I hate 2020, or maybe I do. But I will moved into 2020 because we had such a great year, and this event has overshadowed it. And the men and women have worked so hard at Vistra in 2020 in the face of COVID, in the face of social issues and everything that is been thrown at us, performed as about as good as anybody could have expected. It enabled us to pay down a significant amount of debt. Our retail business was exceptional, getting close to almost $1 billion of EBITDA. We continue on the cost savings front. And by the way, I'm not going to throw a number out there today and say that we are going to save a bunch of hundreds of millions of dollars. We have a lean business, and I'm not going to starve this business. You cannot starve power plants for maintenance costs. It will bite you in 2022 and 2023. But we will as we always do, and we will double down. We will look for opportunities to optimize earnings going forward once we determine what the full effect of this is. And I'm convinced that we do every year, we will find opportunities and we will let you know what those are. But I'm not going to throw a big number out there that I don't think is good for the company in the long run, and we are playing this for the long run. 2021 and this event are a onetime event, and we are going to move this company forward in a way where it can compete and be even better into the future. In 2020, I'm now on delivering the financial results slide. Just a phenomenal year, $3.77 billion of EBITDA and almost $2.6 billion in free cash flow before growth, almost a 70% conversion ratio. I remember when I was talking to you guys in the Dynegy acquisition, and we put out the - I think it is S-4 and we had a set of projection numbers. And just looking at what we were able to do in 2020 relative to what we had in that is, in my opinion, truly remarkable. And I think we did that with very disciplined investment into the business, and I'm proud of what we were able to do and what the numbers we were able to put up. I think since I took over, we have got I think almost $600 million above midpoint of guidance over those years. What just kills me is we gave it all back and more, but we have been through that story already this morning. I won't take you through it again, but that is tough. You don't want to get back what you have created, and that is a difficult thing for us. The OP initiative continues, and it will continue. We baked that now. That is just a part of who we are. And we like to give this to you just because we want you to know when we tell you we are doing something, that we do it. But it is really embedded in our EBITDA. And then we are on track on our synergies for the - and namely the Crius and Ambit because Dynegy is pretty much done Even on the system side, the technology side, that is pretty much done at this point in time. And the last thing I will say and I will hand it over to Jim. Through all this, we still have - and I'm on the last slide here, prioritizing all stakeholders. Just briefly to touch base, this has been who we are since I have been here. We have been about all stakeholders. We continue to do it. We have made huge advancements on the environmental side with our employees and contractors and customers and suppliers in our communities. We are proud of that, and we expect to continue to do that. And I know we did announce that we had $5 million to help customers. And some people may say, \"Well, there is a cost savings right there, Curt, why did you do that?\" And it is because of what I said earlier, two things. One is we are about helping people. As a company, not just about making money. We do care about that, but we have a bunch of people down here that are in need. This became a survival game. This became a human's needs effort, and we took that seriously, just like we take seriously being the guardians of your investments, we do care also about people. And it is very important to the franchise of our retail businesses that we are out there, and we are helping others. We have not lost those franchises. This weather couldn't take the franchises away from us, and they have extreme value. And we have to keep investing in those franchises, but helping people is also a very important thing. And so we made that hard call in the face of adversity and uncertainty because that is who we are. That is what we are about. So with that, I'm going to give it to Jim. Jim is going to quickly go through financial results. And then I know you guys have Q&A, and we will try to answer everything we can as completely as possible. And so I will turn it over to Jim. Thank you. No, there is a potential to that. Yes. I mean look, so it is going to come down to - and I don't want to actually litigate it, but there are provisions and contracts. Every one of them is a little bit different, and it will come down to whether those provisions applied in this instance or not. And to be a very simple analysis, what I will say is there is potential. We are still doing the analysis as to whether it will make sense or not, and we can update you guys on that. But obviously it is something we need to take a look at, because we thought we had gas at a particular price. And obviously we didn't, and that was a big hit for us. So we will see where the stakes is, but there could be some disputes. So I think the interesting thing on that one, Steve, is first of all, yes, it can be disputed. Secondly, it is going to be disputed on both ends. So the prospective increase to the cap and actually keeping it at the cap on Thursday into Friday is going to be something, I think, that is going - not only will be maybe challenged with Public Utility Commission, but it may be challenged at the legislature. So we absolutely believe that when you are in EEA 3 and you don't have reserves, you have negative reserves that you can't be anywhere but the cap. But there is a particular mechanism in pricing scheme that actually kicked in that had the prices being set at LMPs that were below the cap at times. And I think the commission rightly so determined that the price should be at the cap. Ultimately, I think they have the authority to make that order. I think we will likely challenge the notion that you can't retroactively price. But I think there may be others like retailers who may challenge whether it should have been set at the cap. So it is an unfortunate thing because billions of dollars changed hands in a week. People are going to go out of business over it. And I think people are going to try to see what they can do to change the playing field. So we won't really know until we get through all of that math, which I think will go on for some time. But we are probably going to contribute a little bit to the mess because there are some things that we think are legitimate to be - to dispute, and we may do that. No, you have got it exactly right, Stephen. And this was the dilemma that we were faced with. With an unknown load, an unknown financial obligation, but an absolute obligation to human needs. And this is the problem, and I said this last night, yesterday to the House and the Senate in Texas that I don't believe Texas can stop this type of an event, and I don't think any state really can'. I don't think they like the price cap. They don't like the grid products. They don't like consumers having it passed on. We don't like consumers having blips like this passed on because they will shop for another supplier or retailer. And so we all agree that the volatility in this market is probably not what it should be. On the other end of the spectrum, I'm not sure that everybody is ready to go to some full capacity market. But I do believe there is something that can be done in between where the price cap comes down and you increase the amount of reserves, which increases the revenues into the market and it increases the steel in the ground. So it brings this thing a little more stable with less layouts and less risk to consumers. Because what's a problem with the model now for us is as a retailer we don't want to increase price to consumers in the middle of this type of an event, yet our suppliers are increasing prices at will. And we get squeezed in the middle. That is an untenable situation. That is not something that can last. And I believe I made some good points and people are beginning to realize that in this market. So I am convinced that market design will help with that. But the other thing is we cannot let the gas system fail again, and it did. And I don't care what anybody says. All the way from the wellhead, I mean we are producing right now oil and gas in North Dakota. Don't tell me it can't be produced in that kind of weather. And so we can't have that happen again. I don't care if we produce more gas than we ever have in Texas because of demand. The reality is the pressures on the lines were not sufficient enough to get gas generators what they need it in order to be at the top. And we are in a virtuous cycle. We need to provide electricity for compressors and for gas processing and for production sites. We need gas bill to produce electricity. So they all have to work together. And sometimes, that is what regulatory - that is what regulation does and that is what policymakers do. And we need to make sure that happens. Well, I think we are going to give a chance, I hope Tuesday. Alright. Thank you. You can do more than one. Yes, that is an excellent question. So you know we moved it in September. And then we decided to just move it a couple of pennies and to $0.60. And it was $10 million, Steve. And we had made the call, and we just didn't go back on it. $10 million's still $10 million. So we decided to go forward with it and thought it was still the right thing. This is one of these things where if you do it, some people say, \"Why the heck are you doing, raising your dividend?\" Regardless of how much it is in the middle of something like this, honestly I think the way we are thinking about this is that this is a onetime event. It is unfortunate, but we are still on the trajectory when 2022 rolls around. We are still back to where we were on our capital allocation plan in 2023 and forward. And so we made the call to continue with that. Relatively small, but still obviously it is an obvious change in the middle of this type of situation. It certainly can be second guessed, but we thought it was the right thing to do to move forward with it. We still are very interested in our dividend. We think it is important to our investors. And so we decided to stick with it. Because we made that decision, Steve, by the way, before this hit. As a Board, we decided to do this, and we did not revisit it. We said we are going to go ahead and move forward with it. Yes. So from a liquidity standpoint, we feel good. And not only do we feel good with what we have, we feel good with the partnerships we have with a number of different financial institutions that have frankly been very supportive. And they didn't know anything, by the way. They didn't know if we made money or we didn't make money. But they also knew people were winners and losers. And they have come to us and said, \"Look, we believe in your long term. If you need it any kind of liquidity, we would be happy to make our balance sheet available to you to help you through this, if you needed it.\" I'm convinced that this is not a liquidity crisis for this company. This is a short run-material hit. We took a body blow. But I also believe that we will come back or out of this and move forward with strength. And the fact that people are willing to help us out in this, and they understand, they believe in us, that is huge to us. But Steve, I don't see this as a situation we are in dire straits. I would tell you, if we hadn't got our debt down and we are still the old IPP model, we would be in a different place. Yes. So a number that Jim talk a little bit about retail. But I will just say - I'm sorry, what was the first part of that? I got the -. Yes, yes, yes, sorry. Yes. So I guess gets in a little bit to the capital allocation discussion too. I mean first of all, we still believe probably more so than we ever have, in Texas. Until there is a market design change, the generation is pretty darn important. And now we know obviously supply chain around our generation with gas is even more important than we ever thought. But we still believe that the generation that we have is important. I still think that we are going to see coal retirements. And we believe, probably even more now than ever, because my guess is this is also going to impact development in the ERCOT market. But we think there is value in these - in the projects that we are doing. So we continue to want to do those. I will say, though, Steve, that how we finance those and how we realize the value from them. I think we always have been open-minded, and we will continue to be open-minded about - I'm talking now about the renewable investments that we are doing. And so there could be some things that we do. I think we would like to buy our shares back, and we are going to probably need to do that even more. So the real challenge in 2021 is there is not going to be a lot of money to do that, unless we were to do some project-level financing or something like that, which we will consider. In 2022 and beyond, by the way, retail actually held up through this. And Steve or Jim can get into the details and tell you his thoughts on retail real quick. But we are looking not only to maintain our retail, but we may end up getting - we are a provider of last resort in ERCOT. And we may get some of the customers, if in fact customers drop their customers to the provider of last resort, which is a mechanism in ERCOT. We may get a significant amount of new customers. And we are also open to continuing M&A around retail. So we have been saying we would like to get a little more retail in our business. I think we are continuing that. We like that business. We are good at it. And so I think that hasn't changed. On the generation front. We were sort of reducing our generation exposure a little bit anyway, and we are becoming more and more matched. I know this event obviously shakes people because we ended up being short. It was because of things that we did not, could not have planned for. So I still think that we are going to head down a path where our generation is going to be reduced in terms of megawatts as we retire coal. And we will add some renewables and batteries, and we will still have generation. But I think we will be a much more balanced company as we go forward. Even with this event, we still think that is the right move. I hope that I -- Jim, do you want to say anything about retail quick? Thank you Steve. Yes, great questions, Julien. So on the renewables, I think you sort of stated accurately. And I tried to portray this, maybe I didn't do a very good job on it. But I think there are some opportunity to potentially raise capital in a different way, let's put it that way, that could add capital to buy back shares. And I think we would like to buy our shares back. So I think we are going to be very open-minded. These projects have value to them. And now that can be somewhat contingent on also having contracted projects. And of course we have a retail business that we can look at to contract with, but we also can do that externally with third parties. So I think there is some work in 2021, we will do to make sure that. But we are not in a position where we have done it ahead and that we absolutely have to do it, but I think it is worth doing. And we were considering it even before this event, but I think it is an even higher priority. Jim, do you have anything you want to add to that? But that is kind of how I see that. And then I can answer the next piece of it too. We have looked at that, Julien. And the problem is again if you want to sell it, and return to the hedge, I suppose you could do that. But the values just aren't there. There is so much generation that is either explicitly or implicitly for sale in the market that - and I don't feel like we have to do that. But if we found an opportunity to do that, that made some financial sense, we don't need to own all the megawatts that we have, and so we would consider that. But I'm not - we are not going to rush to that because we are not in a financial distress. And I think we are going to be a little more disciplined. I think I would rather look for ways to save money and to do things like that rather than to force a sale in the middle of a market that is not a particularly good market to sell assets in. You asked about the ratings - yes, so rating agencies I will just say this, we have had some early discussions with them. And this is, like it is to you guys, it is an initial shock. They know that we are still disciplined, and we will continue to pay down debt and that we have been that way. And so look, I think we have had constructive discussions. I have nothing to announce at this point in time about that, and they don't either. But I would say the discussions have been constructive. And I'm going to spend some time I could. I was in these hearings all day yesterday. I'm going to spend some time with a couple of the agencies myself because I couldn't make the meetings and talk to them. But I found the discussions to be very open and honest and constructive, and I'm hopeful that we will be okay there. Thank you. Yes. So look, we were asked to bring back ideas in a week. This event has really shaken the state of Texas from the very top. I was able to speak with some of the obviously the leadership in the state of Texas, they don't want this to happen again. I think they are beginning to realize that the mix of assets in the market combined with the structure itself is not sustainable, pretty obvious to them. And they also know this was a big weather event. And we can't lose sight of that, that this was an extreme weather event. But at the same time, they have to ask themselves even so, do we really want to even have to take the risk of this type of event. And I think they are asking themselves, and they know the answer, none of them can stomach really the idea that a bunch of this high pricing power is going to get passed on to customers. And so they realize that that is an untenable position to be in for us, and they are worried about having enough generation. And they realize if you don't have a market structure that works, people aren't going to invest. So that tells me that there is a very good probability that we could get something done here, and I would say north of 50%. And I wouldn't normally say that about any process like that, but I see momentum. And I know our company is going to have a seat at the table. And we are going to be working on this extensively in the next few days, because I do not want to lose the momentum. I think we do need a change. And were already considering these things, and so we were prepared. And I think it is time to get everybody together and find a way to move this market. Still using competitive market principles, but I think stabilizing it somewhat. Thank you. Yes, I will, and then Jim can jump in. But it was kind of two things. Getting coal to the coal silos, but it also was wet coal that we actually had. And so what we were - and that was creating issues with the front end process to eventually burn coal. And so it was those two things. So we were trying to get fresh coal in, and then we were having problems with the rail. Because the coal we had on the ground was frozen, and it was also wet in going up and causing problems that we end up having to take the units down. But that is what I understand it. But Jim has been working on this night and day. So why don't we let him also explain his knowledge of what happened? Yes. And so like with prices kind of on Tuesday and Wednesday kind of clearing at the cap, and it looked like you guys had some length or heat rate length open going into this. I guess I'm still trying to wrap my head around on kind of on why the losses where they were to such an extent. Are you guys kind of saying that because you did such a good job in a light state on in north zone versus say Houston zone that you just - and the demand was so high there relatively, that you guys kind of found yourself short, whereas other kind of generation units that were pointed at Houston zone basically had the benefit of the load just basically being cut, so they basically weren't short anymore? Yes. So I mean - go ahead. And Jim, I will just add that what happened is too is Monday, as I said, pricing was not at the cap. For this very strange reason, we were long Monday. Then we started having gas delivery issues, pricing issues as well as pressure issues. And then we lost Oak Grove for about day and a half, which is our low-cost fuel. And so it is like one of these sayings where if it could go bad, it did. And all those things contributed, but a big chunk of it really was around gas. The cost of gas as well as the amount of gas we were getting delivered. And then there was another - that is a big bucket. That is like, I think Jim has said, about two-thirds. And about third of it was around our coal of that total. And I know - because - I mean you can only imagine what I was doing to meet - I was like pulling my hair out. Like I thought we were long. I thought we were in a good position. We are one of the biggest generators in terms of percentage on the grid. You think $9,000 cap, you are thinking everything is going well. But when you start tracing through it, it begins to make sense and unravel as to how our position changed and how we were - had the inability to really do much about it. But we did the right thing, but it was financially not good. And that is a tough thing when you do things and you know that you were doing the right thing and the outcome doesn't swing your way, it is very difficult. Yes. Take care. Well, I appreciate people that are still hanging in there. But thank you very much for your interest in our company. Tough week last week, but this company is strong, resilient. It is a good company, and we are going to come out of this stronger than ever. I hope you all have a great weekend, and look forward to talking to you soon."

            "content": "Thanks, Curt. I'm going to quickly cover Slide 16. As Curt said, I know we want to get to Q&A. I want to just hit two slides. Our full-year 2020 retail results were 176 million higher than our full-year 2019 results, driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit, plus strong ERCOT margin performance partially offset by milder weather. The 197 million favorability in our collective generation segments was driven by higher margins in our Texas, East and Sunset segments, including the higher period-over-period benefits from our OPI initiatives, partially offset by lower capacity revenues. As it relates to the impacts of COVID-19, Vistra was able to navigate through the challenges brought on by the pandemic with minimal impacts to our financial performance. On the retail side, we only saw a small uptick in bad debt during the year, while our lower business volumes were offset by higher residential volumes. And as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call in May of 2020, our commercial team executed some opportunistic transactions in anticipation of the market volatility caused by COVID-19, resulting in a positive benefit to Vistra for the year. In addition to these strong financial results, our retail business grew its residential customer count in Texas year-over-year, reflecting strong performance by our legacy brands, while our generation business once again executed with commercial availability of over 95%. On the liquidity side as of year-end 2020, Vistra had total available liquidity of approximately $2.4 billion, which was primarily comprised of cash and availability under its revolving credit facility. This strong liquidity position enabled Vistra to effectively manage the collateral requirements related to the winter storm Uri. As of February 25th, Vistra had more than $1.5 billion of cash and availability under its revolving credit facility to meet any liquidity needs. We can close with Slide 17. Vistra repaid more than $1.5 billion of debt in 2020 to end the year at our long-term leverage target of 2.5 time net debt to adjusted EBITDA. As of February 23rd, we have repurchased approximately 5.9 million shares at an average price of $21.15. $1.375 billion remains available under this authorization. We are continuing to execute on our strategic renewable and energy storage investments, including our Texas Phase I and California battery projects. As we have communicated to you, we will be disciplined as it relates to deploying capital, regularly evaluating all growth projects for financial viability. We will only invest in growth projects if we are confident in the expected returns. As a result of this continuous review, we are currently pausing one growth project in West Texas due to updated economics driven by higher-than-anticipated congestion costs. I know many of you are wondering how our existing capital allocation plan will change as a result of the impacts of this winter storm. We expect to provide an updated capital allocation plan for 2021 on our first quarter earnings call. We remain committed to our dividend trajectory and to maintaining a strong balance sheet. The challenges brought on by the global pandemic in 2020 and this historic winter storm in Texas last week have tested our business model. We truly believe it was a one-time historic event. The winter event was a significant financial hit. Our people worked in very tough conditions to generate as much power for the greatest possible. Importantly, our business still has the strong assets that it had just two weeks ago. Both our customer base and our generation footprint remain intact, and we believe with solid growth prospects. We are a resilient team and we will stay focused on bringing value for our stakeholders over the long term. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions. Yes, sure, I would. Thanks, Curt. Steve, I think over the evolution of the markets here in ERCOT, we have seen these events come every three to five-years. And it disciplines retailers to think differently about some of the collateral requirements and the hedging that is necessary to survive. This event had the chance to really create a runaway scenario for swing for the retail segment, for any retail business in ERCOT. And then the load shed capped out that exposure for some, and it actually it did for our business as well. And so the retail business held well. However, there still are some retail businesses that experienced swing, and they are reporting some results that are unfavorable. I think this business takes more capital than most people think. And it takes more discipline around hedging than most people think. And we found ourselves even in a business that we are very familiar with, having assets ready to run, being in a position to run and having trouble with the fuel supply, which we did not see coming to the extent obviously that had occurred. So I think there is going to be some retail consolidation. I think whether it is through the [indiscernible] process or whether that is through a chance to take a look at some books. I think we are going to come out of this in a relative position in a very strong place. And we look at 2022 and beyond as back to normal. And to your point about the curves, the curves being up in the next several years is a 200 million to 300 million difference than where we were just a few weeks ago. And so we will see how that plays out. But this is a tough one, tough one to get through. But I think coming out on the other side, we are going to be relatively positioned in a good place. Our view is very similar to Curt, and I think there may be opportunities to look at current operating assets in the market, are those underway, as current owners or projects might have seen the performance get and how they hedged some of those assets in this market as well. And so I think there could be other opportunities that weren't on the horizon just a few weeks ago. Sure. Thanks, Amit, for the question. That is one of the benefits of having a mine operation right there is that we can self-supply we have several days worked at the plant. And then of course we have at the mine, we have much more under whole barn, a covered area. So the thought was when the coal pile, which is right by the plant, is exposed, it froze over, becomes basically chunks of ice that you can't put through the equipment without tearing it up. So the goal is to try to get the dryer coal over from the mine to the plant. And that transportation system is really tough, not just the tracks, but the railcars, the doors that you used to dump the call they are freezing. So they were freezing shut and then we couldn't actually once we got them open, we couldn't get them back closed. And so we had a supply chain even within our own system where it was effectively difficult to work in the freezing conditions that got worse through the middle of the week Before we were able to find ways to work through that. So that wasn't about a rail coming in from elsewhere. It was really between the mine and the plant and trying to get the best fuel we could. At Martin Lake, we obviously do have also a supply on hand. It was a derated plant because of the freezing temperatures and also dealing with the pile, effectively turning into ice. And so we ended up our conveyor systems where we are transporting this call up through to the plants, they are exposed as well in many parts of the country. Those are completely enclosed. So these systems, as Curt mentioned earlier, they were designed for the heat and the warm weather, not the freezing temperatures we were in. So we took de-rates on that plan as well. We ended up at a 70% capacity factor for coal during the week. So the capacity factor is certainly lower than we expected and wanted to have. But that 30% that we were not able to keep going, and that includes the de-rates and being off-line. That just became a very expensive prospect for us. Because as Curt said, we were replacing $5 to $20 a megawatt hour fuel with $2,000 fuel in the form of gas that we were burning in some of our old gas steam units. And so a little bit of miss on the volume there multiplied by the delta on fuel cost was substantial. So we are going to have to look at the coal handling and look at what resiliency we need to build in for this type of a cold weather stretch at our coal plants."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Molly Sorg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMolly Sorg: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast covering third quarter 2020 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related earnings release.  Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Hudson, Executive Vice President and President of Retail; and David Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives on the call to address questions in the second part of today's webcast as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.\nCurt Morgan: Thanks, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. We appreciate your time and interest in Vistra during this busy third quarter earnings season. It was just five weeks ago when we last connected with you at our virtual investor event, where we laid out our capital allocation plan for the next few years and provided additional details regarding our planned portfolio transformation. As we announced on the call, we expect to transform our generation fleet, including growing our renewable and energy storage presence, while retiring the majority of our existing coal plants, significantly decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions produced by our operations. We believe, we are our natural owner of renewable and energy storage assets given our capabilities and competitive position, and have a high degree of competence that we can generate healthy return from these assets through the same skills and methodology by which we extract significant value from our existing fleet.  We are not going to give away the value to others by entering into below market power purchase agreements, and we have the capabilities to manage the market risk.  We also own a portfolio of highly-efficient low-emitting natural gas assets that can provide reliable dispatchable power and complement the intermittent nature of renewable resources. The diversity of our portfolio enables our team to structure renewable products that can ensure reliability at an affordable price.  As we have recounted in the past, every reputable and objective study on the changing power generation landscape has natural gas playing a significant role for several years to come, especially as we electrify the economy. The most recent study by E3, a well-respected energy consulting firm, is another good example. And let's not forget, we already serve nearly 5 million retail customers, many of which are increasingly seeking to procure their electricity needs from renewable sources.  I know we did not spend as much time on our retail business during our virtual investor event in September, but it is one of the cornerstones of our business model, and we expect to prudently invest in it, as evidenced by the announcement of a highly attractive tuck-in retail business we announced today that Scott Hudson, the President of our Retail Business will discuss. Through growing retail and reducing our exposure to coal generation, we will continue to optimize our retail to wholesale match.  It is important to keep in perspective that it's going to take trillions of dollars of investment over several years for the U.S. electricity grids to meaningfully transition away from thermal resources. The current generating fleet in the U.S. was invested in over many decades. In this respects, we will play an important role in that transition, as well as provide critical reliability via our flexible gas assets.  As we have just recently spent considerable time on these topics, we plan to focus today on the very strong third quarter and year-to-date results of our integrated business. We will also provide a business update on our retail operations.  Before I turn to our third quarter results, I would be remised not to acknowledge that the country is experiencing another wave of COVID-19 cases as we enter the flu season, albeit with a lower mortality rate.  As we have said before, the health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. We have had only five cases we can trace to being contracted at work, successfully containing further spread. Vistra is dedicated to staying vigilant and focused as we continue to operate safely to keep the lights on in this unprecedented environment. We will also continue to focus on helping our communities and customers through this difficult period by making corporate donations, procuring computers for children in need, and offering payment plans and deferral programs for our customers. Just a few examples of our commitment to helping others in need. We hope all of you are also staying safe and healthy.  I'm going to start on Slide 6, where we set forth our strong third quarter and year-to-date results. In the third quarter Vistra delivered adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1,185 million which is 10% above third quarter of 2019 results despite operating through a pandemic in 2020. These higher results might appear counterintuitive, as it was in the third quarter of 2019, when the Texas market saw meaningful scarcity pricing intervals. We did not see similar scarcity pricing this summer as the hottest days fell on the weekends, and fleet performance across Texas was exceptional, exceeding what was already strong performance in the summer of 2019.  As we often reiterate, scarcity events typically have an overall limited impact on current period results, as we are usually largely hedged heading into any given summer. Rather, where scarcity pricing events can be the most beneficial for Vistra\u2019s financial results, relates to the impact they have on forward pricing. We saw this phenomenon play out in the summer of 2019, as it was in August 2019, when the summer 2020 forwards in Texas rose meaningfully. The ERCOT forward stayed at elevated levels through the end of the year, giving Vistra several months of opportunity to hedge our summer 2020 output at attractive prices that were on average higher than the average prices realized for 2019. We're also continuing to see the benefits of our Operations Performance improvement or OP Initiative materialize.  As a reminder, our OP program is on track to deliver an incremental $100 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020 as compared to 2019. With the benefits of our OP program combined with the Dynegy, Crius and Ambit synergies projected to reach an annual run rate of nearly $700 million by year end.  Our retail business had lower adjusted EBITDA period-over-period driven by the additional volume from Crius and Ambit acquisitions. You will recall that our retail business can generate negative EBITDA in the third quarter in periods of higher wholesale pricing due to the seasonality and power costs in Texas, which is why this incremental value drove EBITDA lower in the period. While approaches vary across companies, we do not levelize our cost of power throughout the year. Rather we flow through our actual costs while our retail pricing and revenues are relatively flat.  However, it is important to note that our retail business results exceeded management expectations for the quarter, which are embedded in our guidance as a result of stronger margins and lower sales costs contributing to our 2020 guidance raise for the segment during our September investor event. In addition, our three legacy retail brands once again organically grew residential customer counts in Texas during the course. Vistra delivered year-to-date adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $2,964 million, results that are tracking ahead of management expectations for the period and solidly above 2019 results by nearly 15%, further evidence of the resiliency of the integrated model.  It was a strong performance through the first part of the year that led Vistra to raise its 2020 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance midpoint by $150 million and $165 million respectively in September. Year-to-date, this Vistra is tracking solidly above this recently raised adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint. And as we've mentioned before, it will be the fifth year in a row that we have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance, not exactly the kind of performance associated with the stock or the free cash flow yield in the 20s.  Today, we are reaffirming our recently raised 2020 guidance ranges as set forth on Slide 6. Though, assuming we once again successfully execute in the fourth quarter, we are expecting another adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint be. Importantly, our financial guidance implies an adjusted EBITDA through adjusted free cash flow before growth conversion ratio of approximately 69% for the year, which supports our recently announced capital allocation plan and the anticipated significant return of capital to our financial stakeholders. We have been able to significantly exceed our original free cash flow before growth guidance midpoint and achieve this high conversion ratio even with the early receipt in 2019 of nearly $95 million of alternative minimum tax refunds that were projected in our 2020 guidance and while accelerating some planned outages in 2020, and opportunistically taking advantage of business opportunities that required a higher use of current year cash flows. Turning now to Slide 7. Today, we are also reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges for both ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth, which we initiated during our virtual investor event in September. We have continued to execute since that time, increasing our confidence in our 2021 guidance ranges, and further supporting our view that the upper end of the guidance ranges are achievable.  Importantly, Vistra\u2019s fundamental analysis continues to suggest that the current 2021 forward prices in ERCOT are meaningfully discounting the probability of summer scarcity events. When evaluating all the supply and demand variables at play, we are bullish as ever regarding our opportunity to capture value in 2021. In fact, last Monday, a random Monday in late October, the ERCOT market found itself in a period of scarcity, where prices surged to over $1,000 per megawatt hour around 7 p.m. and stayed well above $100 per megawatt hour for most of the day. These price outcomes were driven by several factors including load coming in 1,500 to 3,000 megawatts higher than predicted in the day-ahead market. Lower available thermal generation due to the post-summer outage season for most units significantly lowered renewables contribution than expected, including wind coming in approximately 13,000 megawatts lower than anticipated during the peak 7 p.m. hour partly driven by icing issues on the turbine blades and the limited contribution from solar throughout the day given the cloud cover. Importantly, the observed strong demand levels extending into the evening hours was also a key contributor to the strong pricing we saw on Monday. As we know and have observed in other markets, the presence of strong evening hour demand does not line up well with the solar contribution profile. This mismatch between demand and the solar generation profile is an emerging trend in Texas, and it will likely be an increasing source of volatility as the supply stack evolves, volatility that Vistra's commercial team and generating assets are positioned to capture, as we have demonstrated time and time again. This is just another reminder of how quickly prices in Texas can change when intermittent renewable resources are not available. While the value of the forward curve at any single point in time leading into the delivery year is important, what is most important to Vistra is that we are able to strategically capture value as market opportunities arise, just like we did last Monday in Texas. Our assets and business positions offer significant levers to capture value that can be represented and captured in the forward, or it can be locked into through bilateral transactions. We have been able to construct a realized wholesale price curve that has supported our consistent overperformance for the last 5 years. We are continuing to make progress in this regard and executing for 2021. Looking ahead to 2022, our current expectations for the earnings power of our business are consistent with our average 2020 to 2021 view in the range of $3.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and a conversion rate to free cash flow before growth of 65% or more. We believe we can manage our year-to-year earnings volatility within a very tight range, and we continue to have confidence in the long-term earnings profile of our business. The market clearly does not share this view. As action on climate change accelerates in private institutions, and state and federal policymakers advance policies supporting the development of incremental renewable resources, investors are clearly questioning what this evolving landscape might mean for Vistra. In our view, it is this question that has directly been impacting Vistra's valuation. There is no justification for Vistra to trade at a 20% free cash flow yield based on the performance and financial position of the company. Free cash flow yield at these levels are generally reserved for companies in financial distress, with poor performance track records and weak balance sheets. None of this applies to Vistra. The only explanation that seems to make some sense is that the market must expect Vistra will experience future economic distress based on the changing power generation landscape. In our view, Vistra's near-term financial performance supports a free cash flow yield at least in the low double-digits, especially when taking into account where the company's debt trades and the prospect for investment-grade credit ratings in the next year. The debt-to-equity risk premium is confounding. Rather, if you believe in appropriate free cash flow yield for a business with a strong balance sheet and a proven track record on execution should be in the range of 10% to 12%, the recent prices where Vistra's stock has been trading would suggest that the market is assigning virtually zero equity value to Vistra's generation segments. In our view, this is a completely flawed assumption that is likely driven by the emotions of the current ESP environment as opposed to a practical and informed fundamental analysis. The bulk of Vistra's adjusted EBITDA from its generation segments is derived from its relatively young, low-cost, highly flexible gas field generation fleet, with 2 of the lowest cost nuclear and coal plants in the country in Comanche Peak and Oak Grove, both in Texas. We believe these assets will continue to be critical resources in the markets where we operate and will continue to generate substantial free cash flow, most of which will be returned to investors. There is absolutely no way that these assets have zero equity value, and in fact, they have significant positive value. In addition, the assumption of no value from our generation fleet extends to our investments in solar and batteries, yet standalone renewable companies are garnering lofty valuations in the markets today. An appropriate free cash flow yield applied to the true long-term free cash flow of Vistra would produce a stock price substantially above our current trading price and at least in line with most sell-side analysts\u2019 price targets. As long as this valuation disconnect persists, we will continue to buy back our shares. If you turn to the next slide, Slide 8, we have set forth how we think Vistra will be able to not only compete but to lead over the next couple of decades. Since 2016, when Vistra was first spun off from its parent as a publicly traded company, we have taken actions to build a business that prioritizes a strong balance sheet and low-cost and market-leading integrated operations with high-quality assets. We also took a company that was 70% coal and transformed it by retiring 16,000 megawatts of coal, adding natural gas renewables and battery generation and growing our retail business by over 3 million customers, all while significantly reducing costs, improving generation performance and expanding our EBITDA at highly attractive returns, which we highlighted at our investor event. We derive approximately 95% of our ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA from our 4 core operating segments, Retail, Texas, East and West, where we believe we have meaningful and attractive transformational growth opportunities into the future. Of that 95%, only 15% now comes from coal And we convert approximately 65% of our adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow before growth, which has enabled the return of more than $6 billion of capital to our financial stakeholders over the last 4 years. With our expectation that we will return an average of $1.5 billion to our financial stakeholders annually, we estimate that we will return another approximately $7.5 billion by 2025 and a cumulative approximately $15 billion by 2030, with total annual returns of 15% or more projected. As we approach our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA, we also believe we are on track to achieve investment-grade credit ratings next year. The steps we have taken over the last 4 years have created a strong foundation from which we can launch our future initiatives. True to our name, we have a vision for success and a tradition of excellence. And now we have introduced our Vistra Zero brand, which will build on this vision and tradition as our zero carbon growth engine for our generation transformation. As we look ahead to 2030, we expect we will continue on this path, evolving into a market-leading integrated business that plays a key role in powering America through its renewable transition by making prudent incremental investments in renewables and energy storage, growing our retail business and offering innovative green products and value-added services to our customers and supporting the reliability of the electric grid at affordable prices with our flexible natural gas fleet. In fact, by 2030, we project that more than half of our adjusted EBITDA will be derived from our carbon-free operations, with 90% of our adjusted EBITDA coming from our retail business and low to zero-carbon generating assets. We believe we can grow our EBITDA over the next decade, even while retiring the majority of our existing coal portfolio, by investing only a modest fraction of our free cash flow back into the business. We expect the majority of our free cash flow will be returned to our financial stakeholders, primarily through dividends and share repurchases. And if we allocate only $1 billion per year to share repurchases at the recent prices where our stock has been trading, we can buy back the entire market cap of our company in less than 9 years. This is all while maintaining balance sheet strength and expected investment-grade credit ratings, a pretty impressive value and growth story, if you ask me. As difficult as it is to project 20 years into the future, as the decarbonization of the economy continues, we expect our disciplined transformation to accelerate into 2040. By 2040, we estimate at least 70% to 80% of our adjusted EBITDA will come from our carbon-free operations, including retail, nuclear, renewable and energy storage. We continue to believe that gas plants will remain a key component of the supply stack up until 2040 and beyond, initially as a base load and reliability resource and, over time, as a transition resource complementing renewables. The playing field is changing. ESG, in particular, environmental stewardship, especially as it relates to climate change, is an increasingly important component for portfolio managers\u2019 investment decisions, and Vistra is committed to prudently be out in front in the transformation leading a sustainable company reaching its fair and full value. Before I turn the call over to Scott, I did want to highlight 3 new slides we included in the appendix to our investor presentation this quarter related to our broad focus on our stakeholders as part of our ESG efforts. We believe a company that prioritizes employees, customers, communities, suppliers and investors is one that will attract the best talent and retain customers and investors. Slides 15 through 17 in our appendix highlight some of our recent ESG initiatives in these areas. We will update these slides on a quarterly basis, and we hope you find them informative and helpful. I will now turn the call over to Scott Hudson to discuss our retail business in a bit more detail.\nScott Hudson : Thank you, Curt. Turning to Slide 10, we wanted to spend some time on today's earnings call highlighting the stability of our retail business, its resiliency through the COVID-19 pandemic and our opportunities for continued growth. As many of you who have been following Vistra for some time might recall, Vistra's retail business has been a stable contributor of EBITDA since the retail market in Texas opened fully to competition in 2008. Prior to the Dynegy transaction, which closed in April of 2018, Vistra's retail business grew solely through organic activity. And over the period from 2008 to 2017, we generated an average of approximately $800 million of EBITDA annually, even in the face of a number of volatile power price cycles, including the extremely hot summer of 2011 and the polar vortex of 2014. The Dynegy transaction that closed in 2018 expanded Vistra\u2019s reach from a Texas-only retailer to one with operations in 5 of the top 10 competitive markets in the U.S. Then last year, we added both Crius Energy and Ambit Energy to our portfolio of businesses, expanding the Vistra Retail footprint to 19 states in the District of Columbia, adding several new brands, high-margin residential natural gas to the portfolio and a powerful network marketing channel. Vistra's customer counts grew to nearly 5 million, and our total delivered load grew to approximately 95 terawatt hours. In 2018 and 2019, our retail EBITDA averaged approximately $825 million. And we are currently on track to exceed our recently raised 2020 guidance midpoint of $955 million, with our 2021 adjusted EBITDA projected at nearly $1 billion. This expected performance in 2020 is particularly impressive in light of the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic during the year. In May, we estimated that COVID-19 could potentially be a negative driver of our 2020 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $70 million due to anticipated higher bad debt expense and the anticipated impact of lower volumes on our financial results. We now expect the impact from COVID-19 to reflect only $10 million to $15 million of higher bad debt expense in 2020, as lower business volumes during the year have been largely offset by higher residential volumes due to increased usage from the work-from-home population. Our strong performance in 2020 in the face of the pandemic is a direct result of the numerous initiatives we implemented to help our customers through these unprecedented times. For example, we utilized our data and analytics capabilities to proactively contact customers whose usage patterns had changed due to working-from-home requirements in order to make sure that they were on the right electricity plan. These efforts resulted in higher retention rates and enhanced customer satisfaction. We also offered payment flexibility to customers unsure of their financial future. Our experience has shown that if you help a customer through hard times, he will be a customer for life. Importantly, TXU Energy, our flagship retail brand, continued to maintain its 5-star rating in the ERCOT market and was the top-performing major retail electric brand in each month of the third quarter. In addition, TXU Energy has been a leader in innovation year-in and year-out, as evidenced by products like Free Nights, Free Nights and Solar Days, Free Pass and many others, all of which have been copied by our competition. In short, our strong 2020 is proving out. Vistra Retail continues to provide stability and robust financial results for the integrated model. As we look to the future, we expect to continue to grow our portfolio, both organically and through opportunistic acquisitions. In addition to the organic growth on the residential customer side, Vistra has demonstrated its ability to organically grow its business markets portfolio each year in ERCOT, and we have line of sight to consistent business markets growth in targeted regions outside of Texas. We also plan to continue to strengthen our customer relationships through various value-added offerings. On that point, Vistra has been active in the cross-selling of non-commodity products and services for over 8 years. We have invested in our platform, and we have seen significant growth, with customer interest growing threefold since 2013. We currently offer services like home warranties and insurance, smart thermostat, HVAC services and a variety of solar, energy storage and green products. We offer most of these products through an asset-light partnership model, which allows Vistra to nimbly test which services resonate with our consumers without making large capital investments. Beyond the opportunity to earn incremental EBITDA through these bolt-on product offerings, we have found that the expanded relationship results in a stickier portfolio, ultimately extending the life of our customers. As a result, we are continuing to expand the universe of value-added products we offer. On the natural gas side, our portfolio is focused on the high-margin residential and small business segments, where approximately 1 in 4 of our Crius and Ambit customers carry a natural gas product into the fuel markets. We are exploring expanding this offering into new markets in the future. We are similarly continuing to be opportunistic when evaluating potential M&A transactions. On that note, I'm excited to announce today that we have just executed an agreement to acquire the Texas electric retail customers of Infinite Energy and Veteran Energy. The transaction will expand Vistra's retail footprint in the attractive Texas market, where we currently derive 95% of our retail profitability. The transaction, which was executed at an estimated acquisition multiple of approximately 3.7 times is expected to close later this month. This acquisition is just another example of Vistra's ability to take advantage of our scale and market position to grow our business through attractive tuck-in opportunities.  Vistra Retail has the lowest cost structure of any major retailer in the country, and our operations are incredibly cash-efficient, dropping over 90% of our EBITDA to free cash flow. Retail continues to be the most attractive channel for Vistra to sell its generation [light]. And after accounting for the recently announced retirements in our generation fleet, we expect we will be more than 80% matched generation to load. We have an exceptionally strong retail business that is focused on the customer and a leader in innovation, and we will continue to leverage these capabilities as we grow.  I will now turn the call over to David Campbell.\nDavid Campbell : Thank you, Scott. As shown on Slide 12, in the third quarter, Vistra once again outperformed management expectations embedded in our guidance. Ongoing operations delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.185 billion, which was $108 million higher than the same period in 2019, with our Retail segment down $53 million, and our generation segments up a collective $161 million. As Curt described, the positive year-over-year variance in generation was driven by higher margins in our Texas segment. The negative variance in our Retail segment was a product with higher volumes from our Crius and Ambit acquisitions during negative margin months. You may recall from our discussions during third quarter performance last year, our plan projected negative adjusted EBITDA in our Retail segment during the third quarter. This phenomenon is a result of the seasonality of power cost in Texas where power prices are at their highest in August, driving up our third quarter cost of goods sold, whereas retail customer prices are generally at more consistent levels through the year. This negative third quarter margin is offset by higher gross margin in the first, second and fourth quarters. Year-to-date, Vistra's ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA is $2,964 million or $346 million higher than our comparable 2019 results. The favorability is driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit, our operations performance improvement initiatives and higher energy margin, primarily in our Texas segment. With 3 quarters of outperformance relative to management expectations for the year, Vistra is tracking solidly above its recently raised adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint for 2020. This quarter, we are also reporting our financial results in accordance with our new segments. Of note, the new Sunset segment includes plants that have announced future retirement dates, providing transparency into the contributions and potential liabilities from those facilities, and more importantly, separating their financial results from our longer-term assets and businesses. Once the Sunset assets retire, it will be moved into the Asset Closure segment. When evaluating the best path forward for these plants, Vistra explored a potential sale. However, the bid-ask spread on the closure cost was [too great], as buyers were generally too conservative due to relative lack of experience and the transactional requirements were too complex. In the end, we determined that Vistra is better equipped to handle the wind-down of these assets as we have significantly more experience in the process than most others. We can manage the retirement of the assets without taking a significant hit to value, while benefiting from the cash generated from the leased facilities prior to their retirement. Once the assets are retired, Vistra has had very good success in divesting some of these facilities in associated closure liabilities to third parties. In addition, retiring the assets, as opposed to selling them, has a greater impact on Vistra's greenhouse gas emission reductions, as selling the assets would similarly reduce our baseline. It is better for the company and for the environment for Vistra to take the action to retire the plants. Turning now to Slide 13. Vistra remains committed to reducing our leverage in 2020, as we approach our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA. As of September 30, we have paid down approximately $1,150 million of debt this year, including the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which totaled $550 million as of the end of the second quarter, as well as the redemption of all of the remaining senior unsecured notes issued by Vistra Corp. Last week, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved a fourth quarter dividend of $0.135 or $0.54 per share on an annual basis, which represents an 8% increase from the annual dividend we paid in 2019. With respect to credit ratings, shortly following our September virtual investor event, we received an upgrade to BB+ by S&P ratings, which also maintained its positive outlook. This upgrade positions Vistra to one notch below investment grade. And of note, all 3 credit rating agencies, Moody's, Fitch and S&P have Vistra on positive outlook. As a result, we expect that a potential upgrade to investment-grade is achievable before the end of 2021. In furtherance of our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet, our capital allocation plan for 2021 and '22 calls for incremental debt reduction of approximately $550 million over the 2-year period, while the bulk of our free cash flow of more than $2 billion is expected to be returned to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As it relates to the dividend, it is our intention to increase our dividend by approximately 8% in 2021, at the high end of our expected 6% to 8% annual growth rate. In 2022, we anticipate a step change increase in the annual dividend to $0.76 per share. Both of these increases will be subject to Board approval at the appropriate time. Our recently announced $1.5 billion share repurchase program begins on January 1st of next year and replaces any repurchase authority that remains outstanding under our existing programs as of the end of this year. The last component of our 2021 and 2022 capital allocation plan is to grow our business through investments that have attractive return profiles and support our continued retail growth or expansion into zero-carbon resources. We expect we will allocate approximately $1.15 billion of capital to transformational growth investments over the next 2 years, which includes capital for our previously announced Moss Landing and Oakland battery storage projects as well as our recently announced Texas Phase 1 renewable and storage development projects. These investments exceed our threshold of 500 basis points to 600 basis points above our cost of equity and are consistent with our strategic transformation plans. Vistra's track record of delivering on our financial commitments, combined with impressive conversion of adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow before growth, supports our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet on both investing in our business and returning a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. Our strong performance year-to-date in 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic, is further evidence of the resilience of our integrated business model. We remain optimistic that with the ongoing successful execution of our business plan, our stock price will ultimately reflect its fundamental value. I would now like to turn the call back over to Curt to make a few remarks on the election.\nCurt Morgan: Thanks, David. And Scott, thank you as well. So not much to say at this point. I think most of you have been following the election and things look pretty tight, too tight to call. Of course, it's going to be interesting to see whether we'll have divided government or whether we will have a single-party control. That, of course, would end up being the Democrats, because it looks like the house will go to the Democrats. The point that I'd like to make about the election is that -- and we've said this before, that we feel like we can be successful under any administration. We're an apolitical entity. We have friends on both sides of the aisle. We've worked very well with both Republicans and Democrats. And we, of course, studied, like most of you have, where the policies might go and feel like we can benefit under either administration. So we look forward to working with whoever the administration is and with whatever the Congressional makeup ends up being. And we feel like we can make progress under either administration, and however Congress gets set up. So it's a little too early to tell on this, as you guys know. This could drag out for a while as well, given what we're seeing. But we believe that Vistra is well-positioned under either control administration by Democrats or Republicans. So with that, operator, we'd like to open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim.\nShahriar Pourreza: Just, Curt, a couple of questions here. I know obviously, you did the small retail acquisition in Texas in the quarter. It looks like a pretty healthy multiple. Very high cash flow conversion on that. Can you just maybe shed any more details on the process there? Is this something that we should kind of expect intermittently? Or was it more of a sort of one-off? And are you seeing any additional opportunities?\nCurt Morgan : Good question, Shahriar. So, we are seeing these types of opportunities come up. What can happen is, and what we typically do through our M&A team, as we will reach out to entities like this, and in some cases we'll reach out and say, are you interested in exiting the business? And in other cases, they may be looking to exit. We happen to know a couple of the principals. And we actually do the supply -- we actually do their supply right now for Infinite. So, we have a relationship, an existing relationship. And I think when they decided that it was time for them to do something different, they of course looked at us as one of the top candidates for buying their business. So, this one, I think, came to us a little bit different. But we have an active process where we are reaching out to some entities. And then again, some will reach out to us.  And there are, I'd say, a few of these, it seems like all the time. And some of which we are able to sign a deal with and some that we are not. So, I would expect that this can continue. And they're just -- they're smallish in nature, but they add up over time.\nShahriar Pourreza : Then you noted that in the upper end -- you've been at the upper end of your '21 guidance, and that's fairly achievable. Can you just maybe refresh us on what the drivers are that may be giving you a little bit more incremental confidence? I mean, it looks directionally like you're pointing to the economy and supply demand. I guess, how has that improved since late September? So maybe just a little bit of drivers there.\nCurt Morgan : Yes. So, October has turned out to be a pretty decent month for us on the retail side of the business, although we're still closing out things. But there's a potential that we -- the weather was decent, and we still have to take a look at what the final tally looks like, but it could be in a favorable position. And we've also -- as you know, we were pretty well hedged on the wholesale side throughout the year at some reasonably good pricing. So, I think that we also go into things a little bit, as you might expect, because we don't know exactly what's going to happen with weather. And our retail business actually does well in these shoulder months, that we tend to go a little conservative even when we revise our guidance. And I think what's showing is that we're more on target with where we thought we would end up being. Plus I think we may see a little better October.  All of that is beginning to give us more confidence. This is just a situation where our confidence is growing around getting somewhere above the midpoint and heading towards the upper end of that range. And that's simply what it is. But I think October also may end up being a favorable month. Again, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves because we haven't closed out the books yet.\nShahriar Pourreza : Got it. And I was referring to -- I'm assuming you're referring to '21, correct?\nCurt Morgan : Well, I'm sorry, I thought you said -- okay, you're talking about '21, I apologize.\nShahriar Pourreza : Yes, exactly. No, it's okay.\nCurt Morgan : In '21, so that's a little bit different. I apologize for that. In '21, I mean, I alluded to this in my comments that there's -- our business position and assets do offer us option value. And the market, depending on whether you're short or long, or where your book is positioned, people look at our business position and they see value for them and we see value in our business. And we're able to either transact in the forward. Sometimes, the forwards recognize scarcity. And sometimes, they recognize the value that's embedded in our assets and you can use that to hedge. Sometimes, like right now, it's not fully reflected in the forward curves, but that value is still there and you can capture it on a bilateral basis. And so I think what we're seeing, though, is in the market, that the value in our portfolio is there. It's just a matter of how do you want to transact and capture it. And we're seeing that value and we're realizing some of it. And we feel like that gives us a lot of confidence that ultimately '21 will turn out to be a year where we can get to the midpoint or even better than that. So, it's just really what you see in the marketplace. And it's not always -- I try to tell this to people, the forward curves are not the end of the all, especially as you get out beyond a year where they are thinly traded and they're not very representative. Have we gone back and marked our book to the forward curves 5 years ago, we would be coming in with EBITDA over that 5-year period at less than $3 billion. But that's not how it ended up. And so you got to be very careful about just choosing the forward curves. I know it's an easy thing. And I know it feels right for people to do it. But that's why we invest a bunch of money to try to analyze and model and understand the fundamentals of our business. And I know people get worried about models and all that. But for us, we have to do that along with the forwards and understand -- to understand really the value of our business. And for '21, we think there's a lot of value that's not reflected in the forward curves and there are multiple ways to realize that value.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin from Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: I'll make this quick. So you all talked about, shall we call it growth initiative, a few weeks ago here. So at the time, I think you alluded to having a shortly upcoming Phase 2 update on Texas specifically. Where do you stand on expanding on your initial growth efforts, first? And then secondly, related, more structured, how should we think about your tax appetite going forward relative to the pace of renewable and/or storage investments, right? As I think about it, I would think that you would key the pace investments off of your ability to absorb those tax attributes directly? Or are we mistaken in making that assumption and thinking that perhaps the retail -- the direct retail sales would drive some of those growth ambitions? So a lot of in there, but I'll let you have at it.\nCurt Morgan : Yes. So I'll take a shot at that. And David or Jim -- Jim Burke is on here with us, if you guys want to add to it. But in terms of the Phase 2, I'm thinking that, that is probably more a '21 -- later '21 type event where we would talk about that. We still have to -- we still have a significant pipeline of things that we announced in Phase 1. We haven't decided exactly when we would come out with our Phase 2 details, but I would guess it's more of a '21 event. In terms of tax appetite, of course, tax appetite is going to be somewhat driven by the election and where tax rates go. But we -- what we do is we look at the present value of the tax benefit relative to what the cost is of bringing in tax equity. And what we have found so far, Julien, is that we still have a tax -- we still have an appetite. Depending on where prices go, so we look at it both using our point of view, our fundamental modeling, as well as market, and when we become taxable, does affect the NPV of those tax attributes. But in all cases, we have an appetite for tax attributes because we will ultimately become a taxpayer after we run through the NOLs. And of course, you know that we have this unique TRA payment that actually will kick in before federal taxes will. And so we also look at that because that helps us defer the TRA payment as well. And that also affects our appetite for the tax attributes of renewables. So it's going to be a little bit fluid just because we don't know exactly what tax rates are going to end up being. But under -- whether it's today's tax environment or something different, we still continue to have tax attribute -- or excuse me, appetite. And we believe we will continue to have that even into our Phase 2 build-out. Does anybody, David or Jim want to add anything to what I just said?\nDavid Campbell : Well I was going to say, we look at this from an overall return perspective, of course. So tax attributes are a factor in our overall analysis. And ERCOT Phase 1, we -- the products exceeded our return thresholds with utilizing the tax benefits on the schedule that we can utilize it. That's how we model them. And as Curt described, there are higher benefits use internally in a third-party marketplace. So as we look at ERCOT Phase 2 and beyond, we'll do that same assessment of what's the maximum opportunity to extract further tax benefits. And we'll fold that into our overall customer accounts and to make sure that the project exceed our returns. Jim, over to you. \nJames Burke: Thank you, David. Sorry about that. Curt, as you described it, most of our Phase 1 spend, it peaks in 2021 and starts to taper off in '22. So we would expect to announce the Phase 2 in 2021. So fill in some of 2022, and then the bulk would be in 2023. You can try to levelize around the $500 million or so in growth capital. So that's how I see it sort of feathering in at this point.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Quick follow-up here, Curt. Given the feedback after the Analyst Day, are you committed going forward to continue to see that level of CapEx even after Phase 2?\nCurt Morgan : Yes, we are. We are. I think, Julien, we see what everybody sees in terms of where the world is going. And I don't think that the ESG world is going to change in the next couple of years. And we want to be a part of that transition. And we also believe that we have the projects, the capabilities and understanding the markets to be able to invest and to generate very good returns. Of course, we always will look, at any given time, if something were to change, then we would obviously let you guys know that. And I'm not saying that we can't change. We're not stubborn about it. But we still see opportunity, and we haven't seen anything to change our view on the long-term fundamental view of markets that we have today and then our ability to create value from investment. We think a quarter of our free cash flow makes a lot of sense to reinvest in the business. But as we have said before, if we begin to see a market environment where we don't believe that we can generate the kind of returns that we think we can, then we will return that money to our shareholders. But at this point in time, we feel like we can continue to do that. And I think one of the things that really is underappreciated, in my mind, is that there is going to be a supply response to newbuild. There was a supply response when combined cycle plants came into the market, and there were a number of retirements in coal plants and higher heat rate gas and oil units. And that's going to continue to happen in these markets as you bring on new technologies. And I think that's largely being ignored. And we certainly are a company that has had to make the hard decisions, and I expect we will continue to do that. But I do believe that this country's generation landscape is going to change significantly. And there's absolutely no reason why Vistra cannot be a part of that. I also believe that you have to have a return on that investment in order to get people to do it. You can't just invest in renewables and say, okay, well, it's zero marginal cost. So now we're going to have free power forever. There has to be a mechanism, a pricing mechanism that incentivizes people to invest. And if we're going to spend trillions of dollars in this country to invest, there has to be a price clearing point that allows that to happen. You can't just invest and then go to zero marginal cost. Zero marginal cost doesn't work in the long run to support an industry. And so if you believe in economic theory, like I do, ultimately, pricing is going to settle at a point where people can get a return of and on investment. And that's why we're encouraged by it. And we'll watch that.  There are periods of time in all competitive markets where markets can get oversupplied. And then there's times when they get tight and they're undersupplied. I am certain that is going to happen. But there will also be a supply response when there is an oversupply, and that will bring markets back to equilibrium.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Search.\nSteve Fleishman : Just first, is there a price or EBITDA that you've disclosed for the new acquisition?\nCurt Morgan : We haven't, but we can, Steve. It's $13 million, in that range. And then I think we said that it was about 3.7 times when you look at the multiple. That includes synergies. Synergies come from back office and other functional units largely. We were already a supplier to these guys.\nSteve Fleishman: $13 million is the price paid or the EBITDA?\nCurt Morgan : No, well, I'm sorry. That's the price paid. EBITDA -- I don't know that we've disclosed that.\nSteve Fleishman : No, that's fine. I can figure that out. And just to be clear on -- when you're making the decision-making on growth and your cost of capital, I mean, if the stock stays in this range around where it is, are you using that as your cost of capital? Or are you using something higher than that, when you think about...?\nCurt Morgan : You're talking about the yield on the stock? Are you talking about...?\nSteve Fleishman : No, just the general cost of capital, the embedded -- yes, the free cash flow yield, whatever, in terms of making the decision to invest in the growth, are you assuming something better? And so then what happens if we're here 9 months from now and you're making the growth decision investment and the stock is still at $18?\nCurt Morgan : Yes. Look, that's why I get paid the big buck, that's the tough decision, right? I mean, I don't know where the stock is going to go. I do -- there's obviously the famous CAPM, which would tell you that our cost of capital is much lower than where the free cash flow yield is, right? But we don't invest in anything anywhere close to what a CAPM model would tell you where we should be. And I won't say, though, that every investment -- although there are some that we have done, that every investment has a 20%-plus return either. And I do believe that we believe -- you know this, since you've covered us, we've been at 15% free cash flow yield. It just so happens that we're up in the 20s right now. But we typically would be in excess of that 15%. But it is something that we have to look at. This is why I believe that we are trying to take a balanced approach and actually one that errs on the side of returning more capital and buying back our shares, more so than reinvesting in the business, and it's something that we're going to have to follow. But then you know this because you've asked me this question, a sustainable 20% plus free cash flow yield has far-reaching implications well beyond whether we invest in solar projects or not. It has a lot to do with, can this company get a reasonable free cash flow yield for the kind of company that it is in the public market setting? And the management team and the Board, over the next couple of years, is going to have to wrestle with that. But there is no easy way out either. It's not easy just to go private either. I know how money is made there, too. And that's no panacea. But at the end of the day, we are going to search, as much as we possibly can, to find a way to get the full and fair value of this company. And I think part of that is investing in the changing technology on the generation side. But we absolutely have to do that in a prudent fashion. And your point is a fair one, and one that we have to wrestle with. And I think we try to balance that. But we've been investing in what we believe are compensatory type returns given where we are.\nOperator: This brings us to the end of today's Q&A. I would now like to turn the call over to Curt Morgan for closing remarks.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you, everybody, again. I appreciate your interest in Vistra. Had a great quarter. We hope to close the year out strong. We're tracking in that direction. And thanks again for your time.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This will conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Curt Morgan",
            "content": "Thanks, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. We appreciate your time and interest in Vistra during this busy third quarter earnings season. It was just five weeks ago when we last connected with you at our virtual investor event, where we laid out our capital allocation plan for the next few years and provided additional details regarding our planned portfolio transformation. As we announced on the call, we expect to transform our generation fleet, including growing our renewable and energy storage presence, while retiring the majority of our existing coal plants, significantly decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions produced by our operations. We believe, we are our natural owner of renewable and energy storage assets given our capabilities and competitive position, and have a high degree of competence that we can generate healthy return from these assets through the same skills and methodology by which we extract significant value from our existing fleet.  We are not going to give away the value to others by entering into below market power purchase agreements, and we have the capabilities to manage the market risk.  We also own a portfolio of highly-efficient low-emitting natural gas assets that can provide reliable dispatchable power and complement the intermittent nature of renewable resources. The diversity of our portfolio enables our team to structure renewable products that can ensure reliability at an affordable price.  As we have recounted in the past, every reputable and objective study on the changing power generation landscape has natural gas playing a significant role for several years to come, especially as we electrify the economy. The most recent study by E3, a well-respected energy consulting firm, is another good example. And let's not forget, we already serve nearly 5 million retail customers, many of which are increasingly seeking to procure their electricity needs from renewable sources.  I know we did not spend as much time on our retail business during our virtual investor event in September, but it is one of the cornerstones of our business model, and we expect to prudently invest in it, as evidenced by the announcement of a highly attractive tuck-in retail business we announced today that Scott Hudson, the President of our Retail Business will discuss. Through growing retail and reducing our exposure to coal generation, we will continue to optimize our retail to wholesale match.  It is important to keep in perspective that it's going to take trillions of dollars of investment over several years for the U.S. electricity grids to meaningfully transition away from thermal resources. The current generating fleet in the U.S. was invested in over many decades. In this respects, we will play an important role in that transition, as well as provide critical reliability via our flexible gas assets.  As we have just recently spent considerable time on these topics, we plan to focus today on the very strong third quarter and year-to-date results of our integrated business. We will also provide a business update on our retail operations.  Before I turn to our third quarter results, I would be remised not to acknowledge that the country is experiencing another wave of COVID-19 cases as we enter the flu season, albeit with a lower mortality rate.  As we have said before, the health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. We have had only five cases we can trace to being contracted at work, successfully containing further spread. Vistra is dedicated to staying vigilant and focused as we continue to operate safely to keep the lights on in this unprecedented environment. We will also continue to focus on helping our communities and customers through this difficult period by making corporate donations, procuring computers for children in need, and offering payment plans and deferral programs for our customers. Just a few examples of our commitment to helping others in need. We hope all of you are also staying safe and healthy.  I'm going to start on Slide 6, where we set forth our strong third quarter and year-to-date results. In the third quarter Vistra delivered adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1,185 million which is 10% above third quarter of 2019 results despite operating through a pandemic in 2020. These higher results might appear counterintuitive, as it was in the third quarter of 2019, when the Texas market saw meaningful scarcity pricing intervals. We did not see similar scarcity pricing this summer as the hottest days fell on the weekends, and fleet performance across Texas was exceptional, exceeding what was already strong performance in the summer of 2019.  As we often reiterate, scarcity events typically have an overall limited impact on current period results, as we are usually largely hedged heading into any given summer. Rather, where scarcity pricing events can be the most beneficial for Vistra's financial results, relates to the impact they have on forward pricing. We saw this phenomenon play out in the summer of 2019, as it was in August 2019, when the summer 2020 forwards in Texas rose meaningfully. The ERCOT forward stayed at elevated levels through the end of the year, giving Vistra several months of opportunity to hedge our summer 2020 output at attractive prices that were on average higher than the average prices realized for 2019. We're also continuing to see the benefits of our Operations Performance improvement or OP Initiative materialize.  As a reminder, our OP program is on track to deliver an incremental $100 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020 as compared to 2019. With the benefits of our OP program combined with the Dynegy, Crius and Ambit synergies projected to reach an annual run rate of nearly $700 million by year end.  Our retail business had lower adjusted EBITDA period-over-period driven by the additional volume from Crius and Ambit acquisitions. You will recall that our retail business can generate negative EBITDA in the third quarter in periods of higher wholesale pricing due to the seasonality and power costs in Texas, which is why this incremental value drove EBITDA lower in the period. While approaches vary across companies, we do not levelize our cost of power throughout the year. Rather we flow through our actual costs while our retail pricing and revenues are relatively flat.  However, it is important to note that our retail business results exceeded management expectations for the quarter, which are embedded in our guidance as a result of stronger margins and lower sales costs contributing to our 2020 guidance raise for the segment during our September investor event. In addition, our three legacy retail brands once again organically grew residential customer counts in Texas during the course. Vistra delivered year-to-date adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $2,964 million, results that are tracking ahead of management expectations for the period and solidly above 2019 results by nearly 15%, further evidence of the resiliency of the integrated model.  It was a strong performance through the first part of the year that led Vistra to raise its 2020 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance midpoint by $150 million and $165 million respectively in September. Year-to-date, this Vistra is tracking solidly above this recently raised adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint. And as we've mentioned before, it will be the fifth year in a row that we have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance, not exactly the kind of performance associated with the stock or the free cash flow yield in the 20s.  Today, we are reaffirming our recently raised 2020 guidance ranges as set forth on Slide 6. Though, assuming we once again successfully execute in the fourth quarter, we are expecting another adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint be. Importantly, our financial guidance implies an adjusted EBITDA through adjusted free cash flow before growth conversion ratio of approximately 69% for the year, which supports our recently announced capital allocation plan and the anticipated significant return of capital to our financial stakeholders. We have been able to significantly exceed our original free cash flow before growth guidance midpoint and achieve this high conversion ratio even with the early receipt in 2019 of nearly $95 million of alternative minimum tax refunds that were projected in our 2020 guidance and while accelerating some planned outages in 2020, and opportunistically taking advantage of business opportunities that required a higher use of current year cash flows. Turning now to Slide 7. Today, we are also reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges for both ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth, which we initiated during our virtual investor event in September. We have continued to execute since that time, increasing our confidence in our 2021 guidance ranges, and further supporting our view that the upper end of the guidance ranges are achievable.  Importantly, Vistra's fundamental analysis continues to suggest that the current 2021 forward prices in ERCOT are meaningfully discounting the probability of summer scarcity events. When evaluating all the supply and demand variables at play, we are bullish as ever regarding our opportunity to capture value in 2021. In fact, last Monday, a random Monday in late October, the ERCOT market found itself in a period of scarcity, where prices surged to over $1,000 per megawatt hour around 7 p.m. and stayed well above $100 per megawatt hour for most of the day. These price outcomes were driven by several factors including load coming in 1,500 to 3,000 megawatts higher than predicted in the day-ahead market. Lower available thermal generation due to the post-summer outage season for most units significantly lowered renewables contribution than expected, including wind coming in approximately 13,000 megawatts lower than anticipated during the peak 7 p.m. hour partly driven by icing issues on the turbine blades and the limited contribution from solar throughout the day given the cloud cover. Importantly, the observed strong demand levels extending into the evening hours was also a key contributor to the strong pricing we saw on Monday. As we know and have observed in other markets, the presence of strong evening hour demand does not line up well with the solar contribution profile. This mismatch between demand and the solar generation profile is an emerging trend in Texas, and it will likely be an increasing source of volatility as the supply stack evolves, volatility that Vistra's commercial team and generating assets are positioned to capture, as we have demonstrated time and time again. This is just another reminder of how quickly prices in Texas can change when intermittent renewable resources are not available. While the value of the forward curve at any single point in time leading into the delivery year is important, what is most important to Vistra is that we are able to strategically capture value as market opportunities arise, just like we did last Monday in Texas. Our assets and business positions offer significant levers to capture value that can be represented and captured in the forward, or it can be locked into through bilateral transactions. We have been able to construct a realized wholesale price curve that has supported our consistent overperformance for the last 5 years. We are continuing to make progress in this regard and executing for 2021. Looking ahead to 2022, our current expectations for the earnings power of our business are consistent with our average 2020 to 2021 view in the range of $3.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA and a conversion rate to free cash flow before growth of 65% or more. We believe we can manage our year-to-year earnings volatility within a very tight range, and we continue to have confidence in the long-term earnings profile of our business. The market clearly does not share this view. As action on climate change accelerates in private institutions, and state and federal policymakers advance policies supporting the development of incremental renewable resources, investors are clearly questioning what this evolving landscape might mean for Vistra. In our view, it is this question that has directly been impacting Vistra's valuation. There is no justification for Vistra to trade at a 20% free cash flow yield based on the performance and financial position of the company. Free cash flow yield at these levels are generally reserved for companies in financial distress, with poor performance track records and weak balance sheets. None of this applies to Vistra. The only explanation that seems to make some sense is that the market must expect Vistra will experience future economic distress based on the changing power generation landscape. In our view, Vistra's near-term financial performance supports a free cash flow yield at least in the low double-digits, especially when taking into account where the company's debt trades and the prospect for investment-grade credit ratings in the next year. The debt-to-equity risk premium is confounding. Rather, if you believe in appropriate free cash flow yield for a business with a strong balance sheet and a proven track record on execution should be in the range of 10% to 12%, the recent prices where Vistra's stock has been trading would suggest that the market is assigning virtually zero equity value to Vistra's generation segments. In our view, this is a completely flawed assumption that is likely driven by the emotions of the current ESP environment as opposed to a practical and informed fundamental analysis. The bulk of Vistra's adjusted EBITDA from its generation segments is derived from its relatively young, low-cost, highly flexible gas field generation fleet, with 2 of the lowest cost nuclear and coal plants in the country in Comanche Peak and Oak Grove, both in Texas. We believe these assets will continue to be critical resources in the markets where we operate and will continue to generate substantial free cash flow, most of which will be returned to investors. There is absolutely no way that these assets have zero equity value, and in fact, they have significant positive value. In addition, the assumption of no value from our generation fleet extends to our investments in solar and batteries, yet standalone renewable companies are garnering lofty valuations in the markets today. An appropriate free cash flow yield applied to the true long-term free cash flow of Vistra would produce a stock price substantially above our current trading price and at least in line with most sell-side analysts' price targets. As long as this valuation disconnect persists, we will continue to buy back our shares. If you turn to the next slide, Slide 8, we have set forth how we think Vistra will be able to not only compete but to lead over the next couple of decades. Since 2016, when Vistra was first spun off from its parent as a publicly traded company, we have taken actions to build a business that prioritizes a strong balance sheet and low-cost and market-leading integrated operations with high-quality assets. We also took a company that was 70% coal and transformed it by retiring 16,000 megawatts of coal, adding natural gas renewables and battery generation and growing our retail business by over 3 million customers, all while significantly reducing costs, improving generation performance and expanding our EBITDA at highly attractive returns, which we highlighted at our investor event. We derive approximately 95% of our ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA from our 4 core operating segments, Retail, Texas, East and West, where we believe we have meaningful and attractive transformational growth opportunities into the future. Of that 95%, only 15% now comes from coal And we convert approximately 65% of our adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow before growth, which has enabled the return of more than $6 billion of capital to our financial stakeholders over the last 4 years. With our expectation that we will return an average of $1.5 billion to our financial stakeholders annually, we estimate that we will return another approximately $7.5 billion by 2025 and a cumulative approximately $15 billion by 2030, with total annual returns of 15% or more projected. As we approach our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA, we also believe we are on track to achieve investment-grade credit ratings next year. The steps we have taken over the last 4 years have created a strong foundation from which we can launch our future initiatives. True to our name, we have a vision for success and a tradition of excellence. And now we have introduced our Vistra Zero brand, which will build on this vision and tradition as our zero carbon growth engine for our generation transformation. As we look ahead to 2030, we expect we will continue on this path, evolving into a market-leading integrated business that plays a key role in powering America through its renewable transition by making prudent incremental investments in renewables and energy storage, growing our retail business and offering innovative green products and value-added services to our customers and supporting the reliability of the electric grid at affordable prices with our flexible natural gas fleet. In fact, by 2030, we project that more than half of our adjusted EBITDA will be derived from our carbon-free operations, with 90% of our adjusted EBITDA coming from our retail business and low to zero-carbon generating assets. We believe we can grow our EBITDA over the next decade, even while retiring the majority of our existing coal portfolio, by investing only a modest fraction of our free cash flow back into the business. We expect the majority of our free cash flow will be returned to our financial stakeholders, primarily through dividends and share repurchases. And if we allocate only $1 billion per year to share repurchases at the recent prices where our stock has been trading, we can buy back the entire market cap of our company in less than 9 years. This is all while maintaining balance sheet strength and expected investment-grade credit ratings, a pretty impressive value and growth story, if you ask me. As difficult as it is to project 20 years into the future, as the decarbonization of the economy continues, we expect our disciplined transformation to accelerate into 2040. By 2040, we estimate at least 70% to 80% of our adjusted EBITDA will come from our carbon-free operations, including retail, nuclear, renewable and energy storage. We continue to believe that gas plants will remain a key component of the supply stack up until 2040 and beyond, initially as a base load and reliability resource and, over time, as a transition resource complementing renewables. The playing field is changing. ESG, in particular, environmental stewardship, especially as it relates to climate change, is an increasingly important component for portfolio managers' investment decisions, and Vistra is committed to prudently be out in front in the transformation leading a sustainable company reaching its fair and full value. Before I turn the call over to Scott, I did want to highlight 3 new slides we included in the appendix to our investor presentation this quarter related to our broad focus on our stakeholders as part of our ESG efforts. We believe a company that prioritizes employees, customers, communities, suppliers and investors is one that will attract the best talent and retain customers and investors. Slides 15 through 17 in our appendix highlight some of our recent ESG initiatives in these areas. We will update these slides on a quarterly basis, and we hope you find them informative and helpful. I will now turn the call over to Scott Hudson to discuss our retail business in a bit more detail. Thanks, David. And Scott, thank you as well. So not much to say at this point. I think most of you have been following the election and things look pretty tight, too tight to call. Of course, it's going to be interesting to see whether we'll have divided government or whether we will have a single-party control. That, of course, would end up being the Democrats, because it looks like the house will go to the Democrats. The point that I'd like to make about the election is that -- and we've said this before, that we feel like we can be successful under any administration. We're an apolitical entity. We have friends on both sides of the aisle. We've worked very well with both Republicans and Democrats. And we, of course, studied, like most of you have, where the policies might go and feel like we can benefit under either administration. So we look forward to working with whoever the administration is and with whatever the Congressional makeup ends up being. And we feel like we can make progress under either administration, and however Congress gets set up. So it's a little too early to tell on this, as you guys know. This could drag out for a while as well, given what we're seeing. But we believe that Vistra is well-positioned under either control administration by Democrats or Republicans. So with that, operator, we'd like to open it up for Q&A. Good question, Shahriar. So, we are seeing these types of opportunities come up. What can happen is, and what we typically do through our M&A team, as we will reach out to entities like this, and in some cases we'll reach out and say, are you interested in exiting the business? And in other cases, they may be looking to exit. We happen to know a couple of the principals. And we actually do the supply -- we actually do their supply right now for Infinite. So, we have a relationship, an existing relationship. And I think when they decided that it was time for them to do something different, they of course looked at us as one of the top candidates for buying their business. So, this one, I think, came to us a little bit different. But we have an active process where we are reaching out to some entities. And then again, some will reach out to us.  And there are, I'd say, a few of these, it seems like all the time. And some of which we are able to sign a deal with and some that we are not. So, I would expect that this can continue. And they're just -- they're smallish in nature, but they add up over time. Yes. So, October has turned out to be a pretty decent month for us on the retail side of the business, although we're still closing out things. But there's a potential that we -- the weather was decent, and we still have to take a look at what the final tally looks like, but it could be in a favorable position. And we've also -- as you know, we were pretty well hedged on the wholesale side throughout the year at some reasonably good pricing. So, I think that we also go into things a little bit, as you might expect, because we don't know exactly what's going to happen with weather. And our retail business actually does well in these shoulder months, that we tend to go a little conservative even when we revise our guidance. And I think what's showing is that we're more on target with where we thought we would end up being. Plus I think we may see a little better October.  All of that is beginning to give us more confidence. This is just a situation where our confidence is growing around getting somewhere above the midpoint and heading towards the upper end of that range. And that's simply what it is. But I think October also may end up being a favorable month. Again, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves because we haven't closed out the books yet. Well, I'm sorry, I thought you said -- okay, you're talking about '21, I apologize. In '21, so that's a little bit different. I apologize for that. In '21, I mean, I alluded to this in my comments that there's -- our business position and assets do offer us option value. And the market, depending on whether you're short or long, or where your book is positioned, people look at our business position and they see value for them and we see value in our business. And we're able to either transact in the forward. Sometimes, the forwards recognize scarcity. And sometimes, they recognize the value that's embedded in our assets and you can use that to hedge. Sometimes, like right now, it's not fully reflected in the forward curves, but that value is still there and you can capture it on a bilateral basis. And so I think what we're seeing, though, is in the market, that the value in our portfolio is there. It's just a matter of how do you want to transact and capture it. And we're seeing that value and we're realizing some of it. And we feel like that gives us a lot of confidence that ultimately '21 will turn out to be a year where we can get to the midpoint or even better than that. So, it's just really what you see in the marketplace. And it's not always -- I try to tell this to people, the forward curves are not the end of the all, especially as you get out beyond a year where they are thinly traded and they're not very representative. Have we gone back and marked our book to the forward curves 5 years ago, we would be coming in with EBITDA over that 5-year period at less than $3 billion. But that's not how it ended up. And so you got to be very careful about just choosing the forward curves. I know it's an easy thing. And I know it feels right for people to do it. But that's why we invest a bunch of money to try to analyze and model and understand the fundamentals of our business. And I know people get worried about models and all that. But for us, we have to do that along with the forwards and understand -- to understand really the value of our business. And for '21, we think there's a lot of value that's not reflected in the forward curves and there are multiple ways to realize that value. Yes. So I'll take a shot at that. And David or Jim -- Jim Burke is on here with us, if you guys want to add to it. But in terms of the Phase 2, I'm thinking that, that is probably more a '21 -- later '21 type event where we would talk about that. We still have to -- we still have a significant pipeline of things that we announced in Phase 1. We haven't decided exactly when we would come out with our Phase 2 details, but I would guess it's more of a '21 event. In terms of tax appetite, of course, tax appetite is going to be somewhat driven by the election and where tax rates go. But we -- what we do is we look at the present value of the tax benefit relative to what the cost is of bringing in tax equity. And what we have found so far, Julien, is that we still have a tax -- we still have an appetite. Depending on where prices go, so we look at it both using our point of view, our fundamental modeling, as well as market, and when we become taxable, does affect the NPV of those tax attributes. But in all cases, we have an appetite for tax attributes because we will ultimately become a taxpayer after we run through the NOLs. And of course, you know that we have this unique TRA payment that actually will kick in before federal taxes will. And so we also look at that because that helps us defer the TRA payment as well. And that also affects our appetite for the tax attributes of renewables. So it's going to be a little bit fluid just because we don't know exactly what tax rates are going to end up being. But under -- whether it's today's tax environment or something different, we still continue to have tax attribute -- or excuse me, appetite. And we believe we will continue to have that even into our Phase 2 build-out. Does anybody, David or Jim want to add anything to what I just said? Yes, we are. We are. I think, Julien, we see what everybody sees in terms of where the world is going. And I don't think that the ESG world is going to change in the next couple of years. And we want to be a part of that transition. And we also believe that we have the projects, the capabilities and understanding the markets to be able to invest and to generate very good returns. Of course, we always will look, at any given time, if something were to change, then we would obviously let you guys know that. And I'm not saying that we can't change. We're not stubborn about it. But we still see opportunity, and we haven't seen anything to change our view on the long-term fundamental view of markets that we have today and then our ability to create value from investment. We think a quarter of our free cash flow makes a lot of sense to reinvest in the business. But as we have said before, if we begin to see a market environment where we don't believe that we can generate the kind of returns that we think we can, then we will return that money to our shareholders. But at this point in time, we feel like we can continue to do that. And I think one of the things that really is underappreciated, in my mind, is that there is going to be a supply response to newbuild. There was a supply response when combined cycle plants came into the market, and there were a number of retirements in coal plants and higher heat rate gas and oil units. And that's going to continue to happen in these markets as you bring on new technologies. And I think that's largely being ignored. And we certainly are a company that has had to make the hard decisions, and I expect we will continue to do that. But I do believe that this country's generation landscape is going to change significantly. And there's absolutely no reason why Vistra cannot be a part of that. I also believe that you have to have a return on that investment in order to get people to do it. You can't just invest in renewables and say, okay, well, it's zero marginal cost. So now we're going to have free power forever. There has to be a mechanism, a pricing mechanism that incentivizes people to invest. And if we're going to spend trillions of dollars in this country to invest, there has to be a price clearing point that allows that to happen. You can't just invest and then go to zero marginal cost. Zero marginal cost doesn't work in the long run to support an industry. And so if you believe in economic theory, like I do, ultimately, pricing is going to settle at a point where people can get a return of and on investment. And that's why we're encouraged by it. And we'll watch that.  There are periods of time in all competitive markets where markets can get oversupplied. And then there's times when they get tight and they're undersupplied. I am certain that is going to happen. But there will also be a supply response when there is an oversupply, and that will bring markets back to equilibrium. We haven't, but we can, Steve. It's $13 million, in that range. And then I think we said that it was about 3.7 times when you look at the multiple. That includes synergies. Synergies come from back office and other functional units largely. We were already a supplier to these guys. No, well, I'm sorry. That's the price paid. EBITDA -- I don't know that we've disclosed that. You're talking about the yield on the stock? Are you talking about...? Yes. Look, that's why I get paid the big buck, that's the tough decision, right? I mean, I don't know where the stock is going to go. I do -- there's obviously the famous CAPM, which would tell you that our cost of capital is much lower than where the free cash flow yield is, right? But we don't invest in anything anywhere close to what a CAPM model would tell you where we should be. And I won't say, though, that every investment -- although there are some that we have done, that every investment has a 20%-plus return either. And I do believe that we believe -- you know this, since you've covered us, we've been at 15% free cash flow yield. It just so happens that we're up in the 20s right now. But we typically would be in excess of that 15%. But it is something that we have to look at. This is why I believe that we are trying to take a balanced approach and actually one that errs on the side of returning more capital and buying back our shares, more so than reinvesting in the business, and it's something that we're going to have to follow. But then you know this because you've asked me this question, a sustainable 20% plus free cash flow yield has far-reaching implications well beyond whether we invest in solar projects or not. It has a lot to do with, can this company get a reasonable free cash flow yield for the kind of company that it is in the public market setting? And the management team and the Board, over the next couple of years, is going to have to wrestle with that. But there is no easy way out either. It's not easy just to go private either. I know how money is made there, too. And that's no panacea. But at the end of the day, we are going to search, as much as we possibly can, to find a way to get the full and fair value of this company. And I think part of that is investing in the changing technology on the generation side. But we absolutely have to do that in a prudent fashion. And your point is a fair one, and one that we have to wrestle with. And I think we try to balance that. But we've been investing in what we believe are compensatory type returns given where we are. Thank you, everybody, again. I appreciate your interest in Vistra. Had a great quarter. We hope to close the year out strong. We're tracking in that direction. And thanks again for your time."

            "name": "Scott Hudson",
            "content": "Thank you, Curt. Turning to Slide 10, we wanted to spend some time on today's earnings call highlighting the stability of our retail business, its resiliency through the COVID-19 pandemic and our opportunities for continued growth. As many of you who have been following Vistra for some time might recall, Vistra's retail business has been a stable contributor of EBITDA since the retail market in Texas opened fully to competition in 2008. Prior to the Dynegy transaction, which closed in April of 2018, Vistra's retail business grew solely through organic activity. And over the period from 2008 to 2017, we generated an average of approximately $800 million of EBITDA annually, even in the face of a number of volatile power price cycles, including the extremely hot summer of 2011 and the polar vortex of 2014. The Dynegy transaction that closed in 2018 expanded Vistra's reach from a Texas-only retailer to one with operations in 5 of the top 10 competitive markets in the U.S. Then last year, we added both Crius Energy and Ambit Energy to our portfolio of businesses, expanding the Vistra Retail footprint to 19 states in the District of Columbia, adding several new brands, high-margin residential natural gas to the portfolio and a powerful network marketing channel. Vistra's customer counts grew to nearly 5 million, and our total delivered load grew to approximately 95 terawatt hours. In 2018 and 2019, our retail EBITDA averaged approximately $825 million. And we are currently on track to exceed our recently raised 2020 guidance midpoint of $955 million, with our 2021 adjusted EBITDA projected at nearly $1 billion. This expected performance in 2020 is particularly impressive in light of the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic during the year. In May, we estimated that COVID-19 could potentially be a negative driver of our 2020 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $70 million due to anticipated higher bad debt expense and the anticipated impact of lower volumes on our financial results. We now expect the impact from COVID-19 to reflect only $10 million to $15 million of higher bad debt expense in 2020, as lower business volumes during the year have been largely offset by higher residential volumes due to increased usage from the work-from-home population. Our strong performance in 2020 in the face of the pandemic is a direct result of the numerous initiatives we implemented to help our customers through these unprecedented times. For example, we utilized our data and analytics capabilities to proactively contact customers whose usage patterns had changed due to working-from-home requirements in order to make sure that they were on the right electricity plan. These efforts resulted in higher retention rates and enhanced customer satisfaction. We also offered payment flexibility to customers unsure of their financial future. Our experience has shown that if you help a customer through hard times, he will be a customer for life. Importantly, TXU Energy, our flagship retail brand, continued to maintain its 5-star rating in the ERCOT market and was the top-performing major retail electric brand in each month of the third quarter. In addition, TXU Energy has been a leader in innovation year-in and year-out, as evidenced by products like Free Nights, Free Nights and Solar Days, Free Pass and many others, all of which have been copied by our competition. In short, our strong 2020 is proving out. Vistra Retail continues to provide stability and robust financial results for the integrated model. As we look to the future, we expect to continue to grow our portfolio, both organically and through opportunistic acquisitions. In addition to the organic growth on the residential customer side, Vistra has demonstrated its ability to organically grow its business markets portfolio each year in ERCOT, and we have line of sight to consistent business markets growth in targeted regions outside of Texas. We also plan to continue to strengthen our customer relationships through various value-added offerings. On that point, Vistra has been active in the cross-selling of non-commodity products and services for over 8 years. We have invested in our platform, and we have seen significant growth, with customer interest growing threefold since 2013. We currently offer services like home warranties and insurance, smart thermostat, HVAC services and a variety of solar, energy storage and green products. We offer most of these products through an asset-light partnership model, which allows Vistra to nimbly test which services resonate with our consumers without making large capital investments. Beyond the opportunity to earn incremental EBITDA through these bolt-on product offerings, we have found that the expanded relationship results in a stickier portfolio, ultimately extending the life of our customers. As a result, we are continuing to expand the universe of value-added products we offer. On the natural gas side, our portfolio is focused on the high-margin residential and small business segments, where approximately 1 in 4 of our Crius and Ambit customers carry a natural gas product into the fuel markets. We are exploring expanding this offering into new markets in the future. We are similarly continuing to be opportunistic when evaluating potential M&A transactions. On that note, I'm excited to announce today that we have just executed an agreement to acquire the Texas electric retail customers of Infinite Energy and Veteran Energy. The transaction will expand Vistra's retail footprint in the attractive Texas market, where we currently derive 95% of our retail profitability. The transaction, which was executed at an estimated acquisition multiple of approximately 3.7 times is expected to close later this month. This acquisition is just another example of Vistra's ability to take advantage of our scale and market position to grow our business through attractive tuck-in opportunities.  Vistra Retail has the lowest cost structure of any major retailer in the country, and our operations are incredibly cash-efficient, dropping over 90% of our EBITDA to free cash flow. Retail continues to be the most attractive channel for Vistra to sell its generation [light]. And after accounting for the recently announced retirements in our generation fleet, we expect we will be more than 80% matched generation to load. We have an exceptionally strong retail business that is focused on the customer and a leader in innovation, and we will continue to leverage these capabilities as we grow.  I will now turn the call over to David Campbell."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Molly Sorg. Thank you. Please go ahead, Molly.\nMolly Sorg: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast covering second quarter 2020 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related earnings release.  Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives on the call to address questions in the second part of today's webcast as necessary.  Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on slides two and three in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra especially during these uncertain times. Cases of COVID-19 have been rising throughout the country, including in many of the states where we operate. Cities are facing social unrest as citizens are fighting for equality and demanding change, while the political climate is polarizing and masked by uncertainty heading into this presidential election season. While it all seems overwhelming, I remain convinced that we will get through this and we will be better than ever. I have seen proof of the resiliency of the American people through the lens of our own team members and their dedication and commitment to keeping the lights on in the face of these macro challenges. And instead of the strife in our country dividing us, we have rallied together as a team and as a family, seeking a better understanding of one another and recognizing that the only way we advance as a company and as a country is to listen and take action to ensuring quality for all. We say at Vistra, we want to be a company that works for everyone. Our people are our number one asset, and they have continued to show up day after day to maintain the level of operational excellence our stakeholders expect from us and our customers deserve. The second quarter results we are announcing today are evidence of this dedication. On slide six, we show our strong second quarter and year-to-date results. In the second quarter, Vistra delivered adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $929 million, which is 30% above second quarter 2019 results. The quarter-over-quarter favorability was driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit in the second half of 2019 as well as strong execution by our retail, generation and commercial teams. Specifically, our retail team grew customer counts in the second quarter in all five of our ERCOT residential retail brands, all while earning all-time highs in our post-interaction customer surveys, reflecting our team's laser focus on maintaining superior customer service levels during this pandemic. Our generation team executed 86 spring maintenance outages in the first half of the year. Our overall performance came in on time and under budget despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, positioning our fleet to be available for the critical summer months. In addition, our teams continue to drive savings and revenue enhancements through the ongoing execution of our operations performance improvement initiative, which we expect will deliver an incremental $100 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020, reaching an annual run rate of nearly $700 million by year-end. And last, our commercial team once again optimized the value of our generation fleet through hedging and optimization transactions. Vistra's second quarter 2020 financial results benefited from both portfolio positioning executed in anticipation of COVID-19 as well as from higher hedged energy margin realized in ERCOT and PJM. Vistra delivered year-to-date adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1.779 billion, results that are tracking ahead of expectations for the period and solidly above 2019 results by more than 15%, further evidence of the resiliency of the integrated model. As a result of this strong performance through the first half of the year, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance ranges for both ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth, as set forth on slide six. And while it is early in the year to formally reset our guidance ranges with the important summer months ahead, we are currently tracking above the midpoint of our 2020 guidance ranges. As it relates to the potential impacts from COVID-19 that we outlined on our first quarter earnings call in May, year-to-date results would indicate that these initial estimates could prove to be overstated, particularly with respect to bad debt, though we will continue to monitor the situation, especially given the recent increase in COVID cases in Texas and now that the federal unemployment benefits have expired as of July 31. Despite the political wrangling in D.C., we continue to believe there will be a phase four stimulus package that will help bolster the economy, although perhaps the unemployment benefits will not be at the same level. After all, it is an election year and neither side wants to come up short when it comes to helping voters. On retail volumes, in the second quarter, residential usage were just approximately 5%, while business volumes were down anywhere from 5% to 15% during the quarter, with significant improvement in demand seen across all markets by the end of the quarter as states began to reopen.  Importantly, data suggests that ERCOT demand is now virtually flat to expected pre-COVID levels, even with the rising cases in the state, as we depict on slide seven. On this slide, we have updated the demand decline impacts we are seeing across each of our markets as of mid to late July as compared to those we observed in April of this year. ERCOT, the market where we derive approximately 70% of our adjusted EBITDA is the most resilient, with peak demand already back to expected pre-COVID levels. The balance of the markets where we operate are also showing meaningful recovery with demand within 1% to 5% of expected pre-COVID levels across the board. This strong recovery in demand, particularly in ERCOT, is a positive data point for our 2021 outlook, bringing us to slide eight.  Vistra's fundamental point of view continues to suggest that our 2021 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA could track in line with or potentially slightly lower than the 2020 guidance midpoint. Even though forward curves for the summer 2021 peak have recently followed the lows of approximately $80 per megawatt hour, we do not believe this is where the 2021 forward curve will ultimately settle as we have seen this pattern play out in each of the past three years. The supply/demand fundamentals remain tight in ERCOT, and we believe stronger pricing than current forwards is supported by our detailed fundamental analysis. In fact, it has always been our view that estimating Vistra's future EBITDA based on a single point in time on the forward curve marginalizes our opportunistic hedging capabilities and ignores the volatility in the ERCOT forwards and our proven ability to take advantage of this volatility to optimize the value of our fleet. Rather, we have consistently delivered financial results in line with our point of view, reflecting the stability of our integrated operations and strong commercial execution. To illustrate, the graph on the slide demonstrates how, historically, ERCOT forward curves have risen in the late summer or early fall of the immediately preceding year. It is typically during this time when retailers start to hedge their exposure for the upcoming summer and traders move from the prop summer to the forward summer, increasing liquidity. As such, the forward summer begins to reflect normal weather and supply/demand fundamentals, with less emphasis placed on the specifics and sentiments of the prop seller. With 2021 reserve margins likely to remain tight, the risk and scarcity pricing remains. We anticipate this risk to persist in the longer term as well, supported by the annual demand growth in Texas, coupled with the market's increasing reliance on intermittent renewable resources during peak hours. All it takes is one week of hot temperatures, in either low wind output or an unplanned outage for scarcity pricing to materialize. While market participants might be currently bearish summer 2021 because we have yet to see any meaningful scarcity events in 2020, recall that we were in the same place at this time last year. In 2019, we observed a couple of weeks of hot July temperatures in Texas, but wind was also strong and unit performance was exceptional. Scarcity pricing did not materialize and 2020 five times16 summer prices fell to the low 90s per megawatt hour by the end of July. But then in August, we observed 72 15-minute intervals of $1,000 per megawatt hour or higher pricing, including 12 intervals that reached the $9,000 per megawatt hour cap, primarily driven by high temperatures and low wind. It was then that the forward for 2020 started to move higher to reflect the underlying fundamentals with 2020 five times16 summer prices rising more than 50% to approximately $150 per megawatt hour by the end of October. Much of Texas summer shows its teeth in August and September, so the greatest opportunity for scarcity pricing remains in the forefront.  With demand back to expected pre-COVID levels, we expect 2021 forward curves to once again rise this fall in anticipation of another tight summer, and we will be there to take advantage of it. As we illustrate on slide nine, ERCOT price spikes in recent years have been caused by moderate to strong loads combined with either unplanned outages or low wind or solar output. In 2018 and 2019, ERCOT saw a total of 31 hours where prices were greater than $1,000 per megawatt hour, with 71% of the hours occurring in August, September or October. The average price for these high-priced hours was $2,921 per megawatt hour, which increased the around-the-clock price by $5.17 per megawatt hour. We continue to believe weather will be a critical variable driving the incidence of scarcity pricing intervals, both this and next summer. And with residential demand coming in more than 5% higher-than-expected pre-COVID levels, we could see meaningful new peak demand records as residential demand is both relatively inelastic and more sensitive to temperature swings due to the increase in air conditioning load. Moreover, we expect year-over-year demand growth in ERCOT to remain strong, necessitating the addition of incremental renewable resources just to keep pace with the higher anticipated load. It is important to remember that the new resources coming online in ERCOT to serve this load are renewable resources, which by definition, are intermittent in nature. The more the grid relies on these renewable resources to satisfy peak demand, the greater the risk of scarcity intervals occurring in the future.  In summary, all of the necessary ingredients to drive scarcity pricing intervals, both this summer and next are present: tight supply/demand fundamentals, year-over-year demand growth, a recurring theme of delayed or canceled new renewable development and an increasing reliance on intermittent renewable resources to satisfy peak demand. While the Texas weather patterns haven't yet yielded scarcity pricing intervals in the early part of 2020, historical data tells us that it is a question of when, and not if, these events will occur, especially now that we are seeing wind output return to more normal levels. In fact, in the last two days, we've seen wind output in the hundreds to low thousands already begin to occur. And if you couple that with high temperatures, you're going to see scarcity value. Just like in 2019, we expect our company will be ready to perform and capture value when the opportunities present themselves. We continue to believe our integrated model is well positioned to deliver relatively consistent financial results while generating a substantial amount of free cash flow on an annual basis. It is important to stress that we believe in balance and integration between retail and generation. We are not a short retailer and believe owning generation remains fundamental to risk management, especially as intermittent resources continue to comprise a greater percentage of the supply base. We also have the operational, technical and commercial capabilities to capture attractive stand-alone returns in generation with superior integrated returns.  We look forward to talking more about how we plan to allocate our significant capital at our virtual investor event in September. We have spent most of our time this morning talking about the financial strength of our organization. Of course, our investors are interested in our financial results, but as you all know, ESG is garnering greater and greater interest. We believe that is a good thing. So we would be remiss not to spend some time talking about the value we place on all of our stakeholders, including our employees, customers and communities, including the environment. In fact, one of our four core principles states, \"We care about our key stakeholders, including our people, customers, communities, suppliers and investors.\" We also are committed to maintain aboveboard honest and ethical relationships with elected officials and regulators. Another one of our core principles is we do business the right way. A just company is a sustainable company that we believe attracts and retains talent, customers and investors. In the second quarter, our company brought these core principles to the forefront as we continued our long tradition of corporate stewardship and initiated some new programs. One in particular that has meant more to me as a CEO than perhaps any other initiative which I have ever been a part, in June, in response in particular to the George Floyd death, we initiated sessions with our employees, where members of the leadership team came together in small groups with employees to listen to their thoughts and experiences on race in their lives and within the workplace. Something just went off in my mind that life's playing field in this country for people of color, especially African-Americans and Blacks, was still not level as much as I wanted to believe it was. I wanted to believe so badly that we had evolved. The stories our employees shared about the challenges they continue to face most outside of the office, but some within our own walls, simply because of the color of their skin, were sobering. We have now completed 21 listening sessions in just over a month period for a total of about additional 40-hour work week, and I have attended every single one of them.  The feedback we received during these sessions was invaluable, helping us to identify pockets of issues we must address to unlock the full potential of our employees in our company. As a result, we have new diversity and inclusion initiatives in flight that we are excited to roll out in the weeks and months ahead. Some of the social issues identified are, of course, bigger than Vistra. But we will start with what we can control. We intend to become more vocal on issues that are occurring outside of our company as well. In addition to the listening sessions, which were a new initiative for Vistra in the second quarter, we also continue to prioritize the safety of our employees and contractors through the COVID-19 pandemic, while ensuring a reliable electricity supply. We have maintained many initiatives we instituted in the first quarter, including our work-from-home policy for all employees with remote work capabilities, thorough cleaning of our facilities between shifts, temperature testing and then entry questionnaires at all of our locations and requiring facial coverings and distancing where possible.  We continue to test employees for antibodies in the virus if they show symptoms or suspect potential infection and support quarantine with pay. In the first half of the year, we shipped our employees and their families more than 5,000 facial coverings to help keep them safe in the public spaces and also sent nearly 30,000 masks to organizations in our local communities, including hospitals. We have similarly continued to support our customers, launching our 22nd annual Beat the Heat program by tripling the funding due to COVID. Beat the Heat is a critical program, including drive-thru distributions of new air conditioning units and fans, education on heat safety, tips for saving on energy costs and financial assistance for TXU Energy customers. In total, we assisted 4,400 customers impacted by COVID-19 pay their electric bills through $1.1 million in donations to TXU Energy Aid, which is in addition to the $2 million we donated to nonprofits and social service agencies for COVID-19 relief. Similarly, in June, with a focus toward social justice and equity, we made a commitment to donate $10 million over the next five years to support the advancement of business and education in diverse communities, including enhancing our minority, women, veteran and LGBTQ+ supplier programs. In the second quarter, we also enhanced our environmental stewardship initiatives by publishing our 2019 Sustainability Report that, for the first time, adopts the Global Reporting Initiative and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board frameworks.  A link to our sustainability report is available on slide 10. We recognize the importance of providing complete and transparent information to the many stakeholders who have interest in our ESG-related activities, and the publication of our 2019 Sustainability Report in June was the first step toward enhancing these disclosures. This fall, we intend to publish a climate report, adopting the task force on climate-related financial disclosures framework. So please keep an eye on the Sustainability section of our website for the latest news and events around our social, economic and environmental initiatives. On the development front, in the second quarter, we announced the expansion of both of our battery energy storage projects in California. Phase two of the Moss Landing project will add an additional 100 megawatts for a total of 400 megawatts, with commercial operations expected to begin prior to August 2021. In addition, we increased the capacity of our Oakland project by more than 80%. As a result, we now have nearly 450 megawatts of battery energy storage developments under contract in California, with another nearly 3,000 megawatts of solar and battery storage projects in our development pipeline, primarily in ERCOT. We believe these projects are only the start of Vistra's expansion into zero carbon-generating assets with our market-leading commercial team, development project management skills, technical prowess, operational and maintenance capabilities and attractive sites. We are a natural owner of these assets. We know how to manage the volatility and risk associated with renewables. And we serve nearly five million retail customers who are increasingly seeking to procure their electricity needs from renewable resources. We are also a large purchaser of renewables through long-term agreements with over 1,000 megawatts contracted. We plan to provide more details regarding our near-term renewable investment pipeline during our virtual investor event on September 29. Before I turn the call over to David, I did want to comment on a federal rule the Environmental Protection Agency finalized last week relating to coal combustion residuals. We have mentioned this pending rule in the past, as we believe it will have far-reaching implications for the power sector. At a very high level, the rule requires certain coal plants that dispose of coal ash and surface impoundments to either make necessary capital investments and operating changes to bring these coal ash disposal sites into compliance with the federal rule or to permanently retire by 2023 or 2028, depending on the size of the surface impoundment. Importantly, decisions on compliance must be made by the end of November this year. Now that the rules have been finalized and will be published in the Federal Register in the next couple of weeks, we are fine-tuning the steps we plan to take in each of our impacted sites. We expect to provide formal details of our plans on a site level basis at our virtual investor event in September. It is important to note that our valuation suggests that there are several coal plants, especially in PJM, that will be under pressure due to this rulemaking. As I close this morning, I want to reiterate that Vistra is committed to lead as we strive to achieve a safe, inclusive and environmentally conscious company and one that is a positive contributor to society. In doing so, we expect we will be able to create a sustainable company that can produce enduring value for all of our stakeholders in both the near and long term, reaching its fair and full value. I will now turn the call over to David Campbell.\nDavid Campbell: Thank you, Curt. As shown on slide 12, Vistra delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $929 million, which was $212 million higher than the same period in 2019. Our retail segment increased by $108 million period-over-period and our generation segments were up a collective $104 million. The positive year-over-year variance for our ongoing operations was driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit and favorability in our ERCOT and PJM segments, reflecting our operations performance improvement initiatives and commercial optimization contributing to higher energy margin. As a reminder, due to the retirement of four coal plants in our MISO segment in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the associated movement of the financial results of those plants into the Asset Closure segment, our 2019 results have been recast, increasing ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA by $9 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $10 million in the second quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, Vistra's ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA is $1.779 billion or $238 million higher than our comparable 2019 results. The favorability is driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit as well as higher energy margins in our ERCOT and PJM segments. In both the second quarter and the first half of the year, Vistra's financial results are coming in ahead of management expectations. As a result, Vistra is currently tracking toward the upper half of its guidance range. Turning now to slide 13. Vistra remains committed to reducing our leverage in 2020 as we approach our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA. As of July 31, we have paid down nearly $750 million of debt in 2020, including the redemption of the entire $500 million principal amount of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2023 as well as redemption of the entire $166 million principal amount of our 8.125% senior unsecured notes due 2026. Last week, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved our third quarter dividend of $0.135 or $0.54 per share on an annual basis, which represents an 8% increase from the annual dividend we paid in 2019. We plan to provide details regarding our long-term capital allocation plan at our virtual investor event on September 29. You can expect that our plan for 2021 and beyond will remain aligned with our core tenets of maintaining a strong balance sheet, being opportunistic and disciplined with respect to growth investments, investing in retail and renewable growth opportunities only when our internal return thresholds are met and, in aggregate, returning most of the cash available for allocation to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As part of our virtual investor event in September, we plan to provide details regarding a 2-year share repurchase program as well as a multiyear dividend announcement. A high-level agenda of planned topics for the event can be found on slide 14. We also expect to update our 2020 guidance, introduce preliminary 2021 guidance and describe our plans to further transform our generation portfolio between now and 2030. On the portfolio side, we plan to provide additional details regarding our expected reduction in coal exposure over the next decade as well as details about our current growth pipeline. It should be an exciting event, and we hope you'll be able to join us. In closing, Vistra's strong financial performance through the first half of 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic, continues to support what we believe is our attractive value proposition, which is our ability to deliver consistent financial results with a high conversion of EBITDA to cash flow as well as capture value through high-return investments and acquisitions. Our low-debt, low-cost integrated model can and does deliver. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nJames Kennedy: It's actually James for Shar. Congrats on a great quarter and looking forward to September. I just have two quick questions for you. Building off of some of your COVID data points, are you seeing or expecting any inorganic retail opportunities to arise in Texas or the East due to the virus? Any stress on smaller books?\nCurt Morgan: Well, yes, we I mean, we have seen pockets of books and companies that have seen some signs of stress. The summer hasn't shown up here yet in ERCOT, and so that has provided some relief for some of those companies. But we could see that and we're active, as you might guess. And most people are going to come to us before they transact with somebody else. So we're in the flow on that, and we are seeing some of it. And I would expect if we see what we think we're going to see in terms of scarcity value, particularly in ERCOT, we may see some more of those books come available. I will say that when we evaluate those, we're obviously looking for quality books, it can extend beyond a year. And some of these companies have the value of their company is atrophied because they may be door-to-door, more face-to-face-type contact. And what's happening with the virus, those types of channels have been a little more difficult. And so you've got to really dig under and just make sure you're getting something of value. And we're not going to do a deal just to do one. We want to make sure we get value. I don't know, Jim Burke's on the line. And Jim oversees over our retail business. Do you want to add anything to that?\nJim Burke: Curt, I think you covered it well. The only thing I would add is that, with some of the COVID impacts having a little bit more focus on the business impacts to demand, some of the lower-margin business-focused books are seeing a little bit more pressure than some of the residential books. But in general, the theme that Curt mentioned that the summer hasn't shown up yet in ERCOT, is probably the prevailing consideration, and we are constantly monitoring the market for these opportunities.\nJames Kennedy: Got you. And then this one might be more for David, but could you give us an update maybe on the conversations with the rating agencies? Are you still targeting investment grade maybe by the end of next year? Or has that kind of slipped to 2022?\nCurt Morgan: Yes, David. You there?\nDavid Campbell: Yes. So the conversations with the agencies continue to go well. The with S&P, they've indicated and right now they've got us some positive outlook for getting the BB+. And they've indicated that, that review will happen as early as the third quarter. That's possible they'll wait for the third quarter results. We expect that, that review will happen as early as the third quarter of this year. And they haven't put a fixed time line out for consideration to investment grade, but that often can take a year or so afterwards. Moody's is on a faster trajectory. They and their when they upgraded us to the equivalent of BB+, indicated that they would consider an upgrade as early as the middle part of 2021. So obviously, we don't control the time line. We expect it's going to be next year, middle or latter part of next year. But the key thing is that I think the agencies have both recognized and affirmed that the strength of our company through the pandemic and through the financial crisis is something related, crisis related to the pandemic is something that they're watching and evaluating and can help to reinforce the resiliency of our business and our business model. And we think this quarter's results and our expectation is that you're willing to reinforce that. So we think we're on a positive trajectory with both the agencies.\nJames Kennedy: Great, guys. That's it for me. Thanks for everything. Congrats on a great quarter and looking forward to September.\nDavid Campbell: Thanks.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. Team. Thank you very much for the time. So if I can ask a couple of questions. Let me just start first with a high-level question. As you think about this larger update in the next couple of months, how do you think about growth investments and where you want to be positioned on that front? And I'm thinking specifically on storage, but also just in terms of generation, you've seen your peers enter more into PPA structures to further align their generation business with retail. How do you see the growth side of the equation initially coming in? And I know this is, to a certain extent, pre-empting some of your updates coming ahead here, but just think more strategically here on growth as part of the capital allocation. Where are you going with that?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Julien, thanks for the question. And I tried to allude a little bit in the comments to this, and I will say, obviously, some for September, some of the details, but I think more at a 10,000-foot level strategically, and I made a very specific comment for a good reason. I think we may think a little bit differently than or maybe other competitors do. But we kind of balance between having investment in physical assets, in generation and in new technologies, renewables and batteries and PPAs. Like I said, we've got over 1,000 megawatts of PPAs as well as we've invested in batteries in California, we put up in two which is a battery. And I think you should expect us to do the same. I mean there are times where we have opportunities to sign up a PPA that is good value and we may back-to-back that with a retail deal. And then we also have times where we have because of a location we might have or because of our retail business and also because of our commercial capabilities and our ability to manage projects, those types of things, we have the capability to also invest in solar, predominantly solar and batteries. Of course, we've got a really good location in Moss Landing and then also Oakland in California. You can only imagine, given the size of our company in Texas, we've got a number of really good sites. And when it comes to renewables and batteries, it's kind of like real estate. It's location, location, location. And I think there's an opportunity for us to use our skills and capabilities as well as our locations and to invest in assets as well. And we like that balance. We like a balance of both new technology investments, and then we also like the balance of PPAs. I'm also a little concerned right now about the depth of the PPA market. And so also, you don't want to put your eggs all in one basket because you're going to try to cover a short position with PPAs and the PPAs are not there, then you got to go to something else and lean on the market. And so we like a balanced approach, and that also manifests itself in a balanced capital allocation plan. And that means we're going to put a little bit of money back into our company, and we're going to put a lot of the money back to the shareholder. And that's we're going to get into very into the very detailed specifics of that and our overall portfolio and how we expect to manage it in September. And so we just want to see this summer play out a little bit. And I think we're by the time we get to September, we'll be in a very good place to lay all that out. But we do see ourselves as a balanced and integrated player with a balanced mix of assets and PPAs and that we are going to deploy some capital into projects that we know we have an advantage and have superior returns. And we've also said, if we don't find those, if we don't have those, and we'll be able to get into the details in September, then we're plenty fine with returning capital to shareholders. In fact, we're excited about the fact that we're getting our debt down to the level now where we have to allocate less and less to debt paydown and we can now start to allocate more and more to returning capital to shareholders. Julien, you still there?\nOperator: And looks like we might have lost Julien. Julien, are you on mute?\nCurt Morgan: Maybe we can get him back on here in a minute.\nOperator: Okay. And we'll move on to the next question. And your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.\nMichael Weinstein: Is there any reason why you're tracking in the upper half of the guidance range? Is there any reason why the second half of the year might bring that back down to the midpoint of the range at this point? I mean is there are there any specific things you're looking at? Or is it just COVID-19 uncertainty that we should be worried about?\nCurt Morgan: Well, look, I think certainly, COVID-19, and we still continue to believe that we may do better on the bad debt expense side. But you just don't know. And like we said in our remarks, I'm a little worried about the additional unemployment and insurance payments coming off at the end of July. We think that's been helpful, people paying their bills. And we want to tread a little bit lightly, you guys know the cases in Texas have exploded. And this is really uncharted waters. So and then that's one of the things that I think could be a place where we might give something back. We haven't played out the whole summer out yet, and we still carry a little bit of length in the summer. And so we'd like to see how that plays out. But I think we were also trying to say in our remarks that we feel pretty good about where we are at this point in time. And so we didn't want to change the ranges. We typically don't do it this early. I think we'll probably talk about that in September. That's even earlier than we normally do. But I think we're going to be in a position to talk about 2020 in the range then in September. I think for us, and you know us well, I think you do, for us to even talk about the fact that we're tracking above the midpoint, I think, tells you that we're feeling good about 2020. But I do want to emphasize, there is still there are still some things out there that we want to keep an eye on for the remainder of the year, but we're feeling good about it. And I don't know, David, if there's anything you want to specifically mention, please jump in.\nDavid Campbell: Curt, I'd just emphasize where you closed, is that we feel good about how we're tracking, even our commentary. I think you can see, Michael, in the script, reflects our view that we're tracking well. So Q3 is always a big quarter for us, so that's why we typically don't update the range at this time of year, but we're feeling good about how we're tracking. The business has performed well. And it's an unusual year. So that, plus the normal dynamics of Q3 being our biggest quarter, are why we haven't changed the range, but still signaling the strength. Go ahead.\nCurt Morgan: Sorry about that, David. I will mention this, Michael, that I think people I think they now know this about us, but we kind of have a balanced year that we have. So the retail does pretty good and can do pretty well in the shoulder months where the supply cost, because we have a levelized retail price where the supply costs are lower. And then in the summer, we don't make as much money in retail, although we're doing pretty well, obviously, right now. And then in the winter months, in the fall and the winter, we get that lower supply cost again. And so it's important that volumes stay strong for us in the remainder of the year on the retail side. So October can be a big month for us. November and December can be big months on the retail side. And if you get if you had a situation where in Texas, you had an issue with demand because of COVID, that might be a little bit of a drag. We're not seeing that, though. We haven't seen it through up to now, and we've seen, obviously, a lot of cases. And so we're pretty optimistic that we're not going to see it. But also the relief program in ERCOT is coming off at the end of August. And so all those things are going to factor into what's going to happen with our retail business for the remainder of the year. We're optimistic, but we want to keep an eye on it, and we've provisioned for it, too. And when we're telling you where we think we're going to be, we also take into account that we do think that there could be higher bad debt expense than we normally have.\nMichael Weinstein: Right. And one place you mentioned about that renewable investments would only be done if it meets your return criteria. How does that look now? Are renewable investments presenting some attractive return possibilities for you? And I'm not just talking about just in Texas, but maybe in other states, where gas and electric prices might be a little higher.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. So there are opportunities out there for people like us that have the locations, the capabilities, have the integrated nature of the business. You can see what I'd call attractive returns. And we're going to get more into that. And we'll actually in September, when we go through this, we'll actually show you how that builds up. Because I know what people have in their mind, they have a PPA, sort of what the returns are for some of the developers that are putting these projects out there. And they're wondering, how are you making something that looks attractive? Somebody's getting that value. That value exists given where market prices are clearing in ERCOT. It's who's getting it. And so the developer wants to get paid the development fee, and they need to get financing to get the project to go. So they need a PPA with an investment-grade firm in order to do that. And then somebody, the investment-grade firm, is getting the value. How they choose to monetize that value is up to them. They can sell the PPA to us and we can back-to-back it with a retail deal. They can take it to the market. Many of these guys don't want to take it to the market because there's risk taking it to the market. And if you don't have the capability to do that, then you don't want that risk. And so you're going to offlay that risk. But the value is in the market. And as we move more and more, Michael, to merchant investment, because not everything in Texas or across this country can be built through a PPA structure, when we get to the point where somebody has to put down real dollars per merchant, then the kind of returns that we're looking for and that we see, they're justified. They need to be there in order to justify the risk. And then you have to have the capability. You have to deal with basis risk and market risk and weather risk and all of those things that go into it. We have that ability to do that. We've got a whole infrastructure that knows how to do that. Not everybody knows how to do that. And so but we are seeing the opportunity, and we're one of the in my view, one of the view players that really have the integrated nature and the capabilities to actually monetize and to extract those kind of returns.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners.\nJonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys. Just one quick question on the retail side. I saw the customer count versus March came down maybe about 1%. And your but your slide says you grew counts in ERCOT across all classes. So I'm presuming other regions saw customer accounts come in and maybe that was partly sort of intentional. But could you just give us some perspective on what's going on there?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. David, do you want so Jonathan, to be clear, do you want us to talk about what's going on like in the PJM area, ISO New England, just what's going on with customer counts there as well as ERCOT? I just want to make sure that I got the question right.\nJonathan Arnold: If you could touch both, and just to make correct that the counts did come down in PJM or elsewhere.\nCurt Morgan: All right.\nJim Burke: This is Jim. I'm happy to take it.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Go ahead, Jim. Yes. Go ahead, Jim.\nJim Burke: Yes. Jonathan, so we had talked on the last call that a couple of our partners, the brands that we acquired, Crius and Ambit, are more dependent on face-to-face selling and the Midwest, Northeast markets have had some of the biggest restrictions on face-to-face selling. So Crius and Ambit, for instance, did well in Texas. Texas reopened in mid-June to allow some face-to-face selling. Many of the other markets, particularly Illinois and Ohio, where we've got sizable presence, have not reopened yet. So the quarter one to quarter two drop is largely a function of the markets not enabling that kind of channel performance. We have moved to other channels. There's more online activity that you would expect. There's definitely more. We're doing through the phones, but not through face-to-face selling. So that's the main driver. And fortunately, the strong ERCOT performance of TXU as well as the other brands in ERCOT more than overcame that in the quarter. And that and we see sort of the full year playing out in a similar fashion.\nJonathan Arnold: Perfect. And then just kind of one question on last quarter, you had talked about your point of view, and you'd also had a specific comment on what you where you thought 2021 would track relative to 2020 based on the March forward curves. I mean they don't seem to have moved very much. So I'm curious if that prior comment still stands or if hedging and other things might have moved the needle there.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. So I think we're pretty much where we were. We see we were trying to convey a message that we're kind of flattish to midpoint guidance from 2020, which was, I think it's like three four, three five, we're kind of flattish to lower. We also, I think, if you remember, Jonathan, we said that we had stressed down further than that, and we were within 10% of EBITDA. But that was to give you guys a sense, because we were getting feedback from people that especially we were really in the throes of COVID and it was really new at the time, they wanted to see what a stress case would look like. But I think where we are right now is we're sort of flattish to slightly lower. And that was similar to where we had come out last time. We haven't seen anything yet that would change that view, and we'll probably know more because we'll be through most of the summer and into September. We'll also be able to see where the 2021 curves go as we roll out of the summer and into that fall period that we showed on that graphic where you start to see people turning their attention to the next summer. And that's where you get liquidity, and that's where pricing starts to firm up. Some of that pricing is supported by what happens in the summer, people the prompt summer. People like to look and see, well, was there scarcity or when conditions for scarcity showed up, didn't show up. That kind of thing does affect the market. And so we'll see where the rest of the summer goes. But if we get some high temperatures and low wind, people will be looking to see how the market reacts to that. All that sort of factors into affecting the forward curves. And for us, I think you know this, we would prefer to hedge up most of our long exposure in ERCOT, in particular, as we go into the next year, and then fill in the gaps throughout the initial part of the year and going into the summer. I don't know whether we'll get that opportunity, but we think we will, and that's what we're going to be looking for. And that's when you'll see more of the summer exposure that we have, hedging will occur sort of between now and the balance of the year. And then you'll see us sort of shape it a little bit as we go into next year. But we feel pretty confident we're going to get the opportunity for 2021 summer, which is really our biggest exposure for length. We'll get plenty of opportunities to be able to hedge going into that. And we still feel really good, when we look at our detailed supply/demand fundamental and modeling, we still feel good that we have a pretty tight market. And it's a market that's relying more and more on intermittent resources. In fact, you no longer have a situation in ERCOT where you can supply all the peak load with dispatchable resources like coal and gas and nuclear. So you have to rely on a certain level of renewable resources in order to be a reliable market and to actually meet the demand in the market. And with the volatility and intermittent nature of those resources, the inherent nature of that, you're going to get a few days in a market like ERCOT where you have extremely high temperatures in July and August and September time frame. There are going to be some days where it's going to be tight, and that's where the scarcity comes into play. And with the ORDC standard deviation moving up this year, we ought to see some pretty good pricing. It will be a function of weather, of course, and wind and unit performance. But we're pretty we go into this we're pretty confident that we'll see opportunities.\nJonathan Arnold: Great. And just one final thing. Your most obvious listed peer reorganized their segments this year to be to show more kind of an integrated look of the businesses. Is that something you would potentially consider? Or do you expect you'll continue reporting the way you are?\nCurt Morgan: That's a good question. I don't think we're going to do what they did. But I think in September, you'll see that we have a slightly different way that we are going to take a look at our business, that we hope will actually increase transparency and provide more information to you guys. And that will be the goal of what we do. And we'll give you a better sense of the business from a longevity standpoint and our strategic focus. So we do have an idea that we've been working on for some time now, and we would like to roll that out commensurate with the remainder of our longer-term capital allocation plan.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand the call back over to Curt Morgan for closing remarks.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. And as I stated at the beginning of the call, we do appreciate your interest in Vistra, and we look forward to continuing the conversation. I hope everybody stays healthy and safe through these trying times. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Curt. As shown on slide 12, Vistra delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $929 million, which was $212 million higher than the same period in 2019. Our retail segment increased by $108 million period-over-period and our generation segments were up a collective $104 million. The positive year-over-year variance for our ongoing operations was driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit and favorability in our ERCOT and PJM segments, reflecting our operations performance improvement initiatives and commercial optimization contributing to higher energy margin. As a reminder, due to the retirement of four coal plants in our MISO segment in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the associated movement of the financial results of those plants into the Asset Closure segment, our 2019 results have been recast, increasing ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA by $9 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $10 million in the second quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, Vistra's ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA is $1.779 billion or $238 million higher than our comparable 2019 results. The favorability is driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit as well as higher energy margins in our ERCOT and PJM segments. In both the second quarter and the first half of the year, Vistra's financial results are coming in ahead of management expectations. As a result, Vistra is currently tracking toward the upper half of its guidance range. Turning now to slide 13. Vistra remains committed to reducing our leverage in 2020 as we approach our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA. As of July 31, we have paid down nearly $750 million of debt in 2020, including the redemption of the entire $500 million principal amount of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2023 as well as redemption of the entire $166 million principal amount of our 8.125% senior unsecured notes due 2026. Last week, we also announced that our Board of Directors approved our third quarter dividend of $0.135 or $0.54 per share on an annual basis, which represents an 8% increase from the annual dividend we paid in 2019. We plan to provide details regarding our long-term capital allocation plan at our virtual investor event on September 29. You can expect that our plan for 2021 and beyond will remain aligned with our core tenets of maintaining a strong balance sheet, being opportunistic and disciplined with respect to growth investments, investing in retail and renewable growth opportunities only when our internal return thresholds are met and, in aggregate, returning most of the cash available for allocation to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As part of our virtual investor event in September, we plan to provide details regarding a 2-year share repurchase program as well as a multiyear dividend announcement. A high-level agenda of planned topics for the event can be found on slide 14. We also expect to update our 2020 guidance, introduce preliminary 2021 guidance and describe our plans to further transform our generation portfolio between now and 2030. On the portfolio side, we plan to provide additional details regarding our expected reduction in coal exposure over the next decade as well as details about our current growth pipeline. It should be an exciting event, and we hope you'll be able to join us. In closing, Vistra's strong financial performance through the first half of 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic, continues to support what we believe is our attractive value proposition, which is our ability to deliver consistent financial results with a high conversion of EBITDA to cash flow as well as capture value through high-return investments and acquisitions. Our low-debt, low-cost integrated model can and does deliver. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions. Yes. So the conversations with the agencies continue to go well. The with S&P, they've indicated and right now they've got us some positive outlook for getting the BB+. And they've indicated that, that review will happen as early as the third quarter. That's possible they'll wait for the third quarter results. We expect that, that review will happen as early as the third quarter of this year. And they haven't put a fixed time line out for consideration to investment grade, but that often can take a year or so afterwards. Moody's is on a faster trajectory. They and their when they upgraded us to the equivalent of BB+, indicated that they would consider an upgrade as early as the middle part of 2021. So obviously, we don't control the time line. We expect it's going to be next year, middle or latter part of next year. But the key thing is that I think the agencies have both recognized and affirmed that the strength of our company through the pandemic and through the financial crisis is something related, crisis related to the pandemic is something that they're watching and evaluating and can help to reinforce the resiliency of our business and our business model. And we think this quarter's results and our expectation is that you're willing to reinforce that. So we think we're on a positive trajectory with both the agencies. Thanks. Curt, I'd just emphasize where you closed, is that we feel good about how we're tracking, even our commentary. I think you can see, Michael, in the script, reflects our view that we're tracking well. So Q3 is always a big quarter for us, so that's why we typically don't update the range at this time of year, but we're feeling good about how we're tracking. The business has performed well. And it's an unusual year. So that, plus the normal dynamics of Q3 being our biggest quarter, are why we haven't changed the range, but still signaling the strength. Go ahead."

            "name": "Curt Morgan",
            "content": "Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra especially during these uncertain times. Cases of COVID-19 have been rising throughout the country, including in many of the states where we operate. Cities are facing social unrest as citizens are fighting for equality and demanding change, while the political climate is polarizing and masked by uncertainty heading into this presidential election season. While it all seems overwhelming, I remain convinced that we will get through this and we will be better than ever. I have seen proof of the resiliency of the American people through the lens of our own team members and their dedication and commitment to keeping the lights on in the face of these macro challenges. And instead of the strife in our country dividing us, we have rallied together as a team and as a family, seeking a better understanding of one another and recognizing that the only way we advance as a company and as a country is to listen and take action to ensuring quality for all. We say at Vistra, we want to be a company that works for everyone. Our people are our number one asset, and they have continued to show up day after day to maintain the level of operational excellence our stakeholders expect from us and our customers deserve. The second quarter results we are announcing today are evidence of this dedication. On slide six, we show our strong second quarter and year-to-date results. In the second quarter, Vistra delivered adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $929 million, which is 30% above second quarter 2019 results. The quarter-over-quarter favorability was driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit in the second half of 2019 as well as strong execution by our retail, generation and commercial teams. Specifically, our retail team grew customer counts in the second quarter in all five of our ERCOT residential retail brands, all while earning all-time highs in our post-interaction customer surveys, reflecting our team's laser focus on maintaining superior customer service levels during this pandemic. Our generation team executed 86 spring maintenance outages in the first half of the year. Our overall performance came in on time and under budget despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, positioning our fleet to be available for the critical summer months. In addition, our teams continue to drive savings and revenue enhancements through the ongoing execution of our operations performance improvement initiative, which we expect will deliver an incremental $100 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020, reaching an annual run rate of nearly $700 million by year-end. And last, our commercial team once again optimized the value of our generation fleet through hedging and optimization transactions. Vistra's second quarter 2020 financial results benefited from both portfolio positioning executed in anticipation of COVID-19 as well as from higher hedged energy margin realized in ERCOT and PJM. Vistra delivered year-to-date adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1.779 billion, results that are tracking ahead of expectations for the period and solidly above 2019 results by more than 15%, further evidence of the resiliency of the integrated model. As a result of this strong performance through the first half of the year, we are reaffirming our 2020 guidance ranges for both ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth, as set forth on slide six. And while it is early in the year to formally reset our guidance ranges with the important summer months ahead, we are currently tracking above the midpoint of our 2020 guidance ranges. As it relates to the potential impacts from COVID-19 that we outlined on our first quarter earnings call in May, year-to-date results would indicate that these initial estimates could prove to be overstated, particularly with respect to bad debt, though we will continue to monitor the situation, especially given the recent increase in COVID cases in Texas and now that the federal unemployment benefits have expired as of July 31. Despite the political wrangling in D.C., we continue to believe there will be a phase four stimulus package that will help bolster the economy, although perhaps the unemployment benefits will not be at the same level. After all, it is an election year and neither side wants to come up short when it comes to helping voters. On retail volumes, in the second quarter, residential usage were just approximately 5%, while business volumes were down anywhere from 5% to 15% during the quarter, with significant improvement in demand seen across all markets by the end of the quarter as states began to reopen.  Importantly, data suggests that ERCOT demand is now virtually flat to expected pre-COVID levels, even with the rising cases in the state, as we depict on slide seven. On this slide, we have updated the demand decline impacts we are seeing across each of our markets as of mid to late July as compared to those we observed in April of this year. ERCOT, the market where we derive approximately 70% of our adjusted EBITDA is the most resilient, with peak demand already back to expected pre-COVID levels. The balance of the markets where we operate are also showing meaningful recovery with demand within 1% to 5% of expected pre-COVID levels across the board. This strong recovery in demand, particularly in ERCOT, is a positive data point for our 2021 outlook, bringing us to slide eight.  Vistra's fundamental point of view continues to suggest that our 2021 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA could track in line with or potentially slightly lower than the 2020 guidance midpoint. Even though forward curves for the summer 2021 peak have recently followed the lows of approximately $80 per megawatt hour, we do not believe this is where the 2021 forward curve will ultimately settle as we have seen this pattern play out in each of the past three years. The supply/demand fundamentals remain tight in ERCOT, and we believe stronger pricing than current forwards is supported by our detailed fundamental analysis. In fact, it has always been our view that estimating Vistra's future EBITDA based on a single point in time on the forward curve marginalizes our opportunistic hedging capabilities and ignores the volatility in the ERCOT forwards and our proven ability to take advantage of this volatility to optimize the value of our fleet. Rather, we have consistently delivered financial results in line with our point of view, reflecting the stability of our integrated operations and strong commercial execution. To illustrate, the graph on the slide demonstrates how, historically, ERCOT forward curves have risen in the late summer or early fall of the immediately preceding year. It is typically during this time when retailers start to hedge their exposure for the upcoming summer and traders move from the prop summer to the forward summer, increasing liquidity. As such, the forward summer begins to reflect normal weather and supply/demand fundamentals, with less emphasis placed on the specifics and sentiments of the prop seller. With 2021 reserve margins likely to remain tight, the risk and scarcity pricing remains. We anticipate this risk to persist in the longer term as well, supported by the annual demand growth in Texas, coupled with the market's increasing reliance on intermittent renewable resources during peak hours. All it takes is one week of hot temperatures, in either low wind output or an unplanned outage for scarcity pricing to materialize. While market participants might be currently bearish summer 2021 because we have yet to see any meaningful scarcity events in 2020, recall that we were in the same place at this time last year. In 2019, we observed a couple of weeks of hot July temperatures in Texas, but wind was also strong and unit performance was exceptional. Scarcity pricing did not materialize and 2020 five times16 summer prices fell to the low 90s per megawatt hour by the end of July. But then in August, we observed 72 15-minute intervals of $1,000 per megawatt hour or higher pricing, including 12 intervals that reached the $9,000 per megawatt hour cap, primarily driven by high temperatures and low wind. It was then that the forward for 2020 started to move higher to reflect the underlying fundamentals with 2020 five times16 summer prices rising more than 50% to approximately $150 per megawatt hour by the end of October. Much of Texas summer shows its teeth in August and September, so the greatest opportunity for scarcity pricing remains in the forefront.  With demand back to expected pre-COVID levels, we expect 2021 forward curves to once again rise this fall in anticipation of another tight summer, and we will be there to take advantage of it. As we illustrate on slide nine, ERCOT price spikes in recent years have been caused by moderate to strong loads combined with either unplanned outages or low wind or solar output. In 2018 and 2019, ERCOT saw a total of 31 hours where prices were greater than $1,000 per megawatt hour, with 71% of the hours occurring in August, September or October. The average price for these high-priced hours was $2,921 per megawatt hour, which increased the around-the-clock price by $5.17 per megawatt hour. We continue to believe weather will be a critical variable driving the incidence of scarcity pricing intervals, both this and next summer. And with residential demand coming in more than 5% higher-than-expected pre-COVID levels, we could see meaningful new peak demand records as residential demand is both relatively inelastic and more sensitive to temperature swings due to the increase in air conditioning load. Moreover, we expect year-over-year demand growth in ERCOT to remain strong, necessitating the addition of incremental renewable resources just to keep pace with the higher anticipated load. It is important to remember that the new resources coming online in ERCOT to serve this load are renewable resources, which by definition, are intermittent in nature. The more the grid relies on these renewable resources to satisfy peak demand, the greater the risk of scarcity intervals occurring in the future.  In summary, all of the necessary ingredients to drive scarcity pricing intervals, both this summer and next are present: tight supply/demand fundamentals, year-over-year demand growth, a recurring theme of delayed or canceled new renewable development and an increasing reliance on intermittent renewable resources to satisfy peak demand. While the Texas weather patterns haven't yet yielded scarcity pricing intervals in the early part of 2020, historical data tells us that it is a question of when, and not if, these events will occur, especially now that we are seeing wind output return to more normal levels. In fact, in the last two days, we've seen wind output in the hundreds to low thousands already begin to occur. And if you couple that with high temperatures, you're going to see scarcity value. Just like in 2019, we expect our company will be ready to perform and capture value when the opportunities present themselves. We continue to believe our integrated model is well positioned to deliver relatively consistent financial results while generating a substantial amount of free cash flow on an annual basis. It is important to stress that we believe in balance and integration between retail and generation. We are not a short retailer and believe owning generation remains fundamental to risk management, especially as intermittent resources continue to comprise a greater percentage of the supply base. We also have the operational, technical and commercial capabilities to capture attractive stand-alone returns in generation with superior integrated returns.  We look forward to talking more about how we plan to allocate our significant capital at our virtual investor event in September. We have spent most of our time this morning talking about the financial strength of our organization. Of course, our investors are interested in our financial results, but as you all know, ESG is garnering greater and greater interest. We believe that is a good thing. So we would be remiss not to spend some time talking about the value we place on all of our stakeholders, including our employees, customers and communities, including the environment. In fact, one of our four core principles states, \"We care about our key stakeholders, including our people, customers, communities, suppliers and investors.\" We also are committed to maintain aboveboard honest and ethical relationships with elected officials and regulators. Another one of our core principles is we do business the right way. A just company is a sustainable company that we believe attracts and retains talent, customers and investors. In the second quarter, our company brought these core principles to the forefront as we continued our long tradition of corporate stewardship and initiated some new programs. One in particular that has meant more to me as a CEO than perhaps any other initiative which I have ever been a part, in June, in response in particular to the George Floyd death, we initiated sessions with our employees, where members of the leadership team came together in small groups with employees to listen to their thoughts and experiences on race in their lives and within the workplace. Something just went off in my mind that life's playing field in this country for people of color, especially African-Americans and Blacks, was still not level as much as I wanted to believe it was. I wanted to believe so badly that we had evolved. The stories our employees shared about the challenges they continue to face most outside of the office, but some within our own walls, simply because of the color of their skin, were sobering. We have now completed 21 listening sessions in just over a month period for a total of about additional 40-hour work week, and I have attended every single one of them.  The feedback we received during these sessions was invaluable, helping us to identify pockets of issues we must address to unlock the full potential of our employees in our company. As a result, we have new diversity and inclusion initiatives in flight that we are excited to roll out in the weeks and months ahead. Some of the social issues identified are, of course, bigger than Vistra. But we will start with what we can control. We intend to become more vocal on issues that are occurring outside of our company as well. In addition to the listening sessions, which were a new initiative for Vistra in the second quarter, we also continue to prioritize the safety of our employees and contractors through the COVID-19 pandemic, while ensuring a reliable electricity supply. We have maintained many initiatives we instituted in the first quarter, including our work-from-home policy for all employees with remote work capabilities, thorough cleaning of our facilities between shifts, temperature testing and then entry questionnaires at all of our locations and requiring facial coverings and distancing where possible.  We continue to test employees for antibodies in the virus if they show symptoms or suspect potential infection and support quarantine with pay. In the first half of the year, we shipped our employees and their families more than 5,000 facial coverings to help keep them safe in the public spaces and also sent nearly 30,000 masks to organizations in our local communities, including hospitals. We have similarly continued to support our customers, launching our 22nd annual Beat the Heat program by tripling the funding due to COVID. Beat the Heat is a critical program, including drive-thru distributions of new air conditioning units and fans, education on heat safety, tips for saving on energy costs and financial assistance for TXU Energy customers. In total, we assisted 4,400 customers impacted by COVID-19 pay their electric bills through $1.1 million in donations to TXU Energy Aid, which is in addition to the $2 million we donated to nonprofits and social service agencies for COVID-19 relief. Similarly, in June, with a focus toward social justice and equity, we made a commitment to donate $10 million over the next five years to support the advancement of business and education in diverse communities, including enhancing our minority, women, veteran and LGBTQ+ supplier programs. In the second quarter, we also enhanced our environmental stewardship initiatives by publishing our 2019 Sustainability Report that, for the first time, adopts the Global Reporting Initiative and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board frameworks.  A link to our sustainability report is available on slide 10. We recognize the importance of providing complete and transparent information to the many stakeholders who have interest in our ESG-related activities, and the publication of our 2019 Sustainability Report in June was the first step toward enhancing these disclosures. This fall, we intend to publish a climate report, adopting the task force on climate-related financial disclosures framework. So please keep an eye on the Sustainability section of our website for the latest news and events around our social, economic and environmental initiatives. On the development front, in the second quarter, we announced the expansion of both of our battery energy storage projects in California. Phase two of the Moss Landing project will add an additional 100 megawatts for a total of 400 megawatts, with commercial operations expected to begin prior to August 2021. In addition, we increased the capacity of our Oakland project by more than 80%. As a result, we now have nearly 450 megawatts of battery energy storage developments under contract in California, with another nearly 3,000 megawatts of solar and battery storage projects in our development pipeline, primarily in ERCOT. We believe these projects are only the start of Vistra's expansion into zero carbon-generating assets with our market-leading commercial team, development project management skills, technical prowess, operational and maintenance capabilities and attractive sites. We are a natural owner of these assets. We know how to manage the volatility and risk associated with renewables. And we serve nearly five million retail customers who are increasingly seeking to procure their electricity needs from renewable resources. We are also a large purchaser of renewables through long-term agreements with over 1,000 megawatts contracted. We plan to provide more details regarding our near-term renewable investment pipeline during our virtual investor event on September 29. Before I turn the call over to David, I did want to comment on a federal rule the Environmental Protection Agency finalized last week relating to coal combustion residuals. We have mentioned this pending rule in the past, as we believe it will have far-reaching implications for the power sector. At a very high level, the rule requires certain coal plants that dispose of coal ash and surface impoundments to either make necessary capital investments and operating changes to bring these coal ash disposal sites into compliance with the federal rule or to permanently retire by 2023 or 2028, depending on the size of the surface impoundment. Importantly, decisions on compliance must be made by the end of November this year. Now that the rules have been finalized and will be published in the Federal Register in the next couple of weeks, we are fine-tuning the steps we plan to take in each of our impacted sites. We expect to provide formal details of our plans on a site level basis at our virtual investor event in September. It is important to note that our valuation suggests that there are several coal plants, especially in PJM, that will be under pressure due to this rulemaking. As I close this morning, I want to reiterate that Vistra is committed to lead as we strive to achieve a safe, inclusive and environmentally conscious company and one that is a positive contributor to society. In doing so, we expect we will be able to create a sustainable company that can produce enduring value for all of our stakeholders in both the near and long term, reaching its fair and full value. I will now turn the call over to David Campbell. Well, yes, we I mean, we have seen pockets of books and companies that have seen some signs of stress. The summer hasn't shown up here yet in ERCOT, and so that has provided some relief for some of those companies. But we could see that and we're active, as you might guess. And most people are going to come to us before they transact with somebody else. So we're in the flow on that, and we are seeing some of it. And I would expect if we see what we think we're going to see in terms of scarcity value, particularly in ERCOT, we may see some more of those books come available. I will say that when we evaluate those, we're obviously looking for quality books, it can extend beyond a year. And some of these companies have the value of their company is atrophied because they may be door-to-door, more face-to-face-type contact. And what's happening with the virus, those types of channels have been a little more difficult. And so you've got to really dig under and just make sure you're getting something of value. And we're not going to do a deal just to do one. We want to make sure we get value. I don't know, Jim Burke's on the line. And Jim oversees over our retail business. Do you want to add anything to that? Yes, David. You there? Thank you. Yes. Julien, thanks for the question. And I tried to allude a little bit in the comments to this, and I will say, obviously, some for September, some of the details, but I think more at a 10,000-foot level strategically, and I made a very specific comment for a good reason. I think we may think a little bit differently than or maybe other competitors do. But we kind of balance between having investment in physical assets, in generation and in new technologies, renewables and batteries and PPAs. Like I said, we've got over 1,000 megawatts of PPAs as well as we've invested in batteries in California, we put up in two which is a battery. And I think you should expect us to do the same. I mean there are times where we have opportunities to sign up a PPA that is good value and we may back-to-back that with a retail deal. And then we also have times where we have because of a location we might have or because of our retail business and also because of our commercial capabilities and our ability to manage projects, those types of things, we have the capability to also invest in solar, predominantly solar and batteries. Of course, we've got a really good location in Moss Landing and then also Oakland in California. You can only imagine, given the size of our company in Texas, we've got a number of really good sites. And when it comes to renewables and batteries, it's kind of like real estate. It's location, location, location. And I think there's an opportunity for us to use our skills and capabilities as well as our locations and to invest in assets as well. And we like that balance. We like a balance of both new technology investments, and then we also like the balance of PPAs. I'm also a little concerned right now about the depth of the PPA market. And so also, you don't want to put your eggs all in one basket because you're going to try to cover a short position with PPAs and the PPAs are not there, then you got to go to something else and lean on the market. And so we like a balanced approach, and that also manifests itself in a balanced capital allocation plan. And that means we're going to put a little bit of money back into our company, and we're going to put a lot of the money back to the shareholder. And that's we're going to get into very into the very detailed specifics of that and our overall portfolio and how we expect to manage it in September. And so we just want to see this summer play out a little bit. And I think we're by the time we get to September, we'll be in a very good place to lay all that out. But we do see ourselves as a balanced and integrated player with a balanced mix of assets and PPAs and that we are going to deploy some capital into projects that we know we have an advantage and have superior returns. And we've also said, if we don't find those, if we don't have those, and we'll be able to get into the details in September, then we're plenty fine with returning capital to shareholders. In fact, we're excited about the fact that we're getting our debt down to the level now where we have to allocate less and less to debt paydown and we can now start to allocate more and more to returning capital to shareholders. Julien, you still there? Maybe we can get him back on here in a minute. Well, look, I think certainly, COVID-19, and we still continue to believe that we may do better on the bad debt expense side. But you just don't know. And like we said in our remarks, I'm a little worried about the additional unemployment and insurance payments coming off at the end of July. We think that's been helpful, people paying their bills. And we want to tread a little bit lightly, you guys know the cases in Texas have exploded. And this is really uncharted waters. So and then that's one of the things that I think could be a place where we might give something back. We haven't played out the whole summer out yet, and we still carry a little bit of length in the summer. And so we'd like to see how that plays out. But I think we were also trying to say in our remarks that we feel pretty good about where we are at this point in time. And so we didn't want to change the ranges. We typically don't do it this early. I think we'll probably talk about that in September. That's even earlier than we normally do. But I think we're going to be in a position to talk about 2020 in the range then in September. I think for us, and you know us well, I think you do, for us to even talk about the fact that we're tracking above the midpoint, I think, tells you that we're feeling good about 2020. But I do want to emphasize, there is still there are still some things out there that we want to keep an eye on for the remainder of the year, but we're feeling good about it. And I don't know, David, if there's anything you want to specifically mention, please jump in. Sorry about that, David. I will mention this, Michael, that I think people I think they now know this about us, but we kind of have a balanced year that we have. So the retail does pretty good and can do pretty well in the shoulder months where the supply cost, because we have a levelized retail price where the supply costs are lower. And then in the summer, we don't make as much money in retail, although we're doing pretty well, obviously, right now. And then in the winter months, in the fall and the winter, we get that lower supply cost again. And so it's important that volumes stay strong for us in the remainder of the year on the retail side. So October can be a big month for us. November and December can be big months on the retail side. And if you get if you had a situation where in Texas, you had an issue with demand because of COVID, that might be a little bit of a drag. We're not seeing that, though. We haven't seen it through up to now, and we've seen, obviously, a lot of cases. And so we're pretty optimistic that we're not going to see it. But also the relief program in ERCOT is coming off at the end of August. And so all those things are going to factor into what's going to happen with our retail business for the remainder of the year. We're optimistic, but we want to keep an eye on it, and we've provisioned for it, too. And when we're telling you where we think we're going to be, we also take into account that we do think that there could be higher bad debt expense than we normally have. Yes. So there are opportunities out there for people like us that have the locations, the capabilities, have the integrated nature of the business. You can see what I'd call attractive returns. And we're going to get more into that. And we'll actually in September, when we go through this, we'll actually show you how that builds up. Because I know what people have in their mind, they have a PPA, sort of what the returns are for some of the developers that are putting these projects out there. And they're wondering, how are you making something that looks attractive? Somebody's getting that value. That value exists given where market prices are clearing in ERCOT. It's who's getting it. And so the developer wants to get paid the development fee, and they need to get financing to get the project to go. So they need a PPA with an investment-grade firm in order to do that. And then somebody, the investment-grade firm, is getting the value. How they choose to monetize that value is up to them. They can sell the PPA to us and we can back-to-back it with a retail deal. They can take it to the market. Many of these guys don't want to take it to the market because there's risk taking it to the market. And if you don't have the capability to do that, then you don't want that risk. And so you're going to offlay that risk. But the value is in the market. And as we move more and more, Michael, to merchant investment, because not everything in Texas or across this country can be built through a PPA structure, when we get to the point where somebody has to put down real dollars per merchant, then the kind of returns that we're looking for and that we see, they're justified. They need to be there in order to justify the risk. And then you have to have the capability. You have to deal with basis risk and market risk and weather risk and all of those things that go into it. We have that ability to do that. We've got a whole infrastructure that knows how to do that. Not everybody knows how to do that. And so but we are seeing the opportunity, and we're one of the in my view, one of the view players that really have the integrated nature and the capabilities to actually monetize and to extract those kind of returns. Yes. David, do you want so Jonathan, to be clear, do you want us to talk about what's going on like in the PJM area, ISO New England, just what's going on with customer counts there as well as ERCOT? I just want to make sure that I got the question right. All right. Yes. Go ahead, Jim. Yes. Go ahead, Jim. Yes. So I think we're pretty much where we were. We see we were trying to convey a message that we're kind of flattish to midpoint guidance from 2020, which was, I think it's like three four, three five, we're kind of flattish to lower. We also, I think, if you remember, Jonathan, we said that we had stressed down further than that, and we were within 10% of EBITDA. But that was to give you guys a sense, because we were getting feedback from people that especially we were really in the throes of COVID and it was really new at the time, they wanted to see what a stress case would look like. But I think where we are right now is we're sort of flattish to slightly lower. And that was similar to where we had come out last time. We haven't seen anything yet that would change that view, and we'll probably know more because we'll be through most of the summer and into September. We'll also be able to see where the 2021 curves go as we roll out of the summer and into that fall period that we showed on that graphic where you start to see people turning their attention to the next summer. And that's where you get liquidity, and that's where pricing starts to firm up. Some of that pricing is supported by what happens in the summer, people the prompt summer. People like to look and see, well, was there scarcity or when conditions for scarcity showed up, didn't show up. That kind of thing does affect the market. And so we'll see where the rest of the summer goes. But if we get some high temperatures and low wind, people will be looking to see how the market reacts to that. All that sort of factors into affecting the forward curves. And for us, I think you know this, we would prefer to hedge up most of our long exposure in ERCOT, in particular, as we go into the next year, and then fill in the gaps throughout the initial part of the year and going into the summer. I don't know whether we'll get that opportunity, but we think we will, and that's what we're going to be looking for. And that's when you'll see more of the summer exposure that we have, hedging will occur sort of between now and the balance of the year. And then you'll see us sort of shape it a little bit as we go into next year. But we feel pretty confident we're going to get the opportunity for 2021 summer, which is really our biggest exposure for length. We'll get plenty of opportunities to be able to hedge going into that. And we still feel really good, when we look at our detailed supply/demand fundamental and modeling, we still feel good that we have a pretty tight market. And it's a market that's relying more and more on intermittent resources. In fact, you no longer have a situation in ERCOT where you can supply all the peak load with dispatchable resources like coal and gas and nuclear. So you have to rely on a certain level of renewable resources in order to be a reliable market and to actually meet the demand in the market. And with the volatility and intermittent nature of those resources, the inherent nature of that, you're going to get a few days in a market like ERCOT where you have extremely high temperatures in July and August and September time frame. There are going to be some days where it's going to be tight, and that's where the scarcity comes into play. And with the ORDC standard deviation moving up this year, we ought to see some pretty good pricing. It will be a function of weather, of course, and wind and unit performance. But we're pretty we go into this we're pretty confident that we'll see opportunities. That's a good question. I don't think we're going to do what they did. But I think in September, you'll see that we have a slightly different way that we are going to take a look at our business, that we hope will actually increase transparency and provide more information to you guys. And that will be the goal of what we do. And we'll give you a better sense of the business from a longevity standpoint and our strategic focus. So we do have an idea that we've been working on for some time now, and we would like to roll that out commensurate with the remainder of our longer-term capital allocation plan. Thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. And as I stated at the beginning of the call, we do appreciate your interest in Vistra, and we look forward to continuing the conversation. I hope everybody stays healthy and safe through these trying times. Thank you."

            "content": "Curt, I think you covered it well. The only thing I would add is that, with some of the COVID impacts having a little bit more focus on the business impacts to demand, some of the lower-margin business-focused books are seeing a little bit more pressure than some of the residential books. But in general, the theme that Curt mentioned that the summer hasn't shown up yet in ERCOT, is probably the prevailing consideration, and we are constantly monitoring the market for these opportunities. This is Jim. I'm happy to take it. Yes. Jonathan, so we had talked on the last call that a couple of our partners, the brands that we acquired, Crius and Ambit, are more dependent on face-to-face selling and the Midwest, Northeast markets have had some of the biggest restrictions on face-to-face selling. So Crius and Ambit, for instance, did well in Texas. Texas reopened in mid-June to allow some face-to-face selling. Many of the other markets, particularly Illinois and Ohio, where we've got sizable presence, have not reopened yet. So the quarter one to quarter two drop is largely a function of the markets not enabling that kind of channel performance. We have moved to other channels. There's more online activity that you would expect. There's definitely more. We're doing through the phones, but not through face-to-face selling. So that's the main driver. And fortunately, the strong ERCOT performance of TXU as well as the other brands in ERCOT more than overcame that in the quarter. And that and we see sort of the full year playing out in a similar fashion."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Molly Sorg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nMolly Sorg: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast covering first quarter 2020 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistraenergy.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related earnings release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Campbell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives available to address questions in the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to our investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra, especially during these extraordinary times. First and foremost, the Vistra family sends our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to those adversely impacted by the COVID-19 virus. We know the Northeast U.S. has been hardest hit and many of you on the call may have been affected. As tough as it is, there is hope, as I am convinced that we will get through this and we will be better than ever. I never thought I'd be hosting an earnings call from my home with our management team dispersed across the North Texas metroplex. And yet, that is where we find ourselves today. These are challenging times as we face the highly disruptive COVID-19 disease, which has already created unprecedented harm to society, threatening the health of not only the population, but of our economy and businesses as well. Now more than ever, I am proud to lead a company that is providing such an essential service to society, the electricity that powers our lives. Roughly 3,000 power plant team members at Vistra have no choice but to go to work every day to fulfill our obligation to society, and they have done it with pride and without question. We would not be able to work from home, power medical equipment and devices, and keep critical infrastructure running without electricity. Since the onset of COVID-19 in the U.S., Vistra has been focused on keeping our people healthy and safe while maintaining our essential business operations. Vistra took actions early on to prepare the company for a COVID-19 environment, putting us in a position of relative strength as we sit here today. In fact, we sowed the seeds of financial strength long before COVID-19 ever arrived. And we've been levered like the IPPs of the past, back in October 2016 when we emerged from bankruptcy, we may be having a very different discussion today. A strong balance sheet is as important as ever, and we intend to continue on our path to 2020 to our leverage target. We have logged well over 100 new activities that we are performing on a daily and weekly basis because of COVID-19, and we have provided a high level list of some of these actions on Slide 6, through steps such as: being one of the first U.S. generators to implement temperature testing and entry questionnaires at our locations, and contact tracing; instituting a work from home policy for all employees with remote work capabilities and nonspecific work location requirements; requiring face coverings and social distancing; thoroughly cleaning facilities between shifts and emphasizing hygiene; and executing commercial transactions to better position Vistra for the anticipated market moves, we have been able to maintain the level of operational excellence our stakeholders expect from us and our customers deserve. It is very important to note that these health and safety procedures must be implemented in a holistic manner. We are continuing to evolve our health and safety guidelines with an eye toward widespread testing. About three weeks ago, we also launched our planning ahead team to evaluate coming back to work for the nonspecific work location team members. This team has already started developing the necessary plans. In the end, the productivity of our team members working from home has been so strong that we can afford to be very deliberate about our returning to work. And frankly, we will not return until we feel that it is safe to do so. On the generation side, in addition to going to work locations to continue to perform their normal functions, our team members also completed or are on schedule to complete 86 maintenance outages this spring in the midst of the pandemic to ensure plant reliability for the critical summer months ahead. We analyzed the necessity and scope of each outage, rescheduling and scaling back if possible for the sake of our people without sacrificing reliability. On the retail side, our call center operations maintained service levels at greater than 90% for the first quarter and greater than 92% for the month of April, while managing the transition for most to working from home. And perhaps most important, I am proud that as of today, these procedures have contributed to eliminating our COVID-19 positive test to only two in a population of approximately 5,500 employees and over 3,000 contractors on our sites in 20 states and the district of Columbia, with both of these cases contracted outside of work. Fortunately, both of these affected individuals have fully recovered. I am also proud that we have been able to help our customers and communities during this difficult time by implementing programs to waive late fees, extend payment days and provide payment plans for those impacted by the COVID-19. We are also offering additional payment assistance to those in need through our TXU Energy Aid program, and we donated $2 million for COVID-19 relief efforts to nonprofits and social service agencies in the communities we serve. This is not just good business, is the right thing to do and reflects one of our guiding principles. I know the potential financial ramifications of COVID-19 on businesses is front of mind for investors today, which is why we have dedicated most of our prepared remarks to this topic. We believe Vistra is well positioned to deliver strong financial results in 2020, even in the face of lower demand driven by COVID-19. In fact, we are reaffirming our 2020 financial guidance today. Our confidence in our ability to continue to meet expectations in 2020 despite the challenges imposed by COVID-19 is a result of a few critical points, all set forth on Slide 7. First, our generation business is now approximately 99% hedged from direct commodity price risk exposure for the balance of 2020, limiting the impact of near-term price volatility on our 2020 financial results. Second, our retail business derives approximately 90% of its adjusted EBITDA from the residential and mass business customer classes, and we expect residential load will increase in 2020, mitigating the expected negative impact of lower business volumes.  Last, approximately 70% of Vistra's adjusted EBITDA is derived from the ERCOT market, which is proving to be relatively resilient as compared to the other markets where we operate. Historically, Texas has outperformed other U.S. markets during and coming out of economic downturns, and we expect it to be no different this time around. Our strong balance sheet and favorable position heading into the COVID-19-driven economic downturn gives us confidence in our working capital and liquidity position. And through the operations preparedness actions we have implemented, our fleet is ready to deliver safe and reliable power in the months ahead. While COVID-19 is making it virtually impossible for businesses in various sectors such as retail, real estate, airlines and hospitality, to estimate the potential negative impacts of the pandemic on their operations, fortunately, Vistra offers and essential product, electricity, which is critical to a well-functioning society. Our strong balance sheet and highly efficient generation fleet have supported our ability to opportunistically hedge minimizing the impacts of near-term price volatility. And our lean integrated operations have created a foundation for us to produce relatively stable financial results in a wide range of wholesale power price environments. Unfortunately, you wouldn't be able to come to this conclusion just by looking at our stock price over the past several months. It remains perplexing to me why our stock would trade at such a high free cash flow yield with our 2020 guidance intact and a relatively robust long-term outlook. As always, we will continue to focus our efforts on execution. Hopefully, with time, the financial markets will begin to appreciate the relative stability this low debt integrated model can deliver, which when combined with our nearly 70% free cash flow conversion ratio, we believe makes for a very attractive investment. While our stock price is disappointing, I am optimistic that as we approach our leverage target this year, announce our long-term capital allocation plan, still scheduled for September of this year and continue to execute and deliver in a variety of markets that we will unlock the value of this company. Turning now to Slide 8. Given the focus by the financial community on the impact of COVID-19 on electricity demand, we have summarized in a chart on this slide, the impacts we are seeing across each of our markets as of mid to late April. Similar to what we observed during the 2008 to 2009 recession and consistent with my earlier comments, ERCOT is proving to be relatively resilient. This is an important point for Vistra, given that, as I mentioned previously, approximately 70% of our adjusted EBITDA is derived from the ERCOT market. Moreover, while on their face, these demand declines could appear to be significant, we expect Vistra's hedges and substantial residential retail portfolio will mitigate what would have otherwise been a more dramatic negative financial implications from the COVID-19-led economic downturn. Turning to Slide 9. Let's start with our generation segment. Early in the first quarter, Vistra's exceptional commercial team read the tea leaves early on and executed a few opportunistic commercial transactions in anticipation of some of the market volatility we are now seeing materialize. These transactions resulted in a positive benefit to Vistra in the first quarter. In addition, our commercial and generation teams were able to dispatch our Permian Basin CTs in the first quarter to capture high prices in the West zone, resulting from low gas prices and local congestion. These actions put Vistra ahead of our financial plan for the quarter, contributing to a positive variance to our original 2020 guidance range for our commercial segments, which we depict in more detail on our guidance walk forward on Slide 11. For the balance of the year, Vistra is approximately 99% hedged from direct commodity price risk exposure, limiting the impact of changes in price levels to our 2020 financial results. Vistra's primary exposure to commodity price movements for the balance of the year is to the ERCOT summer, where we typically retain some generation length in order to protect from the downside risk of being caught short on a volatile summer day. As has always been the case, we continue to expect we will be able to manage this commodity price risk within our guidance range, particularly as we value this open position at well below market forward prices for planning and guidance purposes. And while we do expect lower peak demand in 2020 as compared to ERCOT's latest estimate published in its biannual supply demand forecast, called the Capacity, Demand and Reserve or CDR report in December 2019, we have already accounted for this anticipated lower demand and its expected impact on summer power prices in today's guidance reaffirmation. We continue to believe weather will be a critical variable, driving the incidence of scarcity pricing intervals this summer.  As we saw during the summer of 2019, low wind or high temperatures have the potential to drive scarcity pricing, and this impact could be even more pronounced in 2020 now that the Operating Reserve Demand Curve or ORDC has shifted by another quarter of a standard deviation. As you may recall, the ORDC is an administrative construct designed to provide additional revenues to the market as real-time operating reserves diminished to scarcity levels. Importantly, while we are observing decreased demand across all markets, residential demand is coming in slightly higher than weather-normalized expectations. And residential demand is both relatively inelastic and more sensitive to temperature swings due to increased air conditioning load, especially as more people are working from home. In short, even if lower business demand brings down the ERCOT peak in 2020, higher residential load on a hot summer day in Texas could still result in scarcity pricing intervals.  And we estimate that it could take only two degrees of the increased summer temperatures to offset the lower demand impact from COVID-19. As usual, ERCOT summer will continue to be a critical driver of Vistra's financial results for the year. However, we believe our guidance is conservative as we have already embedded risk from lower demand or mild weather in our financial guidance. Let's turn our attention now to our retail segment. I'm on Slide 10. We do expect that lower demand across our markets will have certain negative impacts on our retail segment's results for the year. Specifically, we are anticipating higher bad debt expense in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 driven financial distress among some of our customers. This risk of higher bad debt expense resides primarily in our ERCOT portfolio as in markets outside of Texas, the local utility generally controls the bill and assumes the customer selection risk. In ERCOT, the Public Utility Commission of Texas recognized that the retail electricity providers could be unduly harmed by continuing to supply power to customers who cannot pay their electric bills due to unemployment or lower income and enacted a COVID-19 Electricity Relief Program in response. This program includes, among other things, a mechanism for retail electric providers to recover $0.04 a kilowatt hour for nonpayment by a qualifying set of customers in exchange for not disconnecting these customers. While the program applies only to a limited set of customers that must go through a number of steps to qualify, we expect it will provide meaningful mitigation to what would otherwise have been even higher bad debt expense in 2020. Next, we similarly expect our retail segment will be negatively impacted by lower volumes, including lower recovery of fixed capacity costs on our Midwest and Northeast large business portfolio, and lower margins driven by reduced consumption across our business customer classes. We expect these negative variances to be partially offset by higher residential volumes among our existing customers. We are more focused than ever on maintaining superior customer service levels during this pandemic. Our customers depend on us to keep their lights on and to power their daily lives. Recognizing that some of our customers will find themselves in financial distress as a result of the COVID-19, we have already instituted programs to waive late fees, extend payment dates and provide payment planned alternatives. We are continuing to offer bill payment assistance through our partner, TXU Energy Aid, which uses donations from customers, employees and other Texans to help around 20,000 families keep their lights on each year. Our commitment to our customers is as high of a priority as ensuring the safety of our people. As we turn now to Slide 11, you can see all of the variables we just discussed accounted for in our 2020 guidance walk forward table. While we are reaffirming our 2020 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance ranges today, there are some puts and takes that get us there, primarily, our above plan performance in the first quarter of 2020, offset by anticipated COVID-19 impacts. Specifically, we expect our generation segment to be up approximately $60 million with some potential for upside as compared to our initial guidance forecast as a result of the opportunistic hedging and generation dispatch activities we executed in the first quarter, which I just discussed, as well as lower fuel expense, partially offset by the potential for lower power prices driven by covenant. We expect this positive variance in our generation segment to be potentially offset by a $60 million negative variance in our retail segment as compared to our initial guidance forecast. This forecasted retail variance is comprised of an expected $10 million benefit from lower costs and an accelerated capture of synergies from our Ambit and Crius acquisitions, offset by $70 million of expected headwinds related to COVID-19. These COVID-19 headwinds reflect an estimated $40 million increase in our bad debt expense for 2020, as well as an estimated $30 million driven by lower volumes in our business segments, partially offset by expected higher volumes from our residential retail customers. In total, we had a strong first quarter, and we are tracking strong for the full year with the expectation that our 2020 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA will be well within the range of the $3.285 billion to $3.585 billion, which is yet another example of the resiliency of the integrated model. We are also reaffirming our ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range of $2.16 billion to $2.46 billion. Now that we have covered 2020, let's turn the discussion toward the potential impacts COVID-19 could have on future market environments. Despite what is, on its face, a dampening market effect of lower demand from COVID-19 that we expect to continue into 2021, albeit at a lower level, the economic slowdown could have some ancillary impacts that are constructive to market dynamics. Starting with ERCOT, which is a market with relatively tight supply-demand fundamentals, we are already seeing evidence that renewable development is slowing for projects that were slated to come online in 2021 and beyond. ERCOT, as an energy-only market, was already difficult for market developers to secure merchant project financing. The uncertainty that has been created by the COVID-19-led economic recession is exacerbating this challenge.  We have received calls from a number of developers seeking to sell the development rights to their projects for very nominal fees given a lack of confidence these projects will be able to advance in today's environment. We are also observing that the appetite to execute power purchase agreements has decreased among investment-grade off-takers. As these entities begin to meet their goals or refine their programs so that their projects are located near their actual load as opposed to serving as virtual offsets. As a result, we estimate the 2021 supply estimates in ERCOT's December 2019 CDR report are almost 2.5x what we believe will be feasible to develop in this environment. If we do, in fact, see renewable development slow, this will be a meaningful offset to any decreases in peak demand that could flow through to 2021. As a result, ERCOT reserve margins could be very tight when demand growth returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. Similarly, the decreased oil drilling activity we are observing is reducing the supply of associated gas, making us somewhat bullish on natural gas prices in 2021 and beyond. Higher natural gas prices could further push up the price of power in the markets where we operate. With these factors as a backdrop, combined with the relative resiliency we're observing in Texas demand, we continue to like our position in the ERCOT market. Moving on to PJM and ISO New England markets, we similarly expect COVID-19 to have an impact on the supply side of the equation, both as it relates to the likelihood of new thermal development as well as the potential for incremental retirements. On the new development side, in our view, market economics did not support new thermal development prior to the COVID-19-related demand declines, and the current forward outlook is even less supportive of new build. As a result, we would not expect any new thermal development in either PJM or ISO New England in this environment. Further, we could see incremental retirements of higher heat rate or higher cost assets as the energy markets are challenged by lower demand expectations. The recent capacity auction clear in ISO New England and the uncertainty related to the upcoming capacity auction in PJM are not helpful for development and also present challenges for inefficient existing generation. Taking all of these factors into account, we expect we could see a range of outcomes in our 2021 financial results with the midpoint shifting somewhat lower. As we describe on Slide 13, many uncertainties remain, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19-led economic downturn, which makes predicting a likely outcome for 2021 even more challenging. Prior to COVID-19, our fundamental point of view suggested 2021 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA could track in line with or potentially higher than 2020 expected results. As of April 30, we are now 57% hedged in ERCOT and approximately 60% to 70% hedged in all other markets, which helps to limit the range of outcomes we expect to see next year. In order to balance risk with potential upside, we are continuing to opportunistically hedge, albeit at lower than previously expected power prices. Even with this incremental hedging activity, however, given the distribution of potential outcomes, we still expect there is a meaningful chance that 2021 guidance could be flat to 2020 guidance midpoint. Just looking at forward curves as of March 31, 2020, which already reflected a level of uncertainty around COVID-19 impact, which suggests 2021 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $200 million to $250 million lower than our 2020 guidance midpoint or about a 6% to 7% reduction. As we have seen, however, ERCOT forward curves have shifted upward in the back half of each of the past three years as the curve begins to reflect fundamentals and becomes more liquid. We believe there is still a possibility we could once again see this play out for the 2021 forward curve this fall. So the probability is likely lower due to the COVID-19 related uncertainty. In addition to looking at current forward curves, we also modeled fundamental supply and demand drivers in a number of economic downturn scenarios in order to better inform our views on the potential range of outcomes for 2021 financial results. Over the past two months, ERCOT's peak load has trended in the range of 2% below expectations. As the Texas economy begins to reopen, we may see this gap start to narrow. However, given the risk of slower economic recovery, our review of downturn scenarios included two consecutive years of peak demand trends below ERCOT's most recent forecast in its CDR report.  On the supply side, the current environment has clearly impacted the prospects for new generation investments. Nevertheless, in an effort to be conservative when testing the potential risk to our 2021 results or downturn scenarios, assume that the majority of the projected supply additions from the CDR will come online despite the historical trend of the CDR significantly overstating new supply additions as its purpose is not as a forecast tool, but as a representation of new generation in the development pipeline that have met certain criteria. As a result of our analysis of these fundamental drivers, we currently estimate that even in our most punitive downside case that holds supply constant to pre-COVID-19 levels and demand growth to 1/4 of the pre-COVID estimates from 2019 to 2021, 2021 results would still be within 10% of our 2020 guidance midpoint. And with so many different variables influencing the range of potential outcomes, we still think there is a meaningful possibility we can achieve flat EBITDA from 2020 to 2021. Importantly, this means that even in our most punitive modeled case, we still expect we will be able to deliver approximately $3.1 billion or more of adjusted EBITDA from our ongoing operations in 2021. With an expected 65% to 70% free cash flow conversion ratio, this would translate to more than $2 billion of adjusted free cash flow before growth, meaning that even in a recession created by an extremely low probability pandemic tail event, we expect to maintain very strong liquidity. And we expect we will have significant free cash flow to return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I suspect not many businesses today can say this. The market appears to be discounting our relative resilience. Even more than before, we believe the recent decline in our stock is unwarranted. In our view, Vistra should have been a stock investors fled to for relative safety in these economically uncertain times, and yet our stock has continued to trade with a free cash flow yield in the range of 20% to 30%. It is frustrating to say the least. The fundamentals of our business are strong. We supply an essential product and our low-cost, low-debt integrated business model comprised of leading retail businesses and advantage-generating assets is designed to manage risk and mitigate volatility. Our robust free cash flow should enable us to both reinvest in the business at modest levels while returning a significant amount of capital to investors. However, we are keeping the faith that as we pay down our debt and announce our capital allocation plans in 2020, we will be on the path to reach our fair and full value. As always, we will keep our eye on the ball of execution and continue to prove out this thesis. I will now turn the call over to David Campbell.\nDavid Campbell: Thank you, Curt. Turning now to Slide 15. Vistra delivered first-quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $850 million, results that exceeded management expectations for the quarter. The favorability was driven by our ERCOT segment, reflecting the opportunistic hedging and generation dispatch activities that Curt mentioned previously. Our first-quarter 2020 results were $26 million higher than the same period in 2019, with our retail segment up $54 million and our generation segments down a collective $28 million. The positive year-over-year variance for our ongoing operations was driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit, partially offset by lower results in our MISO and New York, New England generation segments, driven primarily by lower capacity revenue. As a reminder, due to retirement of four coal plants in our MISO segment in the fourth quarter, our first-quarter 2019 results have been recast, increasing by $9 million to account for the movement of the financial results of those plants out of the MISO segment and into the asset closure segment. Next, on the topic of liquidity. Vistra had total available liquidity of approximately $1.834 billion as of March 31, which includes cash and cash equivalents of $717 million and $1.117 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. In April, we repaid $550 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, on May 1, we notified the holders of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2023 that we will redeem the entire $500 million principal amount outstanding on June 1. Our teams have modeled various scenarios to stress test our liquidity, and given the company's strong cash generation profile, we are confident we will have ample liquidity to operate our business even in a recessionary environment. Before we conclude today's call, I would like to offer a brief reminder of our capital allocation plan for 2020 and 2021, a summary of which is set forth on Slide 16. As we have consistently emphasized, our capital allocation priority for 2020 is debt reduction. In fact, it is in economic environments like the one we're in right now where the value of having a strong balance sheet is even more pronounced. Despite the low levels where our stock has been trading in recent months, our investors and stakeholders remain supportive of our commitment to advance toward our long-term leverage target of approximately 2.5x net debt to EBITDA. Last week, we announced that our Board of Directors approved our second quarter dividend of $0.135 or $0.54 per share on an annual basis, which represents an 8% increase from the annual dividend we paid in 2019. As we look ahead, even with the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we still expect to have significant cash available for allocation in 2021 and beyond. We plan to lay out our long-term capital allocation plan in late September this year, the basic tenets of which we have been articulating for several quarters now. Specifically, we expect we will allocate approximately 25% of our capital available for allocation to growth investments on an annual basis, but only if our investment thresholds are met.  If we do not find projects that we believe are an attractive use of capital, we plan to return that capital to shareholders. We expect that the remaining 75% available capital will be returned to stakeholders through a quarterly dividend with an attractive dividend yield combined with share repurchases. Please stay tuned for more specific details on our long-term capital allocation plan in September of this year. In closing, we are proud of our team members for their unwavering commitment to producing and delivering power to our customers in these challenging times. Our business remains resilient, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver stable results on an annual basis, even in the face of unprecedented economic challenges. Our hope is that the successful execution of our business plan in this environment will further instill confidence in Vistra by our many stakeholders, ultimately unlocking what we believe is the true value of our company. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: Glad you're safe. Can we just -- a couple of questions here. Can we talk about sort of the landscape of potential retail growth opportunities as we look at the second half of the year into '21? Does the PUCT's rate relief program and kind of your lower estimates around peak demand maybe take some of the pressure off the smaller ERCOT books to sell and potentially shift your focus back to buybacks, i.e., that 25% of capital that's allocated to growth, like David just mentioned? Could that present further opportunities as it shifted towards buybacks with sort of credit metrics on pace to hit IG by '21? So how do we sort of think about that growth portion and given some reprieve that's been given to the retail providers?\nCurt Morgan: So it does help. I mean, if they did not put the program in place, I think our view is, Shahriar, that it would have been carnage. No doubt about it. But to be clear about it, what's happening is there's -- what is being recovered by retailers is the energy component or the generation component and the T&D component, the margin that retailers typically get is not embedded in that. So while it's helpful for some of them, some of the retailers that are smaller, not as well capitalized, maybe not as sophisticated from a risk management standpoint, there's still risk and there continues to be, in our view, significant risk going into the summer months. And given the situation, it may be harder also for them to hedge and post collateral. So I do believe that there is still some risk to retailers in this market, and we've seen a little bit of that. Whether that turns into some kind of an opportunity, we'll see. But there is certainly some movement of foot by some retailers given that this isn't exactly everything that a retailer would have wanted in this situation. The other part of this is, is that the margin that is being forgone, you can collect on afterwards. But this is a customer class that is very difficult and will be difficult to collect on. So the ability for the retailer to actually try to claw back, if you will, that lost margin is going to be extremely difficult. So we'll see whether something comes out of this or not, that's certainly something that we are keeping an eye out for. But it's hard to predict at this point in time. I think we're still comfortable, Shahriar, really, with the roughly a quarter of our free cash flow on an annual basis, although it's going to be a bit lumpy, just depends on opportunities and depends more importantly on the economics of any deal that we might want to get into or a project we might want to do. But we still think that quarter of our free cash flow a year, it seems reasonable. I think in September, we're going to put a little more meat on that bone, both the growth side of it, but also, I think, put more detail around what the 3/4 is, which I think is the most important part of our capital allocation plan. And I think September will be a big time period for that.  And then the other thing, I think in September, is that we got some things that we want to talk about in terms of our overall portfolio positioning as a company, our asset mix and how we're going about sort of the future. But I think all of that's going to happen. We're only now -- it seems like years away, but we're only five months away now from that happening. This is the point in time that I've been waiting for since I've been here, to get to the point where we can actually be at a steady state.\nShahriar Pourreza: And so just a follow-up. So I have to imagine that the sustainability of the model that you're displaying today should provide some level of comfort with the agencies, right? Is there any updates with your conversations regarding a ratings upgrade to IG? Also any potential for the time line to slip due to COVID? Are you still kind of shooting for that Q4 '21 for IG? So how is sort of the dialogue going with the rating agencies? Because I have to imagine this quarter should provide a little bit of a reprieve on whatever concerns they have from a business risk standpoint.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Well, what I understand is that -- and I think S&P made some comments to this effect. But I think it slipped a little bit, Shahriar, because what I heard is that S&P is probably going to wait to see how the year turns out to move us another notch. And then I expect them to it -- to be at least a year and probably a little bit more. So I think we've slipped a little bit on the IG. But my own view is exactly yours, which is, I think when the dust settles, I actually don't think this is going to end up being a negative period of time, but actually a highly positive period of time. And the agencies are going to look at this and say, in what is I don't think anybody can argue that this is not a tail event. This is a truly a tail event, probably as bad or as close to as bad as the great depression in terms of what it's doing to unemployment. And they're going to have to step back and look at that. It's not like just a normal run-of-the-mill recession here. And just the resilience of our business model what I believe, and I think this is incredibly important for our company, is that the business risk that has been ascribed to this sector for so long because of the poor execution, the bad strategies, I think when they look at this model and the execution that we put forward, that it's actually going to end up being a positive in the long run. So I still have some hope that by the end of year '21, we could get to investment grade. But I actually believe based on comments that I have heard, we may have slipped a little bit.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Thank you, guys. Congrats on the results. I will jump back in the queue. Appreciate it.\nCurt Morgan : All right. Thanks, Shar.\nOperator: Your next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.\nStephen Byrd: Hey, I hope you all are well.\nCurt Morgan : You, too, Stephen. Hi.\nStephen Byrd : Congrats on the good results in a challenging time. You gave some really good color on the state of the renewables market. And I just wondered, does that make you want to potentially be more aggressive in terms of growth just because of the opportunities? I just want to make sure I kind of understood how you're thinking about the implications of what's happening there.\nCurt Morgan : Well, I think there was a number of implications that we were trying to get across. I think one of them was that we just think the growth in renewables, in particular in ERCOT, may have slowed down a bit. But I will tell you that when we stressed to get to that within 10% in 2021, we really didn't cut back the amount of renewables that we had previously thought we're going to come in back when we gave guidance, back in November time frame. So in my view, it's a bit punitive, but we wanted to stress the system a little bit. So I think that's one point. In terms of the point that you're making, I think we have some ideas about what we would like to do around renewables. And I don't know that this has really changed it much. We still have a strong cash flow that if we want to do some projects, we're going to follow through. I think you saw that we increased the battery opportunity out at our Oakland site. I think there may be some other opportunities at our Moss Landing site. And then, certainly some potential opportunities in ERCOT. And so I don't know, really, Stephen, I don't think it's changed our view. I think the difference is, is that we have the ability to do the things we want to do, whereas some people, I think, it's going to be more difficult just because it's difficult to attract the capital to support their plans. The developers are having more difficulty. And we know that because they're approaching us, for us to take over their projects and then pay them a small nominal fee to take them over. So I think there is an opportunity there and that we're working on that opportunity, whereas maybe there's some good projects that may come to market at a relatively cheap price, and we'll take a look at that and add that to our backlog. We don't talk much about just the amount of projects we have around renewables, in particular in Texas, but we also have them in other states. Of course, we have the coal to solar, thing going on in Illinois. But this company has a fairly deep backlog of opportunities to invest in renewables. But we're going to be deliberate about it, and we're looking for those kind of opportunities that offer the kind of returns that we expect, that sort of 500 to 600 basis points above cost of equity. And we have some of those, and we'll talk more about that in September.\nStephen Byrd: That's helpful. It sounds like it's a pretty rich opportunity set so we'll stay tuned on that. And just on the demand outlook, you gave a lot of good color in a number of ways. I wonder just on residential demand, and I apologize if you did lay it out. Could you quantify just sort of the percentage increase in residential demand you've seen or that you expect, especially down in Texas this year? What's your general kind of view on how meaningful that may be?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Since I'm not in the same room with everybody, I'll ask David if he has that. But between David Campbell and Jim Burke, we probably have two folks that can put a little more detail to that. So David, do you want to start? And then, Jim, if you have anything to say, please jump in.\nDavid Campbell: Sure. So this is David. Thanks, Stephen. With respect to residential, what we've seen is impacts actually in the second quarter. So for the past month or so, it's been in the 5% to 6% range. We've modeled it relatively conservatively, around 2% for the back 9 months of the year, but we've actually seen increases, reflecting people working from home in the 5% to 6% range. And that's what we're expecting in the second quarter and moderating in the back half of the year. We've kept pretty conservative assumptions around load declines in other segments, but we -- to be conservative, we had that moderating. So the overall increase for the back 9 months is about 2%.\nStephen Byrd: Understood. And I guess just as a follow-up on that. I mean, that's -- that sounds -- that makes sense. That sounds reasonably conservative. So if demand is actually -- if demand for residential is stronger, presumably, that's relatively meaningful given your business mix?\nDavid Campbell: That's exactly right, Stephen. It's our -- especially in ERCOT, where residential demand is weather sensitive and it's our highest margin segment. We think that there's potential upside there, particularly it's folks -- scenarios where as businesses reopen, you still have a large segment of the workforce working from home. So you'll see some uptick or moderation of the demand declines on the business side, while at the same time seeing the uptick in the residential side being sustained. So I do think that it provides -- it's a meaningful impact for us given the profitability of our ERCOT residential segment.\nCurt Morgan: And Stephen, one other thing I'll mention at this point, I think we've tried to be pretty conservative. We're only at the beginning of May here. And we typically aren't going to change guidance this early in the year, especially given just how important the ERCOT summer is and how volatile it can be. But there were words in my script and there were words in David's and then also on these slides about tracking strong and that we're well within the range. And what that really means is, I think we've been conservative on our estimates for 2020, and we feel very good, very good about the midpoint and we think there's some potential for upside. But we want to be cautious about that. I think what will be a better indicator is when we get into the second and certainly, the third quarter earnings calls, when we have a better insight as to what the summer and ERCOT is going to look like. But from where we stand today, even with COVID-19, 2020, it looks to be a pretty strong year if we can execute the way we believe we can.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research LLC.\nSteven Fleishman: So just one question in thinking about capital allocation. So if the rating agencies are going to take longer to determine investment grade, I just wanted to kind of get a sense when you make your next decision on capital allocation, are you going to focus mainly on just hitting your debt-to-EBITDA metrics? Or are you going to be trying to kind of do things to keep getting to just the investment grade, i.e., what -- is it the metrics or the investment grade that are the priority in making that decision?\nCurt Morgan: Yes, that's a very good question, Steve. Look, I think the simple way to think about this, and of course I've got a -- we've got a whole session coming up in July with our Board, so I really don't like to get out in front of them but I'll explain it this way. We've dedicated 2020 to pay down debt, and we're going to do that. And that's a bit of a sacrifice to also returning some money to our shareholders, which we would like to do, especially in this environment, but we also had to balance those priorities. And I think what you can expect from us in September is a capital allocation plan that is focused on returning capital to shareholders and reinvesting in our business. And given that it appears that things may be pushed out a little bit and the fact that we've never started this venture to get to investment grade, that was an outcome that kind of came up, that we're not going to chase things around.  We are going to get to where we think the capital structure of this company leaves us in a position to be as strong as possible. And we just so happen believe -- to believe that with our business risk, which we are demonstrating is quite solid through all this and just the metrics themselves, they speak for themselves. And we still have to make a jump to BB+ with S&P, and so we want to get to that next. And then we'll get into dialogue with them about what it's going to take to get to investment grade. But I think the focus for us in September is going to be squarely around the two big buckets that I just talked about, reinvestment in the company and some opportunities that we have -- that we think are quite good. But more importantly, the big 3 quarters of our free cash flow talking to our investors about returning that in some form or fashion. And it's not rocket science, it will be a mix of what do we do with our dividend and what do we do with potential -- probably potential share repurchases. So that's -- and we'll see where we're trading, obviously, and all that will go into it. But I suspect that will be the two big buckets. And I think there's also some other details we're going to get into on that call as well that I think are important for people, about what's the long-term focus of our company and how we think about managing our portfolio of assets for the future. So a lot going to be packed into that. I think we want to get through the summer, see how things go and then we're ready to go in September. But that's how we're thinking about it.\nSteven Fleishman: That's great. That makes sense. And I don't think you want to be chasing the rating agencies all the time. Okay. And then, just on the unfortunately, I have to ask since the CDR has become a bit of an event in recent times. I think it's coming out maybe next week for the summer. Just any sense on what we should expect for that? And do you think we'll actually see this reduction in some of the renewables or delays, or is it likely not to show up in that? Just any color on the CDR.\nCurt Morgan : Boy, I'd tell you, I have a hard time predicting what is going to come out of that CDR because it's not all that difficult for people to get projects to the point where it shows up in the CDR. And as you know, there's no economic overlay. And I think even ERCOT has tried to distance themselves from this being something to use for forecasting purposes. So it's hard to say. I do think there may be some pullback, Steve, but I also believe what's likely going to happen is it may be deferral more than it is anything actually leaving. And so you may see more kind of like it did last year when everything got pushed from '20 into '21, and there was a big bucket of projects that showed up there. And then, I think that you may see some get deferred even again. But I wouldn't be surprised, honestly, that people were still working -- developers are working on projects and getting them in the queue, interconnection queue and that more may show up. For me, it's less about that. We have a development team on the ground, we know this market very well. And it's more about what we're seeing in terms of real activity on the ground and getting equipment, signing contracts, getting financing. And that's where we're seeing things really pull back. And I think the other area where we've seen pretty big pullback is just the support on the PPA side. And that we have yet to see -- for example, on solar, we have yet to see a merchant solar plant get financing in the ERCOT market. It's just really difficult with an all-energy market to do that. And so without a PPA behind these, it just makes it more and more difficult. And we've seen that PPA market slowed down quite a bit. So even though the CDR could be a wildcard in all this, and I know that we're going to have to deal with whatever comes out of that, for us, it's more about what's really going on, on the ground. And for me, that's why our team is constantly not just looking to develop things, but also to try to get intelligence about what else is going on.\nSteve Fleishman : Okay. Thanks so much.\nCurt Morgan : Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Hope you all are well. Wanted to follow up on some of the various ways it's been asked on prior questions, but when you talk about the '21 outlook and you put a few comments in your slides, I won't repeat them. But what are you reflecting with respect to, first, the latest uptick in power prices even in recent days when you think about '21 EBITDA relative to '20? As well as you just talked about an improvement in residential sales, for instance, how does that also figure into the meaningful chance that '21 guidance could be flat to '20 at this point? What are you assuming?\nCurt Morgan : Yeah. Yeah. And Julien, I'm going to take that as being largely focused on ERCOT, is that correct?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. You tell me what the meaningful factors are, for example.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Well, look, I mean -- so 2020 -- actually, what we've seen is that from where our fundamental view is, 20 -- 2021 summer pricing in ERCOT, which is really always the big ticket for us, that will really end up being the swing that will either get us to flat or something less than that. Those prices have come off pretty hard over the last few weeks, and that's liquidity. It's a whole bunch of different reasons why that has come off. We don't believe it's fundamentally driven. And so it will really depend on kind of how quickly we come out of this -- the COVID-19 event and how quick the recovery is. And so that's why we're being a bit cautious in trying to draw distribution around the outcomes.  But if we were -- if we saw pricing up near where our fundamental view is, we would be very much closer to a flat year-over-year. If prices stay where they are now, they'd be more like in the -- what we had talked about in the presentation, that $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. So it just really depends on where ERCOT pricing comes out. And I think on the retail side, the numbers that year-over-year, from '20 to '21 are not that big in terms of our retail outlook that, that's really the swing factor. It's really going to end up being summer ERCOT pricing that will end up being the big ticket item. In the other markets, it's really not -- they're not that big of a player in this either. So I think if you really draw a circle around it, it's really going to end up being where does the summer '21 in ERCOT come out. And we see a distribution around that and still a fairly good chance that you could see a pretty strong year, especially if the development that we talked about doesn't come to fruition and the economy in Texas recovers quickly, which could happen. You could really see another tight situation in ERCOT.  And then we're talking about a very different set of numbers, probably something more closer to flat year-over-year relative to our guidance in 2020. But if we see a more prolonged effect from the COVID-19 virus and prices stay a little more depressed going into the summer, weather doesn't show up, then you could be on the lower end, that kind of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion range. And David, I don't know if you want to add anything on that or not.\nDavid Campbell: I think you covered it, Curt.\nCurt Morgan: Okay.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. Excellent. If I can just quickly follow up. On the C&I exposure, to the extent to which obviously 90% of the business is resi and mass biz. I just wanted to understand how you all are thinking about that exposure more in terms of the margin impacts, even on that small piece that would seemingly be the partial offset to what are otherwise very positive trends on the resi side.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. David, do you want to take that one?\nDavid Campbell: Sure. So Julien, you saw that we noted that there's some downticks from LC&I that we cited on Slide 11. And it's a combination of factors, the margin from that segment is pretty low. So part of it is lost margin, part of it is the loss of the hedge position. So we valued reselling back that power into the market at lower prices. And part of it is some of the impacts of certain fixed costs like capacity and transmission, particularly in Midwest and Northeast. So that's what gets you up to that sum total of the $30 million for the year, partially offset by some higher residential volumes. So that's some total of the various impacts, the margin is a relatively small piece of that. And again, that's our projection for the full year. It's with a view that we could have sustained impacts in the downturn. So we've tried to be pretty conservative in our assumptions. But it's the sum total of those various impacts of that segment.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Understood. Hey, Curt, just a real quick clarification for the sake of the call. When you're talking about growth here real quickly, and you made some comments earlier about growth expectations, renewables, et cetera, and just reconciling against, obviously, where the stock is, et cetera, how committed are you to seeing through growth relative to allocating capital back to buybacks, dividends, et cetera? Just want to be -- just exceptionally clear about growth capital right now.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. So look, I mean we look at -- we balance that. So the priority for us is obviously, to use capital efficiently. But at the same time, you've got to balance that a little bit in terms of growing the company over time. And -- because we are a going concern and buying back our shares. But we do an economic analysis, it's very simple. The real key, Julien, you know this, is what share price do you assume when you do the economics of buying back your own shares? And that is a really -- that's an art more than a science. So we look at a variety of share prices when you look at the return that you get for buying back your own shares, and we don't just look at one price, and we try to be realistic about it.  And we have to look at that over a period of time. And so depending on how long the period of time is, that dilutes the return on buying back shares. But we try to balance that, and we try to -- if we're going to invest in our company, we want to -- back into our company, we want to make sure that those returns also stand up to buy -- the alternative of buying back our shares. And I'm pretty happy to say that when we have done that, the returns have been definitely in the range of what we thought the value of buying back our shares has been and we're going to continue to do that kind of analysis, knowing that we also have to balance that we have to -- we're going to have to invest in our company. Our company is going to -- we're going to see coal plants retire. We've already been very straightforward on that front. We'd like to replace economically, obviously, the EBITDA from that, and we'd like to grow our EBITDA. At the same time, we know our stock is cheap. And so it's a balancing effect. There's no simple formula to it. But we do, do the math that you would expect us to do to try to see the relative returns of investing back in the business and investing in buying back our shares.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Curt Morgan for closing remarks.\nCurt Morgan: Well, once again, I want to thank everybody for being on the call. I hope everybody stays safe and healthy in this difficult time. I can't tell you enough how we appreciate your interest in our company, given the extraordinary COVID-19 virus. We're excited about our company, and we're excited about the months coming ahead. And until next time, please be safe and be healthy.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Curt. Turning now to Slide 15. Vistra delivered first-quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $850 million, results that exceeded management expectations for the quarter. The favorability was driven by our ERCOT segment, reflecting the opportunistic hedging and generation dispatch activities that Curt mentioned previously. Our first-quarter 2020 results were $26 million higher than the same period in 2019, with our retail segment up $54 million and our generation segments down a collective $28 million. The positive year-over-year variance for our ongoing operations was driven by the acquisitions of Crius and Ambit, partially offset by lower results in our MISO and New York, New England generation segments, driven primarily by lower capacity revenue. As a reminder, due to retirement of four coal plants in our MISO segment in the fourth quarter, our first-quarter 2019 results have been recast, increasing by $9 million to account for the movement of the financial results of those plants out of the MISO segment and into the asset closure segment. Next, on the topic of liquidity. Vistra had total available liquidity of approximately $1.834 billion as of March 31, which includes cash and cash equivalents of $717 million and $1.117 billion of availability under our revolving credit facility. In April, we repaid $550 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Additionally, on May 1, we notified the holders of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2023 that we will redeem the entire $500 million principal amount outstanding on June 1. Our teams have modeled various scenarios to stress test our liquidity, and given the company's strong cash generation profile, we are confident we will have ample liquidity to operate our business even in a recessionary environment. Before we conclude today's call, I would like to offer a brief reminder of our capital allocation plan for 2020 and 2021, a summary of which is set forth on Slide 16. As we have consistently emphasized, our capital allocation priority for 2020 is debt reduction. In fact, it is in economic environments like the one we're in right now where the value of having a strong balance sheet is even more pronounced. Despite the low levels where our stock has been trading in recent months, our investors and stakeholders remain supportive of our commitment to advance toward our long-term leverage target of approximately 2.5x net debt to EBITDA. Last week, we announced that our Board of Directors approved our second quarter dividend of $0.135 or $0.54 per share on an annual basis, which represents an 8% increase from the annual dividend we paid in 2019. As we look ahead, even with the economic uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we still expect to have significant cash available for allocation in 2021 and beyond. We plan to lay out our long-term capital allocation plan in late September this year, the basic tenets of which we have been articulating for several quarters now. Specifically, we expect we will allocate approximately 25% of our capital available for allocation to growth investments on an annual basis, but only if our investment thresholds are met.  If we do not find projects that we believe are an attractive use of capital, we plan to return that capital to shareholders. We expect that the remaining 75% available capital will be returned to stakeholders through a quarterly dividend with an attractive dividend yield combined with share repurchases. Please stay tuned for more specific details on our long-term capital allocation plan in September of this year. In closing, we are proud of our team members for their unwavering commitment to producing and delivering power to our customers in these challenging times. Our business remains resilient, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver stable results on an annual basis, even in the face of unprecedented economic challenges. Our hope is that the successful execution of our business plan in this environment will further instill confidence in Vistra by our many stakeholders, ultimately unlocking what we believe is the true value of our company. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions. Sure. So this is David. Thanks, Stephen. With respect to residential, what we've seen is impacts actually in the second quarter. So for the past month or so, it's been in the 5% to 6% range. We've modeled it relatively conservatively, around 2% for the back 9 months of the year, but we've actually seen increases, reflecting people working from home in the 5% to 6% range. And that's what we're expecting in the second quarter and moderating in the back half of the year. We've kept pretty conservative assumptions around load declines in other segments, but we -- to be conservative, we had that moderating. So the overall increase for the back 9 months is about 2%. That's exactly right, Stephen. It's our -- especially in ERCOT, where residential demand is weather sensitive and it's our highest margin segment. We think that there's potential upside there, particularly it's folks -- scenarios where as businesses reopen, you still have a large segment of the workforce working from home. So you'll see some uptick or moderation of the demand declines on the business side, while at the same time seeing the uptick in the residential side being sustained. So I do think that it provides -- it's a meaningful impact for us given the profitability of our ERCOT residential segment. I think you covered it, Curt. Sure. So Julien, you saw that we noted that there's some downticks from LC&I that we cited on Slide 11. And it's a combination of factors, the margin from that segment is pretty low. So part of it is lost margin, part of it is the loss of the hedge position. So we valued reselling back that power into the market at lower prices. And part of it is some of the impacts of certain fixed costs like capacity and transmission, particularly in Midwest and Northeast. So that's what gets you up to that sum total of the $30 million for the year, partially offset by some higher residential volumes. So that's some total of the various impacts, the margin is a relatively small piece of that. And again, that's our projection for the full year. It's with a view that we could have sustained impacts in the downturn. So we've tried to be pretty conservative in our assumptions. But it's the sum total of those various impacts of that segment."

            "content": "Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra, especially during these extraordinary times. First and foremost, the Vistra family sends our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to those adversely impacted by the COVID-19 virus. We know the Northeast U.S. has been hardest hit and many of you on the call may have been affected. As tough as it is, there is hope, as I am convinced that we will get through this and we will be better than ever. I never thought I'd be hosting an earnings call from my home with our management team dispersed across the North Texas metroplex. And yet, that is where we find ourselves today. These are challenging times as we face the highly disruptive COVID-19 disease, which has already created unprecedented harm to society, threatening the health of not only the population, but of our economy and businesses as well. Now more than ever, I am proud to lead a company that is providing such an essential service to society, the electricity that powers our lives. Roughly 3,000 power plant team members at Vistra have no choice but to go to work every day to fulfill our obligation to society, and they have done it with pride and without question. We would not be able to work from home, power medical equipment and devices, and keep critical infrastructure running without electricity. Since the onset of COVID-19 in the U.S., Vistra has been focused on keeping our people healthy and safe while maintaining our essential business operations. Vistra took actions early on to prepare the company for a COVID-19 environment, putting us in a position of relative strength as we sit here today. In fact, we sowed the seeds of financial strength long before COVID-19 ever arrived. And we've been levered like the IPPs of the past, back in October 2016 when we emerged from bankruptcy, we may be having a very different discussion today. A strong balance sheet is as important as ever, and we intend to continue on our path to 2020 to our leverage target. We have logged well over 100 new activities that we are performing on a daily and weekly basis because of COVID-19, and we have provided a high level list of some of these actions on Slide 6, through steps such as: being one of the first U.S. generators to implement temperature testing and entry questionnaires at our locations, and contact tracing; instituting a work from home policy for all employees with remote work capabilities and nonspecific work location requirements; requiring face coverings and social distancing; thoroughly cleaning facilities between shifts and emphasizing hygiene; and executing commercial transactions to better position Vistra for the anticipated market moves, we have been able to maintain the level of operational excellence our stakeholders expect from us and our customers deserve. It is very important to note that these health and safety procedures must be implemented in a holistic manner. We are continuing to evolve our health and safety guidelines with an eye toward widespread testing. About three weeks ago, we also launched our planning ahead team to evaluate coming back to work for the nonspecific work location team members. This team has already started developing the necessary plans. In the end, the productivity of our team members working from home has been so strong that we can afford to be very deliberate about our returning to work. And frankly, we will not return until we feel that it is safe to do so. On the generation side, in addition to going to work locations to continue to perform their normal functions, our team members also completed or are on schedule to complete 86 maintenance outages this spring in the midst of the pandemic to ensure plant reliability for the critical summer months ahead. We analyzed the necessity and scope of each outage, rescheduling and scaling back if possible for the sake of our people without sacrificing reliability. On the retail side, our call center operations maintained service levels at greater than 90% for the first quarter and greater than 92% for the month of April, while managing the transition for most to working from home. And perhaps most important, I am proud that as of today, these procedures have contributed to eliminating our COVID-19 positive test to only two in a population of approximately 5,500 employees and over 3,000 contractors on our sites in 20 states and the district of Columbia, with both of these cases contracted outside of work. Fortunately, both of these affected individuals have fully recovered. I am also proud that we have been able to help our customers and communities during this difficult time by implementing programs to waive late fees, extend payment days and provide payment plans for those impacted by the COVID-19. We are also offering additional payment assistance to those in need through our TXU Energy Aid program, and we donated $2 million for COVID-19 relief efforts to nonprofits and social service agencies in the communities we serve. This is not just good business, is the right thing to do and reflects one of our guiding principles. I know the potential financial ramifications of COVID-19 on businesses is front of mind for investors today, which is why we have dedicated most of our prepared remarks to this topic. We believe Vistra is well positioned to deliver strong financial results in 2020, even in the face of lower demand driven by COVID-19. In fact, we are reaffirming our 2020 financial guidance today. Our confidence in our ability to continue to meet expectations in 2020 despite the challenges imposed by COVID-19 is a result of a few critical points, all set forth on Slide 7. First, our generation business is now approximately 99% hedged from direct commodity price risk exposure for the balance of 2020, limiting the impact of near-term price volatility on our 2020 financial results. Second, our retail business derives approximately 90% of its adjusted EBITDA from the residential and mass business customer classes, and we expect residential load will increase in 2020, mitigating the expected negative impact of lower business volumes.  Last, approximately 70% of Vistra's adjusted EBITDA is derived from the ERCOT market, which is proving to be relatively resilient as compared to the other markets where we operate. Historically, Texas has outperformed other U.S. markets during and coming out of economic downturns, and we expect it to be no different this time around. Our strong balance sheet and favorable position heading into the COVID-19-driven economic downturn gives us confidence in our working capital and liquidity position. And through the operations preparedness actions we have implemented, our fleet is ready to deliver safe and reliable power in the months ahead. While COVID-19 is making it virtually impossible for businesses in various sectors such as retail, real estate, airlines and hospitality, to estimate the potential negative impacts of the pandemic on their operations, fortunately, Vistra offers and essential product, electricity, which is critical to a well-functioning society. Our strong balance sheet and highly efficient generation fleet have supported our ability to opportunistically hedge minimizing the impacts of near-term price volatility. And our lean integrated operations have created a foundation for us to produce relatively stable financial results in a wide range of wholesale power price environments. Unfortunately, you wouldn't be able to come to this conclusion just by looking at our stock price over the past several months. It remains perplexing to me why our stock would trade at such a high free cash flow yield with our 2020 guidance intact and a relatively robust long-term outlook. As always, we will continue to focus our efforts on execution. Hopefully, with time, the financial markets will begin to appreciate the relative stability this low debt integrated model can deliver, which when combined with our nearly 70% free cash flow conversion ratio, we believe makes for a very attractive investment. While our stock price is disappointing, I am optimistic that as we approach our leverage target this year, announce our long-term capital allocation plan, still scheduled for September of this year and continue to execute and deliver in a variety of markets that we will unlock the value of this company. Turning now to Slide 8. Given the focus by the financial community on the impact of COVID-19 on electricity demand, we have summarized in a chart on this slide, the impacts we are seeing across each of our markets as of mid to late April. Similar to what we observed during the 2008 to 2009 recession and consistent with my earlier comments, ERCOT is proving to be relatively resilient. This is an important point for Vistra, given that, as I mentioned previously, approximately 70% of our adjusted EBITDA is derived from the ERCOT market. Moreover, while on their face, these demand declines could appear to be significant, we expect Vistra's hedges and substantial residential retail portfolio will mitigate what would have otherwise been a more dramatic negative financial implications from the COVID-19-led economic downturn. Turning to Slide 9. Let's start with our generation segment. Early in the first quarter, Vistra's exceptional commercial team read the tea leaves early on and executed a few opportunistic commercial transactions in anticipation of some of the market volatility we are now seeing materialize. These transactions resulted in a positive benefit to Vistra in the first quarter. In addition, our commercial and generation teams were able to dispatch our Permian Basin CTs in the first quarter to capture high prices in the West zone, resulting from low gas prices and local congestion. These actions put Vistra ahead of our financial plan for the quarter, contributing to a positive variance to our original 2020 guidance range for our commercial segments, which we depict in more detail on our guidance walk forward on Slide 11. For the balance of the year, Vistra is approximately 99% hedged from direct commodity price risk exposure, limiting the impact of changes in price levels to our 2020 financial results. Vistra's primary exposure to commodity price movements for the balance of the year is to the ERCOT summer, where we typically retain some generation length in order to protect from the downside risk of being caught short on a volatile summer day. As has always been the case, we continue to expect we will be able to manage this commodity price risk within our guidance range, particularly as we value this open position at well below market forward prices for planning and guidance purposes. And while we do expect lower peak demand in 2020 as compared to ERCOT's latest estimate published in its biannual supply demand forecast, called the Capacity, Demand and Reserve or CDR report in December 2019, we have already accounted for this anticipated lower demand and its expected impact on summer power prices in today's guidance reaffirmation. We continue to believe weather will be a critical variable, driving the incidence of scarcity pricing intervals this summer.  As we saw during the summer of 2019, low wind or high temperatures have the potential to drive scarcity pricing, and this impact could be even more pronounced in 2020 now that the Operating Reserve Demand Curve or ORDC has shifted by another quarter of a standard deviation. As you may recall, the ORDC is an administrative construct designed to provide additional revenues to the market as real-time operating reserves diminished to scarcity levels. Importantly, while we are observing decreased demand across all markets, residential demand is coming in slightly higher than weather-normalized expectations. And residential demand is both relatively inelastic and more sensitive to temperature swings due to increased air conditioning load, especially as more people are working from home. In short, even if lower business demand brings down the ERCOT peak in 2020, higher residential load on a hot summer day in Texas could still result in scarcity pricing intervals.  And we estimate that it could take only two degrees of the increased summer temperatures to offset the lower demand impact from COVID-19. As usual, ERCOT summer will continue to be a critical driver of Vistra's financial results for the year. However, we believe our guidance is conservative as we have already embedded risk from lower demand or mild weather in our financial guidance. Let's turn our attention now to our retail segment. I'm on Slide 10. We do expect that lower demand across our markets will have certain negative impacts on our retail segment's results for the year. Specifically, we are anticipating higher bad debt expense in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 driven financial distress among some of our customers. This risk of higher bad debt expense resides primarily in our ERCOT portfolio as in markets outside of Texas, the local utility generally controls the bill and assumes the customer selection risk. In ERCOT, the Public Utility Commission of Texas recognized that the retail electricity providers could be unduly harmed by continuing to supply power to customers who cannot pay their electric bills due to unemployment or lower income and enacted a COVID-19 Electricity Relief Program in response. This program includes, among other things, a mechanism for retail electric providers to recover $0.04 a kilowatt hour for nonpayment by a qualifying set of customers in exchange for not disconnecting these customers. While the program applies only to a limited set of customers that must go through a number of steps to qualify, we expect it will provide meaningful mitigation to what would otherwise have been even higher bad debt expense in 2020. Next, we similarly expect our retail segment will be negatively impacted by lower volumes, including lower recovery of fixed capacity costs on our Midwest and Northeast large business portfolio, and lower margins driven by reduced consumption across our business customer classes. We expect these negative variances to be partially offset by higher residential volumes among our existing customers. We are more focused than ever on maintaining superior customer service levels during this pandemic. Our customers depend on us to keep their lights on and to power their daily lives. Recognizing that some of our customers will find themselves in financial distress as a result of the COVID-19, we have already instituted programs to waive late fees, extend payment dates and provide payment planned alternatives. We are continuing to offer bill payment assistance through our partner, TXU Energy Aid, which uses donations from customers, employees and other Texans to help around 20,000 families keep their lights on each year. Our commitment to our customers is as high of a priority as ensuring the safety of our people. As we turn now to Slide 11, you can see all of the variables we just discussed accounted for in our 2020 guidance walk forward table. While we are reaffirming our 2020 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance ranges today, there are some puts and takes that get us there, primarily, our above plan performance in the first quarter of 2020, offset by anticipated COVID-19 impacts. Specifically, we expect our generation segment to be up approximately $60 million with some potential for upside as compared to our initial guidance forecast as a result of the opportunistic hedging and generation dispatch activities we executed in the first quarter, which I just discussed, as well as lower fuel expense, partially offset by the potential for lower power prices driven by covenant. We expect this positive variance in our generation segment to be potentially offset by a $60 million negative variance in our retail segment as compared to our initial guidance forecast. This forecasted retail variance is comprised of an expected $10 million benefit from lower costs and an accelerated capture of synergies from our Ambit and Crius acquisitions, offset by $70 million of expected headwinds related to COVID-19. These COVID-19 headwinds reflect an estimated $40 million increase in our bad debt expense for 2020, as well as an estimated $30 million driven by lower volumes in our business segments, partially offset by expected higher volumes from our residential retail customers. In total, we had a strong first quarter, and we are tracking strong for the full year with the expectation that our 2020 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA will be well within the range of the $3.285 billion to $3.585 billion, which is yet another example of the resiliency of the integrated model. We are also reaffirming our ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range of $2.16 billion to $2.46 billion. Now that we have covered 2020, let's turn the discussion toward the potential impacts COVID-19 could have on future market environments. Despite what is, on its face, a dampening market effect of lower demand from COVID-19 that we expect to continue into 2021, albeit at a lower level, the economic slowdown could have some ancillary impacts that are constructive to market dynamics. Starting with ERCOT, which is a market with relatively tight supply-demand fundamentals, we are already seeing evidence that renewable development is slowing for projects that were slated to come online in 2021 and beyond. ERCOT, as an energy-only market, was already difficult for market developers to secure merchant project financing. The uncertainty that has been created by the COVID-19-led economic recession is exacerbating this challenge.  We have received calls from a number of developers seeking to sell the development rights to their projects for very nominal fees given a lack of confidence these projects will be able to advance in today's environment. We are also observing that the appetite to execute power purchase agreements has decreased among investment-grade off-takers. As these entities begin to meet their goals or refine their programs so that their projects are located near their actual load as opposed to serving as virtual offsets. As a result, we estimate the 2021 supply estimates in ERCOT's December 2019 CDR report are almost 2.5x what we believe will be feasible to develop in this environment. If we do, in fact, see renewable development slow, this will be a meaningful offset to any decreases in peak demand that could flow through to 2021. As a result, ERCOT reserve margins could be very tight when demand growth returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. Similarly, the decreased oil drilling activity we are observing is reducing the supply of associated gas, making us somewhat bullish on natural gas prices in 2021 and beyond. Higher natural gas prices could further push up the price of power in the markets where we operate. With these factors as a backdrop, combined with the relative resiliency we're observing in Texas demand, we continue to like our position in the ERCOT market. Moving on to PJM and ISO New England markets, we similarly expect COVID-19 to have an impact on the supply side of the equation, both as it relates to the likelihood of new thermal development as well as the potential for incremental retirements. On the new development side, in our view, market economics did not support new thermal development prior to the COVID-19-related demand declines, and the current forward outlook is even less supportive of new build. As a result, we would not expect any new thermal development in either PJM or ISO New England in this environment. Further, we could see incremental retirements of higher heat rate or higher cost assets as the energy markets are challenged by lower demand expectations. The recent capacity auction clear in ISO New England and the uncertainty related to the upcoming capacity auction in PJM are not helpful for development and also present challenges for inefficient existing generation. Taking all of these factors into account, we expect we could see a range of outcomes in our 2021 financial results with the midpoint shifting somewhat lower. As we describe on Slide 13, many uncertainties remain, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19-led economic downturn, which makes predicting a likely outcome for 2021 even more challenging. Prior to COVID-19, our fundamental point of view suggested 2021 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA could track in line with or potentially higher than 2020 expected results. As of April 30, we are now 57% hedged in ERCOT and approximately 60% to 70% hedged in all other markets, which helps to limit the range of outcomes we expect to see next year. In order to balance risk with potential upside, we are continuing to opportunistically hedge, albeit at lower than previously expected power prices. Even with this incremental hedging activity, however, given the distribution of potential outcomes, we still expect there is a meaningful chance that 2021 guidance could be flat to 2020 guidance midpoint. Just looking at forward curves as of March 31, 2020, which already reflected a level of uncertainty around COVID-19 impact, which suggests 2021 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA would be approximately $200 million to $250 million lower than our 2020 guidance midpoint or about a 6% to 7% reduction. As we have seen, however, ERCOT forward curves have shifted upward in the back half of each of the past three years as the curve begins to reflect fundamentals and becomes more liquid. We believe there is still a possibility we could once again see this play out for the 2021 forward curve this fall. So the probability is likely lower due to the COVID-19 related uncertainty. In addition to looking at current forward curves, we also modeled fundamental supply and demand drivers in a number of economic downturn scenarios in order to better inform our views on the potential range of outcomes for 2021 financial results. Over the past two months, ERCOT's peak load has trended in the range of 2% below expectations. As the Texas economy begins to reopen, we may see this gap start to narrow. However, given the risk of slower economic recovery, our review of downturn scenarios included two consecutive years of peak demand trends below ERCOT's most recent forecast in its CDR report.  On the supply side, the current environment has clearly impacted the prospects for new generation investments. Nevertheless, in an effort to be conservative when testing the potential risk to our 2021 results or downturn scenarios, assume that the majority of the projected supply additions from the CDR will come online despite the historical trend of the CDR significantly overstating new supply additions as its purpose is not as a forecast tool, but as a representation of new generation in the development pipeline that have met certain criteria. As a result of our analysis of these fundamental drivers, we currently estimate that even in our most punitive downside case that holds supply constant to pre-COVID-19 levels and demand growth to 1/4 of the pre-COVID estimates from 2019 to 2021, 2021 results would still be within 10% of our 2020 guidance midpoint. And with so many different variables influencing the range of potential outcomes, we still think there is a meaningful possibility we can achieve flat EBITDA from 2020 to 2021. Importantly, this means that even in our most punitive modeled case, we still expect we will be able to deliver approximately $3.1 billion or more of adjusted EBITDA from our ongoing operations in 2021. With an expected 65% to 70% free cash flow conversion ratio, this would translate to more than $2 billion of adjusted free cash flow before growth, meaning that even in a recession created by an extremely low probability pandemic tail event, we expect to maintain very strong liquidity. And we expect we will have significant free cash flow to return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I suspect not many businesses today can say this. The market appears to be discounting our relative resilience. Even more than before, we believe the recent decline in our stock is unwarranted. In our view, Vistra should have been a stock investors fled to for relative safety in these economically uncertain times, and yet our stock has continued to trade with a free cash flow yield in the range of 20% to 30%. It is frustrating to say the least. The fundamentals of our business are strong. We supply an essential product and our low-cost, low-debt integrated business model comprised of leading retail businesses and advantage-generating assets is designed to manage risk and mitigate volatility. Our robust free cash flow should enable us to both reinvest in the business at modest levels while returning a significant amount of capital to investors. However, we are keeping the faith that as we pay down our debt and announce our capital allocation plans in 2020, we will be on the path to reach our fair and full value. As always, we will keep our eye on the ball of execution and continue to prove out this thesis. I will now turn the call over to David Campbell. So it does help. I mean, if they did not put the program in place, I think our view is, Shahriar, that it would have been carnage. No doubt about it. But to be clear about it, what's happening is there's -- what is being recovered by retailers is the energy component or the generation component and the T&D component, the margin that retailers typically get is not embedded in that. So while it's helpful for some of them, some of the retailers that are smaller, not as well capitalized, maybe not as sophisticated from a risk management standpoint, there's still risk and there continues to be, in our view, significant risk going into the summer months. And given the situation, it may be harder also for them to hedge and post collateral. So I do believe that there is still some risk to retailers in this market, and we've seen a little bit of that. Whether that turns into some kind of an opportunity, we'll see. But there is certainly some movement of foot by some retailers given that this isn't exactly everything that a retailer would have wanted in this situation. The other part of this is, is that the margin that is being forgone, you can collect on afterwards. But this is a customer class that is very difficult and will be difficult to collect on. So the ability for the retailer to actually try to claw back, if you will, that lost margin is going to be extremely difficult. So we'll see whether something comes out of this or not, that's certainly something that we are keeping an eye out for. But it's hard to predict at this point in time. I think we're still comfortable, Shahriar, really, with the roughly a quarter of our free cash flow on an annual basis, although it's going to be a bit lumpy, just depends on opportunities and depends more importantly on the economics of any deal that we might want to get into or a project we might want to do. But we still think that quarter of our free cash flow a year, it seems reasonable. I think in September, we're going to put a little more meat on that bone, both the growth side of it, but also, I think, put more detail around what the 3/4 is, which I think is the most important part of our capital allocation plan. And I think September will be a big time period for that.  And then the other thing, I think in September, is that we got some things that we want to talk about in terms of our overall portfolio positioning as a company, our asset mix and how we're going about sort of the future. But I think all of that's going to happen. We're only now -- it seems like years away, but we're only five months away now from that happening. This is the point in time that I've been waiting for since I've been here, to get to the point where we can actually be at a steady state. Yes. Well, what I understand is that -- and I think S&P made some comments to this effect. But I think it slipped a little bit, Shahriar, because what I heard is that S&P is probably going to wait to see how the year turns out to move us another notch. And then I expect them to it -- to be at least a year and probably a little bit more. So I think we've slipped a little bit on the IG. But my own view is exactly yours, which is, I think when the dust settles, I actually don't think this is going to end up being a negative period of time, but actually a highly positive period of time. And the agencies are going to look at this and say, in what is I don't think anybody can argue that this is not a tail event. This is a truly a tail event, probably as bad or as close to as bad as the great depression in terms of what it's doing to unemployment. And they're going to have to step back and look at that. It's not like just a normal run-of-the-mill recession here. And just the resilience of our business model what I believe, and I think this is incredibly important for our company, is that the business risk that has been ascribed to this sector for so long because of the poor execution, the bad strategies, I think when they look at this model and the execution that we put forward, that it's actually going to end up being a positive in the long run. So I still have some hope that by the end of year '21, we could get to investment grade. But I actually believe based on comments that I have heard, we may have slipped a little bit. All right. Thanks, Shar. You, too, Stephen. Hi. Well, I think there was a number of implications that we were trying to get across. I think one of them was that we just think the growth in renewables, in particular in ERCOT, may have slowed down a bit. But I will tell you that when we stressed to get to that within 10% in 2021, we really didn't cut back the amount of renewables that we had previously thought we're going to come in back when we gave guidance, back in November time frame. So in my view, it's a bit punitive, but we wanted to stress the system a little bit. So I think that's one point. In terms of the point that you're making, I think we have some ideas about what we would like to do around renewables. And I don't know that this has really changed it much. We still have a strong cash flow that if we want to do some projects, we're going to follow through. I think you saw that we increased the battery opportunity out at our Oakland site. I think there may be some other opportunities at our Moss Landing site. And then, certainly some potential opportunities in ERCOT. And so I don't know, really, Stephen, I don't think it's changed our view. I think the difference is, is that we have the ability to do the things we want to do, whereas some people, I think, it's going to be more difficult just because it's difficult to attract the capital to support their plans. The developers are having more difficulty. And we know that because they're approaching us, for us to take over their projects and then pay them a small nominal fee to take them over. So I think there is an opportunity there and that we're working on that opportunity, whereas maybe there's some good projects that may come to market at a relatively cheap price, and we'll take a look at that and add that to our backlog. We don't talk much about just the amount of projects we have around renewables, in particular in Texas, but we also have them in other states. Of course, we have the coal to solar, thing going on in Illinois. But this company has a fairly deep backlog of opportunities to invest in renewables. But we're going to be deliberate about it, and we're looking for those kind of opportunities that offer the kind of returns that we expect, that sort of 500 to 600 basis points above cost of equity. And we have some of those, and we'll talk more about that in September. Yes. Since I'm not in the same room with everybody, I'll ask David if he has that. But between David Campbell and Jim Burke, we probably have two folks that can put a little more detail to that. So David, do you want to start? And then, Jim, if you have anything to say, please jump in. And Stephen, one other thing I'll mention at this point, I think we've tried to be pretty conservative. We're only at the beginning of May here. And we typically aren't going to change guidance this early in the year, especially given just how important the ERCOT summer is and how volatile it can be. But there were words in my script and there were words in David's and then also on these slides about tracking strong and that we're well within the range. And what that really means is, I think we've been conservative on our estimates for 2020, and we feel very good, very good about the midpoint and we think there's some potential for upside. But we want to be cautious about that. I think what will be a better indicator is when we get into the second and certainly, the third quarter earnings calls, when we have a better insight as to what the summer and ERCOT is going to look like. But from where we stand today, even with COVID-19, 2020, it looks to be a pretty strong year if we can execute the way we believe we can. Yes, that's a very good question, Steve. Look, I think the simple way to think about this, and of course I've got a -- we've got a whole session coming up in July with our Board, so I really don't like to get out in front of them but I'll explain it this way. We've dedicated 2020 to pay down debt, and we're going to do that. And that's a bit of a sacrifice to also returning some money to our shareholders, which we would like to do, especially in this environment, but we also had to balance those priorities. And I think what you can expect from us in September is a capital allocation plan that is focused on returning capital to shareholders and reinvesting in our business. And given that it appears that things may be pushed out a little bit and the fact that we've never started this venture to get to investment grade, that was an outcome that kind of came up, that we're not going to chase things around.  We are going to get to where we think the capital structure of this company leaves us in a position to be as strong as possible. And we just so happen believe -- to believe that with our business risk, which we are demonstrating is quite solid through all this and just the metrics themselves, they speak for themselves. And we still have to make a jump to BB+ with S&P, and so we want to get to that next. And then we'll get into dialogue with them about what it's going to take to get to investment grade. But I think the focus for us in September is going to be squarely around the two big buckets that I just talked about, reinvestment in the company and some opportunities that we have -- that we think are quite good. But more importantly, the big 3 quarters of our free cash flow talking to our investors about returning that in some form or fashion. And it's not rocket science, it will be a mix of what do we do with our dividend and what do we do with potential -- probably potential share repurchases. So that's -- and we'll see where we're trading, obviously, and all that will go into it. But I suspect that will be the two big buckets. And I think there's also some other details we're going to get into on that call as well that I think are important for people, about what's the long-term focus of our company and how we think about managing our portfolio of assets for the future. So a lot going to be packed into that. I think we want to get through the summer, see how things go and then we're ready to go in September. But that's how we're thinking about it. Boy, I'd tell you, I have a hard time predicting what is going to come out of that CDR because it's not all that difficult for people to get projects to the point where it shows up in the CDR. And as you know, there's no economic overlay. And I think even ERCOT has tried to distance themselves from this being something to use for forecasting purposes. So it's hard to say. I do think there may be some pullback, Steve, but I also believe what's likely going to happen is it may be deferral more than it is anything actually leaving. And so you may see more kind of like it did last year when everything got pushed from '20 into '21, and there was a big bucket of projects that showed up there. And then, I think that you may see some get deferred even again. But I wouldn't be surprised, honestly, that people were still working -- developers are working on projects and getting them in the queue, interconnection queue and that more may show up. For me, it's less about that. We have a development team on the ground, we know this market very well. And it's more about what we're seeing in terms of real activity on the ground and getting equipment, signing contracts, getting financing. And that's where we're seeing things really pull back. And I think the other area where we've seen pretty big pullback is just the support on the PPA side. And that we have yet to see -- for example, on solar, we have yet to see a merchant solar plant get financing in the ERCOT market. It's just really difficult with an all-energy market to do that. And so without a PPA behind these, it just makes it more and more difficult. And we've seen that PPA market slowed down quite a bit. So even though the CDR could be a wildcard in all this, and I know that we're going to have to deal with whatever comes out of that, for us, it's more about what's really going on, on the ground. And for me, that's why our team is constantly not just looking to develop things, but also to try to get intelligence about what else is going on. Thank you, Steve. Yeah. Yeah. And Julien, I'm going to take that as being largely focused on ERCOT, is that correct? Yes. Well, look, I mean -- so 2020 -- actually, what we've seen is that from where our fundamental view is, 20 -- 2021 summer pricing in ERCOT, which is really always the big ticket for us, that will really end up being the swing that will either get us to flat or something less than that. Those prices have come off pretty hard over the last few weeks, and that's liquidity. It's a whole bunch of different reasons why that has come off. We don't believe it's fundamentally driven. And so it will really depend on kind of how quickly we come out of this -- the COVID-19 event and how quick the recovery is. And so that's why we're being a bit cautious in trying to draw distribution around the outcomes.  But if we were -- if we saw pricing up near where our fundamental view is, we would be very much closer to a flat year-over-year. If prices stay where they are now, they'd be more like in the -- what we had talked about in the presentation, that $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion. So it just really depends on where ERCOT pricing comes out. And I think on the retail side, the numbers that year-over-year, from '20 to '21 are not that big in terms of our retail outlook that, that's really the swing factor. It's really going to end up being summer ERCOT pricing that will end up being the big ticket item. In the other markets, it's really not -- they're not that big of a player in this either. So I think if you really draw a circle around it, it's really going to end up being where does the summer '21 in ERCOT come out. And we see a distribution around that and still a fairly good chance that you could see a pretty strong year, especially if the development that we talked about doesn't come to fruition and the economy in Texas recovers quickly, which could happen. You could really see another tight situation in ERCOT.  And then we're talking about a very different set of numbers, probably something more closer to flat year-over-year relative to our guidance in 2020. But if we see a more prolonged effect from the COVID-19 virus and prices stay a little more depressed going into the summer, weather doesn't show up, then you could be on the lower end, that kind of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion range. And David, I don't know if you want to add anything on that or not. Okay. Yes. David, do you want to take that one? Yes. So look, I mean we look at -- we balance that. So the priority for us is obviously, to use capital efficiently. But at the same time, you've got to balance that a little bit in terms of growing the company over time. And -- because we are a going concern and buying back our shares. But we do an economic analysis, it's very simple. The real key, Julien, you know this, is what share price do you assume when you do the economics of buying back your own shares? And that is a really -- that's an art more than a science. So we look at a variety of share prices when you look at the return that you get for buying back your own shares, and we don't just look at one price, and we try to be realistic about it.  And we have to look at that over a period of time. And so depending on how long the period of time is, that dilutes the return on buying back shares. But we try to balance that, and we try to -- if we're going to invest in our company, we want to -- back into our company, we want to make sure that those returns also stand up to buy -- the alternative of buying back our shares. And I'm pretty happy to say that when we have done that, the returns have been definitely in the range of what we thought the value of buying back our shares has been and we're going to continue to do that kind of analysis, knowing that we also have to balance that we have to -- we're going to have to invest in our company. Our company is going to -- we're going to see coal plants retire. We've already been very straightforward on that front. We'd like to replace economically, obviously, the EBITDA from that, and we'd like to grow our EBITDA. At the same time, we know our stock is cheap. And so it's a balancing effect. There's no simple formula to it. But we do, do the math that you would expect us to do to try to see the relative returns of investing back in the business and investing in buying back our shares. Well, once again, I want to thank everybody for being on the call. I hope everybody stays safe and healthy in this difficult time. I can't tell you enough how we appreciate your interest in our company, given the extraordinary COVID-19 virus. We're excited about our company, and we're excited about the months coming ahead. And until next time, please be safe and be healthy."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, Vice President, Investor Relations and Sustainability. Please go ahead.\nMeagan Horn: Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast discussing fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are copies of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-K and the related press release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Burke, President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, today's press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you, Meagan, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra. 2021 was undoubtedly a challenging year and, in many ways, a pivotal one for Vistra. We were faced with an unprecedented weather event at the beginning of the year with Winter Storm Uri, and the financial strength we worked so hard to put in place was challenged. Yet sitting here today, I'm proud of how our team came together to not only confront and mitigate the impact, but to then shift to building a stronger company. That strong balance sheet we built and the resilience of our team helped us stabilize the company and ultimately get back on track within months. Importantly, we accomplished what we set out to do following Uri. We shifted our strategic direction and implemented an enhanced comprehensive capital allocation plan with substantial share repurchases, a new dividend policy and an acceleration of our Vistra Zero portfolio, all while derisking our company after Uri. We believe we exited the year in a position of strength. And we are excited about our competitive positioning and the long-term value creation opportunity ahead. I'd like to now turn to Slide 6 to begin the presentation to discuss the key takeaways from our 2021 performance. We delivered on our adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations guidance we issued in November which notably was an increased and narrowed range from what we had announced in April. After immediately stabilizing our company after Uri, we conducted a thorough review of our business, announcing a capital allocation plan that returns billions of capital to shareholders, enables us to cost effectively fund the development of Vistra Zero and maintains a strong capital structure by continuing to pay down debt. We also made significant progress in establishing ourselves as a leader in ESG and the clean energy transition with our Vistra Zero carbon-free generation portfolio, and our efforts regarding DEI and sustainability, including enhanced disclosures. In fact, in December, we issued the first ever green U.S. corporate perpetual preferred stock that funds our development and growth of Vistra Zero. We haven't emphasized this in a while, but we continued our OPI savings, realizing $500 million of such savings in 2021 from our generation segments. OPI is now part of our DNA, with continuous idea generation and conversion of ideas to executable opportunities on a regular basis. And our retail business rose to the challenge as well. We grew our ERCOT residential accounts by approximately 23,000 customers, the highest organic growth we've seen since 2008. Most of this growth was within our flagship retail brand TXU Energy, demonstrating the strength of our brand promise and continued importance to our customers. In all, we ended the year back strong again and look forward to building on that momentum through the execution of our four strategic priorities, which we will discuss in more detail a bit later. Before I get to that, I would like to turn to Slide 7 to discuss our 2021 performance in a little more detail. When the dust settled right after Uri, we were facing an adjusted EBITDA picture of right around $1.2 billion. I recall thinking that this is not the way that 2021 is going to end. We've got to put this company on a positive path and improve this picture. We instituted at a stretch target of $500 million in self-help and, in fact, achieved the target coming in at $546 million. At the same time, we were very active in the Texas 2021 legislative and regulatory deliberations regarding Uri, which, among other accomplishments, resulted in Vistra being allocated $544 million in ERCOT securitization payments. I want to thank those in the State of Texas that had to deal with the fallout of Uri for their efforts and specifically securitization for their courage and foresight. The self-help and securitization efforts resulted in improvement following Uri of over $1 billion and significantly contributed to improving that initial picture that I mentioned earlier. In November, we issued refined guidance that increased and narrowed our adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations estimates we had issued in April, and we delivered at the midpoint of that November guidance at $1.994 billion prior to taking into account an opportunity we had to settle some Uri-related retail bill credit liabilities. Specifically, at the end of the year, we settled a block of these bill credits for $53 million prior to their expected settles in 2022 and 2023, all with internal rates of return ranging from 20% to over 40% and an average of more than 30%. So while it did decrease our final adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations for 2021, we expect the high IRR settlements will positively impact us in 2022 and 2023. Our adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations was $179 million for the year, which is within the guidance range we offered in November, and excluding the early retail bill credit settlements that I just talked about, it would be over the midpoint at $232 million. Today, we are also reaffirming our 2022 guidance. We see some headwinds and tailwinds, as is normal, in the coming months. And though the upcoming summer months will be critical to our performance, we continue to anticipate that 2022 will be consistent with our previous statements of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $3 billion or more. We are not establishing guidance beyond 2022, but our long-term view of Vistra's earnings power remains consistent with our previous views. Our generation and retail performance outlook is strong. And as we always have, we will capitalize on opportunities to not only lock in adjusted EBITDA through hedging activities, but also incrementally add value through commercial optimization. The net of this activity, we believe, will be in the $3 billion plus adjusted EBITDA range. In addition, we are positioned to grow from this level as investments in our Vistra Zero generation fleet become operational, which we will discuss in more detail shortly. This is all and despite the retirement of significant coal generation. Turning now to Slide 8. In November, we announced four strategic priorities: return capital to our shareholders, accelerate investment in our zero carbon generation growth through an appropriate capital structure, continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver long-term sustainable value. We delivered squarely on each of these priorities by year-end 2021 and are poised to continue delivering in the years ahead. First, we returned $290 million of capital to our shareholders via dividends in 2021 and have instituted our new $300 million dividend policy for 2022. We front-end loaded our share repurchases and spent $764 million of the $2 billion share buyback program as of February 22, 2022. The combination of the new dividend program and share repurchases has yielded an approximately 13% increase in declared dividends in Q1 2022 as compared to Q1 2021 and, as we continue to buy back shares, will lead to further increases on a per share basis. We are also well on the way to deliver the $7.5 billion of shareholder capital return by year-end 2026. Finally, later this year, we expect to be in a position to announce the next phase of our share repurchase program after we complete the $2 billion program by the end of this year. As long as our stock has the kind of free cash flow yield that it does currently, we will be buying our shares. Second, we executed on our goal to further finance and grow our leading Vistra Zero portfolio. In December, we issued an upsized $1 billion in Green Perpetual Preferred Stock. Proceeds from this issuance will be used to fund Vistra Zero's growth while allowing us to retain full control of the business. We expect that these proceeds will also offset the once anticipated $500 million per year equity contribution to Vistra Zero, freeing up that capital to be allocated to further execute on our share repurchase program. We expect Vistra Zero to be further financed, as needed, with project free cash flows and project level financing. Third, we also continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We reduced debt in the fourth quarter of 2021 by approximately $625 million and are on a pace to reduce total debt, exclusive of Vistra Zero project financing, by $1.5 billion by year-end 2022. We've increased liquidity year-over-year by $180 million and further strengthened our balance sheet with cost-effective preferred stock of $2 billion and a $1 billion commodity link revolver that will help provide incremental liquidity for cash postings under various of our commodity contracts when power prices are high. With these endeavors and the planned activities in 2022, we expect our balance sheet to be back into the pre-Uri range by year-end 2022. We continue to believe a strong balance sheet is essential to managing the risk of the company and creating long-term equity value. Finally, we continue to pursue long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. I already mentioned the $500 million OPI value enhancements, which leads to a core set of generation that is highly efficient and necessary for the long-term grid reliability. You are beginning to see large asset managers essentially recognize the need for natural gas in the transition to net zero several years out. We possess a low-cost fleet of gas field generation that is likely to be needed for many years to come. Our retail segment saw significant organic customer growth and we continue to implement derisking activities, including our expenditures to further harden our generation fleet in ERCOT. Specifically, in 2021, we invested approximately $50 million and we'll invest another $30 million in 2022, further derisking our ERCOT fleet. We installed dual fuel capabilities at plants where it was economic and prudent and added on-site and off-site fuel storage. We also revised our commodity hedging approach and carried extra length heading into the winter months of 2022. We've taken these precautions at a relatively low cost to guard against a severe financial impact in the event of a storm similar to Uri. And while the recent weather events in February 2022 in Texas were certainly not Uri-like events, they have given us valuable insights into how our preparations would fare in a repeat situation. We are pleased to report that our fleet has performed exceptionally well with no weather-related outages. Moving on now to Slide 9. We know there is quite a bit of interest in our Vistra Zero growth pipeline. This visual shows you by state the projects and megawatts in the pipeline. We forecast that approximately 5,000 megawatts of projects will generate highly contracted revenue, resulting in approximately $450 million to $500 million of adjusted EBITDA annually. This is in addition to our nuclear plant Comanche Peak at 300 megawatts. All in, Vistra Zero is expected to be in the range of at least 7,300 megawatts of carbon-free generation by 2026. We have a clear line of sight to our project pipeline, as demonstrated by our recently announced Moss Landing expansion by another 350 megawatts, our acquisition of the 110 megawatt Angus solar development in Texas and our 450-megawatt coal-to-solar initiative in Illinois. That's a total of 900 megawatts of planned renewable developments announced in the past five months. And we expect to bring on three projects in ERCOT in the very near future, 260 megawatts of storage at DeCordova, plus 158 megawatts at Brightside and Emerald Grove. It is important to note that we continue to believe in the strength and growth opportunities at Vistra Zero despite the recent unplanned outages we have experienced at our Moss Landing 300 and 100 battery storage sites. We are committed to helping California and the country, as a whole, transition to cleaner sourced electricity and batteries will undoubtedly play an important role. This is a new technology and it will continue to improve. These incidents give us and the industry important insights as we move the country forward in the energy transition. Notably, we believe the issue has not stemmed from the batteries, but instead appears to be related to failures in the water-based safety system. Our investigations have revealed that the safety system is working. It's just experiencing leaks. We will do what it takes to fix this issue quickly, get the systems back online as soon as practical. And as always, we will do it all with safety as our number one priority. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jim Burke to discuss our financial results in more detail. Jim?\nJim Burke: Thank you, Curt. Turning now to Slide 11. Vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of approximately $1.2 billion, which is $363 million higher than 2020. Retail is approximately $526 million higher than Q4 2020, primarily driven by our accrual of the expected $544 million of securitization proceeds. The favorability was partially offset by mild weather. Period-over-period, the collected generation segments ended the quarter $163 million lower than fourth quarter 2020, driven primarily by lower realized margin in ERCOT and our Sunset segments. Adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations was $1.941 billion for 2021 after subtracting the favorable bill credit settlement cost. Year-over-year, the retail segment was $329 million higher than 2020, driven primarily by our self-help initiatives, partially offset by net Winter Storm Uri impacts and milder weather in ERCOT. The generation segment year-over-year was $2.15 billion lower than 2020, driven primarily by the Winter Storm Uri losses. While 2021 was significantly impacted by Winter Storm Uri, we believe we are back on track with 2022 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations guided to a midpoint of approximately $3 billion. I'm turning now to Slide 12, which provides a more detailed breakdown of our 2021 execution on the announced capital allocation plan. We executed on our $2 billion share buyback plan with a total of $764 million of buybacks occurring through February 22, 2022. This leaves just over $1.2 billion remaining of buybacks to be completed by year-end 2022. We remain confident that we will achieve this goal. With those buybacks through February 22, we have 448.8 million shares that remain outstanding, representing an approximately 7% reduction in share count or approximately 35 million shares since our last reported share count in the third quarter of 2021 10-Q. We continue to believe that buying back our shares will create a better supply and demand balance, generating a share price more reflective of what we believe to be our true value. Reducing our share count should also result in an increased dividend yield to our shareholders as we execute upon our announced plan to deliver $300 million in annual dividends to our common shareholders through 2026. In keeping with this plan, on February 23, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of our common stock, approximately a 13% increase over our 2021 first quarter dividend amount. The $0.17 per share amount reflects an estimated $75 million of dividend payouts this quarter. The common dividend will be paid on March 31, 2022, to shareholders of record as of March 22, 2022. The Board of Directors also declared a dividend on the company's 8% Series A fixed rate reset cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred stock of $40 per preferred share payable on April 15th to preferred holders of record on April 1st. In accordance with our announced capital allocation plan, we also eliminated approximately $625 million of debt in the fourth quarter of 2021 and are on track to reach our goal of $1.5 billion debt reduction by year-end 2022, exclusive of project level financing incurred in Vistra Zero. Finally, we previously announced our commitment to allocate capital to attractive strategic growth opportunities. We are executing on this commitment as we pursue the Vistra Zero portfolio. Vistra Zero's expected EBITDA of $450 million to $500 million per year from the 5 gigawatts of storage and renewables projects by 2026 is the type of investment that makes sense financially and is a key component to our portfolio transition. We are excited to be a leader in the energy transition taking shape across our nation. We saw that excitement echoed in the market when our Green Perpetual Preferred Stock issuance was upsized from $750 million to $1 billion while still locking in the low dividend at 7%. Even better, we learned that green-focused accounts drove nearly 25% of the total green perpetual preferred stock allocations and 4 of the top 10 holders were green-focused accounts. In closing, we continue to believe that our execution of this capital allocation plan will continue to unlock the value of Vistra as we return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while transitioning our asset base. We look forward to updating you on our achievements as we execute throughout 2022. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nCurt Morgan: Hi, good morning, Stephen.\nStephen Byrd: So I wanted to start with a fairly high-level question on private market appetite for assets and for cash flows. Now this is a topic that I know you all think about a lot over time, but the \u2013 I guess, our sense is the private market has a very strong bid for assets with strong cash flows. You all obviously have very strong cash flows. Those buyers also might have a different point of view on leverage. And I just \u2013 I see this large disconnect that's been around for quite some time in terms of the kinds of valuations and cash flows that the private market would be willing to accept versus where the public market is pricing your stock. And then you're taking great steps to take advantage of that, you have a lot of capital flexibility, but there seems to be this persistent disconnect between the private and public market. And I'm just curious to get your latest thoughts on that disconnect. Are there ways to take advantage of that? What's your latest thinking there?\nCurt Morgan: Well, I think, you outlined the things from a private market perspective that would be attractive about a company like ours, right? So I can't argue with those attributes because I believe they exist. I think I've said this before that we're a big-sized company in terms of a private market transaction. I was with a private equity firm, they have their own set of issues with their LPs in terms of what they can invest in. And they're getting the same pressures on ESG as anybody else. So I think the long-term valuation question that comes up with companies like ours and other fossil fuel-oriented companies, even though we're shifting, tend to come up in a private market setting as they do in a public market setting. Having said that, I think the investments we're making would be attractive on a private market basis. So look, I think we should be attractive, both in public markets and in private markets. I get the point that you make, that this company could be suitable to being in the private markets. And I think there are attributes that make us attractive. So I can't argue with that. Other than that, I can't say anything more than that because there's nothing really to say. I think you're right about that, Stephen.\nStephen Byrd: Understood. And are there ways beyond, obviously, just at the corporate level, more at the asset level, where you could optimize, find ways to essentially bring cash back at yields that are essentially lower than the stock overall to take advantage of this dynamic?\nCurt Morgan: There could be, yes. We, at time to time, have looked at that and we did not see what we thought were accretive transactions. But yes, there are opportunities and could be opportunities like that, and that's something that we look at on an ongoing basis. So if there is an opportunity like that, we'd be interested in it. And so, it's one of the things that we look at.\nStephen Byrd: Understood. Just one last one for me. Just on storage, you gave a good update there. I was just curious in terms of just next steps in resolution of determining liability. Who's liable for the damages? Are you optimistic about sort of recovery of costs that you've incurred there? Could you just speak a little bit more to kind of next steps there on the storage operational issues?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. So look, I mean, here's the reality. We have warranties with our contractors and equipment suppliers and we have insurance. There are deductibles with the insurance. But we do \u2013 one way or another, we feel like we are covered in this from a cost standpoint. The area where it gets gray sometimes is when you want to improve the current situation, which we are undoubtedly going to want to do. And then there's a question about who pays for those improvements and we'll sort through that. I think the biggest thing we're doing now is we're focused with our contractors and equipment manufacturers to work together because this is bigger than just Vistra or bigger than any one contractor or manufacturer. This is about the long-term transition in the energy sector and batteries have to work. And these two facilities are critical to the summer and beyond. And so I think what we're trying to do is keep this in a situation where we're working together and we're not splintered. And I think once you start going to battle stations on this, then it creates even more issues. I think there's a way to do this in partnership with the folks that worked with us on bringing these two facilities up, and that's what we're going to do. But I think at the end of the day, Stephen, that we have warranties and we have insurance. And we believe that, ultimately, the lion's share of the cost of this are going to be borne by others, but I'll just say that this company is committed to bringing these facilities back online. The good news in my mind is it's not huge money to really fix these the way that they need to be fixed. We're talking about basically the transportation and storage of water and then the release of water into each individual battery module. That should be able to be done in every building and every manufacturing facility in this country and in the world. There are water-based fire suppression systems that do that very thing. And it's frustrating to me that we could not put a system in place that work. These were turnkey deals, we expected the engineering to be right and we're going to get it right. And I think we can do it relatively quickly, and we will get this done right. So we'll sort out the rest of it, but we do have the things in place that you would expect us to, to make sure that we're covered from a cost standpoint.\nStephen Byrd: Really clear and very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Yes. Good morning. Hi, Curt.\nCurt Morgan: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Just on that topic on the Moss Landing issues. The two units have different EPC contractors. So I guess, is it more the actual equipment not kind of working as supposed to or design or not clear?\nCurt Morgan: It's \u2013 look, I got to be careful about because we're still going through all this. I think, Steve, there's a little bit of difference, we believe, in what happened at Moss Landing 300 in the initial phase versus Moss Landing 100. And there are subtleties to all of this. But I think that you hit the areas that we're focused on. It's whether the parts, some of the parts that were part of the water-based heat suppression system were either not installed correctly and/or they had a defect to them or that the design of the overall system needs to be improved. And I think there's \u2013 frankly, Steve, there's an element to all of that. And that's what makes it a little complicated in sorting all this out. And I'm just being as honest as I can be about it that, that's what we \u2013 we'll end up sorting out in the long run. And I think we've made a lot of progress on it. I think we were making a lot of progress on Moss 300 until 100 happen. And that opened up some additional learnings that we are taking into account. And I think we'll take all of those together and come up with the right game plan for both 300 and 100 to get this right. But there are elements of each of the things you mentioned, Steve, in both the Moss 300 and the Moss 100 situation, but they're a little bit different for each one, and that's about all I can say about it.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And a separate topic, just commodity exposure overall, could you just maybe give a sense of kind of how to think? Obviously, commodities are moving around a decent amount. How to think about kind of your position 2022, but maybe more importantly, 2023/2024 to kind of come up \u2013 I know you gave your hedging, but just maybe kind of frame it broadly on how to think about it.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. So in 2022, we're pretty hedged. So probably not a lot to talk about. Although we are carrying a little more length going into this summer than what we would normally carry. I think that most of the markets we're in, the price of power is set in many hours by a natural gas unit. So we effectively are long natural gas equivalents as a company. But we also have, obviously, a big short position on, which is our retail business. But we're net long. And I think in 2023 and beyond, we have length, gas length. And it feels to me, I'm not particularly good at predicting commodities, but we're in it. And I think we know it pretty well. But it does feel like we're in a period where natural gas, in particular, is probably going to be set at a little bit higher level than the old $2.50 to $3. It's feeling more to me like $3.50 to $4 or more. You're seeing that U.S. gas is being connected to worldwide gas. We've got geopolitical issues and those are likely to persist for some time, with Russian gas into Europe, China has a big appetite as well as the rest of Asia. And so gas is beginning to trade on a global basis. And it feels like whether it's artificial or not, there's tightness in that system on a worldwide basis which is probably going to mean in the next few years, potentially several years, that we're just at a little higher plateau for gas. That in the long run, is good for our company, given that we are long natural gas equivalent. So I think we're positioned well. The real key though is for us to manage the volatility and to take advantage of it. Because I do believe that regardless of where it settles, the one thing we can pretty much bet on is that it's going to be volatile just given the geopolitical issues that persist in the world. I think our team is up to that challenge and can take advantage of that. Volatility is something that if you're good at it, you can benefit from it. And I think we're in a good position to do that. I don't know if \u2013 Jim is on, too. I don't know if he has anything he wants to add to that.\nJim Burke: Yes, sure, Curt. Hi Steve, I would only add that as we put out our guidance last fall, we have certainly seen commodity complex move up considerably. We see it particularly even outside of ERCOT. Spark spreads are up $3 to $5. We are largely open to that, particularly when you get to 2023 and 2024. We're less than 20% hedged out in that 2024 and beyond time frame, and you see us more hedged in 2023. We just put that hedge disclosure out. Still just about 25% hedged to spark out in 2023. So it's nice to see the diversification of the portfolio where, at times, we've seen ERCOT run, but not the other areas. Now we're seeing some of the other areas really have some swing up and we have good opportunities to capture that. And as Curt mentioned, we'll get through the summer, and we'll come out with our guidance for 2023. And we'll hopefully give some view as to how the out years look, but it's been a favorable move overall over the complex since we put out the guidance last fall.\nCurt Morgan: Steve, one other thing just to tell you is that while we've seen forwards move, the liquidity in the markets has been limited. And that's because I think the markets are \u2013 the bid and the ask are trying to figure out where this thing is going to settle out and whether some of these geopolitical issues are long-lived or short-lived. And so it takes some time and patience to manage in this type of an environment, and you have to pick and choose the right time to do it. And just \u2013 it's not a cautionary note, but more of just a factual one, that the liquidity in the markets has been somewhat limited just because buyers and sellers are trying to sort out whether these are long-term moves or not. Again, if you're in the market every day and you're patient and you take it as it comes, you can take advantage of this. And I think that's what we're trying to do.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Last quick question, just on the pace of the buyback. Should we assume if the stock stays in this rough area that you're going to continue an aggressive pace? Or do you think you'll kind of more average it out over the rest of the period?\nCurt Morgan: Well, go ahead.\nJim Burke: I'm sorry. We've made the commitment, obviously, we've made the commitment to continue down this buyback to be able to deliver the $2 billion buyback by the end of the year. We've made I think tremendous progress so far, Steve. And I think, hopefully, these disclosures, which come out periodically, folks saw it with the dividend increase of approximately 13%, obviously being reflective of how aggressive we've been on the buybacks. But since we're just a little over 1/3 of the way through that program, we've got a good ways to go through the end of this year, but we feel very good about it. And then we've announced, as we've said before, we intend to do another $1 billion in 2023. So I think the program has been well executed up to this point, and we're going to continue to be aggressive through the balance of the year.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thank you.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Thanks Steve.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the opportunity.\nCurt Morgan: Hey, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Do you hear me?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Can you hear us?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Absolutely. Thank you so much. Curt, if I could go back, we were talking a lot about Vistra Zero a couple of questions ago. But of the $450 million to $500 million, how much of this EBITDA is effectively locked in, if you will, right? Can you talk about the cadence of this EBITDA materializing? You've obviously had great success already. How much of this effectively have you sort of captured? How much of it is \"yet to go?\" And effectively, how much of this eventually comes from California given your perhaps disproportionate successes in that geography. Do you guys hear me? Excuse me.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Sorry, I was talking, Julien, and I had it on mute. So I think we said that both Illinois and California that the underlying revenue streams and EBITDA were about sort of 50% contracted based on the constructs in both of those. They're different constructs, but they ended up coming out about the same, a little bit over that. In Texas, we will contract essentially 100% of those with our \u2013 likely with our retail business. And so if you just look at Vista Zero on an isolated basis \u2013 and then on a megawatt basis, we're probably looking at maybe half coming out of Texas or so. And so that pushes you into kind of the, I'd say, 2/3 contracted, something like that, just in pure math. And so I'd say that's about what it is. And then, of course, we will try to hedge as we go on further. Jim, anything you want to add to that? But that's the quick math in my head tells me that we'll be somewhere in that range, just given the way that we are contracted both in California and Illinois, how we expect the contract in fact.\nJim Burke: Curt, that's correct. And Julien, we put out announcements. What we've tried to do is give the five-year view which we did in the fall, and then we want to keep filling that in so that we can talk to our investors in the market about how are we progressing. So we announced \u2013 since the fall, we had announced the fact that we had completed this Illinois coal to solar through the legislative activities, that's progressing well. We'll be going to the procurement of the REC contract here shortly, the Angus solar facility and then the Moss 350 which would be the third phase of Moss Landing. All of that, that 900 megawatts there, is going towards that 5 gigawatts. But then importantly, we've got three projects coming online right now. We've got Brightside at 50 megawatts, Emerald Grove, 108 megawatts, Grove solar facilities in Texas and then a DeCordova energy store will be on the spring 260 megawatts. That's the unique hybrid project where we paired the combustion turbine with the one hour battery, incredibly flexible, instant ramp but with 24/7 duration, if needed. Those are all coming online now, and that's part of what we want to do is keep bringing the awareness that this is real. It's coming online, and we're going to continue to roll out the announcements, both when we secure the projects and have the contracts to back them, but also as they come online physically.\nCurt Morgan: Julien, sorry, but these are 10- to 15- to 20-year type contracts, just to remind you that there's a mix of that. But go ahead, sorry.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. No, no, please. I mean on the $450 million to $500 million though, so what's the cadence? How quickly does that ramp, right? So how do you think about the EBITDA profile in say, 2023, 2024, 2025 in the interim? And when I said locked in, what I was trying to get at, is how much of a line of sight do you have on that EBITDA already versus having to win contracts still in California? I.e., is there upside in that $450 million to $500 million? Maybe even said differently.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. I'd say \u2013 go ahead, Jim.\nJim Burke: In the earnings deck, I do think you can get a view, Curt covered the map of the U.S. And what we've done here is put the items that are basically inked and ready to go, we've itemized. And then the other items where we've left the queue, where we said, here's what we have line of sight to but don't have a contract to back in California, that was just over a gigawatt of storage capabilities. And then in Texas, we have 1.3 gigs of other opportunities. Some of those we do have within our portfolio. We're just not ready to announce those yet. So of the five gigs, roughly 2.5 to three, what we would say, line of sight secured. And then the rest, we're going to continue to develop over the next couple of years and feel confident that by the 2026 time frame, we can at least have accomplished this level of development.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Yes, at least. And just separately, but in parallel with this, I mean, I do want to touch on the strategic aspect here. I mean you guys have substantial plants that are retiring. These have existing latent transmission interconnect, right? So you've got a leg up, shall we say, on independent renewable developers. And in this environment in which so many developers are struggling to get that interconnect, can you speak to your ability to monetize and effectively capitalize on your existing position on the grid from a transmission perspective? It seems like you're doing so already, but again I'd love to hear that from an even more holistic perspective beyond just the narrow context of the plants that you talked about.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. So look, I mean, it's been why we have been able to build this, in my opinion, why we've been able to build this business. Because it's all started, frankly, with California and with that Moss Landing site, which, if anybody has ever been out there, it's a world-class industrial site in the state that doesn't have many of those. So there's a scarcity value to that site. There's a scarcity value to our Oakland site as well as our Morro Bay site, all of which have transmission yards right next to them and access to transmission. And then if you think about it, we've got the same type of situation in Texas. We have multiple sites that were either purchased many years ago to put a power plant on that never happened, but have access to transmission because the site \u2013 the reason we bought the sites is because of their proximity to transmission or they already had a transmission interconnect. And of course, the nine sites in Illinois all have transmission interconnect. In fact, the transmission system was built around those assets. We also have the two sites \u2013 at least the two sites in Ohio, the two coal sites that we think ultimately will be available to us for batteries and solar. Same thing is we've got an opportunity at our NEPCO site that came from Dynegy in Pennsylvania. So there's a number of opportunities \u2013 and transmission, you're right about this. I mean, we're seeing that PJM is struggling to keep up with transmission interconnect. We know that MISO is because we're working with those guys as well. And so having that access and in particular that proximity, because there's also a cost in many of those markets to interconnect, and if it's significant, it can weigh down the economics of any particular project. And if you're right next the transmission, because that site was obviously used previously by a power plant, it just changes the game. So I think it's something that we started doing. I'm not going to \u2013 it was because we had a good site and PG&E knew it and they came to us. But it's something that we can replicate across the country with the sites that we have as we retire plants. We can add batteries and battery storage and solar. We would do win too if it was the right economic decision, it just hasn't been that way.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. I will leave it there. Thank you guys.\nCurt Morgan: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nShahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.\nCurt Morgan: Hey, Shahriar.\nShahriar Pourreza: Just, you guys, I think you've hit the EBITDA question pretty well. But just given sort of the strong start, you have visibility, you guys are fairly hedged. Any thoughts on narrowing the 22 range in 2Q versus the traditional 3Q time frame following some visibility in June, July? I mean the range remained somewhat wide and you guys do have a lot of good visibility. So just some thoughts there.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Look, I think we'll take a look at it around second quarter, because we will have July pretty much in the bucket. But August is the biggest month for us in the summer. And because we've carried more length going into the summer and the winter months, that is what creates the wider distribution. But I think \u2013 look, I think we always look at it. And if we feel like we have a high degree of confidence one way or another, we would come to the market with that. But because August is such a big month, and in Texas, September \u2013 the first part of September can always be a game changer, we've been hesitant really, Shahriar, to come out and change that until we got into the third quarter call. And in fact, from a retail perspective, the shoulder months are really what are key, and that can be months like October. So that's why we've been a little more hesitant to change. But because we did widen the guidance, I think we'll take a look at it. I just think it's going to be \u2013 come down to confidence. And because we're carrying a little bit more length, we may be less apt to do that, but we'll see.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Got it. And I know, Curt [ph] it's minor, but it looks like year-over-year customer losses in the Eastern markets kind of continued for another quarter. Can you just maybe touch on what you're seeing in this segment in terms of attrition. Just the ability to add new customers. It seems like Texas is doing well. But any color there would be helpful.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Look, I mean, we'll call a spade here. I mean, Crius has been \u2013 we've struggled, and it's because it was a predominantly door-to-door channel. And door-to-door has suffered because of COVID. You can't go knocking on people's doors with COVID. So we have pivoted to digital offering, but it's been a struggle. The other thing is, is that the standard service offers were hedged out and we've seen power prices go up. And so what's happened is there's been a squeeze on margin. And people also, because the standard service offers have been lower than where market is from some of the retail providers like us, they've moved over to standard offer. That's going to change as those standard offers roll off and there'll be an opportunity. And we're also beginning to get back out on the door to door, but we're also strengthening our other channels. So I think over time, we think we can build back what we've lost, but it's an unfortunate thing that would happen with COVID, and it disproportionately affected Crius because of the door-to-door nature of that channel. But we think we can build it back over time. And Scott Hudson, who's on this call with us is \u2013 he and his team have a good plan to do that and it's going to take time, Shahriar. It's not an overnight thing. We think we can do it. The good news is Ambit has been particularly good in Texas. And we've also sort of moved into more of a value offering rather than just an offering on price. We've been successful with that. Our consultants are doing a really good job in that particular channel. And so we're very happy with the Ambit acquisition, in particular, in the ERCOT market in Texas. Crius has struggled some. Overall, though still both very good acquisitions and we think in the long run were the right things to do. And Texas just overall, in particular with TXU Energy, when we went through Uri and some other things, that flight to quality was big. And obviously, TXU Energy was part of that flight to quality and so we grew customers in a significant way. 23,000 customers in a year for us is a big deal down in ERCOT, because as you know, we had typically lost a slight amount of customers in the last few years. But we've been able to turn that tide around and add customers. So that's kind of the lay of the land for retail.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then just literally one last question. I know you're getting this a lot on the private side, single asset, whole company, whatever. But just \u2013 and it makes sense, given where valuations are. But I just want to confirm something, maybe just round out exactly what the key message is, is this an exercise you even looked at? I mean has there been serious considerations internally around this path or at this juncture when you're looking at sort of the visibility, you're looking at the clean energy, the transitioning. It's just the plan is too cemented to even give it a serious consideration. So if you could just round out everything and just give us a sense on whether you can kick the tires around there.\nCurt Morgan: Well, look, here's \u2013 what I'll say about that is after Uri, Shahriar, regardless of what we determined about why it happened, you can't ignore the fact that it happened. And so the Board and the management team went to work. And so we looked at a very broad set of actions that we should consider in the wake of that event. And I'll just say that everything got looked at and looked at seriously. And so I think the Board, along with the management team, are \u2013 and I know this is going to sound cliche, but I just honestly believe, because I was in the middle of this, we were focused on what we thought was going to bring the most value to the table. The one thing we control, obviously, is our strategy and our capital allocation plan, and we believe we did the right thing around that. Whether there's somebody out there someday that would pay more than what we think that strategy is worth, we're way open-minded on that. And we are flexible in terms of that. Because that's our job at the end of the day, is to get the most value for the company. But in terms of just actively going out and pitching that, we look at that relative to other opportunities. And that's all I can say about it. I just can't get into in more detail. But we are open-minded people and our job is to maximize the value of this company for our current shareholders. And I can guarantee you that's what we're trying to do.\nShahriar Pourreza: Perfect. Thank you for that. I just to want to hit that and concluded. I appreciate it. Thank you guys.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys.\nCurt Morgan: Hey, Jonathan. How are you?\nJonathan Arnold: Good. Thank you. Just want to be sure I understand, on the dividend, Curt, your intention is to run at this $75 million per quarter level but declare it on a per share basis each quarter so we could see multiple changes during the year? Or is it set now for the whole of 2022? I want to make sure I got that right.\nCurt Morgan: No. Yes, I'll let Jim \u2013 Jim can take you through it. Because we looked at a couple of different options and made a call. But Jim, do you want to take them through the details?\nJim Burke: Sure. Yes, hey Jonathan. We think one of the benefits of this strategy is, as we continue to buy back shares throughout the year, it will constantly change the denominator as we go. So for this quarter, when we announced the dividend, we set the x dividend date from March 21 and the record date for March 22. We had to estimate how many shares do we think will be outstanding by that point in time because we're going to continue to buy back shares. And then that's how we set the dividend rate at $0.17. And then we're going to come back in the next quarter and we'll do the same thing. So you should expect to see, as long as we're consistently out in the marketplace buying back our stock, you would expect to see that increase each quarter as we go. And that gives the investor obviously a sense of just how much of the equity we continue to buy back, but also reward the holders that are continuing to hold the stock that they will see double-digit year-over-year increases in the dividend.\nJonathan Arnold: Great. Okay. Thank you for that. And then just on Vistra Zero and the way you intend to sort of communicate around it going forward. Do you foresee this being pulled out as a separate segment or embedded within your current segments? And just I'm curious how you plan to highlight executing against the EBITDA target.\nCurt Morgan: Jim, you want to take that, too?\nJim Burke: Sure. Jonathan, as noted on this call and since we announced it last fall, there is a lot of interest in seeing the visibility into Vistra Zero. So we're looking at our segmentation across the business and analyzing the best way to bring that to light, because as folks have covered the space, they are attributing different value to different asset classes. And when we take this investment and we contract it, it becomes meaningful in the eyes of a lot of the investors that we're speaking to, that are putting these much higher multiples on that asset class relative to some of our base business. And so we will probably bring that forward, it will come shortly. I don't know if it will be at this next quarter, it could. But we are looking to bring segmentation that allows our investors to see that as it continues to grow. As you know, the rest of the business, retail is an important part of the business that folks want to continue to have visibility into. So I think it really will come down to how we think about some of our generating assets and which we see a lot of cash flow coming off these assets don't necessarily get as high a multiple as we think they deserve, but we also think that the power of the capital allocation plan is to buy back the equity, obviously continue to pay down debt, as we said, consistent with our target. But if we can bring that Vistra Zero to light, continue to do the capital allocation steps that we have outlined last fall, we think both the sum of the parts as well as just the sheer force of the capital allocation program that we have instituted, we're going to realize a better Vistra value overall.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay, great. Thank you for that. And I will leave with that.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you, Jonathan.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Curt Morgan for any closing remarks.\nCurt Morgan: Well, thanks, everybody, again for \u2013 I know it's a busy season here, obviously, when \u2013 all the earnings calls, but thanks for being on. Look, we feel like we've turned the corner here and strengthened our company. We derisked it. We've got a very good set of priorities that we're working on and a capital allocation plan that matches that. And so we think the future is bright. So thank you for your time.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Curt Morgan",
            "content": "Thank you, Meagan, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra. 2021 was undoubtedly a challenging year and, in many ways, a pivotal one for Vistra. We were faced with an unprecedented weather event at the beginning of the year with Winter Storm Uri, and the financial strength we worked so hard to put in place was challenged. Yet sitting here today, I'm proud of how our team came together to not only confront and mitigate the impact, but to then shift to building a stronger company. That strong balance sheet we built and the resilience of our team helped us stabilize the company and ultimately get back on track within months. Importantly, we accomplished what we set out to do following Uri. We shifted our strategic direction and implemented an enhanced comprehensive capital allocation plan with substantial share repurchases, a new dividend policy and an acceleration of our Vistra Zero portfolio, all while derisking our company after Uri. We believe we exited the year in a position of strength. And we are excited about our competitive positioning and the long-term value creation opportunity ahead. I'd like to now turn to Slide 6 to begin the presentation to discuss the key takeaways from our 2021 performance. We delivered on our adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations guidance we issued in November which notably was an increased and narrowed range from what we had announced in April. After immediately stabilizing our company after Uri, we conducted a thorough review of our business, announcing a capital allocation plan that returns billions of capital to shareholders, enables us to cost effectively fund the development of Vistra Zero and maintains a strong capital structure by continuing to pay down debt. We also made significant progress in establishing ourselves as a leader in ESG and the clean energy transition with our Vistra Zero carbon-free generation portfolio, and our efforts regarding DEI and sustainability, including enhanced disclosures. In fact, in December, we issued the first ever green U.S. corporate perpetual preferred stock that funds our development and growth of Vistra Zero. We haven't emphasized this in a while, but we continued our OPI savings, realizing $500 million of such savings in 2021 from our generation segments. OPI is now part of our DNA, with continuous idea generation and conversion of ideas to executable opportunities on a regular basis. And our retail business rose to the challenge as well. We grew our ERCOT residential accounts by approximately 23,000 customers, the highest organic growth we've seen since 2008. Most of this growth was within our flagship retail brand TXU Energy, demonstrating the strength of our brand promise and continued importance to our customers. In all, we ended the year back strong again and look forward to building on that momentum through the execution of our four strategic priorities, which we will discuss in more detail a bit later. Before I get to that, I would like to turn to Slide 7 to discuss our 2021 performance in a little more detail. When the dust settled right after Uri, we were facing an adjusted EBITDA picture of right around $1.2 billion. I recall thinking that this is not the way that 2021 is going to end. We've got to put this company on a positive path and improve this picture. We instituted at a stretch target of $500 million in self-help and, in fact, achieved the target coming in at $546 million. At the same time, we were very active in the Texas 2021 legislative and regulatory deliberations regarding Uri, which, among other accomplishments, resulted in Vistra being allocated $544 million in ERCOT securitization payments. I want to thank those in the State of Texas that had to deal with the fallout of Uri for their efforts and specifically securitization for their courage and foresight. The self-help and securitization efforts resulted in improvement following Uri of over $1 billion and significantly contributed to improving that initial picture that I mentioned earlier. In November, we issued refined guidance that increased and narrowed our adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations estimates we had issued in April, and we delivered at the midpoint of that November guidance at $1.994 billion prior to taking into account an opportunity we had to settle some Uri-related retail bill credit liabilities. Specifically, at the end of the year, we settled a block of these bill credits for $53 million prior to their expected settles in 2022 and 2023, all with internal rates of return ranging from 20% to over 40% and an average of more than 30%. So while it did decrease our final adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations for 2021, we expect the high IRR settlements will positively impact us in 2022 and 2023. Our adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations was $179 million for the year, which is within the guidance range we offered in November, and excluding the early retail bill credit settlements that I just talked about, it would be over the midpoint at $232 million. Today, we are also reaffirming our 2022 guidance. We see some headwinds and tailwinds, as is normal, in the coming months. And though the upcoming summer months will be critical to our performance, we continue to anticipate that 2022 will be consistent with our previous statements of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $3 billion or more. We are not establishing guidance beyond 2022, but our long-term view of Vistra's earnings power remains consistent with our previous views. Our generation and retail performance outlook is strong. And as we always have, we will capitalize on opportunities to not only lock in adjusted EBITDA through hedging activities, but also incrementally add value through commercial optimization. The net of this activity, we believe, will be in the $3 billion plus adjusted EBITDA range. In addition, we are positioned to grow from this level as investments in our Vistra Zero generation fleet become operational, which we will discuss in more detail shortly. This is all and despite the retirement of significant coal generation. Turning now to Slide 8. In November, we announced four strategic priorities: return capital to our shareholders, accelerate investment in our zero carbon generation growth through an appropriate capital structure, continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver long-term sustainable value. We delivered squarely on each of these priorities by year-end 2021 and are poised to continue delivering in the years ahead. First, we returned $290 million of capital to our shareholders via dividends in 2021 and have instituted our new $300 million dividend policy for 2022. We front-end loaded our share repurchases and spent $764 million of the $2 billion share buyback program as of February 22, 2022. The combination of the new dividend program and share repurchases has yielded an approximately 13% increase in declared dividends in Q1 2022 as compared to Q1 2021 and, as we continue to buy back shares, will lead to further increases on a per share basis. We are also well on the way to deliver the $7.5 billion of shareholder capital return by year-end 2026. Finally, later this year, we expect to be in a position to announce the next phase of our share repurchase program after we complete the $2 billion program by the end of this year. As long as our stock has the kind of free cash flow yield that it does currently, we will be buying our shares. Second, we executed on our goal to further finance and grow our leading Vistra Zero portfolio. In December, we issued an upsized $1 billion in Green Perpetual Preferred Stock. Proceeds from this issuance will be used to fund Vistra Zero's growth while allowing us to retain full control of the business. We expect that these proceeds will also offset the once anticipated $500 million per year equity contribution to Vistra Zero, freeing up that capital to be allocated to further execute on our share repurchase program. We expect Vistra Zero to be further financed, as needed, with project free cash flows and project level financing. Third, we also continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We reduced debt in the fourth quarter of 2021 by approximately $625 million and are on a pace to reduce total debt, exclusive of Vistra Zero project financing, by $1.5 billion by year-end 2022. We've increased liquidity year-over-year by $180 million and further strengthened our balance sheet with cost-effective preferred stock of $2 billion and a $1 billion commodity link revolver that will help provide incremental liquidity for cash postings under various of our commodity contracts when power prices are high. With these endeavors and the planned activities in 2022, we expect our balance sheet to be back into the pre-Uri range by year-end 2022. We continue to believe a strong balance sheet is essential to managing the risk of the company and creating long-term equity value. Finally, we continue to pursue long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. I already mentioned the $500 million OPI value enhancements, which leads to a core set of generation that is highly efficient and necessary for the long-term grid reliability. You are beginning to see large asset managers essentially recognize the need for natural gas in the transition to net zero several years out. We possess a low-cost fleet of gas field generation that is likely to be needed for many years to come. Our retail segment saw significant organic customer growth and we continue to implement derisking activities, including our expenditures to further harden our generation fleet in ERCOT. Specifically, in 2021, we invested approximately $50 million and we'll invest another $30 million in 2022, further derisking our ERCOT fleet. We installed dual fuel capabilities at plants where it was economic and prudent and added on-site and off-site fuel storage. We also revised our commodity hedging approach and carried extra length heading into the winter months of 2022. We've taken these precautions at a relatively low cost to guard against a severe financial impact in the event of a storm similar to Uri. And while the recent weather events in February 2022 in Texas were certainly not Uri-like events, they have given us valuable insights into how our preparations would fare in a repeat situation. We are pleased to report that our fleet has performed exceptionally well with no weather-related outages. Moving on now to Slide 9. We know there is quite a bit of interest in our Vistra Zero growth pipeline. This visual shows you by state the projects and megawatts in the pipeline. We forecast that approximately 5,000 megawatts of projects will generate highly contracted revenue, resulting in approximately $450 million to $500 million of adjusted EBITDA annually. This is in addition to our nuclear plant Comanche Peak at 300 megawatts. All in, Vistra Zero is expected to be in the range of at least 7,300 megawatts of carbon-free generation by 2026. We have a clear line of sight to our project pipeline, as demonstrated by our recently announced Moss Landing expansion by another 350 megawatts, our acquisition of the 110 megawatt Angus solar development in Texas and our 450-megawatt coal-to-solar initiative in Illinois. That's a total of 900 megawatts of planned renewable developments announced in the past five months. And we expect to bring on three projects in ERCOT in the very near future, 260 megawatts of storage at DeCordova, plus 158 megawatts at Brightside and Emerald Grove. It is important to note that we continue to believe in the strength and growth opportunities at Vistra Zero despite the recent unplanned outages we have experienced at our Moss Landing 300 and 100 battery storage sites. We are committed to helping California and the country, as a whole, transition to cleaner sourced electricity and batteries will undoubtedly play an important role. This is a new technology and it will continue to improve. These incidents give us and the industry important insights as we move the country forward in the energy transition. Notably, we believe the issue has not stemmed from the batteries, but instead appears to be related to failures in the water-based safety system. Our investigations have revealed that the safety system is working. It's just experiencing leaks. We will do what it takes to fix this issue quickly, get the systems back online as soon as practical. And as always, we will do it all with safety as our number one priority. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jim Burke to discuss our financial results in more detail. Jim? Hi, good morning, Stephen. Well, I think, you outlined the things from a private market perspective that would be attractive about a company like ours, right? So I can't argue with those attributes because I believe they exist. I think I've said this before that we're a big-sized company in terms of a private market transaction. I was with a private equity firm, they have their own set of issues with their LPs in terms of what they can invest in. And they're getting the same pressures on ESG as anybody else. So I think the long-term valuation question that comes up with companies like ours and other fossil fuel-oriented companies, even though we're shifting, tend to come up in a private market setting as they do in a public market setting. Having said that, I think the investments we're making would be attractive on a private market basis. So look, I think we should be attractive, both in public markets and in private markets. I get the point that you make, that this company could be suitable to being in the private markets. And I think there are attributes that make us attractive. So I can't argue with that. Other than that, I can't say anything more than that because there's nothing really to say. I think you're right about that, Stephen. There could be, yes. We, at time to time, have looked at that and we did not see what we thought were accretive transactions. But yes, there are opportunities and could be opportunities like that, and that's something that we look at on an ongoing basis. So if there is an opportunity like that, we'd be interested in it. And so, it's one of the things that we look at. Yes. So look, I mean, here's the reality. We have warranties with our contractors and equipment suppliers and we have insurance. There are deductibles with the insurance. But we do \u2013 one way or another, we feel like we are covered in this from a cost standpoint. The area where it gets gray sometimes is when you want to improve the current situation, which we are undoubtedly going to want to do. And then there's a question about who pays for those improvements and we'll sort through that. I think the biggest thing we're doing now is we're focused with our contractors and equipment manufacturers to work together because this is bigger than just Vistra or bigger than any one contractor or manufacturer. This is about the long-term transition in the energy sector and batteries have to work. And these two facilities are critical to the summer and beyond. And so I think what we're trying to do is keep this in a situation where we're working together and we're not splintered. And I think once you start going to battle stations on this, then it creates even more issues. I think there's a way to do this in partnership with the folks that worked with us on bringing these two facilities up, and that's what we're going to do. But I think at the end of the day, Stephen, that we have warranties and we have insurance. And we believe that, ultimately, the lion's share of the cost of this are going to be borne by others, but I'll just say that this company is committed to bringing these facilities back online. The good news in my mind is it's not huge money to really fix these the way that they need to be fixed. We're talking about basically the transportation and storage of water and then the release of water into each individual battery module. That should be able to be done in every building and every manufacturing facility in this country and in the world. There are water-based fire suppression systems that do that very thing. And it's frustrating to me that we could not put a system in place that work. These were turnkey deals, we expected the engineering to be right and we're going to get it right. And I think we can do it relatively quickly, and we will get this done right. So we'll sort out the rest of it, but we do have the things in place that you would expect us to, to make sure that we're covered from a cost standpoint. Hi, Steve. It's \u2013 look, I got to be careful about because we're still going through all this. I think, Steve, there's a little bit of difference, we believe, in what happened at Moss Landing 300 in the initial phase versus Moss Landing 100. And there are subtleties to all of this. But I think that you hit the areas that we're focused on. It's whether the parts, some of the parts that were part of the water-based heat suppression system were either not installed correctly and/or they had a defect to them or that the design of the overall system needs to be improved. And I think there's \u2013 frankly, Steve, there's an element to all of that. And that's what makes it a little complicated in sorting all this out. And I'm just being as honest as I can be about it that, that's what we \u2013 we'll end up sorting out in the long run. And I think we've made a lot of progress on it. I think we were making a lot of progress on Moss 300 until 100 happen. And that opened up some additional learnings that we are taking into account. And I think we'll take all of those together and come up with the right game plan for both 300 and 100 to get this right. But there are elements of each of the things you mentioned, Steve, in both the Moss 300 and the Moss 100 situation, but they're a little bit different for each one, and that's about all I can say about it. Yes. So in 2022, we're pretty hedged. So probably not a lot to talk about. Although we are carrying a little more length going into this summer than what we would normally carry. I think that most of the markets we're in, the price of power is set in many hours by a natural gas unit. So we effectively are long natural gas equivalents as a company. But we also have, obviously, a big short position on, which is our retail business. But we're net long. And I think in 2023 and beyond, we have length, gas length. And it feels to me, I'm not particularly good at predicting commodities, but we're in it. And I think we know it pretty well. But it does feel like we're in a period where natural gas, in particular, is probably going to be set at a little bit higher level than the old $2.50 to $3. It's feeling more to me like $3.50 to $4 or more. You're seeing that U.S. gas is being connected to worldwide gas. We've got geopolitical issues and those are likely to persist for some time, with Russian gas into Europe, China has a big appetite as well as the rest of Asia. And so gas is beginning to trade on a global basis. And it feels like whether it's artificial or not, there's tightness in that system on a worldwide basis which is probably going to mean in the next few years, potentially several years, that we're just at a little higher plateau for gas. That in the long run, is good for our company, given that we are long natural gas equivalent. So I think we're positioned well. The real key though is for us to manage the volatility and to take advantage of it. Because I do believe that regardless of where it settles, the one thing we can pretty much bet on is that it's going to be volatile just given the geopolitical issues that persist in the world. I think our team is up to that challenge and can take advantage of that. Volatility is something that if you're good at it, you can benefit from it. And I think we're in a good position to do that. I don't know if \u2013 Jim is on, too. I don't know if he has anything he wants to add to that. Steve, one other thing just to tell you is that while we've seen forwards move, the liquidity in the markets has been limited. And that's because I think the markets are \u2013 the bid and the ask are trying to figure out where this thing is going to settle out and whether some of these geopolitical issues are long-lived or short-lived. And so it takes some time and patience to manage in this type of an environment, and you have to pick and choose the right time to do it. And just \u2013 it's not a cautionary note, but more of just a factual one, that the liquidity in the markets has been somewhat limited just because buyers and sellers are trying to sort out whether these are long-term moves or not. Again, if you're in the market every day and you're patient and you take it as it comes, you can take advantage of this. And I think that's what we're trying to do. Well, go ahead. Yes. Thanks Steve. Hey, Julien. Yes. Can you hear us? Yes. Sorry, I was talking, Julien, and I had it on mute. So I think we said that both Illinois and California that the underlying revenue streams and EBITDA were about sort of 50% contracted based on the constructs in both of those. They're different constructs, but they ended up coming out about the same, a little bit over that. In Texas, we will contract essentially 100% of those with our \u2013 likely with our retail business. And so if you just look at Vista Zero on an isolated basis \u2013 and then on a megawatt basis, we're probably looking at maybe half coming out of Texas or so. And so that pushes you into kind of the, I'd say, 2/3 contracted, something like that, just in pure math. And so I'd say that's about what it is. And then, of course, we will try to hedge as we go on further. Jim, anything you want to add to that? But that's the quick math in my head tells me that we'll be somewhere in that range, just given the way that we are contracted both in California and Illinois, how we expect the contract in fact. Julien, sorry, but these are 10- to 15- to 20-year type contracts, just to remind you that there's a mix of that. But go ahead, sorry. Yes. I'd say \u2013 go ahead, Jim. Yes. So look, I mean, it's been why we have been able to build this, in my opinion, why we've been able to build this business. Because it's all started, frankly, with California and with that Moss Landing site, which, if anybody has ever been out there, it's a world-class industrial site in the state that doesn't have many of those. So there's a scarcity value to that site. There's a scarcity value to our Oakland site as well as our Morro Bay site, all of which have transmission yards right next to them and access to transmission. And then if you think about it, we've got the same type of situation in Texas. We have multiple sites that were either purchased many years ago to put a power plant on that never happened, but have access to transmission because the site \u2013 the reason we bought the sites is because of their proximity to transmission or they already had a transmission interconnect. And of course, the nine sites in Illinois all have transmission interconnect. In fact, the transmission system was built around those assets. We also have the two sites \u2013 at least the two sites in Ohio, the two coal sites that we think ultimately will be available to us for batteries and solar. Same thing is we've got an opportunity at our NEPCO site that came from Dynegy in Pennsylvania. So there's a number of opportunities \u2013 and transmission, you're right about this. I mean, we're seeing that PJM is struggling to keep up with transmission interconnect. We know that MISO is because we're working with those guys as well. And so having that access and in particular that proximity, because there's also a cost in many of those markets to interconnect, and if it's significant, it can weigh down the economics of any particular project. And if you're right next the transmission, because that site was obviously used previously by a power plant, it just changes the game. So I think it's something that we started doing. I'm not going to \u2013 it was because we had a good site and PG&E knew it and they came to us. But it's something that we can replicate across the country with the sites that we have as we retire plants. We can add batteries and battery storage and solar. We would do win too if it was the right economic decision, it just hasn't been that way. Thanks. Hey, Shahriar. Yes. Look, I think we'll take a look at it around second quarter, because we will have July pretty much in the bucket. But August is the biggest month for us in the summer. And because we've carried more length going into the summer and the winter months, that is what creates the wider distribution. But I think \u2013 look, I think we always look at it. And if we feel like we have a high degree of confidence one way or another, we would come to the market with that. But because August is such a big month, and in Texas, September \u2013 the first part of September can always be a game changer, we've been hesitant really, Shahriar, to come out and change that until we got into the third quarter call. And in fact, from a retail perspective, the shoulder months are really what are key, and that can be months like October. So that's why we've been a little more hesitant to change. But because we did widen the guidance, I think we'll take a look at it. I just think it's going to be \u2013 come down to confidence. And because we're carrying a little bit more length, we may be less apt to do that, but we'll see. Yes. Look, I mean, we'll call a spade here. I mean, Crius has been \u2013 we've struggled, and it's because it was a predominantly door-to-door channel. And door-to-door has suffered because of COVID. You can't go knocking on people's doors with COVID. So we have pivoted to digital offering, but it's been a struggle. The other thing is, is that the standard service offers were hedged out and we've seen power prices go up. And so what's happened is there's been a squeeze on margin. And people also, because the standard service offers have been lower than where market is from some of the retail providers like us, they've moved over to standard offer. That's going to change as those standard offers roll off and there'll be an opportunity. And we're also beginning to get back out on the door to door, but we're also strengthening our other channels. So I think over time, we think we can build back what we've lost, but it's an unfortunate thing that would happen with COVID, and it disproportionately affected Crius because of the door-to-door nature of that channel. But we think we can build it back over time. And Scott Hudson, who's on this call with us is \u2013 he and his team have a good plan to do that and it's going to take time, Shahriar. It's not an overnight thing. We think we can do it. The good news is Ambit has been particularly good in Texas. And we've also sort of moved into more of a value offering rather than just an offering on price. We've been successful with that. Our consultants are doing a really good job in that particular channel. And so we're very happy with the Ambit acquisition, in particular, in the ERCOT market in Texas. Crius has struggled some. Overall, though still both very good acquisitions and we think in the long run were the right things to do. And Texas just overall, in particular with TXU Energy, when we went through Uri and some other things, that flight to quality was big. And obviously, TXU Energy was part of that flight to quality and so we grew customers in a significant way. 23,000 customers in a year for us is a big deal down in ERCOT, because as you know, we had typically lost a slight amount of customers in the last few years. But we've been able to turn that tide around and add customers. So that's kind of the lay of the land for retail. Well, look, here's \u2013 what I'll say about that is after Uri, Shahriar, regardless of what we determined about why it happened, you can't ignore the fact that it happened. And so the Board and the management team went to work. And so we looked at a very broad set of actions that we should consider in the wake of that event. And I'll just say that everything got looked at and looked at seriously. And so I think the Board, along with the management team, are \u2013 and I know this is going to sound cliche, but I just honestly believe, because I was in the middle of this, we were focused on what we thought was going to bring the most value to the table. The one thing we control, obviously, is our strategy and our capital allocation plan, and we believe we did the right thing around that. Whether there's somebody out there someday that would pay more than what we think that strategy is worth, we're way open-minded on that. And we are flexible in terms of that. Because that's our job at the end of the day, is to get the most value for the company. But in terms of just actively going out and pitching that, we look at that relative to other opportunities. And that's all I can say about it. I just can't get into in more detail. But we are open-minded people and our job is to maximize the value of this company for our current shareholders. And I can guarantee you that's what we're trying to do. Thank you. Hey, Jonathan. How are you? No. Yes, I'll let Jim \u2013 Jim can take you through it. Because we looked at a couple of different options and made a call. But Jim, do you want to take them through the details? Jim, you want to take that, too? Thank you, Jonathan. Well, thanks, everybody, again for \u2013 I know it's a busy season here, obviously, when \u2013 all the earnings calls, but thanks for being on. Look, we feel like we've turned the corner here and strengthened our company. We derisked it. We've got a very good set of priorities that we're working on and a capital allocation plan that matches that. And so we think the future is bright. So thank you for your time."

            "content": "Thank you, Curt. Turning now to Slide 11. Vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of approximately $1.2 billion, which is $363 million higher than 2020. Retail is approximately $526 million higher than Q4 2020, primarily driven by our accrual of the expected $544 million of securitization proceeds. The favorability was partially offset by mild weather. Period-over-period, the collected generation segments ended the quarter $163 million lower than fourth quarter 2020, driven primarily by lower realized margin in ERCOT and our Sunset segments. Adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations was $1.941 billion for 2021 after subtracting the favorable bill credit settlement cost. Year-over-year, the retail segment was $329 million higher than 2020, driven primarily by our self-help initiatives, partially offset by net Winter Storm Uri impacts and milder weather in ERCOT. The generation segment year-over-year was $2.15 billion lower than 2020, driven primarily by the Winter Storm Uri losses. While 2021 was significantly impacted by Winter Storm Uri, we believe we are back on track with 2022 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations guided to a midpoint of approximately $3 billion. I'm turning now to Slide 12, which provides a more detailed breakdown of our 2021 execution on the announced capital allocation plan. We executed on our $2 billion share buyback plan with a total of $764 million of buybacks occurring through February 22, 2022. This leaves just over $1.2 billion remaining of buybacks to be completed by year-end 2022. We remain confident that we will achieve this goal. With those buybacks through February 22, we have 448.8 million shares that remain outstanding, representing an approximately 7% reduction in share count or approximately 35 million shares since our last reported share count in the third quarter of 2021 10-Q. We continue to believe that buying back our shares will create a better supply and demand balance, generating a share price more reflective of what we believe to be our true value. Reducing our share count should also result in an increased dividend yield to our shareholders as we execute upon our announced plan to deliver $300 million in annual dividends to our common shareholders through 2026. In keeping with this plan, on February 23, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share of our common stock, approximately a 13% increase over our 2021 first quarter dividend amount. The $0.17 per share amount reflects an estimated $75 million of dividend payouts this quarter. The common dividend will be paid on March 31, 2022, to shareholders of record as of March 22, 2022. The Board of Directors also declared a dividend on the company's 8% Series A fixed rate reset cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred stock of $40 per preferred share payable on April 15th to preferred holders of record on April 1st. In accordance with our announced capital allocation plan, we also eliminated approximately $625 million of debt in the fourth quarter of 2021 and are on track to reach our goal of $1.5 billion debt reduction by year-end 2022, exclusive of project level financing incurred in Vistra Zero. Finally, we previously announced our commitment to allocate capital to attractive strategic growth opportunities. We are executing on this commitment as we pursue the Vistra Zero portfolio. Vistra Zero's expected EBITDA of $450 million to $500 million per year from the 5 gigawatts of storage and renewables projects by 2026 is the type of investment that makes sense financially and is a key component to our portfolio transition. We are excited to be a leader in the energy transition taking shape across our nation. We saw that excitement echoed in the market when our Green Perpetual Preferred Stock issuance was upsized from $750 million to $1 billion while still locking in the low dividend at 7%. Even better, we learned that green-focused accounts drove nearly 25% of the total green perpetual preferred stock allocations and 4 of the top 10 holders were green-focused accounts. In closing, we continue to believe that our execution of this capital allocation plan will continue to unlock the value of Vistra as we return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while transitioning our asset base. We look forward to updating you on our achievements as we execute throughout 2022. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions. Yes, sure, Curt. Hi Steve, I would only add that as we put out our guidance last fall, we have certainly seen commodity complex move up considerably. We see it particularly even outside of ERCOT. Spark spreads are up $3 to $5. We are largely open to that, particularly when you get to 2023 and 2024. We're less than 20% hedged out in that 2024 and beyond time frame, and you see us more hedged in 2023. We just put that hedge disclosure out. Still just about 25% hedged to spark out in 2023. So it's nice to see the diversification of the portfolio where, at times, we've seen ERCOT run, but not the other areas. Now we're seeing some of the other areas really have some swing up and we have good opportunities to capture that. And as Curt mentioned, we'll get through the summer, and we'll come out with our guidance for 2023. And we'll hopefully give some view as to how the out years look, but it's been a favorable move overall over the complex since we put out the guidance last fall. I'm sorry. We've made the commitment, obviously, we've made the commitment to continue down this buyback to be able to deliver the $2 billion buyback by the end of the year. We've made I think tremendous progress so far, Steve. And I think, hopefully, these disclosures, which come out periodically, folks saw it with the dividend increase of approximately 13%, obviously being reflective of how aggressive we've been on the buybacks. But since we're just a little over 1/3 of the way through that program, we've got a good ways to go through the end of this year, but we feel very good about it. And then we've announced, as we've said before, we intend to do another $1 billion in 2023. So I think the program has been well executed up to this point, and we're going to continue to be aggressive through the balance of the year. Curt, that's correct. And Julien, we put out announcements. What we've tried to do is give the five-year view which we did in the fall, and then we want to keep filling that in so that we can talk to our investors in the market about how are we progressing. So we announced \u2013 since the fall, we had announced the fact that we had completed this Illinois coal to solar through the legislative activities, that's progressing well. We'll be going to the procurement of the REC contract here shortly, the Angus solar facility and then the Moss 350 which would be the third phase of Moss Landing. All of that, that 900 megawatts there, is going towards that 5 gigawatts. But then importantly, we've got three projects coming online right now. We've got Brightside at 50 megawatts, Emerald Grove, 108 megawatts, Grove solar facilities in Texas and then a DeCordova energy store will be on the spring 260 megawatts. That's the unique hybrid project where we paired the combustion turbine with the one hour battery, incredibly flexible, instant ramp but with 24/7 duration, if needed. Those are all coming online now, and that's part of what we want to do is keep bringing the awareness that this is real. It's coming online, and we're going to continue to roll out the announcements, both when we secure the projects and have the contracts to back them, but also as they come online physically. In the earnings deck, I do think you can get a view, Curt covered the map of the U.S. And what we've done here is put the items that are basically inked and ready to go, we've itemized. And then the other items where we've left the queue, where we said, here's what we have line of sight to but don't have a contract to back in California, that was just over a gigawatt of storage capabilities. And then in Texas, we have 1.3 gigs of other opportunities. Some of those we do have within our portfolio. We're just not ready to announce those yet. So of the five gigs, roughly 2.5 to three, what we would say, line of sight secured. And then the rest, we're going to continue to develop over the next couple of years and feel confident that by the 2026 time frame, we can at least have accomplished this level of development. Sure. Yes, hey Jonathan. We think one of the benefits of this strategy is, as we continue to buy back shares throughout the year, it will constantly change the denominator as we go. So for this quarter, when we announced the dividend, we set the x dividend date from March 21 and the record date for March 22. We had to estimate how many shares do we think will be outstanding by that point in time because we're going to continue to buy back shares. And then that's how we set the dividend rate at $0.17. And then we're going to come back in the next quarter and we'll do the same thing. So you should expect to see, as long as we're consistently out in the marketplace buying back our stock, you would expect to see that increase each quarter as we go. And that gives the investor obviously a sense of just how much of the equity we continue to buy back, but also reward the holders that are continuing to hold the stock that they will see double-digit year-over-year increases in the dividend. Sure. Jonathan, as noted on this call and since we announced it last fall, there is a lot of interest in seeing the visibility into Vistra Zero. So we're looking at our segmentation across the business and analyzing the best way to bring that to light, because as folks have covered the space, they are attributing different value to different asset classes. And when we take this investment and we contract it, it becomes meaningful in the eyes of a lot of the investors that we're speaking to, that are putting these much higher multiples on that asset class relative to some of our base business. And so we will probably bring that forward, it will come shortly. I don't know if it will be at this next quarter, it could. But we are looking to bring segmentation that allows our investors to see that as it continues to grow. As you know, the rest of the business, retail is an important part of the business that folks want to continue to have visibility into. So I think it really will come down to how we think about some of our generating assets and which we see a lot of cash flow coming off these assets don't necessarily get as high a multiple as we think they deserve, but we also think that the power of the capital allocation plan is to buy back the equity, obviously continue to pay down debt, as we said, consistent with our target. But if we can bring that Vistra Zero to light, continue to do the capital allocation steps that we have outlined last fall, we think both the sum of the parts as well as just the sheer force of the capital allocation program that we have instituted, we're going to realize a better Vistra value overall."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Molly Sorg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.\nMolly Sorg: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Vistra\u2019s third quarter 2021 results conference call, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today\u2019s investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related press release. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Curt Morgan, Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Burke, President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today\u2019s call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today\u2019s date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, today\u2019s press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra. While we have a lot to cover today, we will do our best to be as jiffy as possible to leave sufficient time for Q&A. Not only will we be discussing our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, but we are also initiating our 2022 guidance as is customary on our third quarter results call. And most importantly, we are laying out additional details of our long-term capital allocation plan, which I\u2019m excited to share with you. So, let\u2019s get started. It\u2019s hard to believe we are still in the same year where we experienced the significant effects from Winter Storm Uri. I\u2019m proud of how our company has recovered from a business standpoint, and we are beginning to execute on our strategic priorities, which are a product of a thorough review with the Board that have begun prior to Uri but accelerated greatly immediately on the heels of the storm. We will discuss these priorities in more detail later. Consistent with the bounce-back of our business, slide 6 reports our strong third quarter financial results, despite a weak Texas summer where Vistra delivered adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1.177 billion or $1.167 billion, excluding the impacts from Winter Storm Uri realized in the third quarter, which included a small positive impact from ERCOT\u2019s 180-day resettlement statements. As of September 30th, Vistra has already achieved approximately 85% of the $500 million self-help target we announced following Uri, and all of that done without really impacting any future periods. And we have a clear line of sight to achieving the balance in the fourth quarter. The combination of our solid execution on these self-help initiatives together with the inclusion of the approximately $500 million in proceeds we expect to realize from ERCOT\u2019s securitization of certain charges allocated to load serving entities during Uri, we are in a position today to both, narrow and raise our 2021 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range as shown on the slide. The securitization and self-help materially offset the more than $2 billion loss from Uri, such as the retail bill credits we will discuss later. As you likely recall, internal and third-party analysis has shown that Vistra\u2019s Uri loss was driven predominantly by the uncontrollable failure of the Texas Intrastate gas system. We are also narrowing and revising our ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance, which is similarly reflected on slide 6. The cash flow associated with securitization is expected to be received in the first half of 2022. Consequently, the cash impact of securitization is reflected in our 2022 guidance on the next slide. So, turning to slide 7, Vistra is initiating its 2022 guidance today, forecasting ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2.81 billion to $3.31 billion, with ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in the range of $2.07 billion to $2.57 billion. This represents a free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 76%, which is higher than our historical conversion ratio due to the anticipated receipt of the securitization proceeds in the first half of 2022. On slide 7, we also offer an illustrative view of Vistra\u2019s 2022 guidance ranges, which exclude Winter Storm Uri related bill credits of approximately $185 million, and also the negative in-year impact from the execution of NPV-positive long-dated contracts with retail customers of approximately $55 million and the $500 million of securitization proceeds in free cash flow before growth only. We believe this illustrative view is the best way to think about Vistra\u2019s future financial performance potential as it demonstrates the long-term earnings power and cash generation of the business. Notably, the adverse impact from the bill credits in 2022 guidance are more than offset by the securitization included in the 2021 updated guidance. In fact, securitization will likely more than offset the retail bill credits across all years. Looking beyond 2022, Vistra\u2019s long-term view of our earnings power remains robust. The Company is less hedged in 2023 and beyond, which affords an even greater opportunity to capture momentum from the rising curves we have observed in recent months. In fact, we have seen a move up in both gas and heat rate in ERCOT as the gap between market and our fundamental view converge, which we have similarly seen in the last several years. In fact, this conversion has resulted in projected results using market curves for the next several years, in line with our stated view that we can generate consistent EBITDA of $3 billion or greater. Previously, the out years using steeply backwardated market curves were below $3 billion. This leaves us in a stronger position to optimize our EBITDA within the $3 billion or greater EBITDA range, especially as we add our growth investments. We continue to remain confident in the ability of this business to earn significant cash flow on an annual basis, and we intend to return a majority of that cash flow to our financial stakeholders in the years ahead, as I will outline on the next few slides. Slide 8 sets forth the four key priorities that our recent strategic review identified. We believe the best way to unlock the value inherent in this business and maximize value for our financial stakeholders is to drive long-term sustainable value through our integrated business model, which has been strengthened following Uri through various investments in our fleet and fuel supply as well as our enhanced risk management practices; return a significant amount of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and a meaningful dividend program, especially for as long as our stock remains at what we believe is such a meaningful discount to its fundamental value. And if our stock responds, we will continue to return that capital in the most optimal way to our shareholders. The key is that we generate substantial capital year-over-year, and we intend to return a significant amount to our shareholders. Also, we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet. And last but not least, accelerate our Vistra Zero growth pipeline with cost-effective capital. As we set forth on the next slide, our long-term capital allocation plan reflects these strategic priorities. Vistra\u2019s long-term capital allocation plan reflects an anticipated return of capital of at least $7.5 billion to its common stockholders through year-end 2026 while simultaneously reducing our corporate level -- leverage and accelerating our Vistra Zero growth pipeline. Specifically, as we announced in October, our Board recently approved a $2 billion share repurchase program which we expect to fully execute by year-end 2022. The share repurchase program is partially funded by the $1 billion of 8% preferred equity we issued last month. We then expect we will allocate approximately $1 billion per year towards share repurchases from 2023 through 2026 for a total of $6 billion in five years. And again, if our stock responds, we will reallocate those funds back to our shareholders in similar cost-effective manner. This $6 billion of return of capital represents more than 60% of our current market cap. This significant amount of capital allocated to share repurchases is evidence of both management and the Board\u2019s conviction of the long-term earnings power of the business, juxtaposed with what we believe is a significant undervaluation of our stock. We will expect we will continue to prioritize share repurchases so long as we believe our stock is undervalued. And let me tell you, in my view, we have a long way to go. We are also reinforcing our commitment to paying a meaningful and growing dividend. Rather than identifying a target annual growth rate for our dividend, management expects that it will, subject to Board approval at the appropriate time, allocate $300 million per year toward its common dividend. As we retire more and more of our shares over time, this $300 million dividend pool will be spread over fewer shares and will offer potentially outsized growth on the remaining shares. For example, if we were to execute all $6 billion worth of the share repurchases at our recent stock price, our annualized dividend per share would grow by more than 175% by year-end 2026. At our current share price, these share repurchases and dividend programs are projected to result in an annual average cash yield on the stock of an attractive 15%. As always, we are also committed to a strong balance sheet. We expect we will retire another approximately $1.5 billion of corporate level debt by the end of next year and up to $3 billion by 2026 with projections of debt-to-EBITDA in the mid to high-2s during this time frame for the Vistra base business. Per our previous comments, we expect to combine project financing with renewable-related preferred equity and cash flows from existing renewable projects to cost effectively develop our current nearly 5 gigawatt renewable and battery pipeline over the next five years using only $500 million of our own capital. And that is $500 million on a cumulative basis over the five-year period, a significantly lower estimate than our previous expectation of spending approximately $500 million per year on growth capital. These funds can now be used to support other capital allocation priorities, especially share repurchases. It is important to note that Vistra Zero will be a highly contracted business with third-party and internal PPAs. So, the leverage ratios will be commensurate with similarly situated businesses. Slide 10 outlines the sources and uses for the long-term capital allocation plan that I just laid out. Importantly, we expect we will be able to execute on this capital allocation plan by growing our Vistra Zero renewable and battery storage portfolio to a more than 5 gigawatt business, generating approximately $450 million to $500 million of adjusted EBITDA annually by year-end 2026. We are excited about this long-term capital allocation plan and believe strongly that it is the best way to maximize the value of our business as we expect we will return the majority of our free cash flow from our base business to our financial stakeholders while being mindful of our overall leverage levels and cost effectively accelerating our renewables and battery storage growth pipeline, which should ultimately be valued at a higher multiple over time. Using the midpoint of the Vistra Zero EBITDA of $475 million by 2026 and a 14 times multiple would result in a total value of $6.65 billion for these projects. As I mentioned earlier, the strategic review we undertook was thorough, evaluating multiple scenarios and potential paths to unlock shareholder value. Ultimately, we believe the path we have outlined here today will be the path that will result in the greatest financial reward over time, taking into account risk of execution, cost effectiveness and economies of scale. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jim Burke to discuss our financial results in more detail. Jim?\nJim Burke: Thank you, Curt. As shown on slide 12, Vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1.177 billion, results that are comparable to our third quarter 2020 financial results. Period-over-period, our retail segment results were $205 million higher than third quarter 2020, driven by the realization of our self-help initiatives and the lower cost of goods sold in 2021. The collective generation segment ended the quarter $211 million lower than third quarter 2020, driven primarily by the lower realized energy margin in Texas, East and Sunset after a very strong 2020. Turning now to slide 13. We wanted to briefly touch on the momentum we have seen in spark spreads across the markets where we operate. Since September, we\u2019ve seen a dramatic rise in commodity pricing across the board as gas prices, power prices and spark spreads are all climbing higher for 2022 and beyond. This is true in all the markets where we operate, though we highlight our two largest markets, ERCOT and PJM on the slide. As a general rule, Vistra is a company that benefits from higher natural gas price environments as gas units are typically the marginal units setting the price of power, leading to higher overall power prices. We expect this will benefit us in the outer years where we are less hedged. As of October 31st, Vistra is now 27% and 50% hedged in ERCOT and PJM, respectively, for 2023. We are hedged at relatively similar levels in New York, New England, CAISO and MISO as we have taken advantage of the increase in outright power prices and spark spreads over the last couple of months which are rising more in line with our fundamental point of view. We expect our commercial team will continue to take advantage of commodity pricing volatility, working to position our integrated operations to earn a relatively stable earnings profile over time. I\u2019m turning now to slide 14, which provides a more detailed breakdown of our 2022 financial guidance. We believe the illustrative guidance in the range of $3.05 billion to $3.55 billion, adding back the impact of the Uri-related bill credits and the year one impact of various NPV positive long-dated retail contracts is the best way to think about the long-term earnings power of this business. We continue to believe that Vistra will be able to convert a majority of its adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow before growth. Similarly, our guidance for ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth includes the anticipated receipt of securitization proceeds in addition to the other Uri impacts, such as bill credits. So, our illustrative guidance removes these for a more normalized view of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth. A strong conversion percentage, as shown on the slide, enables the significant return of capital that Curt discussed while also supporting a strong balance sheet and the transformation of our fleet with our Vistra Zero pipeline. Before we close this morning, I wanted to briefly address our long-term leverage target in pursuit of investment-grade credit ratings which I know has been a strategic question for many of you following Uri. Foundationally, a strong balance sheet is core to Vistra\u2019s strategy. Our low leverage level proved critical during Uri as our financial strength supported our ability to quickly add more than $2 billion of debt in response to the storm. As outlined on slide 15, we believe our current leverage in the range of approximately 3 to 3.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA is a leverage level that will afford us the same level of financial strength. We believe we will be able to maintain our leverage in this range in the near term and reach the mid to high 2s over the next five years. We also believe that we would still be a candidate for investment-grade credit ratings in the future as our corporate leverage drops below 3 times and any project financing will relate to a lower risk contracted part of the business, though, as we said recently, we believe this opportunity is at least a few years in the future. In closing, as I hope you can see from the long-term capital allocation plan we laid out today, we believe in the value of this business and our ability to generate significant free cash flow for allocation in the years ahead. By prioritizing returning the majority of our capital to our financial stakeholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet and pursuing accelerated growth of our Vistra Zero portfolio, we believe that we will unlock the value of our business over time. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Stephen Byrd at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: Hey. Good morning and congratulations on laying out a very thoughtful capital allocation approach. So, I wanted to focus on Vistra Zero and the updated guidance here. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks, it\u2019s fairly capital light from your perspective, as you mentioned, $5 billion in total capital needed, but only $500 million in net capital from Vistra net of project debt, other financing, cash flow, et cetera. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on that? I guess, I was thinking that\u2019s a fairly high level of project leverage. And we can get that typically when we have contract durations of 20, 25 years. I thought it might be more challenging to achieve that level of leverage here. And what gives you the confidence in sort of such a capital-wide approach?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. So, I\u2019ll take a first shot at that and then Jim, feel free to jump in. But -- so, I think, we\u2019re also looking at sort of what I\u2019ll call a kick-start upfront tranche of capital. We haven\u2019t determined exactly what that tranche will look like, but it will be equity like, let\u2019s put it that way. And then, when you combine that with leverage, Stephen, that\u2019s more around about 60% type leverage, project leverage with the contracted cash flows. So, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re putting 80% leverage. But I think the other thing that\u2019s missing maybe in this is the effort that we\u2019re pursuing to bring in another tranche of capital in here of some consequence. And then, when we look at the cash flows off of the business and the maintenance expense and things because it\u2019s fairly low for these types of assets, we generate enough cash, along with project financing and this project capital along with our $500 million to basically self-fund the build-out of the roughly 5 gigs through 2026. So, we have looked at this. We feel comfortable with how we\u2019re setting it up. Clearly, we would like to grow it even further than that, and I expect us to add to the pipeline, whether that\u2019s through acquiring projects or potentially even a platform. But just what is line of sight that we have already in the Q, we feel like we can raise sufficient capital, and through the cash flows, that would be more than adequate to be able to run that business. Jim, anything you want to add?\nJim Burke: Curt, you covered it well. The only thing that I would amplify is that we intend to structure the PPAs from these assets back to Vistra to create the contracted cash flows. That gives us the chance then to put 60% to 70% project debt. The balance comes from the three sources Curt mentioned, the parent contribution of less than $500 million, some form of structured financing or equity and then the cash flows from the projects themselves. And so when we think of this as a self-sustaining entity and an entity that can grow even faster than we anticipated when we announced this pipeline last summer. And so, I think it gives us a way to use more cost-effective capital and still take advantage of the opportunities, given the pipeline of great sites that we have.\nStephen Byrd: That\u2019s really helpful and makes a lot of sense. And then, just on the 5 gigawatt target by year-end 2026, could you just give us your latest thoughts on sort of visibility of growth, degree of competition, sort of how you see that sort of playing out?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Go ahead, Jim.\nJim Burke: Sure. Thanks, Curt. What we try to do here, Stephen, is focus on where we\u2019ve got a strong place to start, which is sites that we have control over. Its focus right now is primarily Texas, California and now with Coal to Solar, the Illinois fleet. We have a few opportunities at a couple of other coal plants that we intend to convert. But, this does not include -- as Curt mentioned, this does not include an expectation of prospecting for a bunch of sites we don\u2019t have control over or an M&A type platform. So, I think we\u2019ve got a really good pipeline that we can set up based on our partnerships. We\u2019ve got very good partnerships on the solar side and the EPC side and our batteries. And so, it\u2019s really just a matter of taking advantage of this methodically over the next five years. And then, in addition to that, I think there\u2019s other opportunities that Curt mentioned. But, this is our focus, not a heavy focus on PJM, and I also ISO New England at this point, those are possibilities. But, what we\u2019ve got in front of us is quite a bit.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Stephen, you know we have Moss Landing site that can take probably up to another 1,000 megawatts. We have a site called Morro Bay, which can be up to 700 megawatts. Those are both in California. We have a number of sites. We\u2019re one of the largest landholders, especially at our sites that have some of the old coal plants in Texas. We obviously know that market quite well. And we\u2019re partnering in California with the utilities there. And then, of course, we are in the Omnibus Energy Legislation in Illinois. We pursued that for three years out of thin air and raised this Coal to Solar and battery storage legislation that then was -- woven into the ultimate Omnibus bill. So, I think we came up with an idea to utilize sites that already have transmission access in many of the areas where the assets were being shut down or were already retired. And that\u2019s proven to work very well. And I think we have other opportunities down the road.\nStephen Byrd: It\u2019s a great point. I mean the site value from any of those sites in places like California, Illinois, clearly quite high. So, thanks so much for the color. I appreciate it.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nShahriar Pourreza: Just a two-part question on \u201823. Curt, you indicated you\u2019re pretty open still. Is your fundamental view for more expansion in sparks as we draw closer? And directionally, can you just also indicate where EBITDA would shake out under the current dynamic?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. For \u201823 now, you\u2019re talking about?\nShahriar Pourreza: Yes, please. Yes, yes, perfect.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. So, look, we had a period of time where sparks were compressed. They\u2019ve actually come back to what I\u2019d call a more normalized level, but there\u2019s still a fair amount of backwardation in the curve going from \u201822 to \u201823. I think our fundamental view would suggest there\u2019s still room to move with the curves relative to the fundamental view in 2023. But, the one good thing is that that -- those two curves, market and our fundamental view -- our point of view have converged significantly, and I think I made it in my remarks. But we\u2019re now seeing over the next five years, EBITDA levels that are $3 billion plus even at the curves. And prior to that, Shahriar, we were seeing -- when you marked it to the curve, below $3 billion. So, that has converged significantly. In terms of the spark spreads, there\u2019s probably some further what I\u2019ll call normalization that can occur in \u201823 on sparks. And so, yes, there could be some of that movement. But, we\u2019ve seen a pretty strong move in sparks. But, if you take a look at \u201822 sparks versus \u201823 sparks, they\u2019re still about, I\u2019m going to say, maybe about $4 difference. And we would expect that to -- that gap to close. And so, there is some upward mobility and our fundamental view shows that. In terms of directionally, \u201822 to \u201823, we always say this, but I want to be clear this time that we\u2019re within the range of being in a very similar EBITDA level on using that illustrative EBITDA number. And when I say that, that\u2019s plus or minus a couple of hundred million dollars, because an open position can go either way, depending on weather. And so, -- but we\u2019re well within the bounds of where we are in \u201822 for \u201823. And I would say, directionally, when we look at the distribution of outcomes, probably with a greater probability of upside versus downside, just knowing where the curves are, where our fundamental view is, and knowing that our commercial team is able to take advantage of when the curves are in -- are at the point of view or better. So, I feel good about 2023. I think directionally, it\u2019s in that range, and now we have to go out and execute and capture that value.\nShahriar Pourreza: Right. At least at a minimum, the reality versus your view is starting to align, which is what you\u2019ve been pitching for a while, so it\u2019s good to see that. And then, the $4 billion in additional buybacks is predicated, obviously, on your view of the stock value, right? Any guidance here on what you see, Curt, as something of a more sustainable free cash flow yield?\nCurt Morgan: Well, yes, that\u2019s -- man, that\u2019s -- I wish I had a crystal ball. But look, I think what I would hope to see, especially with this capital allocation plan and with our execution is something that is much more in the mid-teens and going down into the low double digits. I think that we certainly warrant that when -- I understand that there was a major event in February, and you know this as well as I do that any kind of return is -- part of that is the anticipated risk of the business, and I think that exposed some risk. But, I think once we show how we have invested in our business, we\u2019ve reduced the risk significantly, and we\u2019re able to execute, I would expect that risk premium to come down. And then, I also believe that people are beginning to realize that a combination of renewables, batteries and low heat rate, very efficient fossil fuel, mainly gas plants, is really going to be the right mix of assets going into the next 15 to 20 years, because you\u2019re going to need dispatchable resources for reliability purposes. The market is going to have to pay for those. Clearly, we\u2019re going to need to have clean and green resources going forward, and battery storage is going to be a big piece of that. I think that\u2019s what our company is lining up with. And then, we\u2019ve got this large retail business that I think people don\u2019t think about that we can contract much of our renewable and battery business with. That also has very consistent and significant margins, and we expect that to continue as well. So, we feel like we\u2019re lined up. If we can execute, then we would expect that the risk premium, that is a function of both, a perceived risk in the business model, which I think we are closing, but also the terminal value question, we believe that we have a company that\u2019s here for a long period of time. We should see that risk premium come down. And commensurately, we ought to see a much lower free cash flow yield, which in turn, as you know, means a higher and stronger stock price.\nShahriar Pourreza: Right. Got it. And then, just lastly for me, are you having any coal or sort of material supply challenges with the Sunset fleet?\nCurt Morgan: Yes, we are. We are. If you take 2021\u2019s outcome and you take $500 million securitization, you back it off, you\u2019ll notice that we were a little bit under and a big chunk of that, more than half of it, is the challenges we\u2019ve had at the Sunset segment, not just coal constraints, but also we\u2019ve had some outages that were this year that came about. What I would call, though, our coal constraint mainly is an opportunity loss more than anything else. And I\u2019ll tell you why. We have been prioritizing building coal inventory for the winter, because the price curves are saying that it\u2019s much more economic to run in Q1 of \u201822 than it is in Q4 of \u201821. And if you think of it, we have a finite amount of coal because of the supply constraints. We were going to have to optimize between Q4 \u201821 and Q1 of \u201822. We have opted to run a little bit less in Q4 of \u201821 to conserve and preserve the amount of coal we have so that we are going to be there for Q1 of \u201822 because the price curves are telling us that\u2019s where it\u2019s most economic, and that\u2019s what we intend to do. The other thing I\u2019ll tell you is that I\u2019m still a little bit concerned about making sure that the entire grid in Texas is weatherized, including the gas system for this particular winter. And so, we want to be very cautious. We\u2019re going to go into that carrying more length because of that, and we want to make sure that we don\u2019t have any hiccups. And then, just the broader energy commodity complex, as you know, is quite volatile. And so, because of that, we\u2019re taking a very, very conservative approach going into Q1, and that means trying to conserve some of our coal to make sure that we can run in Q1 of \u201822.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. Good morning, team. Well done, truly. Listen, I wanted to follow up, a couple of easy questions, if I can just start. First off, in terms of the buyback itself here, any thoughts about a tender versus other mechanisms to execute here? Obviously, a lot to buy at hand. And then, separately, related to your -- on the \u201823 EBITDA, just I\u2019ll throw it out there quickly, some inbound questions here. I mean, how are you thinking about that relative to \u201822 levels? I know you said it\u2019s better than 3, but what about better than \u201822, if I can ask you in that way.\nCurt Morgan: Jim, do you want to take the first one around buyback, what we\u2019re looking at around buybacks and then we can -- and then if you want to take a stab at the second one, that\u2019s fine, and I can add to it. Go ahead.\nJim Burke: Sure. Good morning, Julien. Thanks for the questions. So, on the buyback, we have -- we are looking at a number of alternatives. We have not settled on the method that we\u2019re going to use, hopefully coming out of this earnings call, we\u2019ll be very aggressive with the buyback program in order to be able to implement the $2 billion by the end of \u201822. We don\u2019t intend to telegraph how we\u2019re going to buy, when we\u2019re going to buy, but we\u2019ll report each quarter how we\u2019ve effectuated the number of shares that we\u2019ve purchased. But, it is a meaningful percentage, as you know, of what\u2019s outstanding, not only for the program through \u201822 but through \u201826. The other question, as we think about \u201823, I think as Curt, you mentioned, we have a large open position in \u201823 relative to \u201822. And that can work obviously to create an overperformance opportunity or come in slightly under, and we\u2019ve seen the curves continue to rise. And I think the commercial team has done a very nice job looking at our point of view and trying to figure out when to put the positions on to be able to manage the expectation. I think, as Curt said, \u201823 was much lower. You saw that with forward curves in the past, particularly this time last year. That gap has closed considerably. It hasn\u2019t fully closed. And then, you see that even in our charts in the slides that we presented for the spark spreads. So, we think \u201823 has a very good chance of being in line with \u201822, but there\u2019s still room. There\u2019s still room for the curves to move, and we still have a large open position. So, we\u2019ve talked about a $3-plus billion business on a run rate basis. And I think the fact is, is that there\u2019s going to be a range around these outcomes. We are in a competitive segment. We\u2019re benefited by having a large retail position that can work almost in a countercyclical manner to the wholesale position at times. But, we still have some variation around it as these -- as the markets have shown some volatility. We view that as something we can capture. So, I think looking at it more in line is where we would expect to be, but we still have a ways to go for the \u201823, given that there\u2019s still some backwardation relative to \u201822.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Got it. So, ways to go. Is it uncertainty or is it still a little bit below\u2026?\nJim Burke: Well, I think, Julien, the way I would describe it, it has -- go ahead, Curt.\nCurt Morgan: No, no, no. Go ahead, Jim. Sorry.\nJim Burke: No. I would say, you have -- if you\u2019re simply -- and this is the struggle that we talk about because we have a point of view on the business that has consistently shown that the market curves begin to approach as we get towards a prompt year. So, if all you do is look at where it curves today, and you just look at it and say, lock all that in, it\u2019s going to be lower than \u201822. I mean, that\u2019s just math. That\u2019s not how we run our business. We run our business based on where we think it makes sense to put positions on and where we think curves would likely end up, given supply-demand characteristics in the Q that comes in for new build, et cetera. And so, when we look at it over that basis, we feel that \u201823 has a very good chance to be right in line with \u201822, but that\u2019s just not where the curves are at the moment. And we don\u2019t -- that does not concern us. We\u2019ve been in the spot before. And we -- and it\u2019s happened for \u201822. It\u2019s happened in previous years. And so, we anticipate it would likely happen again in \u201823.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. So, Julien, I think that\u2019s why we say -- and we\u2019re not trying to be evasive here at all. It\u2019s just that when you\u2019re this far out and the curves are still backwardated, and we\u2019ve seen every year that when you get into the summer and come out of the summer, that the next summer and the winters tend to begin to move up, and we expect that from our fundamental view. Marking something just to a current curve will give you one result. Marketing something to our fundamental view will give you a different result. We think those -- the good news is this time around is that those two things are still within the range of \u201822 for \u201823. In the past, the curves -- and you brought this up before. In the past, the curves were well below the $3 billion mark. And now, those -- the curves in the fundamental view are -- have converged, but there\u2019s still some room to move. So, I like to think about there\u2019s a distribution around \u201823. But clearly, the \u201822 EBITDA midpoint on illustrative basis is within that distribution. And so, we think there\u2019s a good chance that we can come in around where \u201822 levels are for \u201823. That\u2019s going to come down to execution and being ready when the curves are ripe and our team, that\u2019s what we do. That\u2019s what we get paid to do. So, we feel pretty good about going into \u201822. We clearly feel good about it being $3 billion plus and being plus $3 billion. Where it will land in terms of \u201822 for \u201823, we\u2019re going to be within spitting distance of \u201823. And I think we have a good chance of hitting it, and we could actually even exceed it. So, that distribution I think is favorable. It\u2019s now about execution and getting opportunities.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Wow! Thank you, team. So much for an easy question here and certainly not evasive at all. Now, let me ask you a slightly more detailed question then. On this Vistra Zero side of the equation, you talked about $450 million to $500 million of adjusted EBITDA. How much CapEx are you thinking needs to get invested to get that outcome here? And just to be clear, it sounds like none of that would be paid at least prospectively by the corporate capital. It would all be funded with various other project and segment-specific sources as well. I know that this is an update that\u2019s coming. But it\u2019s -- I just want to make sure if I\u2019m capturing this holistically correctly.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. I think it\u2019s in the $5 billion to $5.5 billion range of total capital that would have to be invested. And you are right, the amount of equity capital that we would be putting in is relatively low, although we\u2019re putting in some -- obviously putting in some projects into that as well that have value on the market. But yes, I think it\u2019s $5 billion to $5.5 billion, if I remember right that we would have to invest. And we obviously have plans for how we would do that.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: In the contribution, principally, is just your existing storage assets, right, without being too specific?\nCurt Morgan: Well, yes, I think I mentioned it, it\u2019s Moss Landing, it\u2019s Morro Bay, it\u2019s our Oakland site in California, it\u2019s -- what is it, 9 sites in Illinois that would have batteries or something like that. It\u2019s batteries in Texas. We have one that\u2019s 265-megawatt, 1 hour battery coming on in Texas. We have a 10-megawatt already on. But that\u2019s what the battery storage picture looks like. And of course, we\u2019re predominantly a solar. On the renewable side, we have found wind to be economic. We\u2019re not an offshore wind person yet, so -- and I don\u2019t expect us to be that. But, we\u2019re not afraid of wind. It\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t found the opportunity for that. But that\u2019s -- those are the primary projects. Of course, there\u2019s a lot of solar, both in Texas and in Illinois.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Steve Fleishman at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: So, just -- want to just -- the NRG issues yesterday call, it sounds like you discussed some, but I guess also the Texas ancillary costs and coal treatment, et cetera. How do you feel like those are embedded in your outlook? And obviously, your asset position is different, but just want to kind of clarify that you\u2019re okay on those issues.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. And Jim, you can jump in after this. But -- so over half of -- well, let\u2019s just put it this way, about $40 million in \u201821 is the effect of coal constraints. And so, just -- so, we\u2019ve captured that, Steve. That\u2019s in our updated guidance, and we\u2019ve captured that. I think I mentioned, we\u2019ve decided to build inventory for Q1 because the economics are more compelling to be ready for Q1. And so, we have created this constraint in Q4 of \u201821 in favor of Q1 of \u201822. Everything -- any constraint that we have going into \u201822 is already built into our guidance. So, there\u2019s nothing more to talk about there. We expect, given what we\u2019re doing in Q4 of \u201821 in favor of Q1 of \u201822 will actually allow us to run where we want to in Q1 of \u201822. I think you know this too that some of our plants, two of them in PJM and Ohio are not on PRB. A lot of these constraints are coming out of the PRB and on the rails from the PRB. And then, of course, Oak Grove mines its own coal. So, we don\u2019t have those limitations there. And then, many of our other -- we just don\u2019t have a lot of EBITDA coming from like the Illinois plants. And so, the constraints just aren\u2019t as big for us. And I think the other thing is our team got way out in front. I mean, this came to me more than a couple of months ago that we were concerned about this. And so, we\u2019ve been managing toward that, and we\u2019ve been working with the Burlington Northern folks. I\u2019ve talked to their leadership team about getting more trains so that we can get them in and they\u2019re doing the best they can. They know it\u2019s important for this winter in Texas. So all in all, I think we really kind of took a, what I\u2019d call, a $40 million opportunity loss in Q4, but we\u2019re also going to have more inventory for Q1 of \u201822. And all of that\u2019s baked in both of our guidance ranges.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay\u2026\nJim Burke: Go ahead on the ancillaries.\nCurt Morgan: Did you ask about ancillaries, Steve? Can you hear us?\nSteve Fleishman: Yes. That was a big part of the issue they had to, yes.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. We have that. That\u2019s also -- ours is just much lower. And Jim, you might want to add to this. But our effect -- we have ancillary, the effects of ancillaries baked into our numbers. Jim, do you want to add to that, any specifics?\nJim Burke: Sure. Yes, we do. It\u2019s baked into our plan. We view the ancillary costs similar to the other costs that any retailer would face. You\u2019ve got to work it to your price, and you\u2019ve got to ultimately reflect it with the customers. We have that built into our plan for \u201822 and beyond. And of course, we do have, as you mentioned, Steve, a different position, having some generation assets as well, so. But, the integrated effect and the effect on retail is slowly reflected in our plan.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. And then, just on the renewables plan, how are you going to deal with the Texas sites in terms of -- historically, you were looking at developing those as merchants. But obviously, you can\u2019t project finance that. So, are you going to do PPAs with Vistra retail or with third parties? What\u2019s your strategy on the Texas renewals?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. It could be both, Steve. But, I think most of it, we\u2019re looking at right now, this can be different in the future is back with our retail. And that\u2019s actually -- we have an entity that lives between our wholesale and retail group that manages the supply. We call it the supply boat, but it manages supply for our retail business. And they buy and they sell to third-party retailers as well as to our own retail business. They\u2019re the one that will ultimately end up contracting and then they will then supply our retail book as well as other retailers, but that\u2019s where -- it\u2019s really sort of back-to-back with our retail arm. And so, that\u2019s where those contracts will be set up.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: I have a clarification and a follow-up. Just the $500 million prospective EBITDA from the Vistra Zero platform. Just to be clear, as you\u2019re thinking about the structured financing or equity for those projects, that ends up diluting that $500 million, right? That $500 million is the gross number than what\u2019s Vistra\u2019s share is going to be lower depending on what financing you choose. Am I thinking about the right way or no?\nCurt Morgan: You are, but let me just put it this way. We will own 100% of the common equity of this entity. So, just to be very clear about it. That capital tranche that we\u2019re looking at, we haven\u2019t decided exactly what it will look like, but we will own 100% of the common equity of that business. And so, you can sort of figure out what kind of tranches that could be. But, we\u2019re not looking to sell and partner with the equity ownership of that. I think there are other ways to do what we want to do and maintain our control. Jim, anything you want to add?\nJim Burke: Yes. Durgesh, I think the way you\u2019re thinking about it is correct. What Curt mentioned is an EBITDA number. And so, we would expect that we would have some interest expense because we\u2019re going to be doing the project financing and any other sort of third-party capital charges that we would have. So, we have some ongoing cost of that capital, which we believe to be more cost-effective than our own. And then over time, we\u2019d have some amortization of the project debt, the project level debt that we would take on. So, that\u2019s not meant to be a free cash flow number if that\u2019s I think was getting to the nature of your question. It is an EBITDA number. And as Curt mentioned, our goal is to maintain 100% equity control so that from a terminal value standpoint, we\u2019re building a business of $500 million on a five-year basis. We can get to $500 million and have long-dated, long-lived assets, very ESG-friendly asset portfolio that\u2019s grown rapidly and use third-party capital, more cost-effective capital to do it. So, there will be some distributions out of that EBITDA to pay for that, but we think that\u2019s more cost effective than doing it all on balance sheet.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. Yes, I was really interested in whether it\u2019s going to be 100% owned by you and sounds like it will be. Okay. Second question, in terms of that $3-plus-billion EBITDA number. You mentioned coal retirements, amongst other things that kind of give you opportunity to get to that 5 gigawatt zero platform number. Is there a degradation to that base $3 billion EBITDA as you ramp up on the Vistra Zero platform?\nCurt Morgan: Well, yes, if you break these things -- and Jim, you can go. But if you break them out, right, and you say, okay, let\u2019s isolate what impact do we have from our closing or retiring of our coal fleet, yes, there is some slight degradation in EBITDA from that. I will say that there\u2019s very little coming from these assets and the value of these assets have been written down to zero on the books. So, they\u2019re just not economically not contributing a lot and certainly not on an EBITDA basis. What we are seeing though is that, that effect is more than offset by over time as we invest in the Vistra Zero platform. So, we\u2019re able to actually ultimately grow EBITDA over time as we invest. And so, we do see an increasing EBITDA profile when we project that out. So, while they do, if you isolate it, they do have a negative effect on EBITDA, meaning the retired coal plants, the other projects that are coming on more than offset that. Jim, go ahead. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\nJim Burke: No. Curt, you covered it well. There\u2019s nearly 8,000 megawatts of slated retirements. Well, we obviously have two large facilities in Texas that do not have anticipated retirement dates, but the EBITDA contribution of that nearly 8,000 has come down through time and is not material on the go-forward horizon, but it\u2019s something that we are built -- we built into our plan, and that\u2019s the whole point of transitioning this fleet is to be able to put new long-lived high-margin assets with Vistra Zero to more than overcome that so that we have a growing EBITDA profile through time.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Thanks, guys. Net-net, it sounds like you\u2019re biased higher on that $3-plus-billion EBITDA prospectively, right? Like counting in the\u2026\nCurt Morgan: Correct.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nCurt Morgan: Yes.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Curt Morgan for any closing remarks.\nCurt Morgan: Thanks again for everybody for your interest in our company. I\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve done after this February event. I think, we\u2019re back on track. I feel like we\u2019re as strong as ever and really appreciate the interest in Vistra, and we look forward to speaking to you in the near future. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Curt Morgan",
            "content": "Thank you, Molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra. While we have a lot to cover today, we will do our best to be as jiffy as possible to leave sufficient time for Q&A. Not only will we be discussing our third quarter and year-to-date financial results, but we are also initiating our 2022 guidance as is customary on our third quarter results call. And most importantly, we are laying out additional details of our long-term capital allocation plan, which I'm excited to share with you. So, let's get started. It's hard to believe we are still in the same year where we experienced the significant effects from Winter Storm Uri. I'm proud of how our company has recovered from a business standpoint, and we are beginning to execute on our strategic priorities, which are a product of a thorough review with the Board that have begun prior to Uri but accelerated greatly immediately on the heels of the storm. We will discuss these priorities in more detail later. Consistent with the bounce-back of our business, slide 6 reports our strong third quarter financial results, despite a weak Texas summer where Vistra delivered adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1.177 billion or $1.167 billion, excluding the impacts from Winter Storm Uri realized in the third quarter, which included a small positive impact from ERCOT's 180-day resettlement statements. As of September 30th, Vistra has already achieved approximately 85% of the $500 million self-help target we announced following Uri, and all of that done without really impacting any future periods. And we have a clear line of sight to achieving the balance in the fourth quarter. The combination of our solid execution on these self-help initiatives together with the inclusion of the approximately $500 million in proceeds we expect to realize from ERCOT's securitization of certain charges allocated to load serving entities during Uri, we are in a position today to both, narrow and raise our 2021 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range as shown on the slide. The securitization and self-help materially offset the more than $2 billion loss from Uri, such as the retail bill credits we will discuss later. As you likely recall, internal and third-party analysis has shown that Vistra's Uri loss was driven predominantly by the uncontrollable failure of the Texas Intrastate gas system. We are also narrowing and revising our ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance, which is similarly reflected on slide 6. The cash flow associated with securitization is expected to be received in the first half of 2022. Consequently, the cash impact of securitization is reflected in our 2022 guidance on the next slide. So, turning to slide 7, Vistra is initiating its 2022 guidance today, forecasting ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2.81 billion to $3.31 billion, with ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in the range of $2.07 billion to $2.57 billion. This represents a free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 76%, which is higher than our historical conversion ratio due to the anticipated receipt of the securitization proceeds in the first half of 2022. On slide 7, we also offer an illustrative view of Vistra's 2022 guidance ranges, which exclude Winter Storm Uri related bill credits of approximately $185 million, and also the negative in-year impact from the execution of NPV-positive long-dated contracts with retail customers of approximately $55 million and the $500 million of securitization proceeds in free cash flow before growth only. We believe this illustrative view is the best way to think about Vistra's future financial performance potential as it demonstrates the long-term earnings power and cash generation of the business. Notably, the adverse impact from the bill credits in 2022 guidance are more than offset by the securitization included in the 2021 updated guidance. In fact, securitization will likely more than offset the retail bill credits across all years. Looking beyond 2022, Vistra's long-term view of our earnings power remains robust. The Company is less hedged in 2023 and beyond, which affords an even greater opportunity to capture momentum from the rising curves we have observed in recent months. In fact, we have seen a move up in both gas and heat rate in ERCOT as the gap between market and our fundamental view converge, which we have similarly seen in the last several years. In fact, this conversion has resulted in projected results using market curves for the next several years, in line with our stated view that we can generate consistent EBITDA of $3 billion or greater. Previously, the out years using steeply backwardated market curves were below $3 billion. This leaves us in a stronger position to optimize our EBITDA within the $3 billion or greater EBITDA range, especially as we add our growth investments. We continue to remain confident in the ability of this business to earn significant cash flow on an annual basis, and we intend to return a majority of that cash flow to our financial stakeholders in the years ahead, as I will outline on the next few slides. Slide 8 sets forth the four key priorities that our recent strategic review identified. We believe the best way to unlock the value inherent in this business and maximize value for our financial stakeholders is to drive long-term sustainable value through our integrated business model, which has been strengthened following Uri through various investments in our fleet and fuel supply as well as our enhanced risk management practices; return a significant amount of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and a meaningful dividend program, especially for as long as our stock remains at what we believe is such a meaningful discount to its fundamental value. And if our stock responds, we will continue to return that capital in the most optimal way to our shareholders. The key is that we generate substantial capital year-over-year, and we intend to return a significant amount to our shareholders. Also, we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet. And last but not least, accelerate our Vistra Zero growth pipeline with cost-effective capital. As we set forth on the next slide, our long-term capital allocation plan reflects these strategic priorities. Vistra's long-term capital allocation plan reflects an anticipated return of capital of at least $7.5 billion to its common stockholders through year-end 2026 while simultaneously reducing our corporate level -- leverage and accelerating our Vistra Zero growth pipeline. Specifically, as we announced in October, our Board recently approved a $2 billion share repurchase program which we expect to fully execute by year-end 2022. The share repurchase program is partially funded by the $1 billion of 8% preferred equity we issued last month. We then expect we will allocate approximately $1 billion per year towards share repurchases from 2023 through 2026 for a total of $6 billion in five years. And again, if our stock responds, we will reallocate those funds back to our shareholders in similar cost-effective manner. This $6 billion of return of capital represents more than 60% of our current market cap. This significant amount of capital allocated to share repurchases is evidence of both management and the Board's conviction of the long-term earnings power of the business, juxtaposed with what we believe is a significant undervaluation of our stock. We will expect we will continue to prioritize share repurchases so long as we believe our stock is undervalued. And let me tell you, in my view, we have a long way to go. We are also reinforcing our commitment to paying a meaningful and growing dividend. Rather than identifying a target annual growth rate for our dividend, management expects that it will, subject to Board approval at the appropriate time, allocate $300 million per year toward its common dividend. As we retire more and more of our shares over time, this $300 million dividend pool will be spread over fewer shares and will offer potentially outsized growth on the remaining shares. For example, if we were to execute all $6 billion worth of the share repurchases at our recent stock price, our annualized dividend per share would grow by more than 175% by year-end 2026. At our current share price, these share repurchases and dividend programs are projected to result in an annual average cash yield on the stock of an attractive 15%. As always, we are also committed to a strong balance sheet. We expect we will retire another approximately $1.5 billion of corporate level debt by the end of next year and up to $3 billion by 2026 with projections of debt-to-EBITDA in the mid to high-2s during this time frame for the Vistra base business. Per our previous comments, we expect to combine project financing with renewable-related preferred equity and cash flows from existing renewable projects to cost effectively develop our current nearly 5 gigawatt renewable and battery pipeline over the next five years using only $500 million of our own capital. And that is $500 million on a cumulative basis over the five-year period, a significantly lower estimate than our previous expectation of spending approximately $500 million per year on growth capital. These funds can now be used to support other capital allocation priorities, especially share repurchases. It is important to note that Vistra Zero will be a highly contracted business with third-party and internal PPAs. So, the leverage ratios will be commensurate with similarly situated businesses. Slide 10 outlines the sources and uses for the long-term capital allocation plan that I just laid out. Importantly, we expect we will be able to execute on this capital allocation plan by growing our Vistra Zero renewable and battery storage portfolio to a more than 5 gigawatt business, generating approximately $450 million to $500 million of adjusted EBITDA annually by year-end 2026. We are excited about this long-term capital allocation plan and believe strongly that it is the best way to maximize the value of our business as we expect we will return the majority of our free cash flow from our base business to our financial stakeholders while being mindful of our overall leverage levels and cost effectively accelerating our renewables and battery storage growth pipeline, which should ultimately be valued at a higher multiple over time. Using the midpoint of the Vistra Zero EBITDA of $475 million by 2026 and a 14 times multiple would result in a total value of $6.65 billion for these projects. As I mentioned earlier, the strategic review we undertook was thorough, evaluating multiple scenarios and potential paths to unlock shareholder value. Ultimately, we believe the path we have outlined here today will be the path that will result in the greatest financial reward over time, taking into account risk of execution, cost effectiveness and economies of scale. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jim Burke to discuss our financial results in more detail. Jim? Yes. So, I'll take a first shot at that and then Jim, feel free to jump in. But -- so, I think, we're also looking at sort of what I'll call a kick-start upfront tranche of capital. We haven't determined exactly what that tranche will look like, but it will be equity like, let's put it that way. And then, when you combine that with leverage, Stephen, that's more around about 60% type leverage, project leverage with the contracted cash flows. So, it's not like we're putting 80% leverage. But I think the other thing that's missing maybe in this is the effort that we're pursuing to bring in another tranche of capital in here of some consequence. And then, when we look at the cash flows off of the business and the maintenance expense and things because it's fairly low for these types of assets, we generate enough cash, along with project financing and this project capital along with our $500 million to basically self-fund the build-out of the roughly 5 gigs through 2026. So, we have looked at this. We feel comfortable with how we're setting it up. Clearly, we would like to grow it even further than that, and I expect us to add to the pipeline, whether that's through acquiring projects or potentially even a platform. But just what is line of sight that we have already in the Q, we feel like we can raise sufficient capital, and through the cash flows, that would be more than adequate to be able to run that business. Jim, anything you want to add? Yes. Go ahead, Jim. Yes. Stephen, you know we have Moss Landing site that can take probably up to another 1,000 megawatts. We have a site called Morro Bay, which can be up to 700 megawatts. Those are both in California. We have a number of sites. We're one of the largest landholders, especially at our sites that have some of the old coal plants in Texas. We obviously know that market quite well. And we're partnering in California with the utilities there. And then, of course, we are in the Omnibus Energy Legislation in Illinois. We pursued that for three years out of thin air and raised this Coal to Solar and battery storage legislation that then was -- woven into the ultimate Omnibus bill. So, I think we came up with an idea to utilize sites that already have transmission access in many of the areas where the assets were being shut down or were already retired. And that's proven to work very well. And I think we have other opportunities down the road. Yes. Thank you. Yes. For \u201823 now, you're talking about? Yes. So, look, we had a period of time where sparks were compressed. They've actually come back to what I'd call a more normalized level, but there's still a fair amount of backwardation in the curve going from \u201822 to \u201823. I think our fundamental view would suggest there's still room to move with the curves relative to the fundamental view in 2023. But, the one good thing is that that -- those two curves, market and our fundamental view -- our point of view have converged significantly, and I think I made it in my remarks. But we're now seeing over the next five years, EBITDA levels that are $3 billion plus even at the curves. And prior to that, Shahriar, we were seeing -- when you marked it to the curve, below $3 billion. So, that has converged significantly. In terms of the spark spreads, there's probably some further what I'll call normalization that can occur in \u201823 on sparks. And so, yes, there could be some of that movement. But, we've seen a pretty strong move in sparks. But, if you take a look at \u201822 sparks versus \u201823 sparks, they're still about, I'm going to say, maybe about $4 difference. And we would expect that to -- that gap to close. And so, there is some upward mobility and our fundamental view shows that. In terms of directionally, \u201822 to \u201823, we always say this, but I want to be clear this time that we're within the range of being in a very similar EBITDA level on using that illustrative EBITDA number. And when I say that, that's plus or minus a couple of hundred million dollars, because an open position can go either way, depending on weather. And so, -- but we're well within the bounds of where we are in \u201822 for \u201823. And I would say, directionally, when we look at the distribution of outcomes, probably with a greater probability of upside versus downside, just knowing where the curves are, where our fundamental view is, and knowing that our commercial team is able to take advantage of when the curves are in -- are at the point of view or better. So, I feel good about 2023. I think directionally, it's in that range, and now we have to go out and execute and capture that value. Well, yes, that's -- man, that's -- I wish I had a crystal ball. But look, I think what I would hope to see, especially with this capital allocation plan and with our execution is something that is much more in the mid-teens and going down into the low double digits. I think that we certainly warrant that when -- I understand that there was a major event in February, and you know this as well as I do that any kind of return is -- part of that is the anticipated risk of the business, and I think that exposed some risk. But, I think once we show how we have invested in our business, we've reduced the risk significantly, and we're able to execute, I would expect that risk premium to come down. And then, I also believe that people are beginning to realize that a combination of renewables, batteries and low heat rate, very efficient fossil fuel, mainly gas plants, is really going to be the right mix of assets going into the next 15 to 20 years, because you're going to need dispatchable resources for reliability purposes. The market is going to have to pay for those. Clearly, we're going to need to have clean and green resources going forward, and battery storage is going to be a big piece of that. I think that's what our company is lining up with. And then, we've got this large retail business that I think people don't think about that we can contract much of our renewable and battery business with. That also has very consistent and significant margins, and we expect that to continue as well. So, we feel like we're lined up. If we can execute, then we would expect that the risk premium, that is a function of both, a perceived risk in the business model, which I think we are closing, but also the terminal value question, we believe that we have a company that's here for a long period of time. We should see that risk premium come down. And commensurately, we ought to see a much lower free cash flow yield, which in turn, as you know, means a higher and stronger stock price. Yes, we are. We are. If you take 2021's outcome and you take $500 million securitization, you back it off, you'll notice that we were a little bit under and a big chunk of that, more than half of it, is the challenges we've had at the Sunset segment, not just coal constraints, but also we've had some outages that were this year that came about. What I would call, though, our coal constraint mainly is an opportunity loss more than anything else. And I'll tell you why. We have been prioritizing building coal inventory for the winter, because the price curves are saying that it's much more economic to run in Q1 of \u201822 than it is in Q4 of \u201821. And if you think of it, we have a finite amount of coal because of the supply constraints. We were going to have to optimize between Q4 \u201821 and Q1 of \u201822. We have opted to run a little bit less in Q4 of \u201821 to conserve and preserve the amount of coal we have so that we are going to be there for Q1 of \u201822 because the price curves are telling us that's where it's most economic, and that's what we intend to do. The other thing I'll tell you is that I'm still a little bit concerned about making sure that the entire grid in Texas is weatherized, including the gas system for this particular winter. And so, we want to be very cautious. We're going to go into that carrying more length because of that, and we want to make sure that we don't have any hiccups. And then, just the broader energy commodity complex, as you know, is quite volatile. And so, because of that, we're taking a very, very conservative approach going into Q1, and that means trying to conserve some of our coal to make sure that we can run in Q1 of \u201822. Jim, do you want to take the first one around buyback, what we're looking at around buybacks and then we can -- and then if you want to take a stab at the second one, that's fine, and I can add to it. Go ahead. No, no, no. Go ahead, Jim. Sorry. Yes. So, Julien, I think that's why we say -- and we're not trying to be evasive here at all. It's just that when you're this far out and the curves are still backwardated, and we've seen every year that when you get into the summer and come out of the summer, that the next summer and the winters tend to begin to move up, and we expect that from our fundamental view. Marking something just to a current curve will give you one result. Marketing something to our fundamental view will give you a different result. We think those -- the good news is this time around is that those two things are still within the range of \u201822 for \u201823. In the past, the curves -- and you brought this up before. In the past, the curves were well below the $3 billion mark. And now, those -- the curves in the fundamental view are -- have converged, but there's still some room to move. So, I like to think about there's a distribution around \u201823. But clearly, the \u201822 EBITDA midpoint on illustrative basis is within that distribution. And so, we think there's a good chance that we can come in around where \u201822 levels are for \u201823. That's going to come down to execution and being ready when the curves are ripe and our team, that's what we do. That's what we get paid to do. So, we feel pretty good about going into \u201822. We clearly feel good about it being $3 billion plus and being plus $3 billion. Where it will land in terms of \u201822 for \u201823, we're going to be within spitting distance of \u201823. And I think we have a good chance of hitting it, and we could actually even exceed it. So, that distribution I think is favorable. It's now about execution and getting opportunities. Yes. I think it's in the $5 billion to $5.5 billion range of total capital that would have to be invested. And you are right, the amount of equity capital that we would be putting in is relatively low, although we're putting in some -- obviously putting in some projects into that as well that have value on the market. But yes, I think it's $5 billion to $5.5 billion, if I remember right that we would have to invest. And we obviously have plans for how we would do that. Well, yes, I think I mentioned it, it's Moss Landing, it's Morro Bay, it's our Oakland site in California, it's -- what is it, 9 sites in Illinois that would have batteries or something like that. It's batteries in Texas. We have one that's 265-megawatt, 1 hour battery coming on in Texas. We have a 10-megawatt already on. But that's what the battery storage picture looks like. And of course, we're predominantly a solar. On the renewable side, we have found wind to be economic. We're not an offshore wind person yet, so -- and I don't expect us to be that. But, we're not afraid of wind. It's just that we haven't found the opportunity for that. But that's -- those are the primary projects. Of course, there's a lot of solar, both in Texas and in Illinois. Yes. And Jim, you can jump in after this. But -- so over half of -- well, let's just put it this way, about $40 million in \u201821 is the effect of coal constraints. And so, just -- so, we've captured that, Steve. That's in our updated guidance, and we've captured that. I think I mentioned, we've decided to build inventory for Q1 because the economics are more compelling to be ready for Q1. And so, we have created this constraint in Q4 of \u201821 in favor of Q1 of \u201822. Everything -- any constraint that we have going into \u201822 is already built into our guidance. So, there's nothing more to talk about there. We expect, given what we're doing in Q4 of \u201821 in favor of Q1 of \u201822 will actually allow us to run where we want to in Q1 of \u201822. I think you know this too that some of our plants, two of them in PJM and Ohio are not on PRB. A lot of these constraints are coming out of the PRB and on the rails from the PRB. And then, of course, Oak Grove mines its own coal. So, we don't have those limitations there. And then, many of our other -- we just don't have a lot of EBITDA coming from like the Illinois plants. And so, the constraints just aren't as big for us. And I think the other thing is our team got way out in front. I mean, this came to me more than a couple of months ago that we were concerned about this. And so, we've been managing toward that, and we've been working with the Burlington Northern folks. I've talked to their leadership team about getting more trains so that we can get them in and they're doing the best they can. They know it's important for this winter in Texas. So all in all, I think we really kind of took a, what I'd call, a $40 million opportunity loss in Q4, but we're also going to have more inventory for Q1 of \u201822. And all of that's baked in both of our guidance ranges. Did you ask about ancillaries, Steve? Can you hear us? Yes. We have that. That's also -- ours is just much lower. And Jim, you might want to add to this. But our effect -- we have ancillary, the effects of ancillaries baked into our numbers. Jim, do you want to add to that, any specifics? Yes. It could be both, Steve. But, I think most of it, we're looking at right now, this can be different in the future is back with our retail. And that's actually -- we have an entity that lives between our wholesale and retail group that manages the supply. We call it the supply boat, but it manages supply for our retail business. And they buy and they sell to third-party retailers as well as to our own retail business. They're the one that will ultimately end up contracting and then they will then supply our retail book as well as other retailers, but that's where -- it's really sort of back-to-back with our retail arm. And so, that's where those contracts will be set up. You are, but let me just put it this way. We will own 100% of the common equity of this entity. So, just to be very clear about it. That capital tranche that we're looking at, we haven't decided exactly what it will look like, but we will own 100% of the common equity of that business. And so, you can sort of figure out what kind of tranches that could be. But, we're not looking to sell and partner with the equity ownership of that. I think there are other ways to do what we want to do and maintain our control. Jim, anything you want to add? Well, yes, if you break these things -- and Jim, you can go. But if you break them out, right, and you say, okay, let's isolate what impact do we have from our closing or retiring of our coal fleet, yes, there is some slight degradation in EBITDA from that. I will say that there's very little coming from these assets and the value of these assets have been written down to zero on the books. So, they're just not economically not contributing a lot and certainly not on an EBITDA basis. What we are seeing though is that, that effect is more than offset by over time as we invest in the Vistra Zero platform. So, we're able to actually ultimately grow EBITDA over time as we invest. And so, we do see an increasing EBITDA profile when we project that out. So, while they do, if you isolate it, they do have a negative effect on EBITDA, meaning the retired coal plants, the other projects that are coming on more than offset that. Jim, go ahead. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Correct. Yes. Thanks again for everybody for your interest in our company. I'm proud of what we've done after this February event. I think, we're back on track. I feel like we're as strong as ever and really appreciate the interest in Vistra, and we look forward to speaking to you in the near future. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Curt. As shown on slide 12, Vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $1.177 billion, results that are comparable to our third quarter 2020 financial results. Period-over-period, our retail segment results were $205 million higher than third quarter 2020, driven by the realization of our self-help initiatives and the lower cost of goods sold in 2021. The collective generation segment ended the quarter $211 million lower than third quarter 2020, driven primarily by the lower realized energy margin in Texas, East and Sunset after a very strong 2020. Turning now to slide 13. We wanted to briefly touch on the momentum we have seen in spark spreads across the markets where we operate. Since September, we've seen a dramatic rise in commodity pricing across the board as gas prices, power prices and spark spreads are all climbing higher for 2022 and beyond. This is true in all the markets where we operate, though we highlight our two largest markets, ERCOT and PJM on the slide. As a general rule, Vistra is a company that benefits from higher natural gas price environments as gas units are typically the marginal units setting the price of power, leading to higher overall power prices. We expect this will benefit us in the outer years where we are less hedged. As of October 31st, Vistra is now 27% and 50% hedged in ERCOT and PJM, respectively, for 2023. We are hedged at relatively similar levels in New York, New England, CAISO and MISO as we have taken advantage of the increase in outright power prices and spark spreads over the last couple of months which are rising more in line with our fundamental point of view. We expect our commercial team will continue to take advantage of commodity pricing volatility, working to position our integrated operations to earn a relatively stable earnings profile over time. I'm turning now to slide 14, which provides a more detailed breakdown of our 2022 financial guidance. We believe the illustrative guidance in the range of $3.05 billion to $3.55 billion, adding back the impact of the Uri-related bill credits and the year one impact of various NPV positive long-dated retail contracts is the best way to think about the long-term earnings power of this business. We continue to believe that Vistra will be able to convert a majority of its adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow before growth. Similarly, our guidance for ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth includes the anticipated receipt of securitization proceeds in addition to the other Uri impacts, such as bill credits. So, our illustrative guidance removes these for a more normalized view of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth. A strong conversion percentage, as shown on the slide, enables the significant return of capital that Curt discussed while also supporting a strong balance sheet and the transformation of our fleet with our Vistra Zero pipeline. Before we close this morning, I wanted to briefly address our long-term leverage target in pursuit of investment-grade credit ratings which I know has been a strategic question for many of you following Uri. Foundationally, a strong balance sheet is core to Vistra's strategy. Our low leverage level proved critical during Uri as our financial strength supported our ability to quickly add more than $2 billion of debt in response to the storm. As outlined on slide 15, we believe our current leverage in the range of approximately 3 to 3.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA is a leverage level that will afford us the same level of financial strength. We believe we will be able to maintain our leverage in this range in the near term and reach the mid to high 2s over the next five years. We also believe that we would still be a candidate for investment-grade credit ratings in the future as our corporate leverage drops below 3 times and any project financing will relate to a lower risk contracted part of the business, though, as we said recently, we believe this opportunity is at least a few years in the future. In closing, as I hope you can see from the long-term capital allocation plan we laid out today, we believe in the value of this business and our ability to generate significant free cash flow for allocation in the years ahead. By prioritizing returning the majority of our capital to our financial stakeholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet and pursuing accelerated growth of our Vistra Zero portfolio, we believe that we will unlock the value of our business over time. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions. Curt, you covered it well. The only thing that I would amplify is that we intend to structure the PPAs from these assets back to Vistra to create the contracted cash flows. That gives us the chance then to put 60% to 70% project debt. The balance comes from the three sources Curt mentioned, the parent contribution of less than $500 million, some form of structured financing or equity and then the cash flows from the projects themselves. And so when we think of this as a self-sustaining entity and an entity that can grow even faster than we anticipated when we announced this pipeline last summer. And so, I think it gives us a way to use more cost-effective capital and still take advantage of the opportunities, given the pipeline of great sites that we have. Sure. Thanks, Curt. What we try to do here, Stephen, is focus on where we've got a strong place to start, which is sites that we have control over. Its focus right now is primarily Texas, California and now with Coal to Solar, the Illinois fleet. We have a few opportunities at a couple of other coal plants that we intend to convert. But, this does not include -- as Curt mentioned, this does not include an expectation of prospecting for a bunch of sites we don't have control over or an M&A type platform. So, I think we've got a really good pipeline that we can set up based on our partnerships. We've got very good partnerships on the solar side and the EPC side and our batteries. And so, it's really just a matter of taking advantage of this methodically over the next five years. And then, in addition to that, I think there's other opportunities that Curt mentioned. But, this is our focus, not a heavy focus on PJM, and I also ISO New England at this point, those are possibilities. But, what we've got in front of us is quite a bit. Sure. Good morning, Julien. Thanks for the questions. So, on the buyback, we have -- we are looking at a number of alternatives. We have not settled on the method that we're going to use, hopefully coming out of this earnings call, we'll be very aggressive with the buyback program in order to be able to implement the $2 billion by the end of \u201822. We don't intend to telegraph how we're going to buy, when we're going to buy, but we'll report each quarter how we've effectuated the number of shares that we've purchased. But, it is a meaningful percentage, as you know, of what's outstanding, not only for the program through \u201822 but through \u201826. The other question, as we think about \u201823, I think as Curt, you mentioned, we have a large open position in \u201823 relative to \u201822. And that can work obviously to create an overperformance opportunity or come in slightly under, and we've seen the curves continue to rise. And I think the commercial team has done a very nice job looking at our point of view and trying to figure out when to put the positions on to be able to manage the expectation. I think, as Curt said, \u201823 was much lower. You saw that with forward curves in the past, particularly this time last year. That gap has closed considerably. It hasn't fully closed. And then, you see that even in our charts in the slides that we presented for the spark spreads. So, we think \u201823 has a very good chance of being in line with \u201822, but there's still room. There's still room for the curves to move, and we still have a large open position. So, we've talked about a $3-plus billion business on a run rate basis. And I think the fact is, is that there's going to be a range around these outcomes. We are in a competitive segment. We're benefited by having a large retail position that can work almost in a countercyclical manner to the wholesale position at times. But, we still have some variation around it as these -- as the markets have shown some volatility. We view that as something we can capture. So, I think looking at it more in line is where we would expect to be, but we still have a ways to go for the \u201823, given that there's still some backwardation relative to \u201822. Well, I think, Julien, the way I would describe it, it has -- go ahead, Curt. No. I would say, you have -- if you're simply -- and this is the struggle that we talk about because we have a point of view on the business that has consistently shown that the market curves begin to approach as we get towards a prompt year. So, if all you do is look at where it curves today, and you just look at it and say, lock all that in, it's going to be lower than \u201822. I mean, that's just math. That's not how we run our business. We run our business based on where we think it makes sense to put positions on and where we think curves would likely end up, given supply-demand characteristics in the Q that comes in for new build, et cetera. And so, when we look at it over that basis, we feel that \u201823 has a very good chance to be right in line with \u201822, but that's just not where the curves are at the moment. And we don't -- that does not concern us. We've been in the spot before. And we -- and it's happened for \u201822. It's happened in previous years. And so, we anticipate it would likely happen again in \u201823. Go ahead on the ancillaries. Sure. Yes, we do. It's baked into our plan. We view the ancillary costs similar to the other costs that any retailer would face. You've got to work it to your price, and you've got to ultimately reflect it with the customers. We have that built into our plan for \u201822 and beyond. And of course, we do have, as you mentioned, Steve, a different position, having some generation assets as well, so. But, the integrated effect and the effect on retail is slowly reflected in our plan. Yes. Durgesh, I think the way you're thinking about it is correct. What Curt mentioned is an EBITDA number. And so, we would expect that we would have some interest expense because we're going to be doing the project financing and any other sort of third-party capital charges that we would have. So, we have some ongoing cost of that capital, which we believe to be more cost-effective than our own. And then over time, we'd have some amortization of the project debt, the project level debt that we would take on. So, that's not meant to be a free cash flow number if that's I think was getting to the nature of your question. It is an EBITDA number. And as Curt mentioned, our goal is to maintain 100% equity control so that from a terminal value standpoint, we're building a business of $500 million on a five-year basis. We can get to $500 million and have long-dated, long-lived assets, very ESG-friendly asset portfolio that's grown rapidly and use third-party capital, more cost-effective capital to do it. So, there will be some distributions out of that EBITDA to pay for that, but we think that's more cost effective than doing it all on balance sheet. No. Curt, you covered it well. There's nearly 8,000 megawatts of slated retirements. Well, we obviously have two large facilities in Texas that do not have anticipated retirement dates, but the EBITDA contribution of that nearly 8,000 has come down through time and is not material on the go-forward horizon, but it's something that we are built -- we built into our plan, and that's the whole point of transitioning this fleet is to be able to put new long-lived high-margin assets with Vistra Zero to more than overcome that so that we have a growing EBITDA profile through time."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Molly Sorg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMolly Sorg: Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Vistra\u2019s second quarter 2021 results conference call, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today\u2019s investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related press release. Joining me for today\u2019s call are Curt Morgan, Chief Executive Officer and Jim Burke, President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today\u2019s call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today\u2019s discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today\u2019s date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, today\u2019s press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you, Molly and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra, especially on this crowded earnings reporting day. As we find ourselves at the start of August already, the fact that the power markets are in a state of transition continues to be apparent. California, Texas and New York have all requested conservation at various times during the summer. June of 2021 was America\u2019s hottest June in 127 years of records, meeting the prior record from June of 2016 by 0.8 degrees. Much of this record-breaking heat has been observed in the Pacific Northwest. North Texas was actually slightly below the 10-year average in June with April and May also being very mild. So as a nation, there is no question that temperatures have been on the rise in 2021 as have the extremes in weather conditions. These weather extremes, coupled with the greater percentage of renewable resources making up the supply stack in various markets, have resulted in a heightened sensitivity to scarcity conditions by the system operators, reinforcing the importance of thermal resources, especially natural gas and maintaining a reliable grid now and several years into the future. Power markets and systems must also balance decarbonization efforts with affordability and reliability, which is proving to be a challenge as evidenced in California and Texas. Given the uncertainty with COVID-19, especially the Delta variant and the country\u2019s desire to return to normal, we have continued to prioritize the safety of our number one asset, our people, while delivering reliable and affordable power to our customers. The second quarter results we are announcing today reflect this dedication and focus. During the quarter, we continued our rebound from the very unfortunate impacts from Uri, most notably hardening our assets, participating in the Texas legislative and regulatory processes and refining our risk management policies. We have also begun a process to review our strategic direction and how we allocate capital. On Slide 6, we show our strong second quarter financial results. Excluding the second quarter impacts from winter storm Uri related to bill credits and higher fuels costs, Vistra delivered adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $909 million comparable to its very strong second quarter 2020 financial results. Including these Uri impacts, Vistra\u2019s adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations was $825 million. These results were pretty much in line with management expectations for the quarter. We have similarly had a solid start in the execution of the self-help initiatives we identified when we announced our revised financial guidance in April. We currently have a line of sight to achieving the vast majority of the $500 million of self-help initiatives we previously announced. And we have achieved more than 40% through June 30. We will continue to pursue the full $500 million, but only to the extent we do not jeopardize the future risk profile and/or earnings of the company. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges for both ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth as set forth on Slide 6. Importantly, excluding Uri, Vistra would be tracking in line to ahead of our pre-Uri guidance midpoint for the year. We understand that Uri happened, but we also believe it is important to recognize that the long-term earnings potential for Vistra remains intact. Turning now to Slide 7, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, power markets have recently moved up with forward curves in both ERCOT and PJM as well as our other markets, up meaningfully over the last several months. I am sure you have heard me discuss our point of view in the past, which is our modeled fundamental view of where prices are likely to move over time, incorporating various weather conditions, new build scenarios and other key variables on a probability weighted basis. Pretty much since I have been at Vistra, our point of view has decoupled from backward-dated forward curves, especially in ERCOT. Over the years, forward markets, and to some extent, settled prices have afforded Vistra the opportunity to construct realized price curves, in line with our point of view. It is interesting that the recent positive movement in 2022, forward curves have brought pricing in line with Vistra\u2019s point of view, especially in ERCOT. ERCOT sparks have increased primarily for the winter and summer months and we believe this is being driven by market participants reducing their overall risk tolerance following Uri and possibly the potential for market reforms, which could result in more favorable price formation for dispatchable resources in the future to support market reliability. In PJM, however, it is our view that the rise in power prices has been driven primarily by the increase in natural gas prices. As of July 30, Vistra is now 54% and 93% hedged in ERCOT and PJM, up from 40% and 50% respectively for 2022. We have similarly meaningfully increased our hedge positions in New York, New England, California and the MISO markets over the last several months taking advantage of the increase in outright power prices and spark spreads. The recent momentum in forward prices, primarily in ERCOT, supports our previously stated strong outlook for 2022. You might recall last fall at our virtual investor event in September, we offered an early outlook for 2022. Noting our view that in a commodity-exposed business like ours, looking at average adjusted EBITDA over time is a more appropriate way to evaluate the earnings power of the business. We further offered our view that we believe 2022 ongoing operations\u2019 adjusted EBITDA could come in line with this average concept. Specifically, we noted that the average of our 2020 and 2021 ongoing operations\u2019 adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoints was approximately $3.4 billion, which we believe could be indicative of 2022 financial performance and reflected our point of view pricing. At that time, curves were lower. With the recent uplift in forward curves, especially in ERCOT, we continue to believe 2022 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations could be in the range of $3.4 billion, excluding the impact of the retail bill credits from Uri, with a 60% to 70% conversion to adjusted free cash flow before growth. I am now on Slide 8. As we mentioned on our business update call in April, Vistra is taking several actions intended to address the risks we were exposed to during winter storm Uri. First, we are investing nearly $50 million in 2021 prior to the 2022 winter on improvements to further harden our coal fuel handling capabilities and to further weatherize our Texas fleet for even colder temperatures and longer durations. We intend to spend up to another $30 million in 2022 to further enhance the ability for our fleet to withstand extreme weather conditions. We have also contracted for a meaningful amount of additional gas storage, which performed well during the storm to support our gas fleet and we are installing dual-fuel capabilities at our gas steam units, while similarly increasing the fuel oil inventory at our dual-fuel sites. Last, we plan to carry more generation linked into the peak seasons, increasing the level of physical insurance we carry to protect against volatility. The absolute level of excess generation we carry will be a function of our investments, in our generation infrastructure and the ERCOT market improvements that are implemented going forward. In addition to these improvements, we are making on a standalone basis, the Texas legislature recently passed legislation that provides for mapping of the integrated gas and electric systems, which should help to alleviate gas deliverability issues by identifying critical infrastructure, allowing for weatherization and registration with the transmission and distribution utilities to ensure that those assets continue to operate in the inclement conditions and receive power in the event of rolling outages in the future. We have already seen a significant amount of registration activity since Uri. We intend to play a role in ensuring the efforts to map and identify critical gas and power infrastructure are carried out in a manner that results in the intended reduction of risk to the integrated systems. Last, both ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission of Texas are evaluating various market reform alternatives to reduce risk and ensure that dispatchable resources have adequate revenues to incent investment and serve to balance the system with a growing number of intermittent renewables. We believe any such reforms could further improve ERCOT\u2019s risk profile for market participants and enhance the attractiveness of the market. The process is in its early stages. So, it is difficult at this time to speculate on what form these reforms might take, though very clearly, ERCOT and the PUCT are focused on ensuring that Texans have reliable electricity going forward, reinforcing the importance of dispatchable resources like Vistra\u2019s. The most likely potential areas for reform are to the operating reserve demand curve, including reducing the price gap and extending the amount of reserves on the curve and additional ancillary services to incentivize new investment and maintain existing dispatchable generations. Before I turn the call over to Jim, I would like to comment briefly on our strategic direction and capital allocation review. As we noted on our business update call in April, the events of Uri required us to step back and rethink our strategic direction, enterprise risk and how we allocate capital. The goal is to unlock the value of our company that we strongly believe remains intact. As you likely know, the events of Uri also have setback the timeline for a potential investment grade rating to at least the end of 2022 or at some point in 2023. The strategic review will undoubtedly address our leverage targets in the pursuit of investment grade credit ratings. However, regardless of the direction we take, Vistra will always maintain a strong balance sheet that allows us to withstand extreme risk, pursue business opportunities and attract investors. We understand the urgency of this work given where our stock is trading, but we also want to be prudent in our deliberations. We intend to provide more information when we have news to discuss on our longer term strategic direction, no later than our third quarter earnings call in early November. Probably the most important point is that our deliberations have confirmed our confidence in the long-term value of our business. It is incumbent on us to put together the plan to realize this value and we intend to do so. We believe that our relatively young low-cost assets that we are de-risking will play a critical role in the energy transition for the next couple of decades, which when combined with our attractive retail and zero carbon businesses should deliver relatively consistent financial results, while generating a substantial amount of free cash flow on an annual basis. At today\u2019s stock price, investing in our stock has to be at the top of the list of where to allocate our capital. We look forward to talking more about our strategic direction and how we plan to allocate our significant cash flow in the months ahead. I will now turn the call over to Jim Burke.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Curt. As shown on Slide 10, Vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $825 million. Excluding the Uri-related bill credits and fuel cost adjustments, Vistra\u2019s adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations was $909 million, results that are comparable to our exceptionally strong second quarter 2020 financial results. Period-over-period, our retail segment results were $109 million higher than second quarter 2020, driven by the realization of our self-help initiatives in \u201821. The collective generation segments ended the quarter $213 million lower than second quarter 2020 driven primarily by lower realized prices in Texas after an exceptionally strong 2020 and lower capacity revenues. Importantly, the long-term earnings power of this company has not been affected by Uri, which was a highly unusual event. In fact, without the impact of Uri, we expect we would have been reaffirming our pre-Uri guidance today, which had an adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations midpoint of $3.275 billion. Next year, excluding the impact from Uri bill credits, we believe we have the ability to deliver adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations in the $3.4 billion range, with 60% to 70% conversion to free cash flow before growth. All of this to say, we continue to believe this business will have significant capital to allocate in the years ahead, which takes me to Slide 11. Last week, our Board approved our third quarter 2021 dividend of $0.15 or $0.60 on an annual basis, subject to Board approval at the appropriate times. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, though as Curt mentioned, we believe we are still a couple of years out from a potential investment grade credit rating. In the second quarter of 2021, we did execute one capital markets transaction, issuing $1.25 billion of 4.375% senior unsecured notes due May 1, 2029. We used the proceeds to repay all of the outstanding principal amounts of the $1.25 billion, 364-day term loan A that we issued following Uri. Beyond our priority to maintain a strong balance sheet, we also view our stock is significantly undervalued. We continue to believe that share buybacks at these levels would be one of the most attractive uses of our capital, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to reallocate capital for the remainder of 2021. Last, as we previously discussed, we are also evaluating alternatives to accelerate the pace of our renewable development using lower cost capital. All of these capital allocation tenants are being evaluated in our current review. So please stay tuned for more to come on these topics in the months ahead. In closing, while winter storm Uri was a significant one-time financial hit in the first quarter, our business has been able to get back on track and execute well in the second quarter. And with the recent uptick in forward curves in both PJM and ERCOT, our forward outlook has only improved, with management expecting that we will be able to deliver strong adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth in \u201822 and beyond. We believe in the value of this business and our ability to generate significant free cash flow for allocation in the years ahead. In fact, with our long-term view that we will be able to generate $3 billion or more of adjusted EBITDA with 60% to 70% conversion to free cash flow on an annual basis, we could repurchase our entire market cap in roughly 5 years if we would allocate all of this capital to share buybacks, attractive value in our opinion our teams are committed to execution. We prioritize operational excellence, low-cost operations and disciplined financial management. As always, we are focused on delivering safe and reliable electricity to our customers, while creating value for our stakeholders over the long term. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.\nCurt Morgan: Hey, Shar. Good to hear from you.\nShar Pourreza: Yes, same Curt. Just quickly, Curt, just on your comments regarding a review of your strategic direction, how you allocate capital, you mentioned in your prepared remarks. As you kind of continue to generate cash, can you maybe just speak on how you\u2019re thinking about buybacks versus perhaps a special dividend, especially as we\u2019re thinking about \u201822 and beyond, maybe more inorganic retail deals? Also, you kind of specifically also noted strategic direction, could that also imply that there is maybe an internal debate around a go-private scenario, if you continue to trade at these unsustainable high free cash flow yields? Could kind of go-private scenario be the avenue to realize value? Just maybe if you can elaborate a little bit more on that strategic direction comment and would you be prepared to discuss this by November or could this be pushed out? Thanks.\nCurt Morgan: Yes, Shar. So thank you. That\u2019s a great question, a lot in that question. So \u2013 but that \u2013 I mean I knew that I figured we get that question. I think after the Uri event, I think most people would expect that management team and the Board, we\u2019re going to sit down and have a discussion about our business. And something that \u2013 obviously, it was a risk that we did not contemplate and to just brush it off and say we\u2019re going to go at things business as usual. I don\u2019t think that would have sat well with anybody and certainly not with me and not with the Board. So I think the first and foremost that we felt a sense of urgency. And of course, you got \u2013 you know this, I mean, our stock sold off big and more so actually than the actual math that you would put into it in terms of our shares divided into the loss itself. So there was a loss in confidence. And I understand that. But we had to rethink things going forward, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t know that anything has really changed that much. But we \u2013 I think there are four main pillars that are driving us as we go through our strategic direction and as we think about allocating capital. Number one is our stock is incredibly cheap. And we went \u2013 we\u2019ve done a lot of analysis, and we still believe that we\u2019re significantly undervalued. And so we have to think about what\u2019s the best way to invest in our own company. If others don\u2019t believe in us, then we need to believe in ourselves, and we generate a lot of cash. And so I think we have to take a hard look at buying back our shares. And that ultimately adds value to the shareholders to stay in the company. And so it\u2019s a good use of capital in our mind. We said this in our remarks, Jim and I did that we want to have a strong balance sheet. We never started this though with the idea that we had to pursue investment-grade rating. That kind of came along with it. And if we get there, that\u2019s fine. What\u2019s more important is we have a balance sheet that can withstand the kind of risk that we did with Uri. We were sitting here at 5 or 6, maybe 7x debt-to-EBITDA, like the IPPs in the past. We probably would be talking about a completely different situation right now than what we are. So we believe a strong balance sheet. It\u2019s still one of the cornerstones of our company, but we\u2019re not going to be penny wise and pound foolish. So we\u2019re going to look real hard at that. We think dividend will continue to be a part of what we do. And finally, we did a review of our renewable and battery business. And we have one of the best businesses. We see just about every development company that\u2019s trying to sell itself right now. We know what those teams look like. We understand NextEra has got an incredible business and kudos to them, but we\u2019re not second to anybody else in our view. We\u2019ve got a great pipeline. We\u2019re using sites that have access to transmission. We have a tremendous capability in terms of development. Development is not just about going out and getting in the interconnection queue. You\u2019ve got to have market knowledge and experience. You have to have construction experience and operations and maintenance skills. We have the economies of scale from a functional support standpoint. We bring a lot to the table. The key for us, though, is it\u2019s a cost of capital gain. And so that\u2019s where a partner may come into this. And so we\u2019re going to take a real hard look at how we can accelerate the growth in that business and make sure that we have a competitive cost of capital in that business, and that could also mean that we may want to do some project financing, but certainly bring in probably some infrastructure-type investment. So that\u2019s what we are working on. There is no disagreement with our Board. I think our Board and the management team are in lockstep. But these things take a little bit of time, and we\u2019re sure we\u2019re going to be prudent about it. We want to make sure whatever move we make is a long-term move. We don\u2019t want to have a knee-jerk reaction here and then have to do something again. And I feel good, Shar, that we will likely do something no later than the Q3 call time frame. We\u2019d like to obviously not do it on the Q3 call because that gets you guys all congested because you\u2019ve got other things to deal with. We certainly would like to do it before that and separately, so that we can have the kind of time where we can spend time with investors and with you guys. So that\u2019s where we are on this. We\u2019re \u2013 we continue to believe in the long-term value of this company. I step back and think about it this way. We\u2019ve got this incredible business that generates a tremendous amount of cash, and that cash can open up the opportunity for us to return capital. We\u2019ve also got this burgeoning and very good growth business. And that business needs capital, and it also means a cost of capital advantage. That\u2019s what we need to unlock. That\u2019s what we need to solve for. And that\u2019s what we are working on to do. And I feel very good that we\u2019re on a good path to do that. But there is a lot of work to be done. We want to get to the market as soon as we can on this direction because we build the urgency, but we want to do it right.\nShar Pourreza: So just to reiterate, Curt, the strategic direction really isn\u2019t about a debate on whether investors will ever properly reflect the value of an IPP as a public company and whether you\u2019re debating whether we should go private because that\u2019s what private is willing to pay for assets. This is more of a strategic direction, maybe a change in how you\u2019re thinking about buybacks versus dividend versus organic growth versus inorganic growth as a publicly traded company. This isn\u2019t a debate between whether we should go private or stay public.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. No, look, we\u2019re for sale every day. So if somebody wanted to pay an attractive price, but we\u2019re not out with hanging our shingle out there because I\u2019ll just tell you \u2013 I\u2019ve said this before, you know this, . I\u2019ve said it to you, but I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019ve been in the private setting. I know what it is. I know what it takes. I know what private investors want. And I think that there are others out there that have gone private that are realizing that if you go private, it\u2019s the same thing that if we were public for these businesses, that it\u2019s a long-term gain and the idea that a private equity firm would come in here and can somehow then exit in 3 to 5 years. I just don\u2019t know who that exit would be. And the thing that makes it difficult for us is that it would take a big equity check and a significant capital raise in order to get this done. That doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t happen, but that is not our primary direction. We want to take a direction that we control. We don\u2019t control that direction. And so we do something that we control and that we think can unlock this value. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused.\nShar Pourreza: Fantastic. Thank you guys so much. Appreciate it.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question.\nCurt Morgan: Hi, Stephen.\nStephen Byrd: Wanted to just talk a bit more about the opportunities for renewables that you\u2019re seeing and just get your latest view on sort of the state of play there and as much as I love the idea of growing in renewables, it does strike me as challenging to kind of beat the economics of your own stock. And I know you just went through a long discussion of your review, so I understand that this is in process. But just would you mind talking a bit about that opportunity set in renewables? What you\u2019re seeing broadly? I would guess there might be some degree of distress among some of those smaller players out there. But just could you talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re seeing there?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Good question, Stephen. So look, I think I tried to say this, but I\u2019ll make it as clear as I can. We think, at the top of our list of things to use the capital from this great cash generation machine that we have is our stock right now. And so you see the free cash flow yields. The math is pretty clear. And so \u2013 but we also want to have a strong balance sheet. I went through all these things and we do think paying a dividend made some sense. And so we are going to do that. The real challenge is can we return capital and grow what we believe is a very good and like I said, burgeoning renewables and battery storage business. I mean these are opportunities because of the sites that we have and we\u2019re in locations like California. California is talking about 12,000 megawatts plus of batteries that they need to put in. We\u2019ve got sites that can do that. We can\u2019t walk away from that value proposition. We want to partner with PG&E and others in the state of California and with the state of California to help them solve their \u2013 where they are trying to take their state. And we have the sites to do that. And so I think what we\u2019ve concluded is there are ways to do both. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. We also want \u2013 we believe that partnering with people, who have, let\u2019s say, an advantaged cost of capital and will put us in a position of having an advantaged cost of capital will put us in a better position. We have everything else there is to compete in this business, and we have the full suite of capabilities. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of whether you can do one or the other. I think we can do both. The real question is, how do we go about doing that? And that\u2019s where we\u2019re spending the time right now is concluding that effort, so that we can pursue both. There are great companies out there. I used NextEra as one. I think NextEra is a great company, and they have been able to do both. And I think we can do both. And so we\u2019re going to just have to balance that. That\u2019s where we\u2019re headed.\nStephen Byrd: Makes a lot of sense. I wanted to follow-up on Illinois and just get your latest thoughts on kind of the state of play there, the opportunity set. It strikes me sometimes folks don\u2019t appreciate the potential there for you all. But I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re seeing on the ground? What your view is of where that may head?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. So look, I mean this is an interesting one because Governor Pritzker would like to move the state of Illinois in a very progressive way to a leadership position in the area of clean generation. And he\u2019s pushing very hard on doing that. And he sees an opportunity with an Omnibus energy bill, if that\u2019s going to happen. And I\u2019m interpreting he is not telling me this. I\u2019m telling you what I\u2019m reading through the discussions that I\u2019ve had. And in so doing, that\u2019s a difficult thing because he would like to see emissions rates from thermal resources to decline and part of the legislation is pushing hard on that. And of course, that creates disruption. And there are some co-ops that own coal plants have just built them or munis I should say. That just built them not too long ago, and they still have a huge amount of debt that are on a number of different municipalities. And that creates a lot of angst. And of course, there is others like us that own thermal resources, and we\u2019re trying to sort out how does that happen. And I think even within his own party, there is a debate going on as to how you actually accomplish that. So \u2013 and that has created a bit of a divide. And I think at the end of the day, they are going to try to work together. And I believe they will because there is too much at stake here. And they will come to a reasonable conclusion to move the state forward in terms of lowering its emissions. We are in the middle of that trying to help that. The one thing that I have tried to mention to people is that if you get the Omnibus bill in place and you put the kind of stipulations in the direct auctions and require developers to actually complete their projects and get them online. That \u2013 by that very nature, will end up crowding out thermal resources and will reduce emissions without having to have a heavy handed set of criteria that forces those to happen in an unnatural fashion. And so I think if they get this bill passed and they put the right teeth in, so that they can get the development that they want of the renewable and battery resources, they will accomplish a major amount of what they want to get done. So, the real essence, though, at the end of the day, can something get done. We are cautiously optimistic that there will be a way \u2013 a path forward that everybody will come together because again, there is too much at stake. There is a lot of investment that they want to do in renewables. Our coal to solar is part of that. We feel strongly that we are solidly in the legislation. We have a very good program. It helps communities that are losing jobs from the fact that we are shutting down coal plants and investing in those communities, bringing property tax base. And we are real \u2013 we are a real company. We have real projects, and we can bring those online in a very short period of time. And so we think there is a lot in that for us as well. And so we would like to obviously help bridge this gap and work together. And that\u2019s what we are doing. We are working together with as many people as we can to try to help bridge this divide. I think it will get done, Stephen, but you would never know. And we are cautiously optimistic, but there is a lot of stake, and we think \u2013 of course, the nukes, I didn\u2019t even mention that. Those are very important to the state. They have made that very clear, so all that has to come together. Most of it is already together. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just getting through this, what do we do in the long run with thermal resources and the glide path for those to exit. And I think that\u2019s where we need to come up with a compromise, and I believe we will be able to do that.\nStephen Byrd: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you so much.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Hey, good morning.\nCurt Morgan: Hi Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Hi, Curt. Just on the \u2013 could you just remind us the current capital plan? What was in there in terms of dollars for renewables CapEx over the next few years? And maybe just also give us an update on where you stand on projects there, particularly the ones you were planning to do in Texas?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. So Steve, we had said that we would put $0.5 billion \u2013 roughly $500 million. Jim, while I am answering this, Jim may be able to find the exact numbers that we have. But $0.5 billion a year, we have said for 10 years. And when we put out that 10-year view \u2013 and I think we are largely \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit more and a little bit less in a couple of years, but we were going to reinvest that amount into renewables and batteries. And we are tracking sort of in that range and that was the investment. In terms of the projects themselves, I don\u2019t have the list in front of me, but I know that we have, and I don\u2019t know, Jim, if you have that list and if you have been able to find that, but if you can pull up that list of where we are on each of the different projects.\nJim Burke: Sure. Steve, we had in our Investor Day, we had talked about a capital allocation plan that would put over $600 million into \u201821. We said $650 million approximately in \u201821 and $500 million in \u201822. We scaled the $650 million down to $425 million for this year. And we did that as part of the earlier questions. We are kind of reading the market signals on where we should best allocate our capital. And we control these sites. So, these were sites that we can bring on in the timeframe that we would like. We are going to be the off-taker predominantly for the Texas sites. And so this gives us a lot of flexibility to be able to bring them on and do it in the timeframe that makes the most sense for us. As far as the sites themselves, we have both the Moss 300 and 100 which were completed and those are operating with an RA agreement from PG&E. The other sites that we are focused on are the Brightside Solar project, the DeCordova battery project, which is our hybrid project here in Texas. We have got Emerald Grove, and we have got just a little bit of spend to keep some options alive at a few other sites. That\u2019s the bulk of our spend for this year. And we are going to continue to build out for the balance of this year. We have got some Phase 1 projects that we had announced earlier. We just slowed the path down, and we haven\u2019t gotten going yet on Phase 2. So, the strategic review that Curt has mentioned, will obviously dictate a lot in terms of the pace and can we find a cheaper form of financing that helps us accelerate this, but still use our capital for kind of its highest return. And so we will share that as we bring the details of that going forward. But it\u2019s the pipeline we talked about before, just a little bit slower go given we were resetting post Uri. But the projects that we have are moving forward well and the battery projects in California are performing well.\nCurt Morgan: And Steve, one thing \u2013 one other thing to add on that, Andrews County is one that we pulled back when we pulled back to this lower spend. And that was initially \u2013 this is why I talked about having the capability and having the discipline in development. If you are a development company, then all you are going to do is kind of build this thing up and flip it, it\u2019s a little bit different. But we were going to have to live with it. But we had some issues with congestion. And we have worked with Encore, and we now believe that side, you could go up to 200 megawatts. But this is the kind of stuff that we have a dedicated group on transmission that are incredible at what they do. And they can keep us out of issues by over-developing in an area and then having congestion and having the price reduced significantly. And so that \u2013 we have pulled that back, but now since we have been able to work it, it\u2019s a project we will do later. And as Jim said, we control that site. So, that was part of why we also pulled that back.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Just I guess, a high-level question related to the renewables is just in your slide, you mentioned the alternatives to accelerate the pace of development using a cheaper cost of capital, which makes a lot of sense and it frees up a lot more capital for buyback. In terms of then the mix of the company, if someone else is going to own some of this, like can you grow the business fast enough, quicker that even if somebody is going to own some of it, the overall company keeps moving a lot greener over the period, if someone, if you have a partner?\nCurt Morgan: Yes, sure. So yes, I mean that\u2019s a really good question and one that we have spent a lot of time. Jim and I have recently, by the way. But you are talking about whether \u2013 how do you do this, is this a JV and those things tend to have governance associated with them, and there is a lot to them. I think the way we are thinking about it, Steve, is there is a couple of ways to do this. There is \u2013 you can have an equity investment, you can also have sort of, what I will call, a structured financing where it\u2019s \u2013 maybe it\u2019s a preferred \u2013 convertible preferred or something like that. There is a number of ways to cut this in terms of how do you raise the capital against the spend and the value of the company that can allow you to grow this company and to maintain the ownership and the governance that allows you to control the shots, because you can\u2019t get into a situation if you don\u2019t have the right partner, where it can get gummed up. And that\u2019s not what we are looking to do. What we are looking to do is get access to \u2013 there is a lot of capital out there right now and a lot of infrastructure funds and a lot of people looking for companies like us that are legitimate that have a capability. And so we think that we can raise reasonably priced capital in a governance-friendly manner to continue to allow us to grow our business. And so we will see and the extent of how much the party would have a governance position in the company will depend on the size of the capital investment and the type of capital investment, and there will be a balance that we will make there. We have got a number of good friends out there that are interested in this. And we know this because there are people \u2013 there are inbounds coming to us because I am making comments like this on calls like this. But we know that there is interest in this. And then it comes down to just what do the terms look like. But we have people that we know that were like-minded with that we can \u2013 that we could work with. And that we believe that understand what we are trying to do, which is accelerate this, not slow it down.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay, great. It makes a lot of sense. Thank you.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hi. Good morning team. Just on the sort of the \u2013 just on the strategic review, you have mentioned the size of the check. I am just wondering like as you go into the sort of the Q3 call and as you think through this, is there a possibility to not sell the company outright, but perhaps get a like-minded partner, who sees the value in the cash flow stream, sell a portion of the assets or a portion of companies. Is that a possibility?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Absolutely.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay, perfect. And then just in terms of just the buyback you mentioned, obviously, the currencies, is heavily discounted. On the Q3 call, should we expect sort of a form of program to be announced or like what to sort of \u2013 you had this previous guidance of \u2013 I think it was $1.5 billion worth in share buyback. So, should we expect a larger program or would you have done \u2013 you have taken some actions before then?\nCurt Morgan: I hesitate to get into precise numbers because we are working through this. We have a pretty big program that we already have out there for the next couple of years. I think what you are going to hear though is what we would like to do even longer term. I mean I think we would like to paint a picture, again. We have got this core business that generates a lot of cash. And I think we would like to earmark that to returning a bunch of cash. And so we want to give a picture of the future that goes multi-years and just kind of shows just how much return of capital that we can do over that period of time from that business. And then I think we also would like to paint a picture of what the growth side of our business would look like. And those two, let\u2019s call them, two separate businesses and two separate tracks. But at some point, those two ultimately merge again. I think our biggest problem has been is that people can\u2019t envision the company long-term. They say, well, at some point, those thermal assets are going to go away. But if you have two tracks, one that you are generating a lot of cash and you are returning it to shareholders from your core business and you are building this large burgeoning renewable and battery business. At some point, those merge again. And then you have solved your long-term terminal value because our retail business isn\u2019t going anywhere. And we are going to grow that business. It\u2019s how we manufacture power, electricity that matters. And we have got a great business that returns a lot of capital. And I think will continue to do so for a long time that we can return to shareholders. We also have advantaged sites in a core capability to be able to grow in renewables and batteries. And we want to be able to unlock both of those things. We think bringing in partners and additional capital is the way to do that. And then at some point in time, those two merge again and that you have this \u2013 you can then visualize this company in the long run because the supply side of our business has been essentially replaced from thermal to renewable and batteries. That\u2019s really the vision here. And then we need to get into the details of how that happens.\nDurgesh Chopra: That makes a ton of a sense, Curt. Thank you. Just a quick one here, could you \u2013 could there be share buybacks this year in 2021? Potentially, previously, you have said because of Uri and sort of the balance sheet there would be no share buybacks in 2020, but could you reevaluate that?\nCurt Morgan: We could. We could reevaluate that. Yes.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. I appreciate you taking time.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Thank you. Thanks for the questions.\nOperator: And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Curt Morgan for any closing remarks.\nCurt Morgan: Thanks again everybody for joining the Q2 call. I know it\u2019s a busy \u2013 a very busy day. We tried to \u2013 we thought it was a pretty yeoman like quarter. The company has rebounded well. So, we didn\u2019t want to take the full hour. Hopefully, this will give you some time. But we \u2013 a lot to talk about in the future, in the near-term we will be getting back to you soon with the strategic direction and the capital allocation. So, thanks again. I hope everybody is well. Take care.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Curt Morgan",
            "content": "Thank you, Molly and good morning to everyone on the call. As always, we appreciate your interest in Vistra, especially on this crowded earnings reporting day. As we find ourselves at the start of August already, the fact that the power markets are in a state of transition continues to be apparent. California, Texas and New York have all requested conservation at various times during the summer. June of 2021 was America's hottest June in 127 years of records, meeting the prior record from June of 2016 by 0.8 degrees. Much of this record-breaking heat has been observed in the Pacific Northwest. North Texas was actually slightly below the 10-year average in June with April and May also being very mild. So as a nation, there is no question that temperatures have been on the rise in 2021 as have the extremes in weather conditions. These weather extremes, coupled with the greater percentage of renewable resources making up the supply stack in various markets, have resulted in a heightened sensitivity to scarcity conditions by the system operators, reinforcing the importance of thermal resources, especially natural gas and maintaining a reliable grid now and several years into the future. Power markets and systems must also balance decarbonization efforts with affordability and reliability, which is proving to be a challenge as evidenced in California and Texas. Given the uncertainty with COVID-19, especially the Delta variant and the country's desire to return to normal, we have continued to prioritize the safety of our number one asset, our people, while delivering reliable and affordable power to our customers. The second quarter results we are announcing today reflect this dedication and focus. During the quarter, we continued our rebound from the very unfortunate impacts from Uri, most notably hardening our assets, participating in the Texas legislative and regulatory processes and refining our risk management policies. We have also begun a process to review our strategic direction and how we allocate capital. On Slide 6, we show our strong second quarter financial results. Excluding the second quarter impacts from winter storm Uri related to bill credits and higher fuels costs, Vistra delivered adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $909 million comparable to its very strong second quarter 2020 financial results. Including these Uri impacts, Vistra's adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations was $825 million. These results were pretty much in line with management expectations for the quarter. We have similarly had a solid start in the execution of the self-help initiatives we identified when we announced our revised financial guidance in April. We currently have a line of sight to achieving the vast majority of the $500 million of self-help initiatives we previously announced. And we have achieved more than 40% through June 30. We will continue to pursue the full $500 million, but only to the extent we do not jeopardize the future risk profile and/or earnings of the company. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges for both ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth as set forth on Slide 6. Importantly, excluding Uri, Vistra would be tracking in line to ahead of our pre-Uri guidance midpoint for the year. We understand that Uri happened, but we also believe it is important to recognize that the long-term earnings potential for Vistra remains intact. Turning now to Slide 7, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, power markets have recently moved up with forward curves in both ERCOT and PJM as well as our other markets, up meaningfully over the last several months. I am sure you have heard me discuss our point of view in the past, which is our modeled fundamental view of where prices are likely to move over time, incorporating various weather conditions, new build scenarios and other key variables on a probability weighted basis. Pretty much since I have been at Vistra, our point of view has decoupled from backward-dated forward curves, especially in ERCOT. Over the years, forward markets, and to some extent, settled prices have afforded Vistra the opportunity to construct realized price curves, in line with our point of view. It is interesting that the recent positive movement in 2022, forward curves have brought pricing in line with Vistra's point of view, especially in ERCOT. ERCOT sparks have increased primarily for the winter and summer months and we believe this is being driven by market participants reducing their overall risk tolerance following Uri and possibly the potential for market reforms, which could result in more favorable price formation for dispatchable resources in the future to support market reliability. In PJM, however, it is our view that the rise in power prices has been driven primarily by the increase in natural gas prices. As of July 30, Vistra is now 54% and 93% hedged in ERCOT and PJM, up from 40% and 50% respectively for 2022. We have similarly meaningfully increased our hedge positions in New York, New England, California and the MISO markets over the last several months taking advantage of the increase in outright power prices and spark spreads. The recent momentum in forward prices, primarily in ERCOT, supports our previously stated strong outlook for 2022. You might recall last fall at our virtual investor event in September, we offered an early outlook for 2022. Noting our view that in a commodity-exposed business like ours, looking at average adjusted EBITDA over time is a more appropriate way to evaluate the earnings power of the business. We further offered our view that we believe 2022 ongoing operations' adjusted EBITDA could come in line with this average concept. Specifically, we noted that the average of our 2020 and 2021 ongoing operations' adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoints was approximately $3.4 billion, which we believe could be indicative of 2022 financial performance and reflected our point of view pricing. At that time, curves were lower. With the recent uplift in forward curves, especially in ERCOT, we continue to believe 2022 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations could be in the range of $3.4 billion, excluding the impact of the retail bill credits from Uri, with a 60% to 70% conversion to adjusted free cash flow before growth. I am now on Slide 8. As we mentioned on our business update call in April, Vistra is taking several actions intended to address the risks we were exposed to during winter storm Uri. First, we are investing nearly $50 million in 2021 prior to the 2022 winter on improvements to further harden our coal fuel handling capabilities and to further weatherize our Texas fleet for even colder temperatures and longer durations. We intend to spend up to another $30 million in 2022 to further enhance the ability for our fleet to withstand extreme weather conditions. We have also contracted for a meaningful amount of additional gas storage, which performed well during the storm to support our gas fleet and we are installing dual-fuel capabilities at our gas steam units, while similarly increasing the fuel oil inventory at our dual-fuel sites. Last, we plan to carry more generation linked into the peak seasons, increasing the level of physical insurance we carry to protect against volatility. The absolute level of excess generation we carry will be a function of our investments, in our generation infrastructure and the ERCOT market improvements that are implemented going forward. In addition to these improvements, we are making on a standalone basis, the Texas legislature recently passed legislation that provides for mapping of the integrated gas and electric systems, which should help to alleviate gas deliverability issues by identifying critical infrastructure, allowing for weatherization and registration with the transmission and distribution utilities to ensure that those assets continue to operate in the inclement conditions and receive power in the event of rolling outages in the future. We have already seen a significant amount of registration activity since Uri. We intend to play a role in ensuring the efforts to map and identify critical gas and power infrastructure are carried out in a manner that results in the intended reduction of risk to the integrated systems. Last, both ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission of Texas are evaluating various market reform alternatives to reduce risk and ensure that dispatchable resources have adequate revenues to incent investment and serve to balance the system with a growing number of intermittent renewables. We believe any such reforms could further improve ERCOT's risk profile for market participants and enhance the attractiveness of the market. The process is in its early stages. So, it is difficult at this time to speculate on what form these reforms might take, though very clearly, ERCOT and the PUCT are focused on ensuring that Texans have reliable electricity going forward, reinforcing the importance of dispatchable resources like Vistra's. The most likely potential areas for reform are to the operating reserve demand curve, including reducing the price gap and extending the amount of reserves on the curve and additional ancillary services to incentivize new investment and maintain existing dispatchable generations. Before I turn the call over to Jim, I would like to comment briefly on our strategic direction and capital allocation review. As we noted on our business update call in April, the events of Uri required us to step back and rethink our strategic direction, enterprise risk and how we allocate capital. The goal is to unlock the value of our company that we strongly believe remains intact. As you likely know, the events of Uri also have setback the timeline for a potential investment grade rating to at least the end of 2022 or at some point in 2023. The strategic review will undoubtedly address our leverage targets in the pursuit of investment grade credit ratings. However, regardless of the direction we take, Vistra will always maintain a strong balance sheet that allows us to withstand extreme risk, pursue business opportunities and attract investors. We understand the urgency of this work given where our stock is trading, but we also want to be prudent in our deliberations. We intend to provide more information when we have news to discuss on our longer term strategic direction, no later than our third quarter earnings call in early November. Probably the most important point is that our deliberations have confirmed our confidence in the long-term value of our business. It is incumbent on us to put together the plan to realize this value and we intend to do so. We believe that our relatively young low-cost assets that we are de-risking will play a critical role in the energy transition for the next couple of decades, which when combined with our attractive retail and zero carbon businesses should deliver relatively consistent financial results, while generating a substantial amount of free cash flow on an annual basis. At today's stock price, investing in our stock has to be at the top of the list of where to allocate our capital. We look forward to talking more about our strategic direction and how we plan to allocate our significant cash flow in the months ahead. I will now turn the call over to Jim Burke. Hey, Shar. Good to hear from you. Yes, Shar. So thank you. That's a great question, a lot in that question. So \u2013 but that \u2013 I mean I knew that I figured we get that question. I think after the Uri event, I think most people would expect that management team and the Board, we're going to sit down and have a discussion about our business. And something that \u2013 obviously, it was a risk that we did not contemplate and to just brush it off and say we're going to go at things business as usual. I don't think that would have sat well with anybody and certainly not with me and not with the Board. So I think the first and foremost that we felt a sense of urgency. And of course, you got \u2013 you know this, I mean, our stock sold off big and more so actually than the actual math that you would put into it in terms of our shares divided into the loss itself. So there was a loss in confidence. And I understand that. But we had to rethink things going forward, and I think that's what we're doing. I don't know that anything has really changed that much. But we \u2013 I think there are four main pillars that are driving us as we go through our strategic direction and as we think about allocating capital. Number one is our stock is incredibly cheap. And we went \u2013 we've done a lot of analysis, and we still believe that we're significantly undervalued. And so we have to think about what's the best way to invest in our own company. If others don't believe in us, then we need to believe in ourselves, and we generate a lot of cash. And so I think we have to take a hard look at buying back our shares. And that ultimately adds value to the shareholders to stay in the company. And so it's a good use of capital in our mind. We said this in our remarks, Jim and I did that we want to have a strong balance sheet. We never started this though with the idea that we had to pursue investment-grade rating. That kind of came along with it. And if we get there, that's fine. What's more important is we have a balance sheet that can withstand the kind of risk that we did with Uri. We were sitting here at 5 or 6, maybe 7x debt-to-EBITDA, like the IPPs in the past. We probably would be talking about a completely different situation right now than what we are. So we believe a strong balance sheet. It's still one of the cornerstones of our company, but we're not going to be penny wise and pound foolish. So we're going to look real hard at that. We think dividend will continue to be a part of what we do. And finally, we did a review of our renewable and battery business. And we have one of the best businesses. We see just about every development company that's trying to sell itself right now. We know what those teams look like. We understand NextEra has got an incredible business and kudos to them, but we're not second to anybody else in our view. We've got a great pipeline. We're using sites that have access to transmission. We have a tremendous capability in terms of development. Development is not just about going out and getting in the interconnection queue. You've got to have market knowledge and experience. You have to have construction experience and operations and maintenance skills. We have the economies of scale from a functional support standpoint. We bring a lot to the table. The key for us, though, is it's a cost of capital gain. And so that's where a partner may come into this. And so we're going to take a real hard look at how we can accelerate the growth in that business and make sure that we have a competitive cost of capital in that business, and that could also mean that we may want to do some project financing, but certainly bring in probably some infrastructure-type investment. So that's what we are working on. There is no disagreement with our Board. I think our Board and the management team are in lockstep. But these things take a little bit of time, and we're sure we're going to be prudent about it. We want to make sure whatever move we make is a long-term move. We don't want to have a knee-jerk reaction here and then have to do something again. And I feel good, Shar, that we will likely do something no later than the Q3 call time frame. We'd like to obviously not do it on the Q3 call because that gets you guys all congested because you've got other things to deal with. We certainly would like to do it before that and separately, so that we can have the kind of time where we can spend time with investors and with you guys. So that's where we are on this. We're \u2013 we continue to believe in the long-term value of this company. I step back and think about it this way. We've got this incredible business that generates a tremendous amount of cash, and that cash can open up the opportunity for us to return capital. We've also got this burgeoning and very good growth business. And that business needs capital, and it also means a cost of capital advantage. That's what we need to unlock. That's what we need to solve for. And that's what we are working on to do. And I feel very good that we're on a good path to do that. But there is a lot of work to be done. We want to get to the market as soon as we can on this direction because we build the urgency, but we want to do it right. Yes. No, look, we're for sale every day. So if somebody wanted to pay an attractive price, but we're not out with hanging our shingle out there because I'll just tell you \u2013 I've said this before, you know this, . I've said it to you, but I don't \u2013 I've been in the private setting. I know what it is. I know what it takes. I know what private investors want. And I think that there are others out there that have gone private that are realizing that if you go private, it's the same thing that if we were public for these businesses, that it's a long-term gain and the idea that a private equity firm would come in here and can somehow then exit in 3 to 5 years. I just don't know who that exit would be. And the thing that makes it difficult for us is that it would take a big equity check and a significant capital raise in order to get this done. That doesn't mean that it can't happen, but that is not our primary direction. We want to take a direction that we control. We don't control that direction. And so we do something that we control and that we think can unlock this value. So that's where we're focused. Yes. Thank you. Hi, Stephen. Yes. Good question, Stephen. So look, I think I tried to say this, but I'll make it as clear as I can. We think, at the top of our list of things to use the capital from this great cash generation machine that we have is our stock right now. And so you see the free cash flow yields. The math is pretty clear. And so \u2013 but we also want to have a strong balance sheet. I went through all these things and we do think paying a dividend made some sense. And so we are going to do that. The real challenge is can we return capital and grow what we believe is a very good and like I said, burgeoning renewables and battery storage business. I mean these are opportunities because of the sites that we have and we're in locations like California. California is talking about 12,000 megawatts plus of batteries that they need to put in. We've got sites that can do that. We can't walk away from that value proposition. We want to partner with PG&E and others in the state of California and with the state of California to help them solve their \u2013 where they are trying to take their state. And we have the sites to do that. And so I think what we've concluded is there are ways to do both. And that's where we're headed. We also want \u2013 we believe that partnering with people, who have, let's say, an advantaged cost of capital and will put us in a position of having an advantaged cost of capital will put us in a better position. We have everything else there is to compete in this business, and we have the full suite of capabilities. So I don't think it's a question of whether you can do one or the other. I think we can do both. The real question is, how do we go about doing that? And that's where we're spending the time right now is concluding that effort, so that we can pursue both. There are great companies out there. I used NextEra as one. I think NextEra is a great company, and they have been able to do both. And I think we can do both. And so we're going to just have to balance that. That's where we're headed. Yes. So look, I mean this is an interesting one because Governor Pritzker would like to move the state of Illinois in a very progressive way to a leadership position in the area of clean generation. And he's pushing very hard on doing that. And he sees an opportunity with an Omnibus energy bill, if that's going to happen. And I'm interpreting he is not telling me this. I'm telling you what I'm reading through the discussions that I've had. And in so doing, that's a difficult thing because he would like to see emissions rates from thermal resources to decline and part of the legislation is pushing hard on that. And of course, that creates disruption. And there are some co-ops that own coal plants have just built them or munis I should say. That just built them not too long ago, and they still have a huge amount of debt that are on a number of different municipalities. And that creates a lot of angst. And of course, there is others like us that own thermal resources, and we're trying to sort out how does that happen. And I think even within his own party, there is a debate going on as to how you actually accomplish that. So \u2013 and that has created a bit of a divide. And I think at the end of the day, they are going to try to work together. And I believe they will because there is too much at stake here. And they will come to a reasonable conclusion to move the state forward in terms of lowering its emissions. We are in the middle of that trying to help that. The one thing that I have tried to mention to people is that if you get the Omnibus bill in place and you put the kind of stipulations in the direct auctions and require developers to actually complete their projects and get them online. That \u2013 by that very nature, will end up crowding out thermal resources and will reduce emissions without having to have a heavy handed set of criteria that forces those to happen in an unnatural fashion. And so I think if they get this bill passed and they put the right teeth in, so that they can get the development that they want of the renewable and battery resources, they will accomplish a major amount of what they want to get done. So, the real essence, though, at the end of the day, can something get done. We are cautiously optimistic that there will be a way \u2013 a path forward that everybody will come together because again, there is too much at stake. There is a lot of investment that they want to do in renewables. Our coal to solar is part of that. We feel strongly that we are solidly in the legislation. We have a very good program. It helps communities that are losing jobs from the fact that we are shutting down coal plants and investing in those communities, bringing property tax base. And we are real \u2013 we are a real company. We have real projects, and we can bring those online in a very short period of time. And so we think there is a lot in that for us as well. And so we would like to obviously help bridge this gap and work together. And that's what we are doing. We are working together with as many people as we can to try to help bridge this divide. I think it will get done, Stephen, but you would never know. And we are cautiously optimistic, but there is a lot of stake, and we think \u2013 of course, the nukes, I didn't even mention that. Those are very important to the state. They have made that very clear, so all that has to come together. Most of it is already together. At the end of the day, it's just getting through this, what do we do in the long run with thermal resources and the glide path for those to exit. And I think that's where we need to come up with a compromise, and I believe we will be able to do that. Thank you. Hi Steve. Yes. So Steve, we had said that we would put $0.5 billion \u2013 roughly $500 million. Jim, while I am answering this, Jim may be able to find the exact numbers that we have. But $0.5 billion a year, we have said for 10 years. And when we put out that 10-year view \u2013 and I think we are largely \u2013 it's a little bit more and a little bit less in a couple of years, but we were going to reinvest that amount into renewables and batteries. And we are tracking sort of in that range and that was the investment. In terms of the projects themselves, I don't have the list in front of me, but I know that we have, and I don't know, Jim, if you have that list and if you have been able to find that, but if you can pull up that list of where we are on each of the different projects. And Steve, one thing \u2013 one other thing to add on that, Andrews County is one that we pulled back when we pulled back to this lower spend. And that was initially \u2013 this is why I talked about having the capability and having the discipline in development. If you are a development company, then all you are going to do is kind of build this thing up and flip it, it's a little bit different. But we were going to have to live with it. But we had some issues with congestion. And we have worked with Encore, and we now believe that side, you could go up to 200 megawatts. But this is the kind of stuff that we have a dedicated group on transmission that are incredible at what they do. And they can keep us out of issues by over-developing in an area and then having congestion and having the price reduced significantly. And so that \u2013 we have pulled that back, but now since we have been able to work it, it's a project we will do later. And as Jim said, we control that site. So, that was part of why we also pulled that back. Yes, sure. So yes, I mean that's a really good question and one that we have spent a lot of time. Jim and I have recently, by the way. But you are talking about whether \u2013 how do you do this, is this a JV and those things tend to have governance associated with them, and there is a lot to them. I think the way we are thinking about it, Steve, is there is a couple of ways to do this. There is \u2013 you can have an equity investment, you can also have sort of, what I will call, a structured financing where it's \u2013 maybe it's a preferred \u2013 convertible preferred or something like that. There is a number of ways to cut this in terms of how do you raise the capital against the spend and the value of the company that can allow you to grow this company and to maintain the ownership and the governance that allows you to control the shots, because you can't get into a situation if you don't have the right partner, where it can get gummed up. And that's not what we are looking to do. What we are looking to do is get access to \u2013 there is a lot of capital out there right now and a lot of infrastructure funds and a lot of people looking for companies like us that are legitimate that have a capability. And so we think that we can raise reasonably priced capital in a governance-friendly manner to continue to allow us to grow our business. And so we will see and the extent of how much the party would have a governance position in the company will depend on the size of the capital investment and the type of capital investment, and there will be a balance that we will make there. We have got a number of good friends out there that are interested in this. And we know this because there are people \u2013 there are inbounds coming to us because I am making comments like this on calls like this. But we know that there is interest in this. And then it comes down to just what do the terms look like. But we have people that we know that were like-minded with that we can \u2013 that we could work with. And that we believe that understand what we are trying to do, which is accelerate this, not slow it down. Thank you. Yes. Absolutely. I hesitate to get into precise numbers because we are working through this. We have a pretty big program that we already have out there for the next couple of years. I think what you are going to hear though is what we would like to do even longer term. I mean I think we would like to paint a picture, again. We have got this core business that generates a lot of cash. And I think we would like to earmark that to returning a bunch of cash. And so we want to give a picture of the future that goes multi-years and just kind of shows just how much return of capital that we can do over that period of time from that business. And then I think we also would like to paint a picture of what the growth side of our business would look like. And those two, let's call them, two separate businesses and two separate tracks. But at some point, those two ultimately merge again. I think our biggest problem has been is that people can't envision the company long-term. They say, well, at some point, those thermal assets are going to go away. But if you have two tracks, one that you are generating a lot of cash and you are returning it to shareholders from your core business and you are building this large burgeoning renewable and battery business. At some point, those merge again. And then you have solved your long-term terminal value because our retail business isn't going anywhere. And we are going to grow that business. It's how we manufacture power, electricity that matters. And we have got a great business that returns a lot of capital. And I think will continue to do so for a long time that we can return to shareholders. We also have advantaged sites in a core capability to be able to grow in renewables and batteries. And we want to be able to unlock both of those things. We think bringing in partners and additional capital is the way to do that. And then at some point in time, those two merge again and that you have this \u2013 you can then visualize this company in the long run because the supply side of our business has been essentially replaced from thermal to renewable and batteries. That's really the vision here. And then we need to get into the details of how that happens. We could. We could reevaluate that. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. Thanks again everybody for joining the Q2 call. I know it's a busy \u2013 a very busy day. We tried to \u2013 we thought it was a pretty yeoman like quarter. The company has rebounded well. So, we didn't want to take the full hour. Hopefully, this will give you some time. But we \u2013 a lot to talk about in the future, in the near-term we will be getting back to you soon with the strategic direction and the capital allocation. So, thanks again. I hope everybody is well. Take care."

            "content": "Thank you, Curt. As shown on Slide 10, Vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $825 million. Excluding the Uri-related bill credits and fuel cost adjustments, Vistra's adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations was $909 million, results that are comparable to our exceptionally strong second quarter 2020 financial results. Period-over-period, our retail segment results were $109 million higher than second quarter 2020, driven by the realization of our self-help initiatives in \u201821. The collective generation segments ended the quarter $213 million lower than second quarter 2020 driven primarily by lower realized prices in Texas after an exceptionally strong 2020 and lower capacity revenues. Importantly, the long-term earnings power of this company has not been affected by Uri, which was a highly unusual event. In fact, without the impact of Uri, we expect we would have been reaffirming our pre-Uri guidance today, which had an adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations midpoint of $3.275 billion. Next year, excluding the impact from Uri bill credits, we believe we have the ability to deliver adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations in the $3.4 billion range, with 60% to 70% conversion to free cash flow before growth. All of this to say, we continue to believe this business will have significant capital to allocate in the years ahead, which takes me to Slide 11. Last week, our Board approved our third quarter 2021 dividend of $0.15 or $0.60 on an annual basis, subject to Board approval at the appropriate times. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, though as Curt mentioned, we believe we are still a couple of years out from a potential investment grade credit rating. In the second quarter of 2021, we did execute one capital markets transaction, issuing $1.25 billion of 4.375% senior unsecured notes due May 1, 2029. We used the proceeds to repay all of the outstanding principal amounts of the $1.25 billion, 364-day term loan A that we issued following Uri. Beyond our priority to maintain a strong balance sheet, we also view our stock is significantly undervalued. We continue to believe that share buybacks at these levels would be one of the most attractive uses of our capital, and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to reallocate capital for the remainder of 2021. Last, as we previously discussed, we are also evaluating alternatives to accelerate the pace of our renewable development using lower cost capital. All of these capital allocation tenants are being evaluated in our current review. So please stay tuned for more to come on these topics in the months ahead. In closing, while winter storm Uri was a significant one-time financial hit in the first quarter, our business has been able to get back on track and execute well in the second quarter. And with the recent uptick in forward curves in both PJM and ERCOT, our forward outlook has only improved, with management expecting that we will be able to deliver strong adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow before growth in \u201822 and beyond. We believe in the value of this business and our ability to generate significant free cash flow for allocation in the years ahead. In fact, with our long-term view that we will be able to generate $3 billion or more of adjusted EBITDA with 60% to 70% conversion to free cash flow on an annual basis, we could repurchase our entire market cap in roughly 5 years if we would allocate all of this capital to share buybacks, attractive value in our opinion our teams are committed to execution. We prioritize operational excellence, low-cost operations and disciplined financial management. As always, we are focused on delivering safe and reliable electricity to our customers, while creating value for our stakeholders over the long term. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions. Sure. Steve, we had in our Investor Day, we had talked about a capital allocation plan that would put over $600 million into \u201821. We said $650 million approximately in \u201821 and $500 million in \u201822. We scaled the $650 million down to $425 million for this year. And we did that as part of the earlier questions. We are kind of reading the market signals on where we should best allocate our capital. And we control these sites. So, these were sites that we can bring on in the timeframe that we would like. We are going to be the off-taker predominantly for the Texas sites. And so this gives us a lot of flexibility to be able to bring them on and do it in the timeframe that makes the most sense for us. As far as the sites themselves, we have both the Moss 300 and 100 which were completed and those are operating with an RA agreement from PG&E. The other sites that we are focused on are the Brightside Solar project, the DeCordova battery project, which is our hybrid project here in Texas. We have got Emerald Grove, and we have got just a little bit of spend to keep some options alive at a few other sites. That's the bulk of our spend for this year. And we are going to continue to build out for the balance of this year. We have got some Phase 1 projects that we had announced earlier. We just slowed the path down, and we haven't gotten going yet on Phase 2. So, the strategic review that Curt has mentioned, will obviously dictate a lot in terms of the pace and can we find a cheaper form of financing that helps us accelerate this, but still use our capital for kind of its highest return. And so we will share that as we bring the details of that going forward. But it's the pipeline we talked about before, just a little bit slower go given we were resetting post Uri. But the projects that we have are moving forward well and the battery projects in California are performing well."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMeagan Horn: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Vistra's investor webcast, discussing fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, which is being broadcast live on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, the related press release and recent annual and quarterly reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Joining me for today's call are Jim Burke, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior Executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call, as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I would like to note that today's press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call all include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of the company's website. Also today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statement included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks and forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Meagan. Good morning. I'm pleased to be here with you all to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, which we believe is a positive and straightforward message. Beginning on Slide 5, as we've reiterated over these past quarters, we remain vigilant and focused on our strategic priorities throughout the year, and the 2022 results demonstrate that focus and set us up well for the future. We believe that operating an integrated business model provides the stability and consistency that our customers and our shareholders expect and our operations throughout extreme weather events this past year, we believe, have proved this thesis. You'll recall that we initiated guidance for 2022 for adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations with a midpoint of $3.06 billion. Despite extreme volatility in commodities and numerous weather events, including winter storm Elliott at the end of December, we ended the year exceeding this midpoint by $55 million. Importantly, we delivered strong adjusted free cash flows along with these higher earnings, delivering a final adjusted free cash flow before growth of $129 million above the midpoint of the narrow guidance range we introduced in the third quarter of 2022. Our integrated portfolio also supported our comprehensive hedging strategy we executed throughout 2022, with the goal of locking an out-year earnings potential in years 2023 to 2025. Kris will speak to this in more detail later, but we concluded the year at approximately 73% hedged across '23 to '25 across all markets. This hedging percentage and the current forward curves continue to support the estimated $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion midpoint of adjusted EBITDA earnings potentials in those years. And with our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint set at $3.7 billion, we look forward to executing squarely on these opportunities. We continue to see Vistra generate significant cash flows and our strategic priorities remain focused on returning meaningful value to our shareholders. Kris will provide a detailed update on our capital allocation plan, but I will note that we returned approximately $2.25 billion to shareholders via our share repurchase program from November 2021 through December 2022, approximately $250 million more than we had originally planned. Additionally, we paid out $300 million in common stock dividends in 2022, as planned, with each quarter's dividend per share growing as the share count was reduced. The fourth quarter dividend paid in December 2022 represented a 29% increase over the fourth quarter dividend paid in December of '21. We expect shareholders to continue to experience increases in dividend returns into 2023 as we expect to continue to pay out an aggregate $300 million in annual dividends due to decreasing number of shares of Vistra common stock. We remain vigilant this year in maintaining a strong balance sheet. While our debt balance did grow to provide the liquidity we needed to support our comprehensive hedging strategy, we achieved our goal of a sub-3x leverage after margin deposits are considered at year-end. We held our debt capacity steady at year-end as we saw less return of margin than originally expected. We have seen the margin deposits start to return to us in the first quarter of 2023, and we continue to actively manage our liquidity and focus on opportunistic timing and structures to further optimize our balance sheet. With the goal to achieve our long-term sub-3x debt leverage ratio target on a pre-margin deposit basis over time. Finally, we are proud of the results we saw in our Vistra Zero business this past year. We added over 400 megawatts of renewable and storage capacity in 2022, and we expect to add another 350 megawatts of storage capacity in California at our Moss Landing Phase 3 facility in mid-2023. We also retired approximately 2,900 megawatts of Ohio and Illinois coal facilities at our Zimmer, Joppa and Edwards plants. We appreciate the dedication of our teams who work at these sites for decades, powering our communities and always with a sharp focus on safety. We are pleased to be able to redevelop these sites in the future Vistra Zero energy facilities. Notably, the Joppa and Edwards sites are part of our Illinois Coal to Solar program where we are transitioning numerous sites into solar and/or storage facilities. Turning to Slide 6. We had a strong 2022, ending the year with $3.115 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. This is $55 million above the $3.06 billion midpoint we said in the third quarter of 2021. We achieved nearly $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow before growth, $129 million higher than the narrowed guidance midpoint we set in the third quarter of '22. Our financial achievements were underscored by the strong performance of our retail and generation teams. Our flagship retail brand TXU Energy continues to execute well, growing Texas residential customers nearly 2% year-over-year, while maintaining its PUCT 5-star rating. Our Generation team has proven its ability to perform in extreme weather conditions in both the summer and winter months, optimizing the maintenance of our fleet to stand ready to perform when needed. The team's commitment is illustrated by the 95.4% commercial availability achieved fleet-wide this past year. Safety remains our top priority and the culture of continuous improvement is exemplified in our Vistra best defense safety program. I'm pleased with our performance in 2022, but through continuous improvement, we see opportunities to perform operationally at an even higher level in 2023. We now look forward to delivering on the financial guidance we set forth last quarter for 2023. We are reaffirming our $3.4 billion to $4 billion adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations range for 2023 as well as reaffirming our $1.75 billion to $2.35 billion adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range. It is early in the year, but notably, despite the volatility in commodity prices we've experienced lately, we continue to have the line of sight to achieve the expectations we've set for ourselves given the potential value our comprehensive hedging program has locked in for 2023. I will now hand the call over to Kris to discuss the 2022 fourth quarter and annual performance in more detail.\nKris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Starting on Slide 8, Vistra delivered solid fourth quarter results in 2022 with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $771 million, including $359 million from Retail and $412 million from Generation. For the year, Vistra delivered $3.115 billion of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations, including $923 million for retail and $2.192 billion from Generation. Retail's results exceeded the midpoint of its component of our 2022 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations guidance of $700 million by $223 million. Our favorable results were primarily driven by strong residential margins, claim management and customer counts in ERCOT, offset partially by PJM and New York, New England counts and margins. Moving now to Generation. Its adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations results came in under the midpoint of the Generation component of guidance by $168 million, primarily driven by low first quarter prices in ERCOT, coal constraints and higher default service costs, partially offset by higher realized prices and strong commercial availability. Turning now to Slide 9. We are providing an update on the progress we've made on our capital allocation plan. As of February 23, we had executed approximately $2.45 billion of share repurchases since beginning the program in the fourth quarter of 2021. This includes an incremental $200 million since the end of 2022. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $800 million of authorization by year-end 2023. Notably, as of February 23, our outstanding share count had fallen to approximately 381 million shares outstanding, which represents an approximately 21% reduction from the aggregate number of shares that were outstanding just under 16 months ago. Additionally, in 2022, we delivered on our goal to pay $300 million in dividends to our common stockholders each year, and we continue to execute against that goal as we head into 2023. To that end, we recently declared the quarterly dividend to be paid on Vistra's common stock in the amount of $0.1975 per share or approximately $75 million in the aggregate, payable on March 31, 2023. This is an approximately 16% growth in dividend per share as compared to the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2022. While returning cash directly to our shareholders remains a priority, we also continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. Importantly, we continue to target a long-term net leverage ratio, excluding any nonrecourse debt at Vistra Zero of less than 3x. While we did in the year with a higher debt balance than we planned, that higher balance corresponds to the higher levels of adjusted EBITDA opportunities we now have in years 2023 through 2025 as a result of our comprehensive hedging strategy, the execution of which required additional liquidity. Even with the higher debt balance, we achieved a sub-3x leverage on an after margin deposit basis at year-end. As we have reported in prior quarters, we continue to pursue Vistra Zero growth, and once again, we emphasize that we anticipate financing that growth by using primarily third-party capital along with the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the $1 billion of green preferred stock and ongoing Vistra Zero free cash flow. Turning to Slide 10. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA with a $3.7 billion midpoint for 2023. As you can see on Slide 10, we are providing an update on the forward power and gas price curves as of February 23. While there has been noticeable volatility over the past year, prices are still holding in the range of the April 29, 2022 curves, which were the basis for the estimate of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion of potential ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint range for each of years '24 and '25. Importantly, as of the end of 2022, we were approximately 73% hedged on average across all markets for 2023 through 2025, with 2023 approximately 90% hedged and 2024, approximately 76% hedged. As Jim stated, we are pleased with our 2022 accomplishments, but we are focused on continuous improvement as we deliver on our 2023 priorities. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShar Pourreza: Realize it still kind of ways off, but I guess given the volatility we've seen in the backdrop, I think it'd be kind of helpful for The Street, how should we sort of think about the EBITDA in '26 and beyond? The curves would imply a bit of a step down, obviously, not as liquid that far out from a hedging perspective. And I guess, any general sense you can give there like you've been doing for '25?\nJim Burke: Shar, this is Jim. We knew when we put out 3-year kind of views, we get asked about before and it's not surprising. What's interesting about the curves is that '26 is actually hanging in there relative to '25. You see gas, obviously, still has a little bit of contango in it. We're seeing the heat rates hold up. We're certainly way more open in '26, and the liquidity there is not obviously the same as the near term. But right now, it's just that we're really open in '26, Shar, but actually, the '26 on just sort of a view as to where the curves are today. If we could actually lock that in, we feel pretty good about where we would guide for '26. It's just that's a long ways off, and it's not as liquid as we'd like it to be to be able to act on it. I'm not even sure from a point of view that we would act on it fully, if we could. I think we think that some things might be a little bit overdone on at least as we see the view now with the mild winter and that putting that kind of downward pressure we've seen on the complex overall. But it's a good question. It's one we talk about every day, as we look at how we commercially optimize the business, but '26 is hanging in there.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect. And then, Jim, a lot of different data points flying around this winter on the PCM and ERCOT. I realize it's not yet a completely done deal, but I guess how should we sort of think about potential uplift to your assets, if it's passed? You guys should have done the math, and obviously, is there still a door open to do something else down there?\nJim Burke: The PCM, as you know, is the leading concept at the moment as a proposal passed by the Public Utility Commission 50 in January. A lot of alternatives still being discussed there. The one thing to note about the PCM is, it was passed, I would say, more with the conceptual framework. The details are still to be worked out, things like what is the reliability standard that the state is actually going to procure resources to ensure reliability. What is the net CONE, what's the slope of the demand curve. There's just a lot of things to work out. And so this idea of trying to calculate its value, I think there's really a couple of concepts we would want to make sure when we get through the stakeholder process. One is, is it material enough to attract investment? And that's one of the ideas that is the concept behind doing anything with market reform. And is it enough to retain the Generation that's currently there? So to the extent that we end up with a PCM that just does not have a lot of value in it, it could be a concept and it could be implemented, but it may not do much attracting of investment or retaining of assets. And I think you'll hear the debate down there that's happening in Austin, there are many stakeholders that do not believe that we have to do significant market reform. We're concerned about market reform from the standpoint that the state of Texas from a reliability standpoint will need to actually incentivize new generation while retaining the existing because we are such a strong economy, and we're seeing the load growth here in markets unlike anywhere else in the country. So I think, Shar, it's too early to say what the PCM is going to provide. Obviously, we believe in a dispatchable resource emphasis around PCM. We think that's core to grid reliability, but there's too many things to still work out in the stakeholder process, if this is the leading concept coming out of the legislative session.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect. And then, Jim, one last one for me, I promise. Just on the inorganic side, I mean we've seen nuclear assets in the East come to market in recent months. One of your peers obviously has been very vocal that they couldn't bridge the bid ask there. Is this something you've considered or would you consider in the future? Any thoughts there would be appreciated.\nJim Burke: Yes, sure, sure. We're obviously not going to comment on any specific aspect of M&A, but you've seen this in the past. If they can leverage our core capabilities, it'd be a consideration. We've done it with Dynegy, Crius, Ambit. I view it as -- I think we're good at 3 things. I think we're very good at operating plants, serving customers and commercially integrating these 2 activities, which as you know, operate in a followable commodity market. So I think we would look at things, and we have been around processes and that's part of just our core strategy of looking how -- looking at ways that we can maximize value for shareholders, but I wouldn't put a caveat. Our investors have been very clear that they do like our return of capital strategy. We try to be very consistent with that approach, as Kris laid out, and I think that still remains our priority. So anything that we're going to consider in that front, I believe, needs to fit within that framework that may or may not be possible, but we have a priority around returning capital to shareholders. And if we can do that and leverage our core capabilities, we'd be interested.\nShar Pourreza: Terrific, guys. Congrats on the execution and much appreciated.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: I was wondering -- let's see. Could you speak just a little bit more to the Winter Storm Elliott events. Curious if you could just elaborate a bit on how your Generation facilities operated, if there were any penalties that you might have experienced? And then also on the Retail side of things, how did you manage the unexpectedly strong load and get through that weather event?\nJim Burke: Sure. It's a good question. So obviously, we ended the year with a really strong weather system that affected not just one market, but multiple markets. When we go into these events and some of this has been refined since Uri, we carry more length into these events because we've seen that particularly, in winter events, you can actually have some fuel disruptions, not just asset performance challenges. So we try to take that into consideration. So we hold back length on the Generation side, and then we expect that retail load, particularly in extremely cold weather, can swing even more than what we would normally have expected on a winter day. And we expect those 2 to offset each other, and in Winter Storm Elliot, that's what happened. So we were able to run our ERCOT fleet, and our fleet performed really well -- and in PJM. And that extra length from an energy perspective covered the extra swing that we experienced on the retail side. On the penalty specifically, because PJM has yet another aspect to it with the penalties, you could be in a bonus or a penalty situation. And our view at this point, although we do not have full information yet from PJM, is that we're in a net bonus situation, not by a lot, but we are in a net bonus situation. But we haircut a bonus expectations because of some of the default risk that others are concerned about, and this actual process could take 8 or 9 months to receive payments for people that are in a penalty, and they need to pay in order for us to receive a bonus. So we've assumed for this purpose that we basically have a breakeven penalty bonus situation in PJM with that haircut on the bonuses. And so we came out of the storm where we expected to be. What we like about our business is, we can handle these events. What you tend to see in the aftermath of these events is some more volatility potentially in the forward curve. And then we try to hedge into that, and that's how we're able to provide the guidance that we provide. But we don't go into any one event looking for it to be a significantly positive or negative event because we're on both sides, the Gen and the Retail. And we try to come out of that event, and we had a good performance at Elliot.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. That's great to hear. Obviously, a very tough event for a lot of generators. And then I was curious if you could just give an update on the margin deposits so far this year. Is there a level that you could give us as to what that currently stands at? I think you mentioned that it was kind of coming back in slower than expected. So curious if that's starting to improve.\nKris Moldovan: Yes. This is Kris. So as of the end of the fourth quarter we talked about, we had expected to start seeing margin deposits come back as we settled our \u2013 settled some of those hedges in the fourth quarter. With the volatility that continued on in the fourth quarter, especially in December, we actually saw margin deposits go up from September 30 through the end of the year. Over the past 1.5 months, prices and volatility have settled a little bit, and we are seeing some return of cash, and so \u2013 and we\u2019ve also settled some additional hedges. So we are seeing cash come back in, and we do expect more cash to come in, in the near term and over the course of the year. And over the course of the year, we would expect a significant portion of the \u2013 over $3 billion of cash that we had posted to come back.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Jim, can we get your updated thoughts on capital allocation, share buybacks, et cetera, et cetera. On the Q2 call last year, you announced $1.25 billion in additional share buybacks that you're going to complete this year. But just can we get your latest thoughts there? And when should we -- from a timing perspective, when should us and investors be looking for an update in terms of your forward-looking share buyback plans?\nKris Moldovan: Durgesh, this is Kris. I appreciate the question. So when we did upsize the program in the middle of the year last year and that was in part as we were seeing increased opportunity for 2023 that we went ahead and added that increase into the middle of last year. So we added a $250 million. As we disclosed this morning, we ended up completing the first $2.25 billion approximately of the program by the end of the year. And as you know, we have a 3.25 upsize program that we said that would be by the end of this year. So that left $1 billion for 2023. And we had said that we thought share buybacks would be at least $1 billion starting in 2023 through 2026. We have also disclosed today that we have already, through February 23, executed another approximately $200 million. So that would leave approximately $800 million for the final 10 months of the year, which is consistent with going into the year, how we thought about it. We will -- as with same as last year, any changes to capital allocation, including share buybacks, we wouldn't likely consider those and talk to our Board about those until after we get through the important winter and summer months. So I'm not predicting any changes or updates as we had last year, but if there were to be any, that would probably come after we've gotten through a couple of the summer months.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. So back half of the year. And then my next question is on the nuclear fuel. I see sort of you kind of reiterated your nuclear fuel expense projections for 2023. Some of your peers are showing a pretty sizable ramp-up in nuclear fuel costs looking out in the future. Can you comment on that, please?\nJim Burke: Sure. Yes, it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s one that we\u2019re staying close to. We forward buy nuclear fuel, as you would expect. We buy the various components that allow us to have the fuel assemblies for our reloads. On a historical basis, we\u2019ve seen it be somewhere around $5 a megawatt hour a fairly good estimate, if you were to take all of the capital costs and kind of spread them out over the megawatt hours of production. The team has been forward buying, and that\u2019s why you saw a bigger CapEx number in \u201822. We have a bigger CapEx number in \u201823. Our best view of this is, as you spread that out over the time period in the 2025, 2026, that fuel cost is working its way up from $5 to just sub $6. So if you put that on a on Comanche Peak size unit, $1 is about a $20 million per year impact. So it\u2019s not jumping to $6, just kind of migrating from a $5 cost on average historically to hedge. It's looking like it's going to be sub-$6, but heading towards $6 around that 2026 time frame. And so that gives you a sense that it is definitely on the upward trend, where there\u2019ll be some domestic opportunities for supply down the road. That remains to be seen, but I think the team has done a very nice job of getting ahead of the nuclear fuel cost escalation and sourcing, and that gives you a kind of a range of magnitude as to how we\u2019re managing through it.\nOperator: Next question will come from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.\nAngie Storozynski: So maybe a little bit more about Vistra Zero. So thank you for the additional slides. I'm just wondering, I mean it doesn't seem like the market is giving you any credit for that business. So if you could comment both on how you could extract some value from this business? And two, what's the long-term view on the profitability of this business? Or maybe as a percentage of total EBITDA, what do you think is going to come from that business? Again, any way to extract value.\nJim Burke: Sure. Angie, thank you. That's a very good question. Vistra Zero has been off to, in our view, a really strong start on the projects that we've got line of sight to. Right now, we did deliver the 3 that were in Texas in 2022, actually on time, on budget. Our focus right now is Moss 350, which will come online for this summer, which adds to the already large battery assembly of 400 megawatts, will become 750. And then we have 9 Coal to Solar projects in Illinois that were focused on the balance of this year and in 2024 to bring those on in late '24 and '25. What we've done, and you put all that together, Angie, you're still looking at about a $200 million to $250 million kind of EBITDA business. So on the basis of the 3.7, it's still not a sizable share, but it's a meaningful share. And what we've done in Texas, as you know, is we slowed down some of the merchant solar development because we've seen those returns be challenged based on not only EPC cost and panel costs, but solar is already starting to cannibalize solar in terms of price realization. So we would want to do additional solar under the right circumstances, which would likely be if it were contracted. So we slowed our process down at this point because we want to make sure that those projects make sense for us. As we stated since we announced Vistra Zero, we hold these options ourselves. They're not on a time constraint that if we don't exercise them, we lose them. And some of these sites, I think, can end up being more valuable through time as we see these interconnect queues are really hard to get through all over the country, and we own dozens and dozens of interconnect queues that we're not utilizing right now that we'd like to. So it is absolutely an option for us. I think you'll see that we will continue to grow this in a very deliberate way. But I think we've also tried to show discipline that we did not give you a headline megawatt number and just go pursue it regardless of returns. I think we've been very disciplined about the approach. And the market opportunity, clearly, with the Inflation Reduction Act is improving some of these returns even on the projects that we've already announced that are executing like Moss 350 and Coal to Solar. So I feel very good about our portfolio that we're executing on, but there is still uncertainty about the back half of the Vistra Zero portfolio and whether they can generate adequate returns. And if they do, we'll pursue it, and if they don't, then we're going to be disciplined and we'll wait because we still own the sites and have the options.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And there were questions about Comanche Peak. I'm looking at the size of your generation in Texas and your retail book. I mean, how core of an asset is it to serve your Retail load? And again, just judging by your multiple and comparable comps for nuclear plans, it seems like it would be an easy way to generate value by selling the assets. I'm just wondering how core of an asset is it for your generation-retail strategy?\nJim Burke: Dispatchable assets are core to serving Retail load. In fact, I think we have seen, and this is what Steve Muscato and his commercial team focus on every day is, can you serve Retail loads successfully, simply with renewables and batteries. And it\u2019s a really tough \u2013 it\u2019s a really tough effort to manage the risk around that. So dispatchable assets clearly are required to be successful with risk management on Retail. Comanche Peak itself, we talked about was the anchor tenant in Vistra Zero when we first announced Vistra Zero. Obviously, it\u2019s got additional support from the production tax credit. We just obviously put in for the relicensing of it, and it operates at one of the lowest cost structures, if not the lowest cost structure, in the industry. So we do occasionally get inbounds from people that ask that question, Angie, and we are obviously interested in long-term value creation, but we like the Comanche Peak asset. It fits within our portfolio in Texas, given our sizable retail presence. and obviously, nuclear has been given a new level of interest given the Inflation Reduction Act, but we will always engage ideas. But in the core competencies of \u2013 we run plants well, we serve customers well, and we commercially risk manage the 2, I think it\u2019s a core asset.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jim Burke for any closing remarks.\nJim Burke: I just want to thank everybody for joining. I want to thank the hard-working team at Vistra for a strong 2022, and we have turned our attention, and we\u2019re focused on delivering in 2023. So I hope everybody has a great morning. Look forward to talking to you again soon.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Starting on Slide 8, Vistra delivered solid fourth quarter results in 2022 with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $771 million, including $359 million from Retail and $412 million from Generation. For the year, Vistra delivered $3.115 billion of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations, including $923 million for retail and $2.192 billion from Generation. Retail's results exceeded the midpoint of its component of our 2022 adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations guidance of $700 million by $223 million. Our favorable results were primarily driven by strong residential margins, claim management and customer counts in ERCOT, offset partially by PJM and New York, New England counts and margins. Moving now to Generation. Its adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations results came in under the midpoint of the Generation component of guidance by $168 million, primarily driven by low first quarter prices in ERCOT, coal constraints and higher default service costs, partially offset by higher realized prices and strong commercial availability. Turning now to Slide 9. We are providing an update on the progress we've made on our capital allocation plan. As of February 23, we had executed approximately $2.45 billion of share repurchases since beginning the program in the fourth quarter of 2021. This includes an incremental $200 million since the end of 2022. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $800 million of authorization by year-end 2023. Notably, as of February 23, our outstanding share count had fallen to approximately 381 million shares outstanding, which represents an approximately 21% reduction from the aggregate number of shares that were outstanding just under 16 months ago. Additionally, in 2022, we delivered on our goal to pay $300 million in dividends to our common stockholders each year, and we continue to execute against that goal as we head into 2023. To that end, we recently declared the quarterly dividend to be paid on Vistra's common stock in the amount of $0.1975 per share or approximately $75 million in the aggregate, payable on March 31, 2023. This is an approximately 16% growth in dividend per share as compared to the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2022. While returning cash directly to our shareholders remains a priority, we also continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. Importantly, we continue to target a long-term net leverage ratio, excluding any nonrecourse debt at Vistra Zero of less than 3x. While we did in the year with a higher debt balance than we planned, that higher balance corresponds to the higher levels of adjusted EBITDA opportunities we now have in years 2023 through 2025 as a result of our comprehensive hedging strategy, the execution of which required additional liquidity. Even with the higher debt balance, we achieved a sub-3x leverage on an after margin deposit basis at year-end.

Turning to Slide 10. As Jim mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA with a $3.7 billion midpoint for 2023. As you can see on Slide 10, we are providing an update on the forward power and gas price curves as of February 23. While there has been noticeable volatility over the past year, prices are still holding in the range of the April 29, 2022 curves, which were the basis for the estimate of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion of potential ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint range for each of years '24 and '25. Importantly, as of the end of 2022, we were approximately 73% hedged on average across all markets for 2023 through 2025, with 2023 approximately 90% hedged and 2024, approximately 76% hedged. As Jim stated, we are pleased with our 2022 accomplishments, but we are focused on continuous improvement as we deliver on our 2023 priorities. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. Yes. This is Kris. So as of the end of the fourth quarter we talked about, we had expected to start seeing margin deposits come back as we settled our \u2013 settled some of those hedges in the fourth quarter. With the volatility that continued on in the fourth quarter, especially in December, we actually saw margin deposits go up from September 30 through the end of the year. Over the past 1.5 months, prices and volatility have settled a little bit, and we are seeing some return of cash, and so \u2013 and we've also settled some additional hedges. So we are seeing cash come back in, and we do expect more cash to come in, in the near term and over the course of the year. And over the course of the year, we would expect a significant portion of the \u2013 over $3 billion of cash that we had posted to come back. Durgesh, this is Kris. I appreciate the question. So when we did upsize the program in the middle of the year last year and that was in part as we were seeing increased opportunity for 2023 that we went ahead and added that increase into the middle of last year. So we added a $250 million. As we disclosed this morning, we ended up completing the first $2.25 billion approximately of the program by the end of the year. And as you know, we have a 3.25 upsize program that we said that would be by the end of this year. So that left $1 billion for 2023. And we had said that we thought share buybacks would be at least $1 billion starting in 2023 through 2026. We have also disclosed today that we have already, through February 23, executed another approximately $200 million. So that would leave approximately $800 million for the final 10 months of the year, which is consistent with going into the year, how we thought about it. We will -- as with same as last year, any changes to capital allocation, including share buybacks, we wouldn't likely consider those and talk to our Board about those until after we get through the important winter and summer months. So I'm not predicting any changes or updates as we had last year, but if there were to be any, that would probably come after we've gotten through a couple of the summer months."

            "name": "Jim Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Meagan. Good morning. I'm pleased to be here with you all to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, which we believe is a positive and straightforward message. Beginning on Slide 5, as we've reiterated over these past quarters, we remain vigilant and focused on our strategic priorities throughout the year, and the 2022 results demonstrate that focus and set us up well for the future. We believe that operating an integrated business model provides the stability and consistency that our customers and our shareholders expect and our operations throughout extreme weather events this past year, we believe, have proved this thesis. You'll recall that we initiated guidance for 2022 for adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations with a midpoint of $3.06 billion. Despite extreme volatility in commodities and numerous weather events, including winter storm Elliott at the end of December, we ended the year exceeding this midpoint by $55 million. Importantly, we delivered strong adjusted free cash flows along with these higher earnings, delivering a final adjusted free cash flow before growth of $129 million above the midpoint of the narrow guidance range we introduced in the third quarter of 2022. Our integrated portfolio also supported our comprehensive hedging strategy we executed throughout 2022, with the goal of locking an out-year earnings potential in years 2023 to 2025. Kris will speak to this in more detail later, but we concluded the year at approximately 73% hedged across '23 to '25 across all markets. This hedging percentage and the current forward curves continue to support the estimated $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion midpoint of adjusted EBITDA earnings potentials in those years. And with our 2023 adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint set at $3.7 billion, we look forward to executing squarely on these opportunities. We continue to see Vistra generate significant cash flows and our strategic priorities remain focused on returning meaningful value to our shareholders. Kris will provide a detailed update on our capital allocation plan, but I will note that we returned approximately $2.25 billion to shareholders via our share repurchase program from November 2021 through December 2022, approximately $250 million more than we had originally planned. Additionally, we paid out $300 million in common stock dividends in 2022, as planned, with each quarter's dividend per share growing as the share count was reduced. The fourth quarter dividend paid in December 2022 represented a 29% increase over the fourth quarter dividend paid in December of '21. We expect shareholders to continue to experience increases in dividend returns into 2023 as we expect to continue to pay out an aggregate $300 million in annual dividends due to decreasing number of shares of Vistra common stock. We remain vigilant this year in maintaining a strong balance sheet. While our debt balance did grow to provide the liquidity we needed to support our comprehensive hedging strategy, we achieved our goal of a sub-3x leverage after margin deposits are considered at year-end. We held our debt capacity steady at year-end as we saw less return of margin than originally expected. We have seen the margin deposits start to return to us in the first quarter of 2023, and we continue to actively manage our liquidity and focus on opportunistic timing and structures to further optimize our balance sheet. With the goal to achieve our long-term sub-3x debt leverage ratio target on a pre-margin deposit basis over time. Finally, we are proud of the results we saw in our Vistra Zero business this past year. We added over 400 megawatts of renewable and storage capacity in 2022, and we expect to add another 350 megawatts of storage capacity in California at our Moss Landing Phase 3 facility in mid-2023. We also retired approximately 2,900 megawatts of Ohio and Illinois coal facilities at our Zimmer, Joppa and Edwards plants. We appreciate the dedication of our teams who work at these sites for decades, powering our communities and always with a sharp focus on safety. We are pleased to be able to redevelop these sites in the future Vistra Zero energy facilities. Notably, the Joppa and Edwards sites are part of our Illinois Coal to Solar program where we are transitioning numerous sites into solar and/or storage facilities. Turning to Slide 6. We had a strong 2022, ending the year with $3.115 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. This is $55 million above the $3.06 billion midpoint we said in the third quarter of 2021. We achieved nearly $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow before growth, $129 million higher than the narrowed guidance midpoint we set in the third quarter of '22. Our financial achievements were underscored by the strong performance of our retail and generation teams. Our flagship retail brand TXU Energy continues to execute well, growing Texas residential customers nearly 2% year-over-year, while maintaining its PUCT 5-star rating. Our Generation team has proven its ability to perform in extreme weather conditions in both the summer and winter months, optimizing the maintenance of our fleet to stand ready to perform when needed. The team's commitment is illustrated by the 95.4% commercial availability achieved fleet-wide this past year. Safety remains our top priority and the culture of continuous improvement is exemplified in our Vistra best defense safety program. I'm pleased with our performance in 2022, but through continuous improvement, we see opportunities to perform operationally at an even higher level in 2023. We now look forward to delivering on the financial guidance we set forth last quarter for 2023. We are reaffirming our $3.4 billion to $4 billion adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations range for 2023 as well as reaffirming our $1.75 billion to $2.35 billion adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range. It is early in the year, but notably, despite the volatility in commodity prices we've experienced lately, we continue to have the line of sight to achieve the expectations we've set for ourselves given the potential value our comprehensive hedging program has locked in for 2023. I will now hand the call over to Kris to discuss the 2022 fourth quarter and annual performance in more detail. Shar, this is Jim. We knew when we put out 3-year kind of views, we get asked about before and it's not surprising. What's interesting about the curves is that '26 is actually hanging in there relative to '25. You see gas, obviously, still has a little bit of contango in it. We're seeing the heat rates hold up. We're certainly way more open in '26, and the liquidity there is not obviously the same as the near term. But right now, it's just that we're really open in '26, Shar, but actually, the '26 on just sort of a view as to where the curves are today. If we could actually lock that in, we feel pretty good about where we would guide for '26. It's just that's a long ways off, and it's not as liquid as we'd like it to be to be able to act on it. I'm not even sure from a point of view that we would act on it fully, if we could. I think we think that some things might be a little bit overdone on at least as we see the view now with the mild winter and that putting that kind of downward pressure we've seen on the complex overall. But it's a good question. It's one we talk about every day, as we look at how we commercially optimize the business, but '26 is hanging in there. The PCM, as you know, is the leading concept at the moment as a proposal passed by the Public Utility Commission 50 in January. A lot of alternatives still being discussed there. The one thing to note about the PCM is, it was passed, I would say, more with the conceptual framework. The details are still to be worked out, things like what is the reliability standard that the state is actually going to procure resources to ensure reliability. What is the net CONE, what's the slope of the demand curve. There's just a lot of things to work out. And so this idea of trying to calculate its value, I think there's really a couple of concepts we would want to make sure when we get through the stakeholder process. One is, is it material enough to attract investment? And that's one of the ideas that is the concept behind doing anything with market reform. And is it enough to retain the Generation that's currently there? So to the extent that we end up with a PCM that just does not have a lot of value in it, it could be a concept and it could be implemented, but it may not do much attracting of investment or retaining of assets. And I think you'll hear the debate down there that's happening in Austin, there are many stakeholders that do not believe that we have to do significant market reform. We're concerned about market reform from the standpoint that the state of Texas from a reliability standpoint will need to actually incentivize new generation while retaining the existing because we are such a strong economy, and we're seeing the load growth here in markets unlike anywhere else in the country. So I think, Shar, it's too early to say what the PCM is going to provide. Obviously, we believe in a dispatchable resource emphasis around PCM. We think that's core to grid reliability, but there's too many things to still work out in the stakeholder process, if this is the leading concept coming out of the legislative session. Yes, sure, sure. We're obviously not going to comment on any specific aspect of M&A, but you've seen this in the past. If they can leverage our core capabilities, it'd be a consideration. We've done it with Dynegy, Crius, Ambit. I view it as -- I think we're good at 3 things. I think we're very good at operating plants, serving customers and commercially integrating these 2 activities, which as you know, operate in a followable commodity market. So I think we would look at things, and we have been around processes and that's part of just our core strategy of looking how -- looking at ways that we can maximize value for shareholders, but I wouldn't put a caveat. Our investors have been very clear that they do like our return of capital strategy. We try to be very consistent with that approach, as Kris laid out, and I think that still remains our priority. So anything that we're going to consider in that front, I believe, needs to fit within that framework that may or may not be possible, but we have a priority around returning capital to shareholders. And if we can do that and leverage our core capabilities, we'd be interested. Sure. It's a good question. So obviously, we ended the year with a really strong weather system that affected not just one market, but multiple markets. When we go into these events and some of this has been refined since Uri, we carry more length into these events because we've seen that particularly, in winter events, you can actually have some fuel disruptions, not just asset performance challenges. So we try to take that into consideration. So we hold back length on the Generation side, and then we expect that retail load, particularly in extremely cold weather, can swing even more than what we would normally have expected on a winter day. And we expect those 2 to offset each other, and in Winter Storm Elliot, that's what happened. So we were able to run our ERCOT fleet, and our fleet performed really well -- and in PJM. And that extra length from an energy perspective covered the extra swing that we experienced on the retail side. On the penalty specifically, because PJM has yet another aspect to it with the penalties, you could be in a bonus or a penalty situation. And our view at this point, although we do not have full information yet from PJM, is that we're in a net bonus situation, not by a lot, but we are in a net bonus situation. But we haircut a bonus expectations because of some of the default risk that others are concerned about, and this actual process could take 8 or 9 months to receive payments for people that are in a penalty, and they need to pay in order for us to receive a bonus. So we've assumed for this purpose that we basically have a breakeven penalty bonus situation in PJM with that haircut on the bonuses. And so we came out of the storm where we expected to be. What we like about our business is, we can handle these events. What you tend to see in the aftermath of these events is some more volatility potentially in the forward curve. And then we try to hedge into that, and that's how we're able to provide the guidance that we provide. But we don't go into any one event looking for it to be a significantly positive or negative event because we're on both sides, the Gen and the Retail. And we try to come out of that event, and we had a good performance at Elliot. Sure. Yes, it's a good question. It's one that we're staying close to. We forward buy nuclear fuel, as you would expect. We buy the various components that allow us to have the fuel assemblies for our reloads. On a historical basis, we've seen it be somewhere around $5 a megawatt hour a fairly good estimate, if you were to take all of the capital costs and kind of spread them out over the megawatt hours of production. The team has been forward buying, and that's why you saw a bigger CapEx number in \u201822. We have a bigger CapEx number in \u201823. Our best view of this is, as you spread that out over the time period in the 2025, 2026, that fuel cost is working its way up from $5 to just sub $6. So if you put that on a on Comanche Peak size unit, $1 is about a $20 million per year impact. So it's not jumping to $6, just kind of migrating from a $5 cost on average historically to hedge. It's looking like it's going to be sub-$6, but heading towards $6 around that 2026 time frame. And so that gives you a sense that it is definitely on the upward trend, where there'll be some domestic opportunities for supply down the road. That remains to be seen, but I think the team has done a very nice job of getting ahead of the nuclear fuel cost escalation and sourcing, and that gives you a kind of a range of magnitude as to how we're managing through it. Sure. Angie, thank you. That's a very good question. Vistra Zero has been off to, in our view, a really strong start on the projects that we've got line of sight to. Right now, we did deliver the 3 that were in Texas in 2022, actually on time, on budget. Our focus right now is Moss 350, which will come online for this summer, which adds to the already large battery assembly of 400 megawatts, will become 750. And then we have 9 Coal to Solar projects in Illinois that were focused on the balance of this year and in 2024 to bring those on in late '24 and '25. What we've done, and you put all that together, Angie, you're still looking at about a $200 million to $250 million kind of EBITDA business. So on the basis of the 3.7, it's still not a sizable share, but it's a meaningful share. And what we've done in Texas, as you know, is we slowed down some of the merchant solar development because we've seen those returns be challenged based on not only EPC cost and panel costs, but solar is already starting to cannibalize solar in terms of price realization. So we would want to do additional solar under the right circumstances, which would likely be if it were contracted. So we slowed our process down at this point because we want to make sure that those projects make sense for us. As we stated since we announced Vistra Zero, we hold these options ourselves. They're not on a time constraint that if we don't exercise them, we lose them. And some of these sites, I think, can end up being more valuable through time as we see these interconnect queues are really hard to get through all over the country, and we own dozens and dozens of interconnect queues that we're not utilizing right now that we'd like to. So it is absolutely an option for us. I think you'll see that we will continue to grow this in a very deliberate way. But I think we've also tried to show discipline that we did not give you a headline megawatt number and just go pursue it regardless of returns. I think we've been very disciplined about the approach. And the market opportunity, clearly, with the Inflation Reduction Act is improving some of these returns even on the projects that we've already announced that are executing like Moss 350 and Coal to Solar. So I feel very good about our portfolio that we're executing on, but there is still uncertainty about the back half of the Vistra Zero portfolio and whether they can generate adequate returns. And if they do, we'll pursue it, and if they don't, then we're going to be disciplined and we'll wait because we still own the sites and have the options. Dispatchable assets are core to serving Retail load. In fact, I think we have seen, and this is what Steve Muscato and his commercial team focus on every day is, can you serve Retail loads successfully, simply with renewables and batteries. And it's a really tough \u2013 it's a really tough effort to manage the risk around that. So dispatchable assets clearly are required to be successful with risk management on Retail. Comanche Peak itself, we talked about was the anchor tenant in Vistra Zero when we first announced Vistra Zero. Obviously, it's got additional support from the production tax credit. We just obviously put in for the relicensing of it, and it operates at one of the lowest cost structures, if not the lowest cost structure, in the industry. So we do occasionally get inbounds from people that ask that question, Angie, and we are obviously interested in long-term value creation, but we like the Comanche Peak asset. It fits within our portfolio in Texas, given our sizable retail presence. and obviously, nuclear has been given a new level of interest given the Inflation Reduction Act, but we will always engage ideas. But in the core competencies of \u2013 we run plants well, we serve customers well, and we commercially risk manage the 2, I think it's a core asset. I just want to thank everybody for joining. I want to thank the hard-working team at Vistra for a strong 2022, and we have turned our attention, and we're focused on delivering in 2023. So I hope everybody has a great morning. Look forward to talking to you again soon."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Meagan Horn. Please go ahead.\nMeagan Horn: Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast discussing third quarter 2022 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are copies of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-Q, and the related press release. Joining me for today's call are Jim Burke, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I would like to note that today's press release, the slide presentation and discussion on this call all include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available on the Investor Relations section of the company's website. Also today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on slide two in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of these forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation, and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Meagan, and good morning to everyone. We plan to keep this call relatively short. We believe we have a straightforward message to deliver today. In prior calls, we've shared with you our priorities for the year and today, we're here to share how we are successfully executing against those priorities and provide our view regarding 2023. Starting on slide five, we had another strong quarter financially earning $1.038 billion and ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Our generation team performed extremely well throughout the summer, but their performance was most on display during the high heat weather events experienced in July in the ERCOT region. For example, on one particular day in July when ERCOT experienced periods of low wind and solar output, we saw our Texas generation fleet operate at its max capacity. On this day, we saw prices hit the $5,000 price cap on three different hours. A well-maintained fleet is key to delivering reliable power for our customers and our communities and ensuring value is captured during these weather events and our generation team delivered. Our retail business similarly performed well showing its resiliency by demonstrating the ability to serve customers at attractive margins. Even in light of the higher commodity cost environment. Our retail team responded to our customer's needs, and our performance reflects our deep commitment to our customers. In fact, this commitment was recently acknowledged by the PCT when TXU Energy was recognized as a five-star rated retailer. With three quarters of performance now reported, we are able to narrow our previously announced guidance for ongoing operations, adjusted EBITDA, and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth. We now see ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in a range of $2.96 billion to $3.16 billion and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in a range of $2.17 billion to $2.37 billion for 2022. We're reaffirming our original midpoint of $3.06 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA for 2022. This has been a year with significant volatility and fuel prices and weather, in an environment of rising inflation, and yet our team is performing well in tracking at the original guidance provided last November. Due to our comprehensive hedging program to capture higher earnings in future periods, we have incurred some higher interest charges which is reflected in our modestly lower midpoint for ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth. This midpoint is now $2.27 billion. As we have discussed in the past, we took on additional short-term debt to fund the liquidity needed for our comprehensive hedging program. The hedges are locking in significant out-year earnings potential. That higher earnings power is reflected on slide six. Today we are initiating guidance for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in a range of $3.4 billion to $4 billion and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in a range of $1.75 billion to $2.35 billion for 2023. Our 2023 guidance midpoint of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA is $3.7 billion. This is the top end of the midpoint opportunity range we estimated for 2023 during our first quarter call, as we saw the dramatic increase in gas and power forward curves. Given the higher EBITDA figures and the volatility we have seen in the market, our range is larger on an absolute basis, but as a similar percentage of the midpoint as we have had in recent years. We are confident in our ability to deliver on this value proposition for 2023 and as you know, our comprehensive hedging program extends in the future years. With that I wanted to take a moment to reiterate Vistra's strategic priorities as we summarized on slide seven. We believe these priorities are delivering and are expected to continue to deliver significant value for investors. We previously stated that we saw annual ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA potential of around $3 billion going forward. As forward power curves increased, we announced Q1 2022 that we saw ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint potential in a $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion range for years 2023 through 2025. We're now approximately 70% hedged on average across 2023 through 2025. Accordingly, we continue to believe in that range of earnings potential. And in turn, we're using significant cash flows to return value to the shareholders. Vistra continues to execute on our previously announced capital allocation plan and Chris will speak to those details momentarily. But notably, our capital allocation plan offers a robust returns per share. Looking forward to the target share repurchases and dividends under the capital allocation plan between now and year end 2023, we have $1.2 billion of remaining authorization for share repurchases that we expect to utilize by year end 2023 plus $375 million in dividends targeted for payment Q4 2022 through Q4 2023. That capital distributed across our current shareholder base delivers an equivalent of approximately $4 per share of capital being returned. I recognize this as a simple illustration. I only point this out to underscore the incredible value proposition we believe Vistra currently offers. As a reminder, these expected cash returns are achieved even after we make the planned maintenance capital investments to ensure our fleet is well-positioned for the winter and the summer. This is also after we execute on our expected debt reduction to ensure a strong balance sheet. Lastly, we expect Vistra Zero to be financed primarily with third-party capital, enabling us to continue to transition aspects of our fleet, primarily some of our older coal assets in a capital efficient manner. Vistra Zero will also benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, including setting a price floor for a nuclear asset Comanche peak. You may have seen we recently submitted the relicensing application which would extend our licenses by 20 additional years for each of the two units to 2050 and 2053. We continue to see how important a role our diverse set of assets are playing throughout the U.S. and ensuring reliable, affordable, and sustainable power. Our integrated model of delivering the service that our customers and communities depend upon, and we are excited to be able to share our expectations with you, our owners, that the future is bright for our company. I will now hand the call over to Kris to discuss this quarter's financial performance in more detail.\nKris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Starting on slide nine, as Jim mentioned, Vistra delivered strong financial results during the third quarter with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.038 billion, including negative $2 million for retail and $1.04 billion for generation. It is important to note that Vistra's full year 2022 guidance contemplated that retail would deliver negative ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA this quarter. Despite rapidly rising power prices this year, retail's results this quarter and year-to-date are bolstered by continued strong margins and customer counts in ERCOT, along with robust large business market sales performance, partially offset by higher bad debt expense, and ex-ERCOT headwinds. Moving now to generation, the results of the generation segment this quarter and year-to-date have benefited from higher prices in the summer months coupled with outstanding performance of the fleet to be available to capture those higher prices, offset by lower prices in Q1 2022, lower generation volumes from coal plants due to industry-wide fuel delivery challenges, and higher than expected migration of customers to default service providers. With our financial results tracking consistently with our expectations, we continue to execute on our capital allocation plan, as described on slide 10. As of November 1st, we had completed approximately $2.05 billion of share repurchases. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $1.2 billion of authorization under the upsized $3.25 billion program by year end 2023. Notably, as of November 1st, our outstanding share count had fallen to approximately 398 million shares outstanding, which represents an approximately 18% reduction from the aggregate number of shares that were outstanding as of a year ago. We also remained committed to paying $300 million in dividends to our common stockholders each year. To that end, our Board recently approved a quarterly dividend to be paid on Vistra's common stock in the amount of $0.193 per share, or approximately $75 million in the aggregate payable on December 29thm 2022. This is an approximately 29% growth in dividend per share as compared to the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2021. While returning cash directly to our shareholders remains a priority, we will continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. Importantly, we have not deviated from our long-term net leverage target, excluding any non-recourse debt at Vistra Zero of less than three times. On our second quarter call, we noted that we expected to repay at least $2.5 billion in the second half of the year and we made significant progress this quarter, repaying approximately $1.4 billion of debt. We expect to repay an additional $1.1 billion of debt by year end. Finally, as we look to grow Vistra Zero, it is important to emphasize that we anticipate financing that growth by using primarily third-party capital. As Jim mentioned earlier, we have initiated guidance for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA with a $3.7 billion midpoint for 2023. On slide 11, we're presenting the forward power price in gas curves as of October 31st, 2022. As you can see, while there has been noticeable volatility, prices are still up materially as compared to the prior year. Not only do these curves support our 2023 guidance range, but they also continue to give us confidence in the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion of potential ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint for each of years 2024 and 2025. As you would expect, the commercial team has continued its execution of the comprehensive hedging program that we discussed initially on the first quarter earnings call, significantly derisking and locking in our future earnings potential for these out years. As of the end of the quarter, we were approximately 70% hedged on average across all markets for 2023 through 2025, with 2023 being approximately 90% hedged. On slide 12, we are providing a bit more detail around our 2023 guidance among our retail and generation segments. You may recall that last year, we also separately broke out our Sunset generation segment with several plants closing and 2022 in the very beginning of 2023 and moving from our Sunset segment to our asset closer segment, together with the growth of Vistra Zero, we are currently reevaluating the appropriate segments for our businesses. In light of that ongoing process, we have combined this Sunset segment with our other generation segments for 2023 guidance purposes only. We currently expect to finalize any segment changes by the time we share our first quarter 2023 results. I think it is worth reiterating execution has been and will continue to be our focus in 2022 and into 2023. Our first nine months have delivered strong results and we see our full year 2022 on track. We look forward to discussing our full year results on the next call. With that operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey everyone. Good morning.\nJim Burke: Good morning.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey Jim, Hey, Chris, I was just hoping maybe you could start with some color on some of the moving pieces relative to the last call. It seemed like 2022, you were tracking a little better than the midpoint, now at the midpoint; 2023, you're kind of, at the higher end of that range. So, maybe just a little more color on what kind of move between the two years from the last call is just commodity prices or anything else going on?\nJim Burke: Yes, sure, Michael. So, for 2022 we were tracking a little bit above midpoint when we talked last time. We see ourselves closer to midpoint at the moment. I think we've seen some headwinds with coal constraints that we assumed earlier in the year and even through the summer. We were getting some indication that coal deliveries we pick up. That has been a slower process, not just for us, but I think from everything we can tell, industry-wide. So, that's one of the headwinds. The other headwinds that we mentioned is we picked up some default service mode. We did on that load last year and even as late as early this year before the price ran up. As that -- as the market moved up in the spring, in the summer, customers have the opportunity to move to default service, that's their choice. In addition to that there was one media aggregation in OPEC, that actually in mass moved all their customers to default service. We're not sure that that actually was provided for in the structure of the default service, but it was approved by the Commission in Ohio, those headwinds that have developed even further since our last call. So, when we look at the year, we've been able to offset those. So, we have had very good performance on the retail business, a good performance with the summer as we mentioned in the script, and so we had length, we were able to cover those headwinds, and I think the integrated model shows diversification paid off. But I think that's really the driver as to why we saw ourselves tracking slight above midpoint before, and now we see it on midpoint. But the operational excellence of the fleet in the retail business has been quite strong. And as it relates to 2023, some of the default service carries over into May -- through the May time frame and we also had to recognize that the coal constraints has been a rolling issue. So, we have just modest improvement now assumed in 2023 for coal deliveries. We're still not running everything that we could run from the coal fleet even in the 2023 plan. So, I think there's a little bit of conservatism and it's just something we've learned throughout this year that, it's a tough market. It's a tough challenge just to -- to basically free up the supply chain and have the train sets running and the quantity and the cycle times that we would like. So, we reflected that here. And I think the upper end $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, we mentioned that on our first week call in May, and we're at the upper end of that midpoint. And so we feel good about being able to weather this volatility. But those are the headwinds and some of the tailwinds that we've reflected now in this guidance.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. That's super helpful. And then my next question was just as we look out to 2024, 2025, it seemed like previously given a bigger un-hedged position, you help maybe even better out there and just latest thoughts on how you're feeling since the Q2 call?\nJim Burke: Yeah. On slide 11, you see the direction of the curves, and we've tried to, we knew when we put this out, the first week we made that we'd be asked for continuous updates on this. So we added potentially our disclosure on a more consistent basis now for the third call. But you see the run up late spring and summer, and then you see it coming back off pretty hard, we had been hedging through that period. And I think that's the value of the comprehensive hedging program. So, we were a little bit more bullish about where we saw things. Obviously, when you're in the middle of the summer and the curves were peaking and you had the un-hedged position. We were able to hedge through some of that, but the curves have come off, and we are actually still through this chart showing that through October 31 curves, which is certainly much lower than where they were at the peak of the summer, because we've increased our hedge percentage now to 70% across the years, we still feel good about the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. So, again, it's a predictable set of cash flows as far as we can see. We obviously aren't fully hedged. But I think we haven't been trying to time the high and the low. We've been working through this and I think showing that $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion is still there and our expectations for 2024 and 2025 is a sign of that integrated model working.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. That's great. And just real quick, the last one, again, kind of back to the bridge to 2023, what are the positives on the retail side, if I just look at kind of where you are year-to-date, something like $564 million and then the range for next year, it's kind of close to $1 billion. Yeah. What are the tailwinds there that could be up for next year?\nJim Burke: Yeah, we continue -- one of the things we've been able to do this year, which has been a benefit for customers is we forward by, obviously, as you'd expect, in our retail business because our customers expect predictable pricing. And so we've seen our rates move up on existing customers, on average, about 10% this year. So in the aggregate of the inflationary effects and even the price spikes of commodities, I think we've done a nice job smoothing that out for our customer base. As you look at what's going on when you move forward, we do have continued movement in our expectations on average of how we smooth out the prices for customers. So we have even greater margin realization as we go forward, which is a tailwind. We also are seeing -- we've had great margin management this year. We see that continuing. The count story has been very good at ERCOT and that continues. And even our Midwest, Northeast business, which has been more challenged because of the default service, price is lagging the same topic I just mentioned about the fault service migration. It makes it difficult for retail businesses to compete against that. We see that improving in the Midwest, Northeast improving next year as well. So, retail business is in a very good position. It's having a very good year this year, and we expect that to continue to improve. We also have a little bit less retail bill credits that we have as post yearly effect where we have no credits for settling large customers. We have less of that in 2023 versus 2022. So those are the key drivers of the improvement in that business.\nMichael Sullivan: Thanks, Jim. Appreciate all the color.\nOperator: The next question will come from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJim Burke: Hi, Paul.\nPaul Zimbardo: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the update. A lot to pick through, to start out with, could you discuss the drivers on the 2023 free cash flow conversion, I know you had a 65% target at the Analyst Day in the past. So just curious is kind of 2023 a blip and do we get back there in the future?\nJim Burke: Yeah. Paul, the free cash flow conversion from a historical standpoint, we've obviously seen revenues go up because we have inflation that's affected some of the raw commodities. Some of that also affects our cost of doing business, including our CapEx assumption. So we have more outages next year. It's actually just a function of the starts of the units and the run hours. So we have more outages planned for actually '23 and '24, and that's predictable. We can see that peak in 2023 and 2024, and then it comes off for the next three to four years. So we have higher CapEx, and some of the CapEx is more expensive because of the inflation drivers. We also have more interest expense that's a function of our comprehensive hedging program. You can see some of those drivers, obviously, in the back of the release in terms of some of the reconciliations between our EBITDA and our free cash flow. Obviously, the inflation does affect the revenue line, but it does affect some of the cost drivers as I just mentioned interest rates. We have more borrowings at this point, and we have slightly higher interest that's un-hedged that we have. But we do have some interest rate swaps in place as well. But those are the key drivers. And Kris, if there's something you'd like to add there, please?\nKris Moldovan: No, Jim, I think you've covered the driver as well.\nPaul Zimbardo: Thanks. Okay. Great. And then separately, I know you're running a lot of promotions in Texas over the summer. Could you just discuss what you've seen on kind of retail customer attrition? And just unpacking a little bit. It looks like customer count was down quarter-over-quarter and you talked about like value-accretive exits, if you could just elaborate a little bit there? Thank you.\nJim Burke: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Paul. The retail market in Texas is a robust market. We have done extremely well this year. Part of it is the innovation that you mentioned. We've been able -- in fact, we rolled out an EV miles program just this week. We have a lot of those flexibilities in Texas because the retailer gets to do the billing. We get to design the products that customers are looking for, and that gives us a chance to differentiate. And our accounts have actually been very strong in ERCOT, and we've seen ourselves hold, I think, this position of a trusted brand and that is one of the positives from 2022 going into 2023. These exits that have occurred in other markets are a function of the fact that some of these other market designs. They still don't let the retailer do the billing, but still competing against default rates. And those default rates lag, like we've seen a lag this year in particular, it becomes unprofitable to stay in some of these markets. And so you end up in these boom bust cycles. In fact, I think the default markets could end up seeing peak pricing, and then you'll see the retailers rush back in and pull these customers off default. So there were two things happened. On New York, we actually left the New York market because the regulatory scheme you had to offer a discount to the default rate. So that became untenable once the default rate is not moving and you have to offer a discount to that, it becomes unprofitable is unfortunate, because it was a very good customer base. But we have to look at this and be realistic that if the market design is not there to be able to recover your cost, you need to exit. Connecticut was a different story prior to our acquisition of Crius. There was concern from the regulatory body about some of the bill disclosures and when contract term would end for customers, they wanted to see us settle that matter. And one of the terms of settlement was, they asked us to give up our licenses in Connecticut. It's happened before we ever got the business. It seemed shortsighted from the standpoint that the customer impact wasn't even determined to necessarily be negative. It was a question about how clear was the disclosure around the termination of a contract plan, but as I mentioned earlier, if you're competing against default rates, and you do not have the ability to differentiate your product with the customer. You're essentially a line item on a bill and you're competing on price and that's a difficult proposition. So we have to work to change the mindset of some of these marketplaces to be able to open them up to differentiation. I do think other brands entering the space like Tesla, Shell, BP, can help bring other voices to the table. I think a lot of this is the follow on to the polar vortex in 2014, where there was a lot of concern about how retailers needed to try to recover their cost and prices were moving very, very quickly. And we've got to restore confidence in some of these other markets outside of Texas to be able to differentiate like we do here.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Thank you very much.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: And the final question for today will come from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just, first, one follow-up on the free cash flow projections. It's actually for both 2022 and 2023. I think I'm a little bit confused about working capital changes and new collateral postings. I'm assuming that collateral is coming back. So I was actually hoping for some boost to free cash flow in 2023. So again, maybe if you could talk both about collateral postings and the free cash flow projection?\nKris Moldovan : Yes, Angie, thanks for the question. So we do expect the collateral to be posted as you can -- as you saw, we just -- we have just over $3 billion of cash still posted as of 9/30. We expect a significant amount of that to come back over the balance of the year and into 2023. What you would note though is the margin deposits and working capital, we don't -- that doesn't get reflected in our adjusted free cash flow number. So it's below that line. But we do expect over the next 14 months to receive a substantial portion of the cash that $3 billion that we have to return to us. And that's factored into our capital allocation discussions as far as the amount of share repurchases that we plan, the dividends and the debt repayments.\nAngie Storozynski : Okay. So what's the reason why there is this big positive from working capital perspective this year and basically offsetting negative next year?\nJim Burke: I think, Angie, what we're seeing in the disclosures from the EBITDA to free cash flow is that we are seeing obviously, from EBITDA to free cash flow, we see some drivers through CapEx and interest expense. We are expecting the return of working capital and margin deposits net through 2023 and we'll see that as part of our capital allocation, as Kris mentioned, with our share buybacks or dividends and obviously, our debt pay down.\nAngie Storozynski : Okay. Okay. And then secondly, on the guidance, right, for 2023. So you were 90% hedged, and I appreciate all the volatility that you're seeing in energy markets. But that's quite a wide range. So can you just give me a sense, for example, what is it that you're trying to hedge against? Is it, as you mentioned, some issues with the call supplies, is the performance issues of your power plants? Again, just what can take me to the high end versus the low end?\nJim Burke: Yes. Sure. Well, there's a number of things. Even the 90% still has quite a bit at elevated prices that unhedged part is still a meaningful part of the various drivers. We also assume that there's volatility in the marketplace, and that volatility is something we can capture, and that's what we did over the month of July when we had higher prices, tighter supply demand. We saw that some in PJM. We obviously saw it a little bit in CAISO. So we assume that there's an element of volatility in the marketplace and that we can capture some of that, either because prices move up and we're able to capture that incremental output at a higher margin. Or if prices actually move down, we can actually not run the assets and buy back in the marketplace. And that's sort of what we call extrinsic value is part of the value that we anticipate when we set guidance. So that's part of the expectations that we said when we put the $3.7 billion out in the market. We also have some assumption. I said it's modest of coal being able to be delivered slight improvement over 2022 actuals. It could still move south from here. I mean, we do not know how all of this is going to get resolved. They're still in negotiation. They're trying to get the rail agreement that would work for all of the unions involved. But we don't have perfect foresight into how that will play out. That also could be a positive. We can actually get past that and get to the sense that we already have security to get the cycle times where they need to be, that would be upside potentially to our guidance. And then lastly, we still have weather variance even in retail. We do hedge retail conservatively and have paid off for our customer base this year. It's paid off for our retail performance. But if you had mild weather, you could actually find yourself long power in the retail business and having to sell that back in the market at reduced prices. And so when prices get elevated, then the variances around and volumetrically become bigger on a dollar basis. That's why we kept about an 8% band around the midpoint similar to prior years, just larger on an absolute basis.\nAngie Storozynski : Okay. And then lastly, again, I might have missed it in your in your pack -- in your slides. I was hoping for more disclosures on cash available for distributions and drivers year-over-year. And I appreciate some of the comments you have made in your prepared remarks. But should we expect something like that like cash available for distribution, so we have a better sense of how much can be deployed into either additional buybacks and/or dividends?\nKris Moldovan : Yes, Angie. So thank you, again. We continue to talk about being able and in position to spend $300 million a year on the dividend and $1 billion -- at least $1 billion a year on share repurchases and paying down debt to get to three times, which primarily, we can get there, as you can see, as working capital comes back -- as margin positives come back, we could use that money to pay down debt. We also still have some proceeds from the green preferred to allocate. But we're tracking well right at where we thought we would track when we came out with that cash available for allocation last year in November. We did upsize the share repurchases by $250 million to reflect some confidence in additional free cash flow. We'll continue to evaluate as we move through the time period. And as we have additional cash to allocate what's the best use of that cash. But we're still committed to at least $1 billion a year of share repurchases and the $300 million dividend and getting our leverage to three times -- just under three times.\nAngie Storozynski : Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Okay. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jim Burke for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nJim Burke: Yes, I want to thank you again for joining us this morning. We're excited about Vistra's continued value proposition, and we appreciate your continued interest investor, and we look forward to speaking to you again in a few months when we will discuss our fourth quarter and our full year performance. Have good morning. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kris Moldovan",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Starting on slide nine, as Jim mentioned, Vistra delivered strong financial results during the third quarter with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.038 billion, including negative $2 million for retail and $1.04 billion for generation. It is important to note that Vistra's full year 2022 guidance contemplated that retail would deliver negative ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA this quarter. Despite rapidly rising power prices this year, retail's results this quarter and year-to-date are bolstered by continued strong margins and customer counts in ERCOT, along with robust large business market sales performance, partially offset by higher bad debt expense, and ex-ERCOT headwinds. Moving now to generation, the results of the generation segment this quarter and year-to-date have benefited from higher prices in the summer months coupled with outstanding performance of the fleet to be available to capture those higher prices, offset by lower prices in Q1 2022, lower generation volumes from coal plants due to industry-wide fuel delivery challenges, and higher than expected migration of customers to default service providers. With our financial results tracking consistently with our expectations, we continue to execute on our capital allocation plan, as described on slide 10. As of November 1st, we had completed approximately $2.05 billion of share repurchases. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $1.2 billion of authorization under the upsized $3.25 billion program by year end 2023. Notably, as of November 1st, our outstanding share count had fallen to approximately 398 million shares outstanding, which represents an approximately 18% reduction from the aggregate number of shares that were outstanding as of a year ago. We also remained committed to paying $300 million in dividends to our common stockholders each year. To that end, our Board recently approved a quarterly dividend to be paid on Vistra's common stock in the amount of $0.193 per share, or approximately $75 million in the aggregate payable on December 29thm 2022. This is an approximately 29% growth in dividend per share as compared to the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2021. While returning cash directly to our shareholders remains a priority, we will continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet. Importantly, we have not deviated from our long-term net leverage target, excluding any non-recourse debt at Vistra Zero of less than three times. On our second quarter call, we noted that we expected to repay at least $2.5 billion in the second half of the year and we made significant progress this quarter, repaying approximately $1.4 billion of debt. We expect to repay an additional $1.1 billion of debt by year end. Finally, as we look to grow Vistra Zero, it is important to emphasize that we anticipate financing that growth by using primarily third-party capital. As Jim mentioned earlier, we have initiated guidance for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA with a $3.7 billion midpoint for 2023. On slide 11, we're presenting the forward power price in gas curves as of October 31st, 2022. As you can see, while there has been noticeable volatility, prices are still up materially as compared to the prior year. Not only do these curves support our 2023 guidance range, but they also continue to give us confidence in the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion of potential ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint for each of years 2024 and 2025. As you would expect, the commercial team has continued its execution of the comprehensive hedging program that we discussed initially on the first quarter earnings call, significantly derisking and locking in our future earnings potential for these out years. As of the end of the quarter, we were approximately 70% hedged on average across all markets for 2023 through 2025, with 2023 being approximately 90% hedged. On slide 12, we are providing a bit more detail around our 2023 guidance among our retail and generation segments. You may recall that last year, we also separately broke out our Sunset generation segment with several plants closing and 2022 in the very beginning of 2023 and moving from our Sunset segment to our asset closer segment, together with the growth of Vistra Zero, we are currently reevaluating the appropriate segments for our businesses. In light of that ongoing process, we have combined this Sunset segment with our other generation segments for 2023 guidance purposes only. We currently expect to finalize any segment changes by the time we share our first quarter 2023 results. I think it is worth reiterating execution has been and will continue to be our focus in 2022 and into 2023. Our first nine months have delivered strong results and we see our full year 2022 on track. We look forward to discussing our full year results on the next call. With that operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. No, Jim, I think you've covered the driver as well. Yes, Angie, thanks for the question. So we do expect the collateral to be posted as you can -- as you saw, we just -- we have just over $3 billion of cash still posted as of 9/30. We expect a significant amount of that to come back over the balance of the year and into 2023. What you would note though is the margin deposits and working capital, we don't -- that doesn't get reflected in our adjusted free cash flow number. So it's below that line. But we do expect over the next 14 months to receive a substantial portion of the cash that $3 billion that we have to return to us. And that's factored into our capital allocation discussions as far as the amount of share repurchases that we plan, the dividends and the debt repayments. Yes, Angie. So thank you, again. We continue to talk about being able and in position to spend $300 million a year on the dividend and $1 billion -- at least $1 billion a year on share repurchases and paying down debt to get to three times, which primarily, we can get there, as you can see, as working capital comes back -- as margin positives come back, we could use that money to pay down debt. We also still have some proceeds from the green preferred to allocate. But we're tracking well right at where we thought we would track when we came out with that cash available for allocation last year in November. We did upsize the share repurchases by $250 million to reflect some confidence in additional free cash flow. We'll continue to evaluate as we move through the time period. And as we have additional cash to allocate what's the best use of that cash. But we're still committed to at least $1 billion a year of share repurchases and the $300 million dividend and getting our leverage to three times -- just under three times."

            "name": "Jim Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Meagan, and good morning to everyone. We plan to keep this call relatively short. We believe we have a straightforward message to deliver today. In prior calls, we've shared with you our priorities for the year and today, we're here to share how we are successfully executing against those priorities and provide our view regarding 2023. Starting on slide five, we had another strong quarter financially earning $1.038 billion and ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Our generation team performed extremely well throughout the summer, but their performance was most on display during the high heat weather events experienced in July in the ERCOT region. For example, on one particular day in July when ERCOT experienced periods of low wind and solar output, we saw our Texas generation fleet operate at its max capacity. On this day, we saw prices hit the $5,000 price cap on three different hours. A well-maintained fleet is key to delivering reliable power for our customers and our communities and ensuring value is captured during these weather events and our generation team delivered. Our retail business similarly performed well showing its resiliency by demonstrating the ability to serve customers at attractive margins. Even in light of the higher commodity cost environment. Our retail team responded to our customer's needs, and our performance reflects our deep commitment to our customers. In fact, this commitment was recently acknowledged by the PCT when TXU Energy was recognized as a five-star rated retailer. With three quarters of performance now reported, we are able to narrow our previously announced guidance for ongoing operations, adjusted EBITDA, and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth. We now see ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in a range of $2.96 billion to $3.16 billion and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in a range of $2.17 billion to $2.37 billion for 2022. We're reaffirming our original midpoint of $3.06 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA for 2022. This has been a year with significant volatility and fuel prices and weather, in an environment of rising inflation, and yet our team is performing well in tracking at the original guidance provided last November. Due to our comprehensive hedging program to capture higher earnings in future periods, we have incurred some higher interest charges which is reflected in our modestly lower midpoint for ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth. This midpoint is now $2.27 billion. As we have discussed in the past, we took on additional short-term debt to fund the liquidity needed for our comprehensive hedging program. The hedges are locking in significant out-year earnings potential. That higher earnings power is reflected on slide six. Today we are initiating guidance for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in a range of $3.4 billion to $4 billion and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in a range of $1.75 billion to $2.35 billion for 2023. Our 2023 guidance midpoint of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA is $3.7 billion. This is the top end of the midpoint opportunity range we estimated for 2023 during our first quarter call, as we saw the dramatic increase in gas and power forward curves. Given the higher EBITDA figures and the volatility we have seen in the market, our range is larger on an absolute basis, but as a similar percentage of the midpoint as we have had in recent years. We are confident in our ability to deliver on this value proposition for 2023 and as you know, our comprehensive hedging program extends in the future years. With that I wanted to take a moment to reiterate Vistra's strategic priorities as we summarized on slide seven. We believe these priorities are delivering and are expected to continue to deliver significant value for investors. We previously stated that we saw annual ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA potential of around $3 billion going forward. As forward power curves increased, we announced Q1 2022 that we saw ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint potential in a $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion range for years 2023 through 2025. We're now approximately 70% hedged on average across 2023 through 2025. Accordingly, we continue to believe in that range of earnings potential. And in turn, we're using significant cash flows to return value to the shareholders. Vistra continues to execute on our previously announced capital allocation plan and Chris will speak to those details momentarily. But notably, our capital allocation plan offers a robust returns per share. Looking forward to the target share repurchases and dividends under the capital allocation plan between now and year end 2023, we have $1.2 billion of remaining authorization for share repurchases that we expect to utilize by year end 2023 plus $375 million in dividends targeted for payment Q4 2022 through Q4 2023. That capital distributed across our current shareholder base delivers an equivalent of approximately $4 per share of capital being returned. I recognize this as a simple illustration. I only point this out to underscore the incredible value proposition we believe Vistra currently offers. As a reminder, these expected cash returns are achieved even after we make the planned maintenance capital investments to ensure our fleet is well-positioned for the winter and the summer. This is also after we execute on our expected debt reduction to ensure a strong balance sheet. Lastly, we expect Vistra Zero to be financed primarily with third-party capital, enabling us to continue to transition aspects of our fleet, primarily some of our older coal assets in a capital efficient manner. Vistra Zero will also benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, including setting a price floor for a nuclear asset Comanche peak. You may have seen we recently submitted the relicensing application which would extend our licenses by 20 additional years for each of the two units to 2050 and 2053. We continue to see how important a role our diverse set of assets are playing throughout the U.S. and ensuring reliable, affordable, and sustainable power. Our integrated model of delivering the service that our customers and communities depend upon, and we are excited to be able to share our expectations with you, our owners, that the future is bright for our company. I will now hand the call over to Kris to discuss this quarter's financial performance in more detail. Good morning. Yes, sure, Michael. So, for 2022 we were tracking a little bit above midpoint when we talked last time. We see ourselves closer to midpoint at the moment. I think we've seen some headwinds with coal constraints that we assumed earlier in the year and even through the summer. We were getting some indication that coal deliveries we pick up. That has been a slower process, not just for us, but I think from everything we can tell, industry-wide. So, that's one of the headwinds. The other headwinds that we mentioned is we picked up some default service mode. We did on that load last year and even as late as early this year before the price ran up. As that -- as the market moved up in the spring, in the summer, customers have the opportunity to move to default service, that's their choice. In addition to that there was one media aggregation in OPEC, that actually in mass moved all their customers to default service. We're not sure that that actually was provided for in the structure of the default service, but it was approved by the Commission in Ohio, those headwinds that have developed even further since our last call. So, when we look at the year, we've been able to offset those. So, we have had very good performance on the retail business, a good performance with the summer as we mentioned in the script, and so we had length, we were able to cover those headwinds, and I think the integrated model shows diversification paid off. But I think that's really the driver as to why we saw ourselves tracking slight above midpoint before, and now we see it on midpoint. But the operational excellence of the fleet in the retail business has been quite strong. And as it relates to 2023, some of the default service carries over into May -- through the May time frame and we also had to recognize that the coal constraints has been a rolling issue. So, we have just modest improvement now assumed in 2023 for coal deliveries. We're still not running everything that we could run from the coal fleet even in the 2023 plan. So, I think there's a little bit of conservatism and it's just something we've learned throughout this year that, it's a tough market. It's a tough challenge just to -- to basically free up the supply chain and have the train sets running and the quantity and the cycle times that we would like. So, we reflected that here. And I think the upper end $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, we mentioned that on our first week call in May, and we're at the upper end of that midpoint. And so we feel good about being able to weather this volatility. But those are the headwinds and some of the tailwinds that we've reflected now in this guidance. Yeah. On slide 11, you see the direction of the curves, and we've tried to, we knew when we put this out, the first week we made that we'd be asked for continuous updates on this. So we added potentially our disclosure on a more consistent basis now for the third call. But you see the run up late spring and summer, and then you see it coming back off pretty hard, we had been hedging through that period. And I think that's the value of the comprehensive hedging program. So, we were a little bit more bullish about where we saw things. Obviously, when you're in the middle of the summer and the curves were peaking and you had the un-hedged position. We were able to hedge through some of that, but the curves have come off, and we are actually still through this chart showing that through October 31 curves, which is certainly much lower than where they were at the peak of the summer, because we've increased our hedge percentage now to 70% across the years, we still feel good about the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion. So, again, it's a predictable set of cash flows as far as we can see. We obviously aren't fully hedged. But I think we haven't been trying to time the high and the low. We've been working through this and I think showing that $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion is still there and our expectations for 2024 and 2025 is a sign of that integrated model working. Yeah, we continue -- one of the things we've been able to do this year, which has been a benefit for customers is we forward by, obviously, as you'd expect, in our retail business because our customers expect predictable pricing. And so we've seen our rates move up on existing customers, on average, about 10% this year. So in the aggregate of the inflationary effects and even the price spikes of commodities, I think we've done a nice job smoothing that out for our customer base. As you look at what's going on when you move forward, we do have continued movement in our expectations on average of how we smooth out the prices for customers. So we have even greater margin realization as we go forward, which is a tailwind. We also are seeing -- we've had great margin management this year. We see that continuing. The count story has been very good at ERCOT and that continues. And even our Midwest, Northeast business, which has been more challenged because of the default service, price is lagging the same topic I just mentioned about the fault service migration. It makes it difficult for retail businesses to compete against that. We see that improving in the Midwest, Northeast improving next year as well. So, retail business is in a very good position. It's having a very good year this year, and we expect that to continue to improve. We also have a little bit less retail bill credits that we have as post yearly effect where we have no credits for settling large customers. We have less of that in 2023 versus 2022. So those are the key drivers of the improvement in that business. Hi, Paul. Yeah. Paul, the free cash flow conversion from a historical standpoint, we've obviously seen revenues go up because we have inflation that's affected some of the raw commodities. Some of that also affects our cost of doing business, including our CapEx assumption. So we have more outages next year. It's actually just a function of the starts of the units and the run hours. So we have more outages planned for actually '23 and '24, and that's predictable. We can see that peak in 2023 and 2024, and then it comes off for the next three to four years. So we have higher CapEx, and some of the CapEx is more expensive because of the inflation drivers. We also have more interest expense that's a function of our comprehensive hedging program. You can see some of those drivers, obviously, in the back of the release in terms of some of the reconciliations between our EBITDA and our free cash flow. Obviously, the inflation does affect the revenue line, but it does affect some of the cost drivers as I just mentioned interest rates. We have more borrowings at this point, and we have slightly higher interest that's un-hedged that we have. But we do have some interest rate swaps in place as well. But those are the key drivers. And Kris, if there's something you'd like to add there, please? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Paul. The retail market in Texas is a robust market. We have done extremely well this year. Part of it is the innovation that you mentioned. We've been able -- in fact, we rolled out an EV miles program just this week. We have a lot of those flexibilities in Texas because the retailer gets to do the billing. We get to design the products that customers are looking for, and that gives us a chance to differentiate. And our accounts have actually been very strong in ERCOT, and we've seen ourselves hold, I think, this position of a trusted brand and that is one of the positives from 2022 going into 2023. These exits that have occurred in other markets are a function of the fact that some of these other market designs. They still don't let the retailer do the billing, but still competing against default rates. And those default rates lag, like we've seen a lag this year in particular, it becomes unprofitable to stay in some of these markets. And so you end up in these boom bust cycles. In fact, I think the default markets could end up seeing peak pricing, and then you'll see the retailers rush back in and pull these customers off default. So there were two things happened. On New York, we actually left the New York market because the regulatory scheme you had to offer a discount to the default rate. So that became untenable once the default rate is not moving and you have to offer a discount to that, it becomes unprofitable is unfortunate, because it was a very good customer base. But we have to look at this and be realistic that if the market design is not there to be able to recover your cost, you need to exit. Connecticut was a different story prior to our acquisition of Crius. There was concern from the regulatory body about some of the bill disclosures and when contract term would end for customers, they wanted to see us settle that matter. And one of the terms of settlement was, they asked us to give up our licenses in Connecticut. It's happened before we ever got the business. It seemed shortsighted from the standpoint that the customer impact wasn't even determined to necessarily be negative. It was a question about how clear was the disclosure around the termination of a contract plan, but as I mentioned earlier, if you're competing against default rates, and you do not have the ability to differentiate your product with the customer. You're essentially a line item on a bill and you're competing on price and that's a difficult proposition. So we have to work to change the mindset of some of these marketplaces to be able to open them up to differentiation. I do think other brands entering the space like Tesla, Shell, BP, can help bring other voices to the table. I think a lot of this is the follow on to the polar vortex in 2014, where there was a lot of concern about how retailers needed to try to recover their cost and prices were moving very, very quickly. And we've got to restore confidence in some of these other markets outside of Texas to be able to differentiate like we do here. Thank you, Paul. I think, Angie, what we're seeing in the disclosures from the EBITDA to free cash flow is that we are seeing obviously, from EBITDA to free cash flow, we see some drivers through CapEx and interest expense. We are expecting the return of working capital and margin deposits net through 2023 and we'll see that as part of our capital allocation, as Kris mentioned, with our share buybacks or dividends and obviously, our debt pay down. Yes. Sure. Well, there's a number of things. Even the 90% still has quite a bit at elevated prices that unhedged part is still a meaningful part of the various drivers. We also assume that there's volatility in the marketplace, and that volatility is something we can capture, and that's what we did over the month of July when we had higher prices, tighter supply demand. We saw that some in PJM. We obviously saw it a little bit in CAISO. So we assume that there's an element of volatility in the marketplace and that we can capture some of that, either because prices move up and we're able to capture that incremental output at a higher margin. Or if prices actually move down, we can actually not run the assets and buy back in the marketplace. And that's sort of what we call extrinsic value is part of the value that we anticipate when we set guidance. So that's part of the expectations that we said when we put the $3.7 billion out in the market. We also have some assumption. I said it's modest of coal being able to be delivered slight improvement over 2022 actuals. It could still move south from here. I mean, we do not know how all of this is going to get resolved. They're still in negotiation. They're trying to get the rail agreement that would work for all of the unions involved. But we don't have perfect foresight into how that will play out. That also could be a positive. We can actually get past that and get to the sense that we already have security to get the cycle times where they need to be, that would be upside potentially to our guidance. And then lastly, we still have weather variance even in retail. We do hedge retail conservatively and have paid off for our customer base this year. It's paid off for our retail performance. But if you had mild weather, you could actually find yourself long power in the retail business and having to sell that back in the market at reduced prices. And so when prices get elevated, then the variances around and volumetrically become bigger on a dollar basis. That's why we kept about an 8% band around the midpoint similar to prior years, just larger on an absolute basis. Yes, I want to thank you again for joining us this morning. We're excited about Vistra's continued value proposition, and we appreciate your continued interest investor, and we look forward to speaking to you again in a few months when we will discuss our fourth quarter and our full year performance. Have good morning. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, VP Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMeagan Horn: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast discussing second quarter 2022 results, which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are copies of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related press release. Joining me for today's call are Jim Burke, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slide 2 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation, and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, today's press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to our new CEO, Jim Burke, to kick off our discussion.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Meagan, and good morning to everyone. I am excited and eager to talk with all of you as I take on this new role for Vistra. Over the past few months, I've been asked what I envision for Vistra's path forward. Accordingly, turning to Slide 5, before I discuss our second quarter results, I would first like to reinforce a few of my thoughts on Vistra's strategic direction and top priorities. I continue to remain confident in our short-term and long-term value proposition precisely because we intend to remain focused on the 4 key strategic priorities we initially defined in the third quarter of 2021. As we've shared in the past, Vistra is well positioned for the long term during this energy transition. In addition to ensuring that our customers and our communities have the power they need, our integrated approach enables us to deliver strong financial and operational performance, particularly in volatile commodity environments through the operational excellence and expertise of our generation retail and commercial teams. As part of this integrated business, we are continuing to execute on the comprehensive hedging strategy that we announced last quarter, which is locking in significant future year earnings potential. This effort is supported by a high-performing generation team and a customer-focused retail team experienced in managing counts, margins and customer experience, and both teams are supported by a strong commercial team that captures market opportunities and manages risk in a dynamic marketplace. Second, it is fundamental to a business that manages through volatile commodity markets to have the financial flexibility to hedge both fuel procurement and power sales for our fleet and for customers. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and an ample liquidity position. As Kris will cover later, we anticipate paying down a significant amount of debt in the second half of this year as our 2022 hedges settle and the corresponding cash collateral is returned. At year-end, we expect our net leverage ratio to be approximately 3x based on the range of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA we expect in 2023. Third, we are delivering on our capital allocation plan that prioritizes a significant return of capital to our shareholders through 2026. We remain committed to paying aggregate dividends of approximately $300 million per year with the per share amount increasing as we repurchase our shares. We continue to believe that share repurchases provide an efficient, attractive means to return capital to our shareholders. We are executing on our $2 billion share repurchase program on an accelerated basis, having completed approximately 80% to date and expect to complete the balance before year-end. Accordingly, we're pleased to announce that our Board has authorized an incremental $1.25 billion for share repurchases effective immediately, which brings our cumulative authorization to $3.25 billion and the remaining amount available for repurchases to approximately $1.65 billion. We expect to complete the full authorization by the end of 2023. As we deliver on our earnings potential, we will revisit the size of the share repurchase program on a regular basis. Finally, we've made great progress on the build-out of our Vistra Zero platform, which we expect to grow primarily by utilizing cost-effective third-party capital. I'll speak to updates on Vistra Zero in more detail momentarily. I am committed to the execution of our strategic priorities as I firmly believe that our successful execution of these priorities will enable Vistra to deliver sustainable long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Now turning to Slide 6 for our second quarter results. We achieved $761 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. Our Retail segment grew ERCOT residential customer counts in the quarter and year-over-year. In fact, our flagship TXU Energy brand had its best quarter residential counts performance in nearly 15 years while achieving our target margins in a dynamic market. This highlights our expertise as an integrated energy company to acquire and retain customers through volatile and high-priced commodity cycles. Our unique product offerings and multi-brand and channel strategy, combined with our commercial team's expertise in managing risk, drove this success. Our Generation segment similarly performed above expectations, achieving commercial availability of 95%, a strong performance, especially considering the unseasonably warmer weather experienced in Texas in the second quarter. The teams worked diligently to perform regular maintenance on an expedited basis and in some cases, truncated schedules to ensure the plants were available to the grid during the heatwaves experienced in the latter half of the second quarter. We are reaffirming today our previously announced guidance of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $2.81 billion to $3.31 billion and adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations of $2.07 billion to $2.57 billion. We don't typically update current year guidance until our third quarter earnings discussion, but favorable weather and strong performance in our Generation and Retail segments provide increased confidence that our 2022 outlook is tracking above the midpoint of guidance. Of course, the remaining summer months are important across the country for us, so we are focused on proactively maintaining our fleet during times of lower demand to avoid unplanned outages as much as possible. We understand that execution is key to delivering the full value we believe possible in this environment. Turning to Slide 7. As we discussed in the first quarter, we are currently experiencing a highly favorable pricing environment. We've used this opportunity to continue to execute on the comprehensive hedging strategy we previously discussed. As a result of our comprehensive hedging strategy, Vistra is now over 60% hedged across the years 2023 to 2025 with 2023 now hedged at approximately 80%. Last quarter, we stated that given the marks as of April 29, we anticipated a risk-adjusted midpoint opportunity in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion for the years 2023 through 2025. Curves moved up considerably in May and early June before coming off in late June with the drop in natural gas prices. For 2023, when comparing where we were as of April 29 and rolling that forward to July 29, overall, the curves are in a similar place despite the volatility we've seen over the past 3 months. However, for 2024 and 2025 since April 29, as the graphs indicate, both power and gas curves have continued moving up. As our hedge percentages have increased, our confidence in this earnings potential has grown. And more than that, we continue to believe this range could be on the conservative side. Of course, given that we are not fully hedged, there remains a significant range around this earnings potential, especially in '24 and '25. Looking ahead, assuming the forward curves continue to hold or improve, you can expect us to continue to execute on this comprehensive hedging strategy to lock in more value while maintaining sufficient generation length as insurance against the unforeseen. As discussed last quarter, our hedging strategy requires ample liquidity for collateral postings, we continue to proactively manage our liquidity requirements in a way that allows us to remain confident, and we can execute this hedging strategy and the capital allocation plan in tandem. Kris will go into more detail on our liquidity management activities later in the call. Turning now to Slide 8. I wanted to provide a brief update on our Vistra Zero growth trajectory and how we are positioning Vistra to capitalize on this significant opportunity. This past quarter, we returned both phases of our Moss Landing energy storage facility to service with over 98% of its maximum capacity on the expected schedule and ahead of California's hot summer months. We successfully restored and addressed root cause concerns during this timeframe, and we anticipate the final few megawatts to be restored by the fall. In addition, we began construction on the 350-megawatt Phase III expansion of our Moss Landing facility, which we expect to be online by June 2023. In Illinois, we bid in a competitive process. And in May, we were selected by the Illinois Power Agency to provide over 460,000 annual renewable energy credits, or RECs, over the course of 20 years. The contracted sale of these RECs will serve to provide stability of the revenue streams of our coal to solar projects. In June, we were also awarded energy storage grants at our Joppa, Havana and Edwards sites to be received over 10 years. We expect to bring our Illinois projects online in the 2024 timeframe ahead of the required dates for the awarded contracts. Finally, our development projects in Texas continued to make great progress as well. In April, we announced that our 50-megawatt solar facility Brightside was online. This was followed by announcement in May that our 260-megawatt energy storage facility at DeCordova was online. And in June, our 108-megawatt ERCOT solar facility, Emerald Grove, was online. We now have 608 megawatts for Vistra Zero online of solar and energy storage serving the ERCOT grid. In addition, of course, to our Comanche Peak nuclear facility. Our teams did an excellent job of delivering these projects in Texas as well as returning Phases 1 and 2 of our most Moss Landing facility to normal operation in California. Some of our early-stage projects that we are evaluating are facing potential impacts from supply chain constraints and inflation. We prudently reevaluate the business cases of these projects on a regular basis. For example, we have reassessed the timing of certain ERCOT solar projects, and we will move ahead with these projects only if we have confidence in the returns. Since we own these sites and we have the flexibility on timing, this is something we expect to remain dynamic. We are excited about the pipeline and the growth potential of achieving 7.3 gigawatts in Vistra Zero generation online by 2026, but we are also going to remain disciplined on the projects. Of course, in light of the newly introduced Inflation Reduction Act, it is possible that our Vistra Zero development projects could see enhanced returns. It is certainly a dynamic time in the marketplace and Vistra is extremely well positioned with both a strong outlook on our core generation and retail businesses, but also with Vistra Zero. With that, I will turn the call over to Kris Moldovan, our recently named CFO, to discuss the quarter's financial performance and our capital allocation progress in more detail. Many of you already know Kris well and his track record of successfully driving shareholder value for Vistra, and as of late, his active and effective management of our liquidity position. As background, he practiced as an attorney for over a decade, including gaining significant experience through representing clients in merger and acquisition activity as well as complex financing transactions. Kris has been with Vistra and its predecessor for 16 years and joined the finance team in 2010, where he has focused on some of the most complex financial transactions in our industry. I've had the privilege to work with Kris for many years and could attest personally to his insights and capabilities, and I'm very much looking forward to partnering with him as we take Vistra forward in these exciting times of transition and growth. Kris?\nKris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. It's an honor to be in the new role and representing Vistra on the call today. While I have met many of the participants on the call in my previous role as the Treasurer of the company, I look forward to getting to know everyone and spending time with each of you in the coming months. I'll turn now to Slide 10. As Jim noted earlier, Vistra delivered strong financial results during the second quarter with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of approximately $761 million, which was above management's expectations. Retail ended the quarter at $403 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. And while this result is $107 million lower than second quarter 2021, it is important to note that this difference is more than accounted for by the amount of onetime self-help initiatives we undertook in the second quarter of 2021 to offset some of the losses we experienced in the preceding quarter. Retail performance this quarter was favorably impacted by warmer weather, strong margins and exceptional residential customer count growth in Texas. Moving to Generation. Our collective Generation segments ended the quarter with $358 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. This result was approximately $14 million above our second quarter 2021 results after adjusting second quarter 2021 to remove the earnings attributable to Zimmer and Joppa, which are now reported in the Asset Closure segment. This increase was driven primarily by favorable prices we experienced in the quarter offset by the ongoing coal constraints the industry continues to experience as well as onetime benefits of self-help initiatives executed in the second quarter of 2021. Finally, turning to Slide 11. Our strong financial results allow us to continue to favorably execute our capital allocation plan. Specifically, as of August 2, 2022, we have executed approximately $1.6 billion of the original $2 billion authorization, repurchasing approximately 70.5 million shares or approximately 14.6% of the shares that were outstanding as of November 2021. Since we expect to execute the remaining portion of the $2 billion authorization before year-end 2022, as Jim noted, the Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $1.25 billion of share repurchases effective immediately. As such, we have approximately $1.65 billion of aggregate remaining availability for share repurchases under the upsized $3.25 billion authorization, which we expect to execute between now and the end of 2023. Additionally, the Board recently approved a quarterly dividend to be paid on Vistra's common stock in the amount of $0.184 per share or approximately $75 million in the aggregate payable on September 30, 2022. This is an approximately 23% growth in dividend per share as compared to the dividend paid in the third quarter of 2021. While we are focused on returning capital to our shareholders, we remain steadfastly committed to balance sheet strength, targeting a long-term net leverage ratio below 3x, excluding any nonrecourse debt we raised at Vistra Zero. This year, however, the material increase in forward power prices for the balance of 2022 through 2025, taken together with our increased forward hedging activities to lock in those prices, has resulted in significant increases in our collateral posting obligations and required liquidity to support these obligations. As such, we have actively worked to increase our available liquidity, including issuing $1.5 billion of short-term senior secured notes, in addition to increasing the aggregate commitments under our corporate revolver by $725 million and increasing the aggregate commitments under our commodity-linked revolver by $250 million. As a result of these proactive transactions, we have significantly increased our available liquidity which was approximately $4.5 billion as of August 3. Looking forward, as we deliver power against our hedges over the balance of 2022, we expect to see a material return of collateral including a significant amount of the cash we had posted at June 30. To that end, we anticipate repaying more than $2.5 billion of debt by year-end, including debt outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. Of course, we must continue to prudently balance the timing of these debt repayments against the liquidity needed to support our hedging program. In addition to repaying debt, we will continue to monitor and optimize the amount and sources of liquidity necessary to support our existing hedges as well as any additional hedges we may execute over time. We said we would focus on execution in 2022 and the efforts of our generation retail and commercial teams in the first 6 months have positioned us well for a successful year. We remain focused on our strategic priorities and look forward to discussing third quarter results and our outlook for the balance of 2022 and for 2023 on our next call. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jim for a brief wrap-up.\nJim Burke: Kris, very much and congratulations on the new role. Turning to Slide 12, to recap a few key points. First, our integrated model is uniquely positioned to capture long-term value in these dynamic conditions, and we are comprehensively hedging and have locked in over 60% of this value for the period of 2023 to 2025. We believe we have ample liquidity and balance sheet strength to execute this strategy. Our confidence in our outlook is reinforced by the upsizing of the share repurchase program to $3.25 billion, and we continue to return capital through this program and our $300 million annual dividend. Finally, we have made great progress by bringing online over 400 megawatts in new assets in Texas this spring with Vistra Zero while restoring Moss Landing battery operations in California. With our Illinois coal to solar contracts and other pipeline projects, we are excited about our ability to decarbonize our fleet and grow our business. We are tracking ahead of our 60% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030 for our fleet, and we anticipate Vistra Zero will more than replace the earnings of the retiring coal units and we are doing this with cost-efficient capital. This is an exciting time for Vistra, and we are well positioned for this energy transition to deliver long-term sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. With that, operator, we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShah Pourreza: So let me just ask more of a top level and maybe we could start sort of with the capital allocation announcement. It's, obviously, a bit earlier than we expected, but that's a good problem to have. How should we be thinking about the cadence of future updates given the move here? Could we start to see more off-cycle announcements as free cash flow generation for the next 3 years is increasingly locked in with the hedges? I guess what do you mean by \u201crevisit\u201d on a regular basis? And have you and the Board thought about potentially allocating everything you've locked in through '25 all at once?\nJim Burke: Shar, there's a lot in that question. Let me first start with the idea that we are just past the halfway point 2022 and we feel good about where 2022 is trending. We were working through the buyback program in a fairly expeditious manner. And our next call, obviously, would be early November. So we thought, given where we're tracking in '22, plus the incremental hedging that we've been able to do for '23 through '25, our confidence level was higher. We wanted to keep the momentum in the market from a return to capital standpoint. So we felt comfortable asking for the authorization and the Board was obviously comfortable approving it as a sign that the earnings power of this business has taken a material step up since early this year when we saw the curve start to rise in April. As far as the frequency of it, I think it's a function of a number of factors. It's a function of what are the market opportunities from the capital standpoint that we could deploy in the base business. We are obviously always even looking for upgrades in our own units, where we can bring in incremental megawatts, for instance, in ERCOT. We've operated some of our units to capture some of the prices that we saw this summer. So there's -- on the margin, there's opportunities to deploy on the base business small amounts of capital. Vistra Zero is obviously something that could accelerate some with the IRA that we're talking about here. But I think the main thesis, which is as we get a line of sight to these cash flows, the 60% is still well hedged, but there's still plenty that's not hedged. As that confidence builds, we could continue to update the capital return strategy, and that was the point we tried to make in our comments, and I think we have to just see how the market curves and follow from this point forward in tandem with our hedging strategy.\nShah Pourreza: Got it. Got it. And just on your hedging real quick, I guess, obviously, the backdrop is really strong. There's some perpetuity to it. I guess, why aren't you just hedging everything at this point? Is it just that you can't give the liquidity out in \u201825, fuel hedging, maybe just a bit of a fundamental view here.\nJim Burke: Sure. I think you hit a couple of the key points, Shar. The market depth is not as great, clearly, out in 2025 as it is in '23. The liquidity that we have, while it is ample, it does take more liquidity in reserve to be able to hedge that far out. And so you can imagine we've got sort of a downward sloping hedge percentage where \u201823 is hedged higher as we said, over 80%. '24 is less than that and then '25 is less than that. It's also we do tandem hedging, where we want to make sure that we've got the fuel to back up the hedging for our generation assets and some of the fuel procurement out that far in certain regions is not as deep. And so we take all that into consideration. And also, we're not sure in some of these that full value are still realized. These curves have moved up in '24, '25, but there may still be some room to run. And so it's okay for us to have a little bit of exposure to that, too.\nShah Pourreza: Got it. And then lastly, Jim, for me is one of your peers recently mentioned that they were considering maybe contracting for new build gas in ERCOT, right? I guess do you agree the market needs more? Do you guys have a fundamental view, I guess, over the next 5 years in Texas. The CDR says one thing, but the real-time markets says another.\nJim Burke: Yes. Shar, great question. That's actually hitting on the bigger topic about ERCOT market reform and how is ERCOT going to sufficiently incentivize not only the potential for new assets to come online that are dispatchable, be it thermal or battery, but also retain the assets that actually has, on the grid that were needed multiple times from May through July. I think as the market and the CDR indicates more interment resources, are clearly in the queue, and they've been coming in a fairly robust fashion. But that means that all the other assets are dispatching at times against marginal cost assets that could be dispatching at 0 or even negative prices. So I think ERCOT reform is going to have to consider how does the revenue mechanism for dispatchable assets have a factor that considers their availability and their reliability. And that may be a payment mechanism that suffer in the part can simply redispatch for energy purposes. That hadn't been figured out yet. And so I do think there's a worry that the only thing that has the incentives and that\u2019s primarily because of federal incentives to be built are more of the intermittent resources. And I think policymakers are focused and interested in having the reliability that the dispatchable assets bring. That's the focus of the study that the consultant is doing on behalf of the Public Utility Commission. We believe that there needs to be a focus on reliability. There's been a lot of focus on the transition from an environmental and emission standpoint, but in many places around the country, the reliability aspect has not been the key area of focus. I think Texas is focused on that, and Texas wants to solve this. That might incentivize some thermal generation. But without that incentive, it is hard to see that penciling now in our analysis. And so potentially with market reform, that might be something that would work.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman : Yes. I want to echo congratulations, Jim and Kris. So just on the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion range, '23 to '25. Is that an average over the 3 years? Or is that a range you expect each year?\nJim Burke: So that is an average, Steve. And similar to the last call we had, what we see is we're more hedged in the early part of that period, and we're less hedged obviously in the latter part. So even though on an absolute basis, the curves aren't as high and say '25, '23. Once you consider the relative hedge ratios, they actually end up being pretty similar.\nSteve Fleishman : Okay. So just I guess my next question was just going to be the shaping of the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, '23, '24, '25. It sounds like based on what you said, it's kind of similar each year?\nJim Burke: It is. Now, the good news is that '24 and '25 have continued to run on fine as that shape doesn't look flatter. We're more locked for '23, so we won't capture probably as much upside if '23 were to continue to run. Or the '24, '25 were to then we could absolutely see still upside in that slope actually shifting more to upward.\nSteve Fleishman : Okay. That makes sense. Is it fair to assume for '24, '25, you're using forward curves as they are right now for the open positions in those years? Or are you are cutting some just because --\nJim Burke: So yes, so we're using curves of [7 29] as we refresh this analysis. We have to take into some consideration, Steve, some of the unknowns. I mean we assume that some factors like coal constraints would have worked their way out more by 2025 and potentially the balance of '22 and '23. So we have done, and we said this risk adjustment, we have taken into account some risk adjustments as we think about this. That's why we think the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion is conservative. So we still have a decent open position out there. So it can go the other way, right? That's why we feel like hedging makes sense. That's why we like the opportunity to keep ample liquidity. But yes, this is a conservative view on a risk-adjusted basis.\nSteve Fleishman : Yes. All right. That makes a ton of sense. And then just on the IRA aside from potentially improving returns for your renewables opportunities? Any other broad thoughts on implications for Vistra as it passes?\nJim Burke: Yes. I think there are some. I think obviously, the most immediate ones would be on the renewables piece and the stand-alone batteries. More than 50% of our Vistra Zero opportunity set is storage related, and that was not attached to solar, in most cases to solar. So standalone battery ITC is meaningful for us. On carbon capture, we have some assets that could be good candidates. That's a little bit further out to be able to get the technology, but certainly, the economic incentives could be there, and we've got some attractive assets that could be coal or gas that could be candidates for carbon capture. And then the hydrogen piece, obviously, with the nuclear facility, with Comanche Peak. You've got not only the hydrogen incentive, but the production tax credit, which at today's curves looks a little bit more like it provides a floor support. I wouldn't consider it in the near-term incremental EBITDA, but it certainly helps provide a floor that's a lot higher than where the floor was in 2018, where we were looking at forward curves in the mid-$25 to $27 range for as far as the eye can see. So even if the floor is $40 to $44, that's a much more attractive place to put a anchor for a large carbon-free asset like Comanche Peak. So that's how we think about the IRA.\nSteve Fleishman : Okay. And then one last quick question on retail. Very strong quarter for you in terms of customer growth and the like. Could you just maybe give a little bit more flavor on the competitive dynamics you're seeing in retail in Texas?\nJim Burke: Yes, you bet. And I'll kick it off, Steve, and then I'd like Scott Hudson to comment here in a second. We have had a really good run in the ERCOT retail business for well over a year now. And the second quarter was really strong, as you noted. We tend to do really well. If you go back over the 20 years, when curve start to move up rapidly, and there's a lot of volatility, our value proposition to our customers really shine because we forward buy sometimes the hedging and folks would like to see a more open position. But part of our hedging strategy is selling from generation to retail and retail being able to lock in a good price for that -- for the customer base. A lot of our competitors aren't doing that. So our customers were seeing year-over-year, when inflation for gasoline was up 50% and even doubling, we're seeing our revenue rates over the quarter-over-quarter in the 8% to 10% increase rate. So that's a real value proposition for our customers. So our retention was excellent and then our acquisition with new products that we've announced heading into this hot summer which has been really well received, is something I'd like Scott to comment on because it is a product innovation and a channel strategy. It isn't just a game of oil pricing, but I think the platform that we have of stability for customers is really attractive in these periods, and it's showing up in the customer count. Scott?\nScott Hudson: Yes. Thanks, Jim, and thanks for the question, Steve. A little bit about market dynamics that we're seeing -- the market was extremely active in the quarter, first of all, with new transactions being up by about 19%, and then we're -- to capture more of that market activity. We also saw a tremendous amount of leads coming into our call centers and our digital properties, which, as Jim mentioned, I think, really speaks to the effectiveness of the marketing. And in times of volatility customers that might be on a less-known brand really come to brands that they know and trust and TXU Energy clearly falls in that category. And then lastly, as Jim mentioned, we're really known for offering first of a kind mass market product offers and the market we had -- the product we had in market this summer was called Ultimate Summer Pass. And it's a seasonal discount product that gives you percentage off during the summer and because it was so hot that particular product just really resonated with the consumers. But we have a lot of proven capabilities in terms of analytics and marketing and channel strategies, but it really is just a focus on the customer experience and how we really try to be consultative with our customers and help them find the right product and the right plan, and it's really all contributed to our success. But again, thanks for the question.\nJim Burke: Steve, I would just wrap with Scott's comment by just adding that these gains are some of the best gains we've seen in 14, 15 years. Competition has kind of winnowed a bit in terms of number of competitors because the balance sheet and the hedging requirements and the volatility make this a difficult business to just be standalone. And I think this is another case where the integrated model has really been able to show its effectiveness.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro : Maybe I have a quick follow-up on the inflation Reduction Act. Any thoughts on the minimum tax and whether that could impact cash flow going forward?\nJim Burke: I'll comment, and then I'll ask Kris to say a few words. It could. Not in the near term. We don't see anything. We still carry losses from Yuri. And so -- this is going to be something that for book purposes, it's going to take a while to work out of. And so it would down the road, as we think about what is our federal tax exposure, it could increase it. But it's not a near-term kind of in immediate vicinity of our planning horizon, but I'm going to let Kris comment further.\nKris Moldovan: Thanks, Jim. I think that's right. Given the fact of the losses during Yuri and those book losses, we don't see throughout the entirety of our planning horizon that coming into play. We will continue to monitor it. But it's not -- as Jim said, it's not a near-term effect on us.\nDavid Arcaro : Okay. Great. That makes sense. That's helpful. And then there's been a lot of focus on operations, just given how tight the ERCOT market has been. Wondering if you could just comment on kind of the current health of your fleet in ERCOT, how comfortable you're feeling as we head into August. And whether there is just still kind of maintenance work that you're trying to chip away at or just how -- what the current state of the fleet is right now?\nJim Burke: David, thank you. Great question. First of all, I'm going to tell you about how we have performed, and I hope that doesn't jinx our performance going forward because it is a tough business. And I can't get into the specific details of the financial impacts, but I can tell you from a reliability standpoint, the fleet performed exceptionally well, particularly in July, which was a critical period. The men and women that are out there in these conditions, making these units operate at the level of effectiveness that they have is really just a tremendous, tremendous effort, and there were times, I'm sure you were following where basically every megawatt was needed on the grid to keep the system with a minimum operating level of reserves. So the fleet is in good shape. It remains in good shape. We tend to take some periods on the weekends to come down for some assets to do minor repairs to make sure they're ready to go. And of course, we use our weather -- our weather forecasting as well as coordinating with ERCOT with advanced notice to let them know what our intentions are, and that has been very helpful so that we're able to do the maintenance that we need. I will say in some other parts of the country in July in PJM, we did have a few struggles with some older coal units. And so the performance that we saw from the from the July generation and retail performance was offset some by where we were seeing some unit challenges in PJM, not fully offsetting by any means, but just recognition that when you run a 40,000-megawatt fleet, there's going to be some cases where you have some unplanned impacts. Those units have been recovered and they're operating, but it's still just a matter of a large fleet diversified across the country. But in the moment, when ERCOT was its tightest and when these units were needed there was exceptional performance by the ERCOT fleet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Congratulations to you both. I just wanted to go back to the -- I'm sorry, I was going to ask you a question about your debt-to-EBITDA metrics. And obviously, as of the second quarter, they're kind of -- you've got some margin contributions there. So they're elevated above the 3x target you have long term. Maybe just could you talk to how do you see that trending over the next few years? Should we expect them to kind of remain elevated given the margin deposits? Or how should we think about those targets over the next 12 to 24 months?\nJim Burke: Sure. Yes, Durgesh, thank you. In the deck, we tried to highlight the total debt numbers, recognizing, of course, we have cash on hand. And then we have a significant amount post of this margin deposits. And of course, as we operate our fleet and we serve customers, we would expect this cash that's posted in terms of net margin deposits to come back into the system, and we've used that obviously, to pay down debt, as Kris indicated in his remarks. I believe that we're tracking, and I think you see this in the chart, I think we're tracking in the low 3s in under normal course of operation here in the very near term. If we have to keep posting margin, it means that the curves are moving up, and that probably means that our unhedged position is even more in the money, and that's a good thing from an enterprise value for Vistra. So I think the most important thing that we've done, and Kris has done an excellent job of doing this, is securing ample liquidity, which I realized that you've read some announcements over time, wondering what is the adequate amount to have, and that's something we monitor every day, and it's a function of how hedged are we, what's the volatility in the market, how far out are we hedging. And if anything, we're going to be conservative on the liquidity side and make sure that we are not paying down debt, permanent debt any sooner than we should because we want to make sure that the liquidity is there to keep taking advantage of these market opportunities. And so I'm going to ask Kris if he would like to add something.\nKris Moldovan: Yes. Thanks, Jim. The only thing that I would add is that it's just the timing that you referenced. As we reported this morning, we have approximately just over $3 billion of cash posted and a significant amount of that cash will come back over the balance of this year. And that's what -- as we perform and our units run. So that's what gives us the ability to be confident we say that we'll be able to repay more than $2.5 billion over the balance of the year and get back into the range of our target, we think, in the very near future.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners.\nJonathan Arnold: Durgesh just asked what I was going to ask. One other thing I wanted to -- just curious on as Vistra Zero grows and you start to see more of a contribution. How are you going to show that to us? Any thoughts about sort of does it just show up in the segments? Are you going to call it out just sort of back to the comment on anticipating replacing EBITDA from retiring coal with that portfolio over time. There's no -- any sense of just sort of tracking that we'll be able to do on that.\nJim Burke: Yes. Great question, Jonathan. I think I even indicated earlier this year that we would envision providing visibility for that segment. And at that same time, we were focused on restoring Moss 300 and 100 because until we got these assets operating in the spring in Texas and got Moss 300, 100 restored, there wasn't a lot of operating EBITDA in Vistra Zero. Now that we have even those assets on the ground and operating with obviously Moss 300 and 100, we have a material contribution for 2023, we see it in the ballpark of around $200 million coming from Vistra Zero. That's not a segment reported yet, but I see us getting to that segment reporting towards the end of this year. And we just wanted to make sure if it was meaningful, Jonathan, to go through that exercise at this point and we wanted to get the operating assets on the ground delivering and we've got that. So I think you can expect to see more visibility into that towards the end of the year.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke for any closing remarks.\nJim Burke: I just want to thank you for taking the time to join us, be with Kris, myself and the management team. We are incredibly excited about where Vistra is, and we look forward to speaking to you again in a few months as we update you on our execution and our outlook for 2023 and beyond. Thanks again.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kris Moldovan",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. It's an honor to be in the new role and representing Vistra on the call today. While I have met many of the participants on the call in my previous role as the Treasurer of the company, I look forward to getting to know everyone and spending time with each of you in the coming months. I'll turn now to Slide 10. As Jim noted earlier, Vistra delivered strong financial results during the second quarter with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of approximately $761 million, which was above management's expectations. Retail ended the quarter at $403 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. And while this result is $107 million lower than second quarter 2021, it is important to note that this difference is more than accounted for by the amount of onetime self-help initiatives we undertook in the second quarter of 2021 to offset some of the losses we experienced in the preceding quarter. Retail performance this quarter was favorably impacted by warmer weather, strong margins and exceptional residential customer count growth in Texas. Moving to Generation. Our collective Generation segments ended the quarter with $358 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. This result was approximately $14 million above our second quarter 2021 results after adjusting second quarter 2021 to remove the earnings attributable to Zimmer and Joppa, which are now reported in the Asset Closure segment. This increase was driven primarily by favorable prices we experienced in the quarter offset by the ongoing coal constraints the industry continues to experience as well as onetime benefits of self-help initiatives executed in the second quarter of 2021. Finally, turning to Slide 11. Our strong financial results allow us to continue to favorably execute our capital allocation plan. Specifically, as of August 2, 2022, we have executed approximately $1.6 billion of the original $2 billion authorization, repurchasing approximately 70.5 million shares or approximately 14.6% of the shares that were outstanding as of November 2021. Since we expect to execute the remaining portion of the $2 billion authorization before year-end 2022, as Jim noted, the Board of Directors has authorized an incremental $1.25 billion of share repurchases effective immediately. As such, we have approximately $1.65 billion of aggregate remaining availability for share repurchases under the upsized $3.25 billion authorization, which we expect to execute between now and the end of 2023. Additionally, the Board recently approved a quarterly dividend to be paid on Vistra's common stock in the amount of $0.184 per share or approximately $75 million in the aggregate payable on September 30, 2022. This is an approximately 23% growth in dividend per share as compared to the dividend paid in the third quarter of 2021. While we are focused on returning capital to our shareholders, we remain steadfastly committed to balance sheet strength, targeting a long-term net leverage ratio below 3x, excluding any nonrecourse debt we raised at Vistra Zero. This year, however, the material increase in forward power prices for the balance of 2022 through 2025, taken together with our increased forward hedging activities to lock in those prices, has resulted in significant increases in our collateral posting obligations and required liquidity to support these obligations. As such, we have actively worked to increase our available liquidity, including issuing $1.5 billion of short-term senior secured notes, in addition to increasing the aggregate commitments under our corporate revolver by $725 million and increasing the aggregate commitments under our commodity-linked revolver by $250 million. As a result of these proactive transactions, we have significantly increased our available liquidity which was approximately $4.5 billion as of August 3. Looking forward, as we deliver power against our hedges over the balance of 2022, we expect to see a material return of collateral including a significant amount of the cash we had posted at June 30. To that end, we anticipate repaying more than $2.5 billion of debt by year-end, including debt outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. Of course, we must continue to prudently balance the timing of these debt repayments against the liquidity needed to support our hedging program. In addition to repaying debt, we will continue to monitor and optimize the amount and sources of liquidity necessary to support our existing hedges as well as any additional hedges we may execute over time. We said we would focus on execution in 2022 and the efforts of our generation retail and commercial teams in the first 6 months have positioned us well for a successful year. We remain focused on our strategic priorities and look forward to discussing third quarter results and our outlook for the balance of 2022 and for 2023 on our next call. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jim for a brief wrap-up. Thanks, Jim. I think that's right. Given the fact of the losses during Yuri and those book losses, we don't see throughout the entirety of our planning horizon that coming into play. We will continue to monitor it. But it's not -- as Jim said, it's not a near-term effect on us. Yes. Thanks, Jim. The only thing that I would add is that it's just the timing that you referenced. As we reported this morning, we have approximately just over $3 billion of cash posted and a significant amount of that cash will come back over the balance of this year. And that's what -- as we perform and our units run. So that's what gives us the ability to be confident we say that we'll be able to repay more than $2.5 billion over the balance of the year and get back into the range of our target, we think, in the very near future."

            "name": "Jim Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Meagan, and good morning to everyone. I am excited and eager to talk with all of you as I take on this new role for Vistra. Over the past few months, I've been asked what I envision for Vistra's path forward. Accordingly, turning to Slide 5, before I discuss our second quarter results, I would first like to reinforce a few of my thoughts on Vistra's strategic direction and top priorities. I continue to remain confident in our short-term and long-term value proposition precisely because we intend to remain focused on the 4 key strategic priorities we initially defined in the third quarter of 2021. As we've shared in the past, Vistra is well positioned for the long term during this energy transition. In addition to ensuring that our customers and our communities have the power they need, our integrated approach enables us to deliver strong financial and operational performance, particularly in volatile commodity environments through the operational excellence and expertise of our generation retail and commercial teams. As part of this integrated business, we are continuing to execute on the comprehensive hedging strategy that we announced last quarter, which is locking in significant future year earnings potential. This effort is supported by a high-performing generation team and a customer-focused retail team experienced in managing counts, margins and customer experience, and both teams are supported by a strong commercial team that captures market opportunities and manages risk in a dynamic marketplace. Second, it is fundamental to a business that manages through volatile commodity markets to have the financial flexibility to hedge both fuel procurement and power sales for our fleet and for customers. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and an ample liquidity position. As Kris will cover later, we anticipate paying down a significant amount of debt in the second half of this year as our 2022 hedges settle and the corresponding cash collateral is returned. At year-end, we expect our net leverage ratio to be approximately 3x based on the range of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA we expect in 2023. Third, we are delivering on our capital allocation plan that prioritizes a significant return of capital to our shareholders through 2026. We remain committed to paying aggregate dividends of approximately $300 million per year with the per share amount increasing as we repurchase our shares. We continue to believe that share repurchases provide an efficient, attractive means to return capital to our shareholders. We are executing on our $2 billion share repurchase program on an accelerated basis, having completed approximately 80% to date and expect to complete the balance before year-end. Accordingly, we're pleased to announce that our Board has authorized an incremental $1.25 billion for share repurchases effective immediately, which brings our cumulative authorization to $3.25 billion and the remaining amount available for repurchases to approximately $1.65 billion. We expect to complete the full authorization by the end of 2023. As we deliver on our earnings potential, we will revisit the size of the share repurchase program on a regular basis. Finally, we've made great progress on the build-out of our Vistra Zero platform, which we expect to grow primarily by utilizing cost-effective third-party capital. I'll speak to updates on Vistra Zero in more detail momentarily. I am committed to the execution of our strategic priorities as I firmly believe that our successful execution of these priorities will enable Vistra to deliver sustainable long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Now turning to Slide 6 for our second quarter results. We achieved $761 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. Our Retail segment grew ERCOT residential customer counts in the quarter and year-over-year. In fact, our flagship TXU Energy brand had its best quarter residential counts performance in nearly 15 years while achieving our target margins in a dynamic market. This highlights our expertise as an integrated energy company to acquire and retain customers through volatile and high-priced commodity cycles. Our unique product offerings and multi-brand and channel strategy, combined with our commercial team's expertise in managing risk, drove this success. Our Generation segment similarly performed above expectations, achieving commercial availability of 95%, a strong performance, especially considering the unseasonably warmer weather experienced in Texas in the second quarter. The teams worked diligently to perform regular maintenance on an expedited basis and in some cases, truncated schedules to ensure the plants were available to the grid during the heatwaves experienced in the latter half of the second quarter. We are reaffirming today our previously announced guidance of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $2.81 billion to $3.31 billion and adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations of $2.07 billion to $2.57 billion. We don't typically update current year guidance until our third quarter earnings discussion, but favorable weather and strong performance in our Generation and Retail segments provide increased confidence that our 2022 outlook is tracking above the midpoint of guidance. Of course, the remaining summer months are important across the country for us, so we are focused on proactively maintaining our fleet during times of lower demand to avoid unplanned outages as much as possible. We understand that execution is key to delivering the full value we believe possible in this environment. Turning to Slide 7. As we discussed in the first quarter, we are currently experiencing a highly favorable pricing environment. We've used this opportunity to continue to execute on the comprehensive hedging strategy we previously discussed. As a result of our comprehensive hedging strategy, Vistra is now over 60% hedged across the years 2023 to 2025 with 2023 now hedged at approximately 80%. Last quarter, we stated that given the marks as of April 29, we anticipated a risk-adjusted midpoint opportunity in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion for the years 2023 through 2025. Curves moved up considerably in May and early June before coming off in late June with the drop in natural gas prices. For 2023, when comparing where we were as of April 29 and rolling that forward to July 29, overall, the curves are in a similar place despite the volatility we've seen over the past 3 months. However, for 2024 and 2025 since April 29, as the graphs indicate, both power and gas curves have continued moving up. As our hedge percentages have increased, our confidence in this earnings potential has grown. And more than that, we continue to believe this range could be on the conservative side. Of course, given that we are not fully hedged, there remains a significant range around this earnings potential, especially in '24 and '25. Looking ahead, assuming the forward curves continue to hold or improve, you can expect us to continue to execute on this comprehensive hedging strategy to lock in more value while maintaining sufficient generation length as insurance against the unforeseen. As discussed last quarter, our hedging strategy requires ample liquidity for collateral postings, we continue to proactively manage our liquidity requirements in a way that allows us to remain confident, and we can execute this hedging strategy and the capital allocation plan in tandem. Kris will go into more detail on our liquidity management activities later in the call. Turning now to Slide 8. I wanted to provide a brief update on our Vistra Zero growth trajectory and how we are positioning Vistra to capitalize on this significant opportunity. This past quarter, we returned both phases of our Moss Landing energy storage facility to service with over 98% of its maximum capacity on the expected schedule and ahead of California's hot summer months. We successfully restored and addressed root cause concerns during this timeframe, and we anticipate the final few megawatts to be restored by the fall. In addition, we began construction on the 350-megawatt Phase III expansion of our Moss Landing facility, which we expect to be online by June 2023. In Illinois, we bid in a competitive process. And in May, we were selected by the Illinois Power Agency to provide over 460,000 annual renewable energy credits, or RECs, over the course of 20 years. The contracted sale of these RECs will serve to provide stability of the revenue streams of our coal to solar projects. In June, we were also awarded energy storage grants at our Joppa, Havana and Edwards sites to be received over 10 years. We expect to bring our Illinois projects online in the 2024 timeframe ahead of the required dates for the awarded contracts. Finally, our development projects in Texas continued to make great progress as well. In April, we announced that our 50-megawatt solar facility Brightside was online. This was followed by announcement in May that our 260-megawatt energy storage facility at DeCordova was online. And in June, our 108-megawatt ERCOT solar facility, Emerald Grove, was online. We now have 608 megawatts for Vistra Zero online of solar and energy storage serving the ERCOT grid. In addition, of course, to our Comanche Peak nuclear facility. Our teams did an excellent job of delivering these projects in Texas as well as returning Phases 1 and 2 of our most Moss Landing facility to normal operation in California. Some of our early-stage projects that we are evaluating are facing potential impacts from supply chain constraints and inflation. We prudently reevaluate the business cases of these projects on a regular basis. For example, we have reassessed the timing of certain ERCOT solar projects, and we will move ahead with these projects only if we have confidence in the returns. Since we own these sites and we have the flexibility on timing, this is something we expect to remain dynamic. We are excited about the pipeline and the growth potential of achieving 7.3 gigawatts in Vistra Zero generation online by 2026, but we are also going to remain disciplined on the projects. Of course, in light of the newly introduced Inflation Reduction Act, it is possible that our Vistra Zero development projects could see enhanced returns. It is certainly a dynamic time in the marketplace and Vistra is extremely well positioned with both a strong outlook on our core generation and retail businesses, but also with Vistra Zero. With that, I will turn the call over to Kris Moldovan, our recently named CFO, to discuss the quarter's financial performance and our capital allocation progress in more detail. Many of you already know Kris well and his track record of successfully driving shareholder value for Vistra, and as of late, his active and effective management of our liquidity position. As background, he practiced as an attorney for over a decade, including gaining significant experience through representing clients in merger and acquisition activity as well as complex financing transactions. Kris has been with Vistra and its predecessor for 16 years and joined the finance team in 2010, where he has focused on some of the most complex financial transactions in our industry. I've had the privilege to work with Kris for many years and could attest personally to his insights and capabilities, and I'm very much looking forward to partnering with him as we take Vistra forward in these exciting times of transition and growth. Kris? Kris, very much and congratulations on the new role. Turning to Slide 12, to recap a few key points. First, our integrated model is uniquely positioned to capture long-term value in these dynamic conditions, and we are comprehensively hedging and have locked in over 60% of this value for the period of 2023 to 2025. We believe we have ample liquidity and balance sheet strength to execute this strategy. Our confidence in our outlook is reinforced by the upsizing of the share repurchase program to $3.25 billion, and we continue to return capital through this program and our $300 million annual dividend. Finally, we have made great progress by bringing online over 400 megawatts in new assets in Texas this spring with Vistra Zero while restoring Moss Landing battery operations in California. With our Illinois coal to solar contracts and other pipeline projects, we are excited about our ability to decarbonize our fleet and grow our business. We are tracking ahead of our 60% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030 for our fleet, and we anticipate Vistra Zero will more than replace the earnings of the retiring coal units and we are doing this with cost-efficient capital. This is an exciting time for Vistra, and we are well positioned for this energy transition to deliver long-term sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. With that, operator, we will open up the line for questions. Shar, there's a lot in that question. Let me first start with the idea that we are just past the halfway point 2022 and we feel good about where 2022 is trending. We were working through the buyback program in a fairly expeditious manner. And our next call, obviously, would be early November. So we thought, given where we're tracking in '22, plus the incremental hedging that we've been able to do for '23 through '25, our confidence level was higher. We wanted to keep the momentum in the market from a return to capital standpoint. So we felt comfortable asking for the authorization and the Board was obviously comfortable approving it as a sign that the earnings power of this business has taken a material step up since early this year when we saw the curve start to rise in April. As far as the frequency of it, I think it's a function of a number of factors. It's a function of what are the market opportunities from the capital standpoint that we could deploy in the base business. We are obviously always even looking for upgrades in our own units, where we can bring in incremental megawatts, for instance, in ERCOT. We've operated some of our units to capture some of the prices that we saw this summer. So there's -- on the margin, there's opportunities to deploy on the base business small amounts of capital. Vistra Zero is obviously something that could accelerate some with the IRA that we're talking about here. But I think the main thesis, which is as we get a line of sight to these cash flows, the 60% is still well hedged, but there's still plenty that's not hedged. As that confidence builds, we could continue to update the capital return strategy, and that was the point we tried to make in our comments, and I think we have to just see how the market curves and follow from this point forward in tandem with our hedging strategy. Sure. I think you hit a couple of the key points, Shar. The market depth is not as great, clearly, out in 2025 as it is in '23. The liquidity that we have, while it is ample, it does take more liquidity in reserve to be able to hedge that far out. And so you can imagine we've got sort of a downward sloping hedge percentage where \u201823 is hedged higher as we said, over 80%. '24 is less than that and then '25 is less than that. It's also we do tandem hedging, where we want to make sure that we've got the fuel to back up the hedging for our generation assets and some of the fuel procurement out that far in certain regions is not as deep. And so we take all that into consideration. And also, we're not sure in some of these that full value are still realized. These curves have moved up in '24, '25, but there may still be some room to run. And so it's okay for us to have a little bit of exposure to that, too. Yes. Shar, great question. That's actually hitting on the bigger topic about ERCOT market reform and how is ERCOT going to sufficiently incentivize not only the potential for new assets to come online that are dispatchable, be it thermal or battery, but also retain the assets that actually has, on the grid that were needed multiple times from May through July. I think as the market and the CDR indicates more interment resources, are clearly in the queue, and they've been coming in a fairly robust fashion. But that means that all the other assets are dispatching at times against marginal cost assets that could be dispatching at 0 or even negative prices. So I think ERCOT reform is going to have to consider how does the revenue mechanism for dispatchable assets have a factor that considers their availability and their reliability. And that may be a payment mechanism that suffer in the part can simply redispatch for energy purposes. That hadn't been figured out yet. And so I do think there's a worry that the only thing that has the incentives and that's primarily because of federal incentives to be built are more of the intermittent resources. And I think policymakers are focused and interested in having the reliability that the dispatchable assets bring. That's the focus of the study that the consultant is doing on behalf of the Public Utility Commission. We believe that there needs to be a focus on reliability. There's been a lot of focus on the transition from an environmental and emission standpoint, but in many places around the country, the reliability aspect has not been the key area of focus. I think Texas is focused on that, and Texas wants to solve this. That might incentivize some thermal generation. But without that incentive, it is hard to see that penciling now in our analysis. And so potentially with market reform, that might be something that would work. So that is an average, Steve. And similar to the last call we had, what we see is we're more hedged in the early part of that period, and we're less hedged obviously in the latter part. So even though on an absolute basis, the curves aren't as high and say '25, '23. Once you consider the relative hedge ratios, they actually end up being pretty similar. It is. Now, the good news is that '24 and '25 have continued to run on fine as that shape doesn't look flatter. We're more locked for '23, so we won't capture probably as much upside if '23 were to continue to run. Or the '24, '25 were to then we could absolutely see still upside in that slope actually shifting more to upward. So yes, so we're using curves of [7 29] as we refresh this analysis. We have to take into some consideration, Steve, some of the unknowns. I mean we assume that some factors like coal constraints would have worked their way out more by 2025 and potentially the balance of '22 and '23. So we have done, and we said this risk adjustment, we have taken into account some risk adjustments as we think about this. That's why we think the $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion is conservative. So we still have a decent open position out there. So it can go the other way, right? That's why we feel like hedging makes sense. That's why we like the opportunity to keep ample liquidity. But yes, this is a conservative view on a risk-adjusted basis. Yes. I think there are some. I think obviously, the most immediate ones would be on the renewables piece and the stand-alone batteries. More than 50% of our Vistra Zero opportunity set is storage related, and that was not attached to solar, in most cases to solar. So standalone battery ITC is meaningful for us. On carbon capture, we have some assets that could be good candidates. That's a little bit further out to be able to get the technology, but certainly, the economic incentives could be there, and we've got some attractive assets that could be coal or gas that could be candidates for carbon capture. And then the hydrogen piece, obviously, with the nuclear facility, with Comanche Peak. You've got not only the hydrogen incentive, but the production tax credit, which at today's curves looks a little bit more like it provides a floor support. I wouldn't consider it in the near-term incremental EBITDA, but it certainly helps provide a floor that's a lot higher than where the floor was in 2018, where we were looking at forward curves in the mid-$25 to $27 range for as far as the eye can see. So even if the floor is $40 to $44, that's a much more attractive place to put a anchor for a large carbon-free asset like Comanche Peak. So that's how we think about the IRA. Yes, you bet. And I'll kick it off, Steve, and then I'd like Scott Hudson to comment here in a second. We have had a really good run in the ERCOT retail business for well over a year now. And the second quarter was really strong, as you noted. We tend to do really well. If you go back over the 20 years, when curve start to move up rapidly, and there's a lot of volatility, our value proposition to our customers really shine because we forward buy sometimes the hedging and folks would like to see a more open position. But part of our hedging strategy is selling from generation to retail and retail being able to lock in a good price for that -- for the customer base. A lot of our competitors aren't doing that. So our customers were seeing year-over-year, when inflation for gasoline was up 50% and even doubling, we're seeing our revenue rates over the quarter-over-quarter in the 8% to 10% increase rate. So that's a real value proposition for our customers. So our retention was excellent and then our acquisition with new products that we've announced heading into this hot summer which has been really well received, is something I'd like Scott to comment on because it is a product innovation and a channel strategy. It isn't just a game of oil pricing, but I think the platform that we have of stability for customers is really attractive in these periods, and it's showing up in the customer count. Scott? Steve, I would just wrap with Scott's comment by just adding that these gains are some of the best gains we've seen in 14, 15 years. Competition has kind of winnowed a bit in terms of number of competitors because the balance sheet and the hedging requirements and the volatility make this a difficult business to just be standalone. And I think this is another case where the integrated model has really been able to show its effectiveness. I'll comment, and then I'll ask Kris to say a few words. It could. Not in the near term. We don't see anything. We still carry losses from Yuri. And so -- this is going to be something that for book purposes, it's going to take a while to work out of. And so it would down the road, as we think about what is our federal tax exposure, it could increase it. But it's not a near-term kind of in immediate vicinity of our planning horizon, but I'm going to let Kris comment further. David, thank you. Great question. First of all, I'm going to tell you about how we have performed, and I hope that doesn't jinx our performance going forward because it is a tough business. And I can't get into the specific details of the financial impacts, but I can tell you from a reliability standpoint, the fleet performed exceptionally well, particularly in July, which was a critical period. The men and women that are out there in these conditions, making these units operate at the level of effectiveness that they have is really just a tremendous, tremendous effort, and there were times, I'm sure you were following where basically every megawatt was needed on the grid to keep the system with a minimum operating level of reserves. So the fleet is in good shape. It remains in good shape. We tend to take some periods on the weekends to come down for some assets to do minor repairs to make sure they're ready to go. And of course, we use our weather -- our weather forecasting as well as coordinating with ERCOT with advanced notice to let them know what our intentions are, and that has been very helpful so that we're able to do the maintenance that we need. I will say in some other parts of the country in July in PJM, we did have a few struggles with some older coal units. And so the performance that we saw from the from the July generation and retail performance was offset some by where we were seeing some unit challenges in PJM, not fully offsetting by any means, but just recognition that when you run a 40,000-megawatt fleet, there's going to be some cases where you have some unplanned impacts. Those units have been recovered and they're operating, but it's still just a matter of a large fleet diversified across the country. But in the moment, when ERCOT was its tightest and when these units were needed there was exceptional performance by the ERCOT fleet. Sure. Yes, Durgesh, thank you. In the deck, we tried to highlight the total debt numbers, recognizing, of course, we have cash on hand. And then we have a significant amount post of this margin deposits. And of course, as we operate our fleet and we serve customers, we would expect this cash that's posted in terms of net margin deposits to come back into the system, and we've used that obviously, to pay down debt, as Kris indicated in his remarks. I believe that we're tracking, and I think you see this in the chart, I think we're tracking in the low 3s in under normal course of operation here in the very near term. If we have to keep posting margin, it means that the curves are moving up, and that probably means that our unhedged position is even more in the money, and that's a good thing from an enterprise value for Vistra. So I think the most important thing that we've done, and Kris has done an excellent job of doing this, is securing ample liquidity, which I realized that you've read some announcements over time, wondering what is the adequate amount to have, and that's something we monitor every day, and it's a function of how hedged are we, what's the volatility in the market, how far out are we hedging. And if anything, we're going to be conservative on the liquidity side and make sure that we are not paying down debt, permanent debt any sooner than we should because we want to make sure that the liquidity is there to keep taking advantage of these market opportunities. And so I'm going to ask Kris if he would like to add something. Yes. Great question, Jonathan. I think I even indicated earlier this year that we would envision providing visibility for that segment. And at that same time, we were focused on restoring Moss 300 and 100 because until we got these assets operating in the spring in Texas and got Moss 300, 100 restored, there wasn't a lot of operating EBITDA in Vistra Zero. Now that we have even those assets on the ground and operating with obviously Moss 300 and 100, we have a material contribution for 2023, we see it in the ballpark of around $200 million coming from Vistra Zero. That's not a segment reported yet, but I see us getting to that segment reporting towards the end of this year. And we just wanted to make sure if it was meaningful, Jonathan, to go through that exercise at this point and we wanted to get the operating assets on the ground delivering and we've got that. So I think you can expect to see more visibility into that towards the end of the year. I just want to thank you for taking the time to join us, be with Kris, myself and the management team. We are incredibly excited about where Vistra is, and we look forward to speaking to you again in a few months as we update you on our execution and our outlook for 2023 and beyond. Thanks again."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMeagan Horn: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Vistra's investor webcast discussing first quarter 2022 results which is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. Also available on our website are copies of today's investor presentation, our Form 10-Q and the related press release. Joining me for today's call are Curt Morgan, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Burke, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Before we begin our presentation, I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slide 2 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. Further, today's press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. I will now turn the call over to Curt Morgan to kick off our discussion.\nCurt Morgan: Thank you, Meagan. Good morning to everyone and thank you for your continued interest in Vistra. Getting started with Slide 5. I've mentioned before that 2022 is a year of executing on the strategic priorities we outlined in the third quarter of 2021, shown on this slide. Importantly, Vistra has started on the right foot in 2022 with Q1 results consistent with our expectations and it is noteworthy that our confidence regarding 2022 has grown. However, to me, the bigger story is the material movement in energy commodities complex forward curves for '23 and beyond. And our emphasis on a comprehensive hedge strategy, capitalizing on this move that began last year, continued in the first quarter and continues today. Notably, we expect this upward trend to continue given how the U.S. and world energy situation is set up, especially regarding ESG and boardroom actions in response, combined with strong demand and geopolitical events. In a nutshell, the U.S. natural gas complex is already tight and likely to be increasingly tied to world gas economics. As an expanding pivotal supplier on the world stage, we expect U.S. supply and demand to tighten even further. Higher natural gas prices in turn lead to higher power prices and Vistra is long power and natural gas equivalents. Frankly, in my 40 years, I have not seen a confluence of events quite like this. Certainly, Vistra is in the right position to capitalize on the strong forward curves. The effectiveness of our execution will be key as the day-to-day volatility is extraordinary. It is a rare opportunity presented to us and it is our job to create the most value out of it while managing the risk. Our prudent hedging strategy has resulted in Vistra locking in material out-year value in the '23 to '25 timeframe. And it is worth noting that the forwards have also risen materially out to 2030. The market clearly believes there has been a fundamental shift in the energy commodity complex and it started before the aggression against Ukraine. This shift, as reflected in the forwards, offers continued opportunities to hedge more while remaining mindful of the potential liquidity requirements against further commodity price moves. The good news is that this offers right-way risk with our open position as well as the significant value already hedged. We also have tandem hedged, other risks associated with our commodity hedge positions, such as fuel and basis differentials. Our generation fleet has also performed exceptionally well at an average commercial availability in the mid-90s percent as a critical component of our hedging strategies. We bolstered this exceptional historical performance by the additional expenditures after Uri to derisk our ERCOT plant operations and as we have mentioned in the past, we hold back generation to cover forced outages, all to manage any risk exposure that hedges can expose us to. Our primary focus when hedging is on managing risk while capturing value. We are not focused on picking the absolute peak. Our experience is that this futile endeavor leads to a significant risk of missing the opportunity entirely. As it relates to 2022, while we were considerably hedged coming into the year, our open position in the summer months could now benefit from the power price environment which we expect to remain intact given the likely continued strength of natural gas prices, as I just discussed. This is our expectation even without an extreme weather event. In addition, our retail business continues to deliver strong margins while organically growing customer counts as customers in ERCOT value quality retail names like TXU Energy and Ambit. Jim will speak to the significant value capture opportunity in more detail momentarily. But in sum, the EBITDA outlook for Vistra through 2025 has now increased to potentially over $1 billion even with prudently conservative estimates and the market has only continued to move up. As briefly mentioned a moment ago, a robust hedging strategy, of course, requires significant liquidity as collateral postings are required. Notably, our commitment to a strong balance sheet with significant liquidity has positioned us with the cash and access to capital necessary to make the collateral postings while continuing to execute solidly on our $2 billion share repurchase program and pay out significant dividends to our shareholders of record. Of course, in this environment, you can never have enough liquidity. As such, we continually look for ways to efficiently manage our liquidity and are working diligently to enhance access to capital so we can further take advantage of the long-dated move up and forward and capture value for our shareholders. We believe these efforts will be successful given the significant strength of our business and the amount of forward value we can lock in. Finally, we remain committed to sensibly progressing our fleet of zero carbon generation. As of today's call, we have completed construction of our Brightside and Emerald Grove solar facilities and our DeCordova battery energy storage facility in ERCOT. Additionally, we've been working around the clock to install replacement connectors in the water-based heat suppression safety systems at Moss 300 and Moss Landing 100 and expect to begin bringing those megawatts back online ahead of the hot California summer months. Despite the challenges, the supply chain issues or the uncertainties around solar panel procurement that the Department of Commerce's anti-circumvention investigation are causing the industry, we find ourselves well positioned to navigate these particular headwinds and as we continue to advance the growth of our Vistra Zero portfolio. Our planned 2022 development projects are constructed and we've already procured panels for several of our next-in-line solar projects. Further, our remaining projects have a timeline that allows us to opportunistically contract at the right time. It is important to note that we will remain disciplined in our development efforts, especially given that we either have procured the equipment or have flexibility to time our projects with availability and pricing of equipment. It is also important to note that the supply chain bottlenecks and government actions are dampening the build-out of renewables in the U.S., placing more emphasis on the existing fleet of assets, especially natural gas fueled and nuclear power plants. As we have said many times before, natural gas fueled power plants are going to be critical to a rational and just transition to a decarbonized electric system. Moving now to Slide 6. In the first quarter, we achieved $547 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations in line with our expectations. Notably, this year, our first quarter results are a smaller contribution to our overall annual earnings as compared to certain prior year first quarters. But this new earnings shape was expected for 2022 and is correlated to the seasonality of our retail business in the ERCOT market during the winter months with higher cost of goods sold locked in to hedge retail sales. However, there is greater margin opportunity expected in the remaining months in both our retail and wholesale businesses. With that said, the Retail segment performed above expectations in Q1 in ERCOT with notable organic customer count growth and strong margin performance. Our Generation segment came in a little below expectations, largely due to a greater open position and lower realized prices from a weaker winter. However, with very strong performance in commercial availability rates at the plants of approximately 96% in this first quarter. We are reaffirming our previously announced guidance of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $2.81 billion to $3.31 billion and adjusted free cash flows before growth from ongoing operations of $2.07 billion to $2.57 billion. We retain the ranges as we are still early in the year, have the summer months ahead of us and at this point in time, we continue to carry a little more open position than in the past for risk management purposes. However, we reaffirm this guidance with increased confidence given the favorable energy commodities markets we continue to experience. In closing, Vistra is very well positioned, especially given the current market environment. Execution is key in 2022 and beyond, especially related to our hedging in forward years and managing adequate liquidity. Now before I turn it over to Jim, as you are likely all aware, this will be my last earnings call as CEO of Vistra. It has been my distinct honor and privilege to serve you all for nearly six years. I want to thank our many stakeholders for their support throughout my tenure. In particular, all of you who entrusted us with your hard-earned money. I know, I gave it my best to do business the right way and create value for our investors. I'm proud of all that we've accomplished and believe Vistra is well positioned to drive continued industry leadership. This is simply the right time for me to transition the CEO role to Jim. Jim has done everything to be prepared for this demanding job. After having worked with Jim for many years, I have the utmost confidence in his capabilities, commitment to Vistra and his leadership skills. He has a deep experience and knowledge of our business, including an understanding of how the disparate parts of the company work together. I am certain and our Board is certain that he is the right person to lead us through our next phase as we execute on our capital allocation plan, including substantial return of capital and expansion of our Vistra Zero portfolio. Finally, to the incredible team members at Vistra. I have never been more honored and proud to work with a group of people. Your life has shown brightly through thick and thin and I am grateful for the time we had together. I believe there is a tremendous opportunity ahead for Vistra as a leader in the power business and look forward to watching that come to fruition. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Curt. I will get into additional details surrounding our first quarter's financial performance outlook and our strategy. But before I do so, I want to express my appreciation for all Curt has done to lead this company over the past six years. Curt has been a mentor and a friend to me. But more importantly, Curt has been a champion of Vistra and its many varied stakeholders. Vistra's accomplishments under Curt's leadership since he took the helm in 2016 for many. We grew our business by acquiring Dynegy, Crius and Ambit, moving from a Texas-only company to one operating in over 20 states, delivering over $850 million a year in annual value drivers while pivoting the company to being predominantly a natural gas-powered fleet serving over four million retail customers and well positioned for future growth with Vistra Zero. Curt Championed the integrated model and highlighted the benefits of our commercial capability that is tightly integrated with our generation and retail businesses and the importance of a strong balance sheet. He pioneered our ESG and DEI efforts despite the challenges we faced with Uri and the COVID pandemic. These accomplishments, among many others, resulted in a doubling in value for our shareholders while also providing a strong foundation for the future. I want to reassure you all on the call today that as CEO, I'm ready to build on what we have achieved and I intend to remain focused on our previously announced capital allocation plan with a commitment, as always, to delivering sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. I am grateful to Curt and committed to do my best to lead Vistra going forward alongside some of the finest, most dedicated colleagues in our industry. Turning now to Slide 8. Vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter that were in line with our expectations with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of approximately $547 million. We recognize the quarter-over-quarter comparison is not meaningful given the Uri impacts to last year's earnings. Retail ended the first quarter in 2022 at $163 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations and our collective generation segments ended the quarter with $384 million in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. Despite the expected lower than historical contribution, we believe these first quarter results from ongoing operations positions us to achieve or exceed the midpoint of the EBITDA guidance previously announced. This quarter also continued the execution of our previously announced capital allocation plan. We repurchased approximately 18.6 million shares since our last reported share count as of February 22, 2022. As of May 3, 2022, we've repurchased approximately 54 million shares since the share buyback program was initiated, accounting for a total of approximately 10.5% of shares then outstanding. Approximately 431.8 million shares remain outstanding as of May 3, 2022 and $805 million remains available for additional share repurchases for the remainder of 2022. The Board has also approved a quarterly dividend to be paid on the common stock in the amount of $0.177 per share payable on June 30, 2022. This is approximately 18% growth in dividend per share as compared to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2021. We continue to prioritize a strong balance sheet in the near term and are balancing the hedging opportunities to lock in value with ensuring sufficient liquidity for these dynamic markets. especially given that the hedging activity is locking in materially higher future earnings. We will continue to provide updates on the $1.5 billion debt repayment as the year progresses and as we capitalize on opportunities to lock in value and manage liquidity. Similarly, we are committed to our transformational growth and are actively exploring avenues to support the Vistra Zero portfolio with nonrecourse financing where we find those financing markets remain open and with satisfactory interest rates. We can't discuss our capital allocation plan in full without acknowledging the commodities and power pricing environment that we've been experiencing this past quarter. As reflected on Slide 9, this quarter saw dramatic increases in both the ERCOT and PJM weighted spark spreads for 2023. These trends have continued through April and into May. Given the favorable environment, we've continued our hedging strategy to lock in value in 2023 and beyond. As of March 31, 2022, we were 93% and 96% hedged in Texas and East segments, respectively, for 2022 and we were 60% and 67% hedged in those segments, respectively, for 2023. Turning now to Slide 10. This slide illustrates in more detail the phenomena we've all been observing, reflecting that power price forwards are up dramatically in correlation with the increase in the gas price forwards. This environment increases margins across our fleet in the money gas generation plants, coal, nuclear and renewables. In addition to locking in the revenue values, we have also been hedging coal, gas and nuclear fuel cost as a result of our comprehensive hedging strategy. Vistra is now over 50% hedged across the years 2023 to 2025. To provide a sense of magnitude, we have stated in the past that we expect to consistently earn above $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations on a go-forward basis. Given the marks as of April 29, we now anticipate a risk-adjusted midpoint in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion for adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations for the years 2023 through 2025. Again, we are just over 50% hedged, so there is still a significant range around this midpoint. However, the curves have continued to move up materially since April 29. So we believe that range of estimates to be on the conservative side. We are continuing to execute on our comprehensive hedging strategy to lock in as much of that value as possible. Notably, a comprehensive hedging strategy requires significant liquidity for collateral postings. We are actively managing our liquidity requirements in a way that allows us to remain confident at this time that we can execute our hedging strategy and the capital allocation plan in tandem. In closing, we continue to focus on execution in 2022, execution on the growth of our Vistra Zero portfolio, of our comprehensive hedging strategy and of our previously announced capital allocation plan. And we firmly believe in the value this execution will bring to our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our achievements as we progress throughout the remainder of 2022. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: So, maybe if we could start with earnings and the hedging outlook and sort of in light of the current commodity environment. It looks like you guys hedged into '23 fairly well here versus February. And obviously, we appreciate the high-level color on '24 and '25 in the slides. But can you give us any more detail on the amount of hedging you've done into the outer years of the curve, if at all? I mean, put differently, have you departed from -- your typical hedging profile here given the opportunities or fundamental view, I'm really thinking about your approach to 25 and '26 but I do obviously appreciate that the curves can get a little bit of liquid on the power side quickly so.\nCurt Morgan: Yes. So look, I'll start with a couple of opening questions but Jim can then fill in with specifics and add his flavor to it. But look, I do think we've departed and we're going to depart. If anything, a message we deliver today is that we've got really one of the most rare opportunities in my career and I've been around a long time, to lock in significant value in the out years. The curves have moved up -- sorry, even out into 2030. The thing you have to balance, all of us do, even if you're investment grade, is margins and posting and having enough liquidity. And we feel very good that we will be able to do that. But this is a rare opportunity for us and this is a good news story. It's all about execution and we feel good about it. And then, of course, as these hedges realize, you got to run the assets. And the one thing that we've been very proud of through the years is just the incredible performance of our generating fleet to back up the hedges. So this is one of the best opportunities I've ever seen for a company like ours and we just need to capitalize on it. So philosophically, we are departing a bit and we are looking to hedge '24, '25, I suspect just given the way that the energy commodity price -- world markets are set up, we think this is going to be around a while and we'll roll hedges into '26, '27 and beyond because we believe that you're going to see a strong natural gas market for many years to come. So, it's a rare situation and one we have to step up and capitalize on. And Jim can tell you a little more about the specifics of what we've done in '24 or '25 because we have done some significant hedging which is rare for us because you know this, Shar. Generally, these curves are backward dated. And we are seeing pricing that is at or above our point of view. And we've told you that when we see prices at or above our point of view, we expect to hedge and we're not trying to pick the highs. We're just trying to lock value and then we just have to execute from that. Jim, do you want to add? You bet, Curt.\nJim Burke: Shar, the way Curt described it, it looks like a unique opportunity and we're taking advantage of it because we have typically seen tremendous backwardation. So we'll see prompt months and maybe a year show up but then the outer periods have not responded. I think on Slide 10, where you saw the curve moves, particularly gas driven but also the sparks that have driven considerably higher in the '23, '24 period, we decided to layer on more hedges. That's what gave us the confidence to talk about '23 to '25. As you know, we would normally talk about 2023 after the summer and we would generally and I cannot recall that we've ever spoken specifically with confidence two and three years out. But we're representing that in our materials today because we have hedged over 50% in total for that three year period a little bit more in the front in '23, a little bit less in '25. There's still a range around that and that's the important thing. And that range can go higher. It could also go lower. We recognize that. And that's why we talk about that range as a midpoint. So there's a chance for that number to go down. We would put this in the range of potentially $500 million, $600 million to the downside, possibly that to the upside and we think that's reasonable. And so giving you a sense of how much we've hedged and putting that out with all was important for investors because these opportunities, as Curt said, don't come around very often.\nCurt Morgan: And Shar, look, we know you guys model. Everybody does. We want to give you some idea of this. But I think it's important to also note that I think the skews to the upside, especially given that commodity prices have moved up and that 3.5% to 3.7% range was a 4.29% [ph] vintage and we've seen a pretty big move up this week alone. And so we're just trying to give you an idea but the earnings power of this company for the next -- at least three years and beyond is significantly higher and it's just the realities of the situation. And like I said, it's our job now to manage that because it's not without risk. But that's what we do and we do it well. So that's -- this is a good news story but we need to execute.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. And as we think about sort of the potential for extra cash to come in the door versus your plans last fall, how does your, I guess, calculus shift at all? I mean at a high level, how would you maybe prioritize the incremental cash? Should we be thinking about returning to shareholders more delevering growth CapEx like Vistra Zero acceleration? And the reason why I'm asking this is, this is obviously in light of your view that the curves, the moves in the curves aren't really transitory, right?\nCurt Morgan: Look, I think it really doesn't change much. I mean, we still like the value proposition of buying our shares. And so -- but this -- you know this, it's a function of where you're trading at in terms of your share price. But if you said, okay, what would you do if you have a pile more cash today? I think we'd say, we'd buy back our shares. But we also want to maintain a strong balance sheet for sure. And we want to pay a healthy dividend. And the buyback our shares has helped us pay a healthy dividend and increase that over time for those -- the shareholders of record. So, I'm not sure that we would change that much. We've said that we would prefer not to use the cash flow from the core business on Vistra Zero to allow Vistra Zero to raise its own capital because we could get cost of active capital there and we still have a high free cash flow yield. And so that may not be the best place to put it. So, I think it's the real three primary capital allocation buckets that we've always talked about and share repurchases would continue to be strong on that list. But again, that's a function of where you're trading at any given time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.\nMichael Sullivan: Good morning. Curt, congrats and all the best. And Jim, congrats to you as well and good luck here. Exciting times. Yes, maybe just wanted to start and just with a quick clarification. The $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion range you gave, is that true in each individual year? Or is that an average over the '23 to '25?\nCurt Morgan: Jim, do you want to take that?\nJim Burke: Yes. So Michael, it is. First of all, it is a range that applies to all three years, okay? So we see all three years within that range. We didn't want to put out individual year guidance and individual year hedge percentages at this point because this is moving -- We've taken advantage of a lot of the hedging opportunities that the month of April provided us where we really started to see this move. But we're pretty flat over that three year period because we have a little bit more hedges on at the beginning when the move started in the near term and a little bit more open to the out even though they're still backwardation, the captured value ends up being pretty similar across that three year period.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. That's super helpful color. And then maybe just on the liquidity side, Jim, if you could give us an update there on some of the steps you're taking. I think there was a revolver update yesterday and just as things continue to evolve here? And it sounds like you expect things to get increasingly more volatile. Just how you're thinking about that and what are some of the steps you can take to manage that liquidity? Just more color there would be helpful.\nJim Burke: You bet. Yes. And Curt emphasized liquidity in his remarks and it is front and center for us being able to capture this opportunity and make sure that as we continue to hedge because we'd like to do that, we'd like to continue to put more hedges on at these levels that we have adequate liquidity. So you saw us increase the commodity-linked revolver so that we have $2.1 billion of available liquidity as of yesterday. That is very helpful in managing the hedge levels that we already have put on. We also are looking to do some additional raise and work with other counter-parties in a more credit efficient way which we can do with some of our first lien opportunities to hedge with parties and we do that already but we expect to increase that level of activity. And so our view is that did now is the time to make sure we have ample liquidity because we want to not only hedge more, we want to be able to withstand any further moves because the goal here is all this liquidity comes back to us, right? It all comes back as we operate and deliver the power through the various calendar years. And so it's relatively cost effective for us to load up on even additional liquidity to make sure we can hedge more because we know that this cash does return and just make sure that we have the line of sight and continue to bring the range of outcomes in the out years even tighter. And I think, as Curt noted, I think the midpoint of this range is skewed to the upside. I think the midpoint can continue to move up and we can give you that confidence as we continue to put more hedges on. But we've had great access to liquidity. All of our partners that have worked with us have been very helpful because they understand this is the right-way risk as these hedges continue to be put on and we have to post more. They know the franchise value of the enterprise is continuing to grow. That's a great place to be and this is going to be something that we'll continue to actively manage.\nCurt Morgan: Michael, if I can just add something too. The nice thing about adding this liquidity is that we can keep it outstanding and keep this on our balance sheet as long as it's necessary. So if we continue in a high-priced volatile market, we can continue to extend this liquidity and lock in value. And the annual cost of that liquidity relative to the value locked in, as Jim just said, it is very low; so it's a compelling value proposition. If we were to come back to a more recent historical normal level of commodity prices which I'm not sure will happen. But let's just say that we did. We can always then reoptimize the balance sheet and shrink the amount of liquidity that we have to the volatility in the marketplace at that given time; so we can flex it. And because it's right-way risk and also because we tandem hedge all the risks, not just the commodity risk but also basis and fuel, we have a high -- and we can perform very -- at a high level with our generation. We have a high confidence of achieving the cash flow levels that the hedges bring to us which obviously satisfied the cost of the added liquidity. So -- and this is -- right now and this works for us. Liquidity is very important to us; we have access to it and it allows us to go out and lock that significant value in for years to come and that's a rare opportunity for companies to have.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: And congratulations to both of you but very well-earned retirement here. Leaving on a high note, as we say. I suppose just coming back to this quasi guidance, if you will. Just to reconcile that $1 billion number you threw out in the comments versus the $3.6 billion midpoint that you just talked about a second ago. Just the $1 billion, that was relative to what? Just to make sure I understood that appropriately.\nCurt Morgan: You mean when I say was $1 billion of value that we were adding, you're talking about what I said in my remarks?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes.\nCurt Morgan: Jim, you can answer that because you know it, too. So go ahead.\nJim Burke: Yes, yes. Sure. Julien, that was in the remarks we said through 2025, nearly $1 billion. That was a cumulative minimum value increase from '23, '24, '25 of $1 billion. So think about that as $333 million a year minimum, so that gets to our $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion which is higher than where anyone was really thinking we were ahead of this commodity moves where they -- we said we're a $3-plus billion business. Some would say you're a $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion kind of business. So we're taking that delta and saying assume $300-plus million a year, that gets you to this midpoint of the range we're talking about for three years is $1 billion.\nCurt Morgan: And Jim, can I add that we debated on this one, Julien, because if you take the $3 billion plus that we always say, that number is close to $2 billion. If you take sort of the $3.3 billion that we sort of, I guess, gave a wink and a nod to for 2023 previously, then that number is closer to a little over $1 billion. So the reality is it's a significant amount above -- depending on what you want to use as your baseline. And we looked at consensus, too. And that number is -- no matter how you slice it, it was at least over $1 billion. And so that's why we felt comfortable saying that. And those two, we tried to reconcile those, what Jim said, the $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion and what I said. But no matter how you slice it, it's $1 billion or more. And you can argue with the $3 billion-plus number, it's closer to $2 billion.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. No, no, no, indeed. Both numbers are conservative. I got you. I hear you. Well, listen, I mean, just to keep that focus going on the commodity front, what are you seeing with your coal counter-parties and your logistics counter-parties here? I mean, are the PRB suppliers finally ramping up? And to that end, how have you made arrangements and what are you seeing with logistics? And ultimately, what's priced into that $3.6 billion, for instance, on delivered PRB and your lignite, etcetera?\nCurt Morgan: Jim, you can talk. Yes, go ahead, Jim.\nJim Burke: Julien, I'll start and Curt, thank you for that. We have factored in that even in 2022, it has been tough for some of the PRB suppliers to fully ramp up. As you would expect, as gas continues to move up, everyone is trying to get more coal and that's logical but it is difficult for some of these coal supply chains to respond. And some of it is simply hiring and having enough people to actually operate the equipment and some of it is weather driven. There's been storms that have actually disrupted some supplies. We factored that into how we think about 2022 and we have factored in the ranges we just gave you. So we are not assuming perfect execution on the coal supply chain. We do think, over time, this will get resolved either because there will be a more fulsome response to the supply chain maybe even outside of the 2022 timeframe before that happens, or gas may actually, at some point, dissipate and not put quite as much strain on the system. But it has been a challenge more on the PRB and the train set as so with the barge coal that we have access to for our Ohio plants but that is something we took into consideration when we provided these numbers. Go ahead, Curt.\nCurt Morgan: Well, I'll add to this, Julien, is that we have good relationships with the BN also with KCS. And then down with Coleto Creek, it's UP. And we have good relationships. We have long-term historical relationships. And I think we're going to continue to work and I am and so is Jim with the leadership of those companies to try to help us through this, especially given that we got a summer coming up in Texas. We want to make sure we have adequate access to coal. But it is -- they're struggling like everybody else on the supply chain side and having enough labor. I can't remember the number, Jim but it's like six to nine months to train new people on the railroad. So it takes a long time to get new people -- fresh people in and get them trained. So this is an issue. The good news is we've been conserving where we can. We're going into the summer with a decent pile. We'd like to have more and we'd like to see the train sets get picked up. I think we'll be able to work that out and this is something you just have to work together with the railroads on.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. But you're pricing in kind of current strip pricing or...\nCurt Morgan: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners.\nJonathan Arnold: And congratulations to you both. Just a quick one on given this big shift in the market, does it change any of your thoughts around planned retirements that you have scheduled -- just curious there.\nCurt Morgan: So some of our retirements are already scheduled because they are part of agreements that we have I'd say there are some that are not. And certainly, we're going to look at the whole suite of things that we look at when we decide whether we retire a plant. But I think the other thing we have to balance is markets are tight and we're part of the reliability of markets and also the affordability of our product as well as emissions. And so I could see a situation where maybe we would extend some of the coal plants. But we've also agreed to shut those down as part of the coal combustion residual rule at EPA. And so a lot to take into account. But could we say maybe go from '25 to '26 for something? We might. And I think we just have to consider what does the market look like, what's the need of the power plant. And it's not a foregone conclusion that all these are economic even with these prices. Having said that, we're economic people but we're also about trying to help with reliability in the markets that we serve and keeping prices affordable. So we'll have to balance all that and see what that brings us. We haven't made any definitive decisions on any of those other coal plants other than the ones that we have committed to retiring as part of some sort of a commitment.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. I mean you've not assumed anything like that in this outlook, I imagine?\nCurt Morgan: That's right. That's correct. We have not.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. And then could I just -- just a couple of things on liquidity. Could you maybe update for us just what the current numbers are relative to the ones you put in the release for the end of March, given the April moves? I think you said you now have two available rather than one but I want to make sure net of moves in commodity but I just want to make sure we got that.\nCurt Morgan: Jim will take that.\nJim Burke: Yes, we had $3.1 billion available as of the end of March. We now have $2.1 billion available and we added $1 billion to the commodity rate revolving facility for capacity because of the moves, particularly in April. And we wanted to take advantage of hedging more in the month of April. So we increased our capacity some but we still have the ability -- we still have the $2.1 billion available to us after all postings that we've made to date.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. And the implication of your prior comments is that you feel confident you could flex more if you needed to?\nCurt Morgan: Correct. That's correct.\nJonathan Arnold: And just a different kind of liquidity question. But as you out in the out years, in the past, it's been challenging to find liquidity in power. But maybe gas has been more liquid. Can any -- can you give us any sense of is that changing? Or how are you -- what's the nature of the hedges you're able to put on that far out?\nJim Burke: It has been changing, Jonathan. I think both the sell side as well as the buy side has -- see this as either opportunity or potentially risk if they don't buy long term. So we've been able to hedge both gas and power out through '25 with fairly deep markets compared to what we've seen historically. And I think that is something that has occurred as people are thinking this is not temporary. We've generally seen, as we talked earlier, things move up in the very short run and then you see some assumed corrections. But you don't even see that with the NYMEX curve now for the next 10 years. So I think folks are seeing that the complex is moving up. They see difficulty in supply chains. They see difficulties with some of the environmental restrictions that are happening. So I think folks are concerned about where this whole commodity complex could go. So there has been folks on the other side willing to make longer-dated purchases that we haven't seen the same depth in prior markets.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore.\nDurgesh Chopra: Maybe just Curt and/or Jim, maybe can you talk to the first quarter 2022 EBITDA? I appreciate sort of the profiling has changed post Uri. But just maybe a little bit color there. And then when you talk about margin opportunity or greater margin opportunity rest of the year, I get, I mean, obviously, there's upside from the commodity standpoint or open positions. But is there something on the retail side in terms of profiling or expenses that we're missing? So any color there is appreciated.\nJim Burke: Sure. Yes, Durgesh, what ended up happening post Uri is the first quarter cost structure shifted up remarkably as people started to conclude that the winter has potentially even if not more volatility built into it than the summer. ERCOT, as you know, has always been a summer focus. People have always talked about peak capacity and peak demand in the summer. Uri shifted that. And now we saw the first quarter part of the curve move up considerably. Retail has to buy that but they generally flat price their customers. We don't have a lot of indexed-based structures with particularly residential customers. So when we flat price, it basically means that the margins get squeezed considerably still positive but definitely lower in the first quarter than historical patterns. What that means is it really opens up the margins in 2Q and 4Q relative to what we have seen in the past. So when Curt was alluding to we have greater earnings power in the back part of the year, that's not assuming anything with the open position. That's just simply if you were to model retail margins on a monthly basis, you would have historically seen a better first quarter margin than we're seeing at the moment because of the shape of the 12-month curve.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. So just to be clear, it's the retail margins that we're talking about, the profiling of the retail margins Q1 and then rest of the year, right? I mean we're expecting to pick up.\nJim Burke: That's correct. Yes.\nCurt Morgan: I mean if I can add, though, I mean, look, the prices have moved up, too, though, on the wholesale side. But what we were talking about specifically about what we were seeing and we actually had factored in into our guidance was what Jim talked about which was that shift in retail margins. And we don't -- you know that guys, this is a little bit disappointing is that we don't give quarterly guidance. And unfortunately, there is a consensus out there which is generally built on kind of an assumption of the percentage of EBITDA of the annual and the reality of the situation is that does move at times. And we tandem hedge. When we sell retail, we tandem hedge with wholesale. And we knew this -- this was in our guidance number all along. And we knew that we were going to be a little skinnier on the first quarter but higher in the second and the fourth. Now we've also seen them move up a little bit on the third because of wholesale pricing. We'll see if that comes to fruition. But that's just how things work and we just want to be clear that we understood this phenomenon. And we don't -- we're not seeing it in the outer years, either. We think things will probably, at least over time, move back to more of a traditional split or shape of earnings. But it just happened in '22 just given the way that traded relative to the -- when we locked in retail.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. That's super helpful color. Just one quick one for me. On the topic of share repurchases, the latest guidance you have for '23 and beyond is, I believe, at least $1 billion a year and right? And we're looking at sizable EBITDA cash flow upside, Curt, that you alluded to in your commentary and the EBITDA estimates going forward. When should we expect sort of an update on the use of that excess cash that now you're seeing over 2023 and beyond? Is that sometime later this year? When should we expect an update on that in the use of the cash proceeds?\nCurt Morgan: Yes. Well, Jim, I don't want to -- because I'm not going to be here after obvious one but I would expect that just the way we've normally done is later this year, after we get through the summer and also, we've done some more hedging, my guess is we'll talk about at least about '23. And we'll see about '24 and '25.\nJim Burke: No, I was going to say, Curt, I agree with that completely. I think we need to get through the summer. Let's look at the additional hedges that we anticipate putting on at these kind of levels. And obviously, we won't hedge all the way up but we still think there's value to capture here. So we'll again, emphasis on liquidity. All this money will come back to us eventually but we do want to preserve long-term value and take advantage. So I think it would be prudent for us to talk about that in the fall when we give the guidance for next year. That will be a good time for us to update our cash flow and our capital allocation assumptions for '23.\nOperator: And the last question today will come from James Thalacker from BMO Capital.\nJames Thalacker: Congratulations, Curt, It's really been a pleasure. Just had two real quick questions. Just following up on Julien's coal question. I know you said your outlook reflects basically the current curves on coal pricing. But is that coal pricing based on an FOB basis? I know that the rails are also having some labor issues also on deliveries and that could be impacting upward pressure on transport costs. So just wondering what you guys are seeing there.\nCurt Morgan: Go ahead, Jim.\nJim Burke: Yes. I was going to say, we have some long-dated transportation arrangements for our key facilities, James. So our issue has been less rail transport cost. It has been simply about quantity as it relates to PRB, getting all the quantity that our plants could consume in the higher kind of power price and natural gas price worlds. So we have been less exposed to the cost of transport. It's been for us a little bit more on the quantity side.\nJames Thalacker: Okay, great. That's helpful. And just sticking along that same line. Do you think that some of the recent move in power could also be a reflection of gas plants being dispatched out of merit to preserve some of these coal stockpiles? Some of the more regulated [indiscernible] we've talked to are down to like 20, 25 days as we move into summer. Just wondering if that could be contributing to the [indiscernible] and the moves recently.\nCurt Morgan: Absolutely. In fact, I'm certain of it, that, that is affecting it because some people are -- they're holding on in the shoulder periods where the margin isn't that great on coal, they're backing off. Gas is having to come on at setting price. So yes, that interplay between gas and coal is going to continue until the coal can solve the issue. But yes, that definitely is having an impact on price.\nJames Thalacker: Okay, great. And then just the last question and this is kind of -- I apologize for being greedy and I know that we're only a week after the -- when you guys priced your upside of $1 billion through 2025. But obviously, prices have continued to kind of move up. Are you -- going back to that previous question, Curt and Jim, do you think that pricing will kind of hold in this level and that you feel good about kind of being able to lock in, let's say, $300 million across to 2025? Or do you think that we're kind of at a peak here and we should really be sort of baking in any incremental upside from here?\nCurt Morgan: Well, how we handle it? Well, I'll just keep in mind, Jim, I'd like to hear what you have to say. I'll pull out my crystal ball here. Look, I think here's what I would say about it. We would like to continue to hedge. And 70% to 80% would feel pretty good to us in those out-years right now, the ones that we've talked about. But the one thing we're just going to make sure, James, is that we also have the liquidity to go along with it. So, we're just -- we're being prudent about it. But I would also say that whether it's going to stay at this level or go a little bit higher in the near term, things seem to be a fair amount of fear in the market around gas right now. How long that lasts, I don't know. But I do believe that we're going to stay at pretty strong levels on gas and power for a while and we'll pick our shocks. But look, we see a real opportunity here. We have a sense of urgency as a company. This -- you don't get this opportunity very often and so you can be rest assured that we're working urgently to lock in value at these kind of levels. And so I wouldn't be surprised to see us having increased our hedging between now and the next quarter when we talk to you again. I mean I just think that -- and we're not going to worry about whether it's at the peak or not. We just -- what we really care about is it a fundamentally good value for the company. Jim, you want to add to that?\nJim Burke: Yes. Curt, I agree completely. And I would just add that if prices stay where they are and we continue to increase our hedge percentage, then we would see this range move up from where it is. That's what we meant by we were being conservative because we made this range off of the April 29 curve, James. And as you noted, they've moved up. So, if they stay where they are and we can continue to hedge into that, I would expect that you'd see this midpoint of this range move up.\nJames Thalacker: Okay, great. Yes. Sorry about the greedy question but I was just curious because it seems the biggest delimiter that you guys probably have, to your point, is really just maintaining adequate liquidity as well as probably just sourcing liquidity in the markets, especially as we probably get out past '24, '25, '26, I would think that it probably gets a little bit more thin out there and so you might have to take some discount to sort of get those hedges on.\nCurt Morgan: Yes.\nJim Burke: We might see thing. But as Curt said, we're not trying to get every last nickel here. So there's plenty of room for us to lock this in and move the midpoints up. And as you said, liquidity is a key area of focus. We feel good about it but we're going to keep actively working that so that we could capture this opportunity. Sorry to pick, Curt.\nCurt Morgan: No, no, that's it. I think that's right.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Curt Morgan for any closing remarks.\nCurt Morgan: Thanks again. It looks like we ran over time. Sorry about that. Great working with everybody. I'm hoping that I get to see people between now and August 1 and now that we're also getting to see each other. But enjoyed it and look forward to. You're in good hands with Jim and the company is in good shape as ever. So we're excited about the future. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Curt Morgan",
            "content": "Thank you, Meagan. Good morning to everyone and thank you for your continued interest in Vistra. Getting started with Slide 5. I've mentioned before that 2022 is a year of executing on the strategic priorities we outlined in the third quarter of 2021, shown on this slide. Importantly, Vistra has started on the right foot in 2022 with Q1 results consistent with our expectations and it is noteworthy that our confidence regarding 2022 has grown. However, to me, the bigger story is the material movement in energy commodities complex forward curves for '23 and beyond. And our emphasis on a comprehensive hedge strategy, capitalizing on this move that began last year, continued in the first quarter and continues today. Notably, we expect this upward trend to continue given how the U.S. and world energy situation is set up, especially regarding ESG and boardroom actions in response, combined with strong demand and geopolitical events. In a nutshell, the U.S. natural gas complex is already tight and likely to be increasingly tied to world gas economics. As an expanding pivotal supplier on the world stage, we expect U.S. supply and demand to tighten even further. Higher natural gas prices in turn lead to higher power prices and Vistra is long power and natural gas equivalents. Frankly, in my 40 years, I have not seen a confluence of events quite like this. Certainly, Vistra is in the right position to capitalize on the strong forward curves. The effectiveness of our execution will be key as the day-to-day volatility is extraordinary. It is a rare opportunity presented to us and it is our job to create the most value out of it while managing the risk. Our prudent hedging strategy has resulted in Vistra locking in material out-year value in the '23 to '25 timeframe. And it is worth noting that the forwards have also risen materially out to 2030. The market clearly believes there has been a fundamental shift in the energy commodity complex and it started before the aggression against Ukraine. This shift, as reflected in the forwards, offers continued opportunities to hedge more while remaining mindful of the potential liquidity requirements against further commodity price moves. The good news is that this offers right-way risk with our open position as well as the significant value already hedged. We also have tandem hedged, other risks associated with our commodity hedge positions, such as fuel and basis differentials. Our generation fleet has also performed exceptionally well at an average commercial availability in the mid-90s percent as a critical component of our hedging strategies. We bolstered this exceptional historical performance by the additional expenditures after Uri to derisk our ERCOT plant operations and as we have mentioned in the past, we hold back generation to cover forced outages, all to manage any risk exposure that hedges can expose us to. Our primary focus when hedging is on managing risk while capturing value. We are not focused on picking the absolute peak. Our experience is that this futile endeavor leads to a significant risk of missing the opportunity entirely. As it relates to 2022, while we were considerably hedged coming into the year, our open position in the summer months could now benefit from the power price environment which we expect to remain intact given the likely continued strength of natural gas prices, as I just discussed. This is our expectation even without an extreme weather event. In addition, our retail business continues to deliver strong margins while organically growing customer counts as customers in ERCOT value quality retail names like TXU Energy and Ambit. Jim will speak to the significant value capture opportunity in more detail momentarily. But in sum, the EBITDA outlook for Vistra through 2025 has now increased to potentially over $1 billion even with prudently conservative estimates and the market has only continued to move up. As briefly mentioned a moment ago, a robust hedging strategy, of course, requires significant liquidity as collateral postings are required. Notably, our commitment to a strong balance sheet with significant liquidity has positioned us with the cash and access to capital necessary to make the collateral postings while continuing to execute solidly on our $2 billion share repurchase program and pay out significant dividends to our shareholders of record. Of course, in this environment, you can never have enough liquidity. As such, we continually look for ways to efficiently manage our liquidity and are working diligently to enhance access to capital so we can further take advantage of the long-dated move up and forward and capture value for our shareholders. We believe these efforts will be successful given the significant strength of our business and the amount of forward value we can lock in. Finally, we remain committed to sensibly progressing our fleet of zero carbon generation. As of today's call, we have completed construction of our Brightside and Emerald Grove solar facilities and our DeCordova battery energy storage facility in ERCOT. Additionally, we've been working around the clock to install replacement connectors in the water-based heat suppression safety systems at Moss 300 and Moss Landing 100 and expect to begin bringing those megawatts back online ahead of the hot California summer months. Despite the challenges, the supply chain issues or the uncertainties around solar panel procurement that the Department of Commerce's anti-circumvention investigation are causing the industry, we find ourselves well positioned to navigate these particular headwinds and as we continue to advance the growth of our Vistra Zero portfolio. Our planned 2022 development projects are constructed and we've already procured panels for several of our next-in-line solar projects. Further, our remaining projects have a timeline that allows us to opportunistically contract at the right time. It is important to note that we will remain disciplined in our development efforts, especially given that we either have procured the equipment or have flexibility to time our projects with availability and pricing of equipment. It is also important to note that the supply chain bottlenecks and government actions are dampening the build-out of renewables in the U.S., placing more emphasis on the existing fleet of assets, especially natural gas fueled and nuclear power plants. As we have said many times before, natural gas fueled power plants are going to be critical to a rational and just transition to a decarbonized electric system. Moving now to Slide 6. In the first quarter, we achieved $547 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations in line with our expectations. Notably, this year, our first quarter results are a smaller contribution to our overall annual earnings as compared to certain prior year first quarters. But this new earnings shape was expected for 2022 and is correlated to the seasonality of our retail business in the ERCOT market during the winter months with higher cost of goods sold locked in to hedge retail sales. However, there is greater margin opportunity expected in the remaining months in both our retail and wholesale businesses. With that said, the Retail segment performed above expectations in Q1 in ERCOT with notable organic customer count growth and strong margin performance. Our Generation segment came in a little below expectations, largely due to a greater open position and lower realized prices from a weaker winter. However, with very strong performance in commercial availability rates at the plants of approximately 96% in this first quarter. We are reaffirming our previously announced guidance of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of $2.81 billion to $3.31 billion and adjusted free cash flows before growth from ongoing operations of $2.07 billion to $2.57 billion. We retain the ranges as we are still early in the year, have the summer months ahead of us and at this point in time, we continue to carry a little more open position than in the past for risk management purposes. However, we reaffirm this guidance with increased confidence given the favorable energy commodities markets we continue to experience. In closing, Vistra is very well positioned, especially given the current market environment. Execution is key in 2022 and beyond, especially related to our hedging in forward years and managing adequate liquidity. Now before I turn it over to Jim, as you are likely all aware, this will be my last earnings call as CEO of Vistra. It has been my distinct honor and privilege to serve you all for nearly six years. I want to thank our many stakeholders for their support throughout my tenure. In particular, all of you who entrusted us with your hard-earned money. I know, I gave it my best to do business the right way and create value for our investors. I'm proud of all that we've accomplished and believe Vistra is well positioned to drive continued industry leadership. This is simply the right time for me to transition the CEO role to Jim. Jim has done everything to be prepared for this demanding job. After having worked with Jim for many years, I have the utmost confidence in his capabilities, commitment to Vistra and his leadership skills. He has a deep experience and knowledge of our business, including an understanding of how the disparate parts of the company work together. I am certain and our Board is certain that he is the right person to lead us through our next phase as we execute on our capital allocation plan, including substantial return of capital and expansion of our Vistra Zero portfolio. Finally, to the incredible team members at Vistra. I have never been more honored and proud to work with a group of people. Your life has shown brightly through thick and thin and I am grateful for the time we had together. I believe there is a tremendous opportunity ahead for Vistra as a leader in the power business and look forward to watching that come to fruition. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim. Yes. So look, I'll start with a couple of opening questions but Jim can then fill in with specifics and add his flavor to it. But look, I do think we've departed and we're going to depart. If anything, a message we deliver today is that we've got really one of the most rare opportunities in my career and I've been around a long time, to lock in significant value in the out years. The curves have moved up -- sorry, even out into 2030. The thing you have to balance, all of us do, even if you're investment grade, is margins and posting and having enough liquidity. And we feel very good that we will be able to do that. But this is a rare opportunity for us and this is a good news story. It's all about execution and we feel good about it. And then, of course, as these hedges realize, you got to run the assets. And the one thing that we've been very proud of through the years is just the incredible performance of our generating fleet to back up the hedges. So this is one of the best opportunities I've ever seen for a company like ours and we just need to capitalize on it. So philosophically, we are departing a bit and we are looking to hedge '24, '25, I suspect just given the way that the energy commodity price -- world markets are set up, we think this is going to be around a while and we'll roll hedges into '26, '27 and beyond because we believe that you're going to see a strong natural gas market for many years to come. So, it's a rare situation and one we have to step up and capitalize on. And Jim can tell you a little more about the specifics of what we've done in '24 or '25 because we have done some significant hedging which is rare for us because you know this, Shar. Generally, these curves are backward dated. And we are seeing pricing that is at or above our point of view. And we've told you that when we see prices at or above our point of view, we expect to hedge and we're not trying to pick the highs. We're just trying to lock value and then we just have to execute from that. Jim, do you want to add? You bet, Curt. And Shar, look, we know you guys model. Everybody does. We want to give you some idea of this. But I think it's important to also note that I think the skews to the upside, especially given that commodity prices have moved up and that 3.5% to 3.7% range was a 4.29% [ph] vintage and we've seen a pretty big move up this week alone. And so we're just trying to give you an idea but the earnings power of this company for the next -- at least three years and beyond is significantly higher and it's just the realities of the situation. And like I said, it's our job now to manage that because it's not without risk. But that's what we do and we do it well. So that's -- this is a good news story but we need to execute. Look, I think it really doesn't change much. I mean, we still like the value proposition of buying our shares. And so -- but this -- you know this, it's a function of where you're trading at in terms of your share price. But if you said, okay, what would you do if you have a pile more cash today? I think we'd say, we'd buy back our shares. But we also want to maintain a strong balance sheet for sure. And we want to pay a healthy dividend. And the buyback our shares has helped us pay a healthy dividend and increase that over time for those -- the shareholders of record. So, I'm not sure that we would change that much. We've said that we would prefer not to use the cash flow from the core business on Vistra Zero to allow Vistra Zero to raise its own capital because we could get cost of active capital there and we still have a high free cash flow yield. And so that may not be the best place to put it. So, I think it's the real three primary capital allocation buckets that we've always talked about and share repurchases would continue to be strong on that list. But again, that's a function of where you're trading at any given time. Jim, do you want to take that? Michael, if I can just add something too. The nice thing about adding this liquidity is that we can keep it outstanding and keep this on our balance sheet as long as it's necessary. So if we continue in a high-priced volatile market, we can continue to extend this liquidity and lock in value. And the annual cost of that liquidity relative to the value locked in, as Jim just said, it is very low; so it's a compelling value proposition. If we were to come back to a more recent historical normal level of commodity prices which I'm not sure will happen. But let's just say that we did. We can always then reoptimize the balance sheet and shrink the amount of liquidity that we have to the volatility in the marketplace at that given time; so we can flex it. And because it's right-way risk and also because we tandem hedge all the risks, not just the commodity risk but also basis and fuel, we have a high -- and we can perform very -- at a high level with our generation. We have a high confidence of achieving the cash flow levels that the hedges bring to us which obviously satisfied the cost of the added liquidity. So -- and this is -- right now and this works for us. Liquidity is very important to us; we have access to it and it allows us to go out and lock that significant value in for years to come and that's a rare opportunity for companies to have. You mean when I say was $1 billion of value that we were adding, you're talking about what I said in my remarks? Jim, you can answer that because you know it, too. So go ahead. And Jim, can I add that we debated on this one, Julien, because if you take the $3 billion plus that we always say, that number is close to $2 billion. If you take sort of the $3.3 billion that we sort of, I guess, gave a wink and a nod to for 2023 previously, then that number is closer to a little over $1 billion. So the reality is it's a significant amount above -- depending on what you want to use as your baseline. And we looked at consensus, too. And that number is -- no matter how you slice it, it was at least over $1 billion. And so that's why we felt comfortable saying that. And those two, we tried to reconcile those, what Jim said, the $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion and what I said. But no matter how you slice it, it's $1 billion or more. And you can argue with the $3 billion-plus number, it's closer to $2 billion. Jim, you can talk. Yes, go ahead, Jim. Well, I'll add to this, Julien, is that we have good relationships with the BN also with KCS. And then down with Coleto Creek, it's UP. And we have good relationships. We have long-term historical relationships. And I think we're going to continue to work and I am and so is Jim with the leadership of those companies to try to help us through this, especially given that we got a summer coming up in Texas. We want to make sure we have adequate access to coal. But it is -- they're struggling like everybody else on the supply chain side and having enough labor. I can't remember the number, Jim but it's like six to nine months to train new people on the railroad. So it takes a long time to get new people -- fresh people in and get them trained. So this is an issue. The good news is we've been conserving where we can. We're going into the summer with a decent pile. We'd like to have more and we'd like to see the train sets get picked up. I think we'll be able to work that out and this is something you just have to work together with the railroads on. Yes. So some of our retirements are already scheduled because they are part of agreements that we have I'd say there are some that are not. And certainly, we're going to look at the whole suite of things that we look at when we decide whether we retire a plant. But I think the other thing we have to balance is markets are tight and we're part of the reliability of markets and also the affordability of our product as well as emissions. And so I could see a situation where maybe we would extend some of the coal plants. But we've also agreed to shut those down as part of the coal combustion residual rule at EPA. And so a lot to take into account. But could we say maybe go from '25 to '26 for something? We might. And I think we just have to consider what does the market look like, what's the need of the power plant. And it's not a foregone conclusion that all these are economic even with these prices. Having said that, we're economic people but we're also about trying to help with reliability in the markets that we serve and keeping prices affordable. So we'll have to balance all that and see what that brings us. We haven't made any definitive decisions on any of those other coal plants other than the ones that we have committed to retiring as part of some sort of a commitment. That's right. That's correct. We have not. Jim will take that. Correct. That's correct. I mean if I can add, though, I mean, look, the prices have moved up, too, though, on the wholesale side. But what we were talking about specifically about what we were seeing and we actually had factored in into our guidance was what Jim talked about which was that shift in retail margins. And we don't -- you know that guys, this is a little bit disappointing is that we don't give quarterly guidance. And unfortunately, there is a consensus out there which is generally built on kind of an assumption of the percentage of EBITDA of the annual and the reality of the situation is that does move at times. And we tandem hedge. When we sell retail, we tandem hedge with wholesale. And we knew this -- this was in our guidance number all along. And we knew that we were going to be a little skinnier on the first quarter but higher in the second and the fourth. Now we've also seen them move up a little bit on the third because of wholesale pricing. We'll see if that comes to fruition. But that's just how things work and we just want to be clear that we understood this phenomenon. And we don't -- we're not seeing it in the outer years, either. We think things will probably, at least over time, move back to more of a traditional split or shape of earnings. But it just happened in '22 just given the way that traded relative to the -- when we locked in retail. Yes. Well, Jim, I don't want to -- because I'm not going to be here after obvious one but I would expect that just the way we've normally done is later this year, after we get through the summer and also, we've done some more hedging, my guess is we'll talk about at least about '23. And we'll see about '24 and '25. Go ahead, Jim. Absolutely. In fact, I'm certain of it, that, that is affecting it because some people are -- they're holding on in the shoulder periods where the margin isn't that great on coal, they're backing off. Gas is having to come on at setting price. So yes, that interplay between gas and coal is going to continue until the coal can solve the issue. But yes, that definitely is having an impact on price. Well, how we handle it? Well, I'll just keep in mind, Jim, I'd like to hear what you have to say. I'll pull out my crystal ball here. Look, I think here's what I would say about it. We would like to continue to hedge. And 70% to 80% would feel pretty good to us in those out-years right now, the ones that we've talked about. But the one thing we're just going to make sure, James, is that we also have the liquidity to go along with it. So, we're just -- we're being prudent about it. But I would also say that whether it's going to stay at this level or go a little bit higher in the near term, things seem to be a fair amount of fear in the market around gas right now. How long that lasts, I don't know. But I do believe that we're going to stay at pretty strong levels on gas and power for a while and we'll pick our shocks. But look, we see a real opportunity here. We have a sense of urgency as a company. This -- you don't get this opportunity very often and so you can be rest assured that we're working urgently to lock in value at these kind of levels. And so I wouldn't be surprised to see us having increased our hedging between now and the next quarter when we talk to you again. I mean I just think that -- and we're not going to worry about whether it's at the peak or not. We just -- what we really care about is it a fundamentally good value for the company. Jim, you want to add to that? Yes. No, no, that's it. I think that's right. Thanks again. It looks like we ran over time. Sorry about that. Great working with everybody. I'm hoping that I get to see people between now and August 1 and now that we're also getting to see each other. But enjoyed it and look forward to. You're in good hands with Jim and the company is in good shape as ever. So we're excited about the future. Thank you."

            "name": "Jim Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Curt. I will get into additional details surrounding our first quarter's financial performance outlook and our strategy. But before I do so, I want to express my appreciation for all Curt has done to lead this company over the past six years. Curt has been a mentor and a friend to me. But more importantly, Curt has been a champion of Vistra and its many varied stakeholders. Vistra's accomplishments under Curt's leadership since he took the helm in 2016 for many. We grew our business by acquiring Dynegy, Crius and Ambit, moving from a Texas-only company to one operating in over 20 states, delivering over $850 million a year in annual value drivers while pivoting the company to being predominantly a natural gas-powered fleet serving over four million retail customers and well positioned for future growth with Vistra Zero. Curt Championed the integrated model and highlighted the benefits of our commercial capability that is tightly integrated with our generation and retail businesses and the importance of a strong balance sheet. He pioneered our ESG and DEI efforts despite the challenges we faced with Uri and the COVID pandemic. These accomplishments, among many others, resulted in a doubling in value for our shareholders while also providing a strong foundation for the future. I want to reassure you all on the call today that as CEO, I'm ready to build on what we have achieved and I intend to remain focused on our previously announced capital allocation plan with a commitment, as always, to delivering sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders and other stakeholders. I am grateful to Curt and committed to do my best to lead Vistra going forward alongside some of the finest, most dedicated colleagues in our industry. Turning now to Slide 8. Vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter that were in line with our expectations with adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of approximately $547 million. We recognize the quarter-over-quarter comparison is not meaningful given the Uri impacts to last year's earnings. Retail ended the first quarter in 2022 at $163 million of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations and our collective generation segments ended the quarter with $384 million in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. Despite the expected lower than historical contribution, we believe these first quarter results from ongoing operations positions us to achieve or exceed the midpoint of the EBITDA guidance previously announced. This quarter also continued the execution of our previously announced capital allocation plan. We repurchased approximately 18.6 million shares since our last reported share count as of February 22, 2022. As of May 3, 2022, we've repurchased approximately 54 million shares since the share buyback program was initiated, accounting for a total of approximately 10.5% of shares then outstanding. Approximately 431.8 million shares remain outstanding as of May 3, 2022 and $805 million remains available for additional share repurchases for the remainder of 2022. The Board has also approved a quarterly dividend to be paid on the common stock in the amount of $0.177 per share payable on June 30, 2022. This is approximately 18% growth in dividend per share as compared to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2021. We continue to prioritize a strong balance sheet in the near term and are balancing the hedging opportunities to lock in value with ensuring sufficient liquidity for these dynamic markets. especially given that the hedging activity is locking in materially higher future earnings. We will continue to provide updates on the $1.5 billion debt repayment as the year progresses and as we capitalize on opportunities to lock in value and manage liquidity. Similarly, we are committed to our transformational growth and are actively exploring avenues to support the Vistra Zero portfolio with nonrecourse financing where we find those financing markets remain open and with satisfactory interest rates. We can't discuss our capital allocation plan in full without acknowledging the commodities and power pricing environment that we've been experiencing this past quarter. As reflected on Slide 9, this quarter saw dramatic increases in both the ERCOT and PJM weighted spark spreads for 2023. These trends have continued through April and into May. Given the favorable environment, we've continued our hedging strategy to lock in value in 2023 and beyond. As of March 31, 2022, we were 93% and 96% hedged in Texas and East segments, respectively, for 2022 and we were 60% and 67% hedged in those segments, respectively, for 2023. Turning now to Slide 10. This slide illustrates in more detail the phenomena we've all been observing, reflecting that power price forwards are up dramatically in correlation with the increase in the gas price forwards. This environment increases margins across our fleet in the money gas generation plants, coal, nuclear and renewables. In addition to locking in the revenue values, we have also been hedging coal, gas and nuclear fuel cost as a result of our comprehensive hedging strategy. Vistra is now over 50% hedged across the years 2023 to 2025. To provide a sense of magnitude, we have stated in the past that we expect to consistently earn above $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations on a go-forward basis. Given the marks as of April 29, we now anticipate a risk-adjusted midpoint in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion for adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations for the years 2023 through 2025. Again, we are just over 50% hedged, so there is still a significant range around this midpoint. However, the curves have continued to move up materially since April 29. So we believe that range of estimates to be on the conservative side. We are continuing to execute on our comprehensive hedging strategy to lock in as much of that value as possible. Notably, a comprehensive hedging strategy requires significant liquidity for collateral postings. We are actively managing our liquidity requirements in a way that allows us to remain confident at this time that we can execute our hedging strategy and the capital allocation plan in tandem. In closing, we continue to focus on execution in 2022, execution on the growth of our Vistra Zero portfolio, of our comprehensive hedging strategy and of our previously announced capital allocation plan. And we firmly believe in the value this execution will bring to our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our achievements as we progress throughout the remainder of 2022. With that, operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions. Shar, the way Curt described it, it looks like a unique opportunity and we're taking advantage of it because we have typically seen tremendous backwardation. So we'll see prompt months and maybe a year show up but then the outer periods have not responded. I think on Slide 10, where you saw the curve moves, particularly gas driven but also the sparks that have driven considerably higher in the '23, '24 period, we decided to layer on more hedges. That's what gave us the confidence to talk about '23 to '25. As you know, we would normally talk about 2023 after the summer and we would generally and I cannot recall that we've ever spoken specifically with confidence two and three years out. But we're representing that in our materials today because we have hedged over 50% in total for that three year period a little bit more in the front in '23, a little bit less in '25. There's still a range around that and that's the important thing. And that range can go higher. It could also go lower. We recognize that. And that's why we talk about that range as a midpoint. So there's a chance for that number to go down. We would put this in the range of potentially $500 million, $600 million to the downside, possibly that to the upside and we think that's reasonable. And so giving you a sense of how much we've hedged and putting that out with all was important for investors because these opportunities, as Curt said, don't come around very often. Yes. So Michael, it is. First of all, it is a range that applies to all three years, okay? So we see all three years within that range. We didn't want to put out individual year guidance and individual year hedge percentages at this point because this is moving -- We've taken advantage of a lot of the hedging opportunities that the month of April provided us where we really started to see this move. But we're pretty flat over that three year period because we have a little bit more hedges on at the beginning when the move started in the near term and a little bit more open to the out even though they're still backwardation, the captured value ends up being pretty similar across that three year period. You bet. Yes. And Curt emphasized liquidity in his remarks and it is front and center for us being able to capture this opportunity and make sure that as we continue to hedge because we'd like to do that, we'd like to continue to put more hedges on at these levels that we have adequate liquidity. So you saw us increase the commodity-linked revolver so that we have $2.1 billion of available liquidity as of yesterday. That is very helpful in managing the hedge levels that we already have put on. We also are looking to do some additional raise and work with other counter-parties in a more credit efficient way which we can do with some of our first lien opportunities to hedge with parties and we do that already but we expect to increase that level of activity. And so our view is that did now is the time to make sure we have ample liquidity because we want to not only hedge more, we want to be able to withstand any further moves because the goal here is all this liquidity comes back to us, right? It all comes back as we operate and deliver the power through the various calendar years. And so it's relatively cost effective for us to load up on even additional liquidity to make sure we can hedge more because we know that this cash does return and just make sure that we have the line of sight and continue to bring the range of outcomes in the out years even tighter. And I think, as Curt noted, I think the midpoint of this range is skewed to the upside. I think the midpoint can continue to move up and we can give you that confidence as we continue to put more hedges on. But we've had great access to liquidity. All of our partners that have worked with us have been very helpful because they understand this is the right-way risk as these hedges continue to be put on and we have to post more. They know the franchise value of the enterprise is continuing to grow. That's a great place to be and this is going to be something that we'll continue to actively manage. Yes, yes. Sure. Julien, that was in the remarks we said through 2025, nearly $1 billion. That was a cumulative minimum value increase from '23, '24, '25 of $1 billion. So think about that as $333 million a year minimum, so that gets to our $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion which is higher than where anyone was really thinking we were ahead of this commodity moves where they -- we said we're a $3-plus billion business. Some would say you're a $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion kind of business. So we're taking that delta and saying assume $300-plus million a year, that gets you to this midpoint of the range we're talking about for three years is $1 billion. Julien, I'll start and Curt, thank you for that. We have factored in that even in 2022, it has been tough for some of the PRB suppliers to fully ramp up. As you would expect, as gas continues to move up, everyone is trying to get more coal and that's logical but it is difficult for some of these coal supply chains to respond. And some of it is simply hiring and having enough people to actually operate the equipment and some of it is weather driven. There's been storms that have actually disrupted some supplies. We factored that into how we think about 2022 and we have factored in the ranges we just gave you. So we are not assuming perfect execution on the coal supply chain. We do think, over time, this will get resolved either because there will be a more fulsome response to the supply chain maybe even outside of the 2022 timeframe before that happens, or gas may actually, at some point, dissipate and not put quite as much strain on the system. But it has been a challenge more on the PRB and the train set as so with the barge coal that we have access to for our Ohio plants but that is something we took into consideration when we provided these numbers. Go ahead, Curt. Yes, we had $3.1 billion available as of the end of March. We now have $2.1 billion available and we added $1 billion to the commodity rate revolving facility for capacity because of the moves, particularly in April. And we wanted to take advantage of hedging more in the month of April. So we increased our capacity some but we still have the ability -- we still have the $2.1 billion available to us after all postings that we've made to date. It has been changing, Jonathan. I think both the sell side as well as the buy side has -- see this as either opportunity or potentially risk if they don't buy long term. So we've been able to hedge both gas and power out through '25 with fairly deep markets compared to what we've seen historically. And I think that is something that has occurred as people are thinking this is not temporary. We've generally seen, as we talked earlier, things move up in the very short run and then you see some assumed corrections. But you don't even see that with the NYMEX curve now for the next 10 years. So I think folks are seeing that the complex is moving up. They see difficulty in supply chains. They see difficulties with some of the environmental restrictions that are happening. So I think folks are concerned about where this whole commodity complex could go. So there has been folks on the other side willing to make longer-dated purchases that we haven't seen the same depth in prior markets. Sure. Yes, Durgesh, what ended up happening post Uri is the first quarter cost structure shifted up remarkably as people started to conclude that the winter has potentially even if not more volatility built into it than the summer. ERCOT, as you know, has always been a summer focus. People have always talked about peak capacity and peak demand in the summer. Uri shifted that. And now we saw the first quarter part of the curve move up considerably. Retail has to buy that but they generally flat price their customers. We don't have a lot of indexed-based structures with particularly residential customers. So when we flat price, it basically means that the margins get squeezed considerably still positive but definitely lower in the first quarter than historical patterns. What that means is it really opens up the margins in 2Q and 4Q relative to what we have seen in the past. So when Curt was alluding to we have greater earnings power in the back part of the year, that's not assuming anything with the open position. That's just simply if you were to model retail margins on a monthly basis, you would have historically seen a better first quarter margin than we're seeing at the moment because of the shape of the 12-month curve. That's correct. Yes. No, I was going to say, Curt, I agree with that completely. I think we need to get through the summer. Let's look at the additional hedges that we anticipate putting on at these kind of levels. And obviously, we won't hedge all the way up but we still think there's value to capture here. So we'll again, emphasis on liquidity. All this money will come back to us eventually but we do want to preserve long-term value and take advantage. So I think it would be prudent for us to talk about that in the fall when we give the guidance for next year. That will be a good time for us to update our cash flow and our capital allocation assumptions for '23. Yes. I was going to say, we have some long-dated transportation arrangements for our key facilities, James. So our issue has been less rail transport cost. It has been simply about quantity as it relates to PRB, getting all the quantity that our plants could consume in the higher kind of power price and natural gas price worlds. So we have been less exposed to the cost of transport. It's been for us a little bit more on the quantity side. Yes. Curt, I agree completely. And I would just add that if prices stay where they are and we continue to increase our hedge percentage, then we would see this range move up from where it is. That's what we meant by we were being conservative because we made this range off of the April 29 curve, James. And as you noted, they've moved up. So, if they stay where they are and we can continue to hedge into that, I would expect that you'd see this midpoint of this range move up. We might see thing. But as Curt said, we're not trying to get every last nickel here. So there's plenty of room for us to lock this in and move the midpoints up. And as you said, liquidity is a key area of focus. We feel good about it but we're going to keep actively working that so that we could capture this opportunity. Sorry to pick, Curt."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. And now I would like to take the conference to Eric Micek. Please go ahead.\nEric Micek: Good morning, and thank you all for joining Vistra's investor webcast discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Our discussion today is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There, you can also find copies of today's investor presentation and the earnings release. Leading the call today are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra's senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Our earnings release, presentation and other matters discussed on the call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of Visa's website. Also, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Eric. I appreciate all of you taking the time to join our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. First, I am proud to share the very strong results that the hard-working Vistra team delivered in 2023. And second, I am excited to announce that we expect to close the Energy Harbor acquisition on Friday, March 1. The Energy Harbor acquisition fits squarely with our continued focus on our four strategic priorities as laid out on slide 5, which starts with operating an integrated business model that combines retail and wholesale operations leading to more resilient and sustainable earnings and a variety of weather and pricing environments. This was not only true in delivering results $440 million above our original guidance level in 2023 and but was recently apparent during Winter Storm Heather in January of this year, where our core competency of operating generation assets was evidenced by our 98% commercial availability, which is particularly impressive in an environment where the ERCOT overall market outage rate for the five days impacted by the storm was 2.5 times Vistra outage rate. Turning to the other key priorities. We continue to execute on our capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we have returned to our investors approximately $4.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends. Further, we are excited to announce the Board approval of an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchases, which we expect to fully utilize by year-end 2025. Importantly, we have strengthened and simplified our balance sheet while maintaining our capital return plan. Net leverage remains low at 2.4 times, and although we expect to be slightly above our three times net leverage target when Energy Harbor closes, we project to return to below three times by year-end 2024. The successful repurchase of approximately 98% of our outstanding tax receivable agreement rights marks further progress in our efforts to simplify Vistra's capital structure, while improving our free cash flow conversion over the foreseeable planning horizon. Our disciplined capital approach also enables us to invest in renewables and energy storage growth that capitalizes on sites and interconnects in the Vistra portfolio. We delivered the Moss Landing 350 megawatt energy storage expansion in June of last year, and we began construction on three of our larger Illinois solar and energy storage developments located at our former coal plant sites in the spring of 2024. With grids in most of our markets tightening in the coming years as older fossil generation retires, mode continues to grow and with interconnection and transmission challenges, Vistra is well-positioned to continue to find ways to serve our customers reliably, affordably and sustainably while remaining disciplined about our capital allocation. Turning to slide 6. We received FERC's approval for both the acquisition of Energy Harbor and the corresponding sale of our Richland and Stryker generation facilities. Energy Harbor is a transformative acquisition and represents another significant step forward for our company. We are diligently working towards closing this transaction, which, as I already mentioned, we expect to close on March 1st. Despite closing later than we had hoped, we remain comfortable with our ability to successfully integrate our teams and deliver the initial guidance of pre-tax run rate synergies of $125 million by year-end 2025. We are also reiterating a 12-month 2024 and 2025 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities from Energy Harbor of $700 million and $800 million, respectively, as well as the expected run rate ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity on an unhedged and open basis of $900 million. However, given the anticipated closing date, you can expect our updated 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range, which we expect to provide on the first quarter 2024 results call will reflect only 10 months of contribution from Energy Harbor this year. Moving now to slide 7. As a reminder, we began the year with initial guidance for 2023 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA with a midpoint of $3.7 billion. This guidance was subsequently revised on both our second and third quarter calls, ultimately raised to a midpoint of $4.025 billion. As I stated earlier, despite another year of volatile weather, characterized by mostly mild weather, excluding the unprecedented summer heat in ERCOT during the third quarter, we were able to exceed the midpoint of our original guidance range by $440 million. Importantly, this translated to higher than expected ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth of approximately $2.491 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our original guidance range by $441 million. These results were achieved through strong customer count and margin performance at our retail segment and a nearly 96% commercial availability rate for our Generation segment. Now, I'd like to quickly turn to the 2024 guidance. Given the recent regulatory approval and the upcoming transaction closing, we anticipate providing combined Vistra and Energy Harbor guidance, including an update on synergies, as part of our first quarter 2024 results call. However, we can reaffirm the Vistra stand-alone 2024 guidance for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. We are eager and excited to join with the men and women of Energy Harbor and execute on behalf of our customers and communities as one team. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to discuss our quarterly performance in more detail.\nKris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Turning to slide 9. Vistra delivered strong fourth quarter results in 2023 with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $965 million, including $463 million from retail and $502 million from generation. For the year, Vistra delivered $4,140 million of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA including $1,105 million from retail and $3,035 million from generation. Despite mild weather conditions for much of the year, the performance of our generation units combined with our comprehensive hedging program and our ability to optimize our flexible assets drove the significant year-over-year improvement in our generation results in every region in the country. Moving to the Retail segment. The strong margin performance seen in the first nine months of the year continued in the fourth quarter. Positive residential customer count growth was driven by our multi-brand strategy with organic growth by our flagship brand, TXU Energy, for the third consecutive year. Turning to slide 10. We provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan. As of February 23, we executed approximately $3.7 billion of share repurchases and leading to an approximately 28% reduction compared to the number of shares that were outstanding in November of 2021. We expect to utilize $2.25 billion consisting of the $750 million remaining under the previous authorization as of the end of 2023 and the additional $1.5 billion of authorization announced today over the course of 2024 and 2025. We will review our capital available for allocation after we close the Energy Harbor acquisition and expect to share any updates later this year. Moving to our dividend program. We announced last week a fourth quarter 2023 common stock dividend of $0.215 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 9% over the dividend paid in Q1 2023 and an impressive 43% increase over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2021, when our capital allocation plan was first established. Turning to the balance sheet. Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits significantly below three times. As Jim stated earlier, although net debt will increase upon closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, it will remain close to three times, and we expect it to return to below three times by the end of 2024. In addition to maintaining low leverage, we took an important step to further simplify the balance sheet at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. As of February 23, 2024, we have repurchased approximately 98% of the outstanding rights to receive payments under our tax receivable agreement. To pay for these rights, which were entitled to receive approximately $1.4 billion over time on an undiscounted basis. We paid approximately $625 million, consisting of approximately $475 million in aggregate face value of Series C perpetual preferred stock and approximately $150 million of cash. Based on our forecast of payments that would have been due under the tax receivable agreement over the foreseeable planning horizon, we believe this transaction results in accretion to free cash flow over that time period and provides robust net present value to the company. Finally, the team is preparing to begin construction activities at three of our larger Illinois solar and energy storage developments at our former coal plant sites this spring. We believe these projects will continue to exceed our targeted return thresholds despite some headwinds in this higher cost and interest rate environment. The three key tenets of our responsible energy transition reliability, affordability and sustainability will continue to guide our renewables development program. We remain disciplined in our approach and continue to benchmark all projects against other uses of capital, including our share repurchase program. Touching quickly on slide 11. As we have done in prior quarters, we have provided an update on the out-year forward price curves as of February 23. While the ERCOT forward price curves continue to reflect on backwardation, the prices remain higher than the April 29, 2022, curves when we first spoke to you about increased EBITDA earnings potential in the out years. These curves together with the continued execution of our comprehensive hedging program, give us confidence in the ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity for 2025 in the range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion for Vistra stand-alone discussed last quarter. Again, we expect to update the 2025 opportunity, including the expected contribution from Energy Harbor on the first quarter results call. We are extremely proud of the performance of our generation retail and commercial teams during 2023 and the start of 2024. We believe our commercial optimization activities and flexible generation assets combined with an industry-leading retail business provides significant opportunities going forward. We will continue to focus on being a reliable, cost-efficient operator of assets, while producing adjusted free cash flow yields that translate directly into significant returns for our stockholders. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, let's start with a question from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Shar, please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Can you hear me?\nJim Burk: Yeah, Hey, Shar. Good morning.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, Jim, sorry with that little tech issues. I guess, Jim, you're getting closer to closing the Energy Harbor, you repurchased the TRAs to clean up the cap structure. Can we just get a little more color on how you're thinking about the longer-term profile of the business? I mean, do you see a pathway for traditional and vision to go their separate ways in the years ahead? Or is this kind of a longer date process in your mind?\nJim Burke: Yes. Thank you, Shar. I'll let Kris address the TRA, but I'll start with the direction we're headed. I think the Energy Harbor acquisition, as we said, is transformative for the company. It obviously brings a dispatchable 24/7 carbon-free element to the portfolio enhances our starting point that we had with Comanche Peak and Vistra Zero. The other part of the portfolio that I think is incredibly critical is the dispatchable assets that we have with our fossil fleet. Flexibility is an increasingly valuable attribute on these grids, particularly with the renewables penetration that we're seeing across the country, particularly ERCOT and California. So, from our standpoint, with such a large retail position and a growing retail position, the integration of how we can match the customer needs with assets that can provide the base load and the ramp products is an important part of risk management and value creation for our company. So, we see this still as one team. We see it as Vistra delivering on an integrated basis across our business for the long-term. And I think this excitement we have around closing Energy Harbor is it's a path we've been on for quite some time with the other acquisitions we've done. This is yet another one that fits neatly into what customers are looking for and that's why we're ready to get on to this next chapter. I'll let Kris quickly address the TRA.\nKris Moldovan: Yes, Shar, again, we noted in the comments, I think the primary purpose of the TRA, it does have some benefits that aren't economic related, but the primary purpose was economic. When you take an instrument out that is entitled to $1.4 billion, and then we did it with a little bit more than $600 million. And more than three quarters of that is perpetual stock. It's just -- it became a transaction that was very economically beneficial for the company. And so we really focused on the economics of it. As far as cleaning it up, it does simplify the capital structure. It's a topic that we're pleased to not talk much about going forward. But it still is just one of the impediments to a split. There are still other debt securities at the Vistra operations level, and we still have preferred stock in place. So, there would be other things to address. So, that wasn't the primary purpose for this transaction. It was really -- we thought it was a great economic benefit to the company, including a significant amount of NPV for us.\nShar Pourreza: Okay, perfect. That's helpful. And then, Jim, just on ERCOT. We've seen a few new build announcements recently. It sounds like one of your peers is waiting for the loan program details before potentially pulling the trigger on a combined cycle. There has also been a substantial amount of noise regarding the ECRS, I guess what's your house view on supply/demand backdrop and sort of ongoing market reforms? Thanks.\nJim Burke: Yes, great question. Well, the demand growth surprised, I think many of us, both what we saw last summer and even with Heather. So, robust, low growth in Texas coupled with extreme weather, you start to see the grid getting pushed, obviously to a level of tightness, we haven't seen in quite some time. The loan program clearly was a signal from the legislature and policymakers that they would like to see the dispatchable resources grow in Texas, at a minimum to backstop the level of growth that we see with intermittent resources in Texas and we see like in winter storm Heather, on the tightest days of winter storm Heather about 5% during the hours that were the tightest. About 5% of the power coming \u2013 were coming from intermittent sources, about 95% from dispatchable. So I think the desire is there. The loan program is clearly a boost because the interest rate at 3%, that's better than where market is. But you raised another point that I think is critical, which is there's a series of market reforms that are contemplated at the moment that sit between ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission, they generally are around the ancillaries. So ECRS is one. DRS is another. And there's details of these that are yet to be defined. We hope to hear more about ECRS here in a few months. It's likely that ECRS could actually dispatch a little earlier, could actually end up being brought into the market earlier than it was last summer, which could have a little bit of a dampening effect on prices. The DRS is pushed out in time and it's unclear, what kind of effect on price signals that might have? And then lastly, PCM, this performance credit mechanism, which is in the law, the House Bill 1500, that is also probably on a 2027 time frame. And I think the balance, Shar, that all policymakers are trying to strike is what's the sufficient revenue stream to incentivize someone to write an equity check and at the same time, deliver affordable electricity in Texas that's obviously reliable. And there's a tension there. And that tension shows up in some of the rule makings and the procedures that are going to follow -- we're going to learn more as they follow through on these in the next three to six months. So the loan program is certainly helpful. We don't view that as sufficient as a revenue signal you still see in our PowerPoint deck, there's backwardation in the spark spreads for ERCOT. So why they are higher than they were when we first started to talk to you about long-dated curves in 2022, they're still backwardated. We need to see some support for the price signals to be able to be confident that a 20- to 30-year life asset has a reasonable prospect for a return. And I think people are working hard to try to make that happen, but that's still TBD.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect. Thank you very much. And congrats on the execution. I'll see you soon. Appreciate it\nOperator: And now we have a question from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. David, please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, thank you, good morning.\nJim Burke: Hey, David.\nDavid Arcaro: Maybe a bit of a follow-on to that question, specifically on data center growth. And as we see that accelerate, wondering if you could speak to how you're thinking about the potential market impact and opportunities for your fleet potentially from new data centers coming on?\nJim Burke: Sure. Yes. Thanks, David, for the question. I'll step back just a second to say that as the grids have become a little bit tighter across the country, we're seeing the fossil assets retire, particularly coal. And then we're seeing more electrification. We're seeing customers approach us at a rate that we haven't seen in my history with this industry. And data center specifically, they're looking for speed to market, so they're trying to get online as fast as they can. They're obviously looking for where they've got good fiber, particularly potentially access to water for cooling needs, but reliability is now entering that discussion. So many of them are talking about while they can do it out on the grid, they're interested in also being behind-the-meter. And depending on who the customer is, it doesn't need to be a nuclear plant. They're actually entertaining gas plants for behind-the-meter opportunities. And we've done that with some of the crypto load already in Texas. We've done some behind-the-meter. So we're familiar with it. Whether that load goes behind-the-meter or out on the grid, it's new demand. And that's part of the supply and demand equation that might also send the price signals that could also then incentivize new supply. But it's meaningful, David. It's hard to get locked in on any one forecast. But most forecasts have a doubling of this data center load by 2030. Texas is a pretty easy place to do business. So Texas, which is already the second largest data center market in the country, may end up getting a disproportionate amount of it. But we do see this as a real opportunity for our company. I will tell you in terms of customers approaching us, way more customers approaching us around data centers than we've had so far on hydrogen. And part of that is just the rules uncertainty around hydrogen, but also I think we're serving a customer demand. There's actually a demand for where this is going, where the hydrogen has been a little bit more supply driven and trying to create a product that's inexpensive. This is more pull from the customer, and we're having a lot of conversations. We're pretty excited about it.\nDavid Arcaro: Yeah. Got it. Thanks. I appreciate that perspective. How early is it? When do you think that you could see potential market impacts if it's upside in the curve or potential contracts like you say with maybe behind-the-meter or contracted power with these customers? \nJim Burke: Yeah. The behind-the-meter activity, it still takes some planning studies that we work on with ERCOT and the wires company. You may also need to be doing the substation construction, get some of the high-voltage switchgear. So you could still be looking at a couple of years for something to go from concept to reality. So I wouldn't say that it's immediately around the corner for something, that's a new conversation. There are clearly some current data centers that could actually even be repowered. Those can actually go from existing chips that are used more for cloud services to the more energy-intensive AI purpose chips. That could be happening over the course of the next two years. But I would say it's a couple of year process, David, from my perspective.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, got it. Very helpful. Thanks so much.\nJim Burke: Yeah. Thanks David.\nOperator: And we'll follow with a question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien, please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning Jim and congratulations on the progress here, nicely done. In fact, I wanted to follow-up on the last question and the expectations for 1Q update here. Can you give us an initial glimpse on how you think about capital allocation? I presume to a certain extent, there could be capital commitments on your part to enable some of these data-oriented strategies to perhaps provide some of the warehousing, et cetera. So how do you think about that impacting capital location, as you say, maybe a couple of years out 2025, 2026? And then maybe to marry that up, how do you think about sustaining this level of buyback? Or do you have any broad heuristics that you might be willing to share as you think about buybacks beyond -- 205 and beyond here as you think about this updated plan with 1Q?\nJim Burke: Yes, Julien, thank you very much for the questions. I'll start with the data center opportunities, as I mentioned, whether behind-the-meter or whether out on the grid, they have a natural sort of demand increase that could send some price signals for wholesale power prices in the out year. Some of that could be factored into these curves already. I mean people have been reading about this. The curves are stronger today than they were in the spring of 2022 when we first put out our multiyear guidance range. So I think, Vistra being net long in ERCOT has an opportunity, whether we are directly involved with the data center or not. So then you beg the question, when would we get directly involved? It's if we found that there's a return on that capital to do something that would make sense relative to our other capital allocation alternatives. I would say that, I'm not in the detail at a level of comfort yet, that I would tell you, that's actionable. So we know that from a free cash flow yield perspective, it's still pretty attractive for us to be returning capital through the buyback. So we would need to see a level of, what I'd call, transactable economics that have the long-term agreement to bring that to bear as an alternative to our capital allocation strategy, in which case, I think our shareholders would be pleased to see it. But I view this as an opportunity for us with our native position that I think it's specifically an enhanced opportunity for our own assets, if we choose to do something behind the meter. In addition, I didn't even mention, but in addition to the data center, of course, we have population growth in Texas, which is still strong. And we have a Permian Basin growth rate for load that ERCOT has put out some studies that suggest that you could see 13 gigawatts of growth out west from 2023 to 2030. That's oil and gas driven, it's population driven. It's also got some data center loan growth there. So, this is a general theme and then how that -- I think will benefit an asset position like Vistra. And then specifically, how we might target our own assets, I view that as incremental upside, none of which is factored in to our long-range plan at this point. And in terms of when we'll update from a capital allocation and how we think about longer-term buybacks, I'm going to have Kris jump in.\nKris Moldovan: Yes, Julian, I would say, you hit it with the Energy Harbor transaction. So as that closes, as we look forward, we talked about expecting to spend $2.25 billion on share repurchases over 2024 and 2025. We also have a little bit of debt to repay, and we have some growth that you see for our renewables and energy storage business. But on top of that, we do expect to have additional cash available for allocation that's unallocated. We think it's preliminary right now to get into the levels that, that is because we just want to make sure to get this Energy Harbor deal closed and put the two businesses, start integrating the businesses. But I do think, we will come back to you and talk about an additional amount that over the next two years that we have to allocate on top of the share repurchase estimate that we're making. And so, I don't believe that any of those opportunities would disrupt our pacing on share repurchases.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right, even as a percent of total cash flow beyond '25?\nKris Moldovan: We'll -- we're going to continue to come back. I still think that the -- we haven't ever announced it as a percentage, but I think as a gross amount in this $1 billion-plus range on a per year basis, we don't see anything that would move us off that now. But we will continue to evaluate that with our Board.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Wonderful. I know it's in flight. Good luck, guys. We'll speak to you then.\nKris Moldovan: Thank you, Julien.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ICI -- ISI, pardon me. Durgesh, you may proceed.\nDurgesh Chopra: Yes. Thanks so much. Appreciate the time team. Good morning to you.\nJim Burke: Good morning, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, Jim. Hey, Kris, just maybe this is a stupid question will ask it anyways. The TRA transaction that you did, does that have any implication on like your forward looking free cash flow guidance, you kind of talked to it as being somewhat cash flow accretive. So are there any implications as we think about sort of 2025 guidance and beyond?\nKris Moldovan : As we do. We do see some benefits on a -- just a straight free cash flow basis, it is positive from free cash flow. So if you look -- as we talked about, we spent about $150 million of cash and then we issued the preferred. And so over the course of five years, our cash cost for that repurchase is in the neighborhood of $350 million, our estimates that we previously had would have shown that the TRA payments would have been roughly twice that. So there is some free cash flow pickup and that will factor into our conversion percentage. We still see -- obviously, we're in a higher cost and higher interest rate environment. So there are puts and takes. And so I think we still feel really good about saying that our -- our expectation is that we would be 55% on average over the planning horizon. Some years, we expect to be more like this year, you see in our materials that we end up just over 60% conversion. In some years, depending on the timing of maintenance capital could be a little bit lower. But I think on average, 55%, the mid-50s is the right place for our conversion ratio.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. That's super helpful. But it is accretive to your cash flow guidance, but there are obviously other drags and you're comfortable with the 55% range is the key takeaway there. Okay. Thank you. And then maybe just can I ask -- I don't want to jump the gun, but what to expect in terms of disclosures on the first quarter call, whether EBITDA is still the metric? And then in terms of forward-looking years, what to expect, if you could share any color?\nKris Moldovan : Yes. So we're going to focus here on Energy Harbor and getting it closed. I do think that whether it's on that call or a future call, we are going to continue to assess what is the best way for us to communicate the ongoing value of this company. And so I do think we will -- at the very -- we do expect to plan -- we do expect to give updated guidance for this year. But as we go forward, what metrics we use and how we communicate what we see as the value of the business, we're going to continue to work through that, and we will come back to you whether that. It could come on the May call, but it could come also later this year. We're going to think through that and make sure that we've thought through all the issues.\nJim Burke: Durgesh, what I would add is, once we close Energy Harbor, we will go through a process to confirm the synergy numbers. So we'll talk about that on the May call. That will then lead to the 2024 expectation, as Kris said, of the combined companies. We will also, as he noted in his script, we'll talk about where we see the 2025 headed as well. And obviously, the synergies are part of that. Capital allocation, there will be an amount that's still unallocated that we see that we will be talking to our Board with, with respect to how we think about the best use of that capital. But what you could expect to hear about in May, at least to 2024 with a nod to 2025 with our guidance and then these updated synergy expectations. As far as the best metrics, clearly, with Constellation's call yesterday, very successful in their description of how to think about the value drivers. For our business, where we have looked at it and since the buyback program was enhanced in 2021. So far, we've really focused on the return of cash and capital to the shareholders. And on a per share basis, between the buyback programs and the dividends, you're seeing that in the sort of $4.45 on the high end and that's an opportunity that's per share. And so that's just from a return of capital standpoint. In terms of the adjusted free cash flow before growth on a per share basis, it's much higher on a stand-alone basis, that's closer to $6 a share. As far as working through GAAP and working through the mark-to-market, working through depreciation and amortization, we will be taking a look at that. What we've tried to focus on to date has been much more about the proof points around the capital we're returning and the sustainability of that and frankly, the upsizing of that. But clearly, the investor response yesterday was super positive. And if there's opportunities for us to be more clear about the value drivers and the comfort that investors are looking for, for the long term, we owe it to them. We'll be certainly taking a look at that.\nDurgesh Chopra: I appreciate that very much. Thank you both.\nOperator: We are now taking a question from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Michael, please go ahead.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey, everyone. Good morning.\nJim Burke: Good morning.\nMichael Sullivan: Jim, you kind of answered this, but just wanted to confirm. So it sounds like the synergies from the original target, you're going to kind of revisit and refresh. But the Energy Harbor guidance itself, what you're putting out there today, is that just kind of what you saw originally? Or is that actually refreshed and just consistent as of today?\nJim Burke: Yeah, Michael, I would say it has been -- we have been updating it ourselves as we're tracking kind of through the process of working to close. We feel good about it. So when we looked at $700 million on a 12-month basis, I do think we'll be in the ballpark of prorating 10th, 12ths of that number. If you do that and you add it to our Vistra stand-alone as we sit today, then you're in the $4.5 billion sort of range for calendar year 2024. That's above where we were when we announced the acquisition in March of 2023. The synergy numbers, I think there'll be some upside to the synergy numbers, but not likely in calendar year 2024 because we thought we could close this deal later last year. So we're getting a later start. But I think by the end of this year, we'll be about where we expected from a run rate perspective. I think there's upside to the out years on how we're thinking about it. So we'd expect to talk about that on the May call. But the way you're thinking about it is correct, Michael. I think it's always helpful to close a deal work with the teams day-in and day-out, make sure we understand all the assumptions and then affirm and potentially, we see a chance to upsize some things on the May call, we'll do it at that time.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. Super clear. Thanks. And then we continue to get questions on this. Just can you give us the latest on where you are in terms of having nuclear fuel secured both for Comanche and to the extent Energy Harbor's position?\nJim Burke: Sure. Yes, we believe we're in really good shape. Michael, we have, as I've indicated on previous calls, we have, as Vistra done some additional procurement through time since we announced the transaction. Obviously, we had a high percentage likelihood in our view of being able to close the transaction. Either way, the markets continue to go up in price, and that's been speculation on the part of a number of folks based on whether Russia pans or limitations would ultimately be put in place. So we have a physical procurement strategy that we are secure for both Energy Harbor sites and our site Comanche Peak through 2027 refuelings. And we feel good about that. We're also substantially hedged into 2028 as well. So we feel good about the risk management around that. And of course, long term, depending on where this goes with the domestic fuel supply capabilities and whether the federal government will incentivize more domestic capabilities for enrichment remains to be seen. But I think we have a very good line of sight and very consistent with everything that we've shared publicly so far and our expectations of this deal.\nMichael Sullivan: Thanks for all the detail. I appreciate it.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And now we follow with a question from Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Angie, please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. Good morning. So maybe first\u2026\nJim Burke: Good morning, Angie.\nAngie Storozynski: Good morning. Maybe first with -- yeah, the fundamentals of our markets are tightening, but we don't see it in forward power curves and probably very low natural gas prices do not help. But I'm just wondering, if you think that there will be a step change in those power curves on the back of any big announcements about and data centers, you name it. We've seen some positive surprise in capacity prices in New England. I'm wondering if you'd hope to see a similar message being sent from the next PJM capacity auction, and again, how do you think we will see more of a forward-looking signal that the profitability of your assets is improving?\nJim Burke: Yes, Angie, thank you for that. New England was a better clear than we've seen in a while. In fact, about 50% higher in the 2027, 2028 auction than what we saw just prior in the previous auction. Good for our gas fleet, obviously, up in New England. PJM has delayed some of their auctions. So we have to play catch-up with PJM. So we'll see what comes forward. There's going to be a number of auctions that happen in the next 12 months to get caught up in PJM. There have been market reforms proposed for PJM. Some of those are going to be implemented. Some of them were not supported by FERC. So again, it's still a little bit of a struggle as to what is going to be the effect on the capacity, things like market seller offer cap have been very difficult to move the needle on, which has had a dampening effect on capacity prices. But this effective load-carrying capability or ELCC, where potentially the dispatchable assets get proportionally more credit than the intermittent. That's an opportunity for the PJM capacity clear. So I think they are coming to the same conclusion that other grid operators, which is we -- PJM used to be really flushed with excess capacity, but a lot of it is retiring. And the gas plants are critical because the intermittent sources for wind and solar are not nearly as naturally supported in PJM as they are in places like ERCOT in California. As far as Texas is concerned, as I mentioned, the spark, and you see it in the graph that Chris covered, the spark spread has definitely moved up. So gas prices went up and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have come back down. Sparks have stayed elevated relative to that time frame, but they're still strongly backwardated. And I think that still comes from the concern of how much renewables will continue to come in. And then also, will the market reforms support price formation in ERCOT. And ECRS was an example where price formation occurred last summer. There was a lot of concern from a lot of customers and others that maybe there was too much price formation. And so they start having to revisit the rules. And now I would say it's just uncertain how some of these things like ECRS will play out. So certainty around some of these ancillaries will help certainty around PCM will help. That, coupled with the demand growth that is actualized on the ground I think, could help address some of the backwardation in ERCOT, which could then help address the investment signal. But we've said that for a while, ERCOT has been backwardated for about forever. If you go long enough out back in history, so the prop will always be pretty strong because that's where a reality meets the supply/demand. But out in the forwards, you still see concern around whether the price signals will be there. And that's part of the Texas market reform and ultimately, the gas plant investment that folks are considering. But I think that's still yet to play out.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then changing topics. So I understand that the Energy Harbor transaction hasn't closed, but I'm sure that was taking months to close. You were probably looking at the assets you're acquiring and potential revenue and cost synergies. So we're waiting for probably the first colocation of a data center within nuclear plant. And I'm just wondering, one, if you think that this will have an impact on other nuclear power owners? And also, how do you see the portfolio and large portfolio of nuclear plants vis-\u00e0-vis that opportunity. I'm mostly asking most of your sites are single unit nuclear plants. So there's this no backup from additional units that a data center would get? And would you think that it's somewhat of an impediment to the pursuit of such a colocation strategy on your sites?\nJim Burke: Yes. Angie, it's a fair question. I would say the data center growth behind the meter at a nuclear plant is still early stages for anybody in the market. It's certainly been discussed and being considered, but it still takes time for some of these to play out. I do think the two units having an opportunity to have redundancy will be attractive for customers. So Veeva Valley has been the one that is it working towards this path and then Comanche Peak as well. However, I'll go back to a comment I made on an earlier question, between the colocation companies and the hyperscalers, speed is very important to them. So while the redundancy may not be there on a single unit site, pulling from the grid would still be an option. And that's how we manage the behind the meter that we work with, with our gas plant. So while there is a preference list from a customer standpoint of things that check every box, I think there's going to be a balance of factors that the potential data center companies will be considering when they do a site selection. And speed is one of them. Economics is one of them, access to water is another one. So there's a number of variables there beyond just the two units versus one unit. But all things being equal, that would probably be a preferred site Angie. But I -- the fact that we're being approached about gas plants tells you that it isn't just about the carbon attributes. It's about some of these others as well.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then lastly, I'm sorry that I'm asking so many questions. But if you were to be approached by some of these tech companies and offer long-term contracts. And again, against a very depressed forward power curve, would you be willing to actually lock in some of these assets? Or are you basically thinking that we're about to see a step change in how the market assesses the value of your assets? And so there's no need to actually lock the -- the value at the bottom of the -- a potential bottom of the sell-the-cycle?\nJim Burke: Yeah. That is an excellent question, Angie. I don't know if it's an all or nothing approach because we have a lot of assets with a lot of length. But with -- if you're speaking nuclear first with a production tax credit that escalates with inflation and our curves are basically sitting at those levels, you would need to see something attractive from a customer to lock it in and it would have to be at a reasonable premium to what your view is of the alternative, which is to stay long to have the PTC as some support on the bottom, but still retain some of the upside for that asset. For other assets like the gas plants, I think you could potentially have more flexibility because you're not necessarily going to see that -- you're not going to see the PTC support for some of those. But from a nuclear standpoint, I don't think there's a rush here for the reasons that you mentioned. And it also takes time because of the complexity of these to put these in place. So I think we agree with how you're framing the question, Angie, and we're going to be patient about how we think about these opportunities.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Angie.\nOperator: And with that, we conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke, the CEO of Vistra for some closing remarks.\nJim Burke: Perfect. Thank you. First, I want to start with just thanking the Vistra team. 2023 was a heck of a year, and we look forward to what is in store with Energy Harbor, who I also want to thank they have done an excellent job running a business during a year of uncertainty, whenever an announcement is made, the units are running very well. The team has been incredibly cooperative on our integration efforts. And we're excited about this Friday and becoming one team. We're going to continue to execute our plan, which includes returning capital in an environment of very strong long-term fundamentals. I think that came out in a number of the questions that we were asked. And I also hope that we get to see many of you in New York next week. We'll be up there for a couple of days, and it's always good to see folks face-to-face. So, thank you for your time this morning, and we'll hopefully see you soon.\nOperator: And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Turning to slide 9. Vistra delivered strong fourth quarter results in 2023 with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $965 million, including $463 million from retail and $502 million from generation. For the year, Vistra delivered $4,140 million of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA including $1,105 million from retail and $3,035 million from generation. Despite mild weather conditions for much of the year, the performance of our generation units combined with our comprehensive hedging program and our ability to optimize our flexible assets drove the significant year-over-year improvement in our generation results in every region in the country. Moving to the Retail segment. The strong margin performance seen in the first nine months of the year continued in the fourth quarter. Positive residential customer count growth was driven by our multi-brand strategy with organic growth by our flagship brand, TXU Energy, for the third consecutive year. Turning to slide 10. We provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan. As of February 23, we executed approximately $3.7 billion of share repurchases and leading to an approximately 28% reduction compared to the number of shares that were outstanding in November of 2021. We expect to utilize $2.25 billion consisting of the $750 million remaining under the previous authorization as of the end of 2023 and the additional $1.5 billion of authorization announced today over the course of 2024 and 2025. We will review our capital available for allocation after we close the Energy Harbor acquisition and expect to share any updates later this year. Moving to our dividend program. We announced last week a fourth quarter 2023 common stock dividend of $0.215 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 9% over the dividend paid in Q1 2023 and an impressive 43% increase over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2021, when our capital allocation plan was first established. Turning to the balance sheet. Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits significantly below three times. As Jim stated earlier, although net debt will increase upon closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, it will remain close to three times, and we expect it to return to below three times by the end of 2024. In addition to maintaining low leverage, we took an important step to further simplify the balance sheet at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. As of February 23, 2024, we have repurchased approximately 98% of the outstanding rights to receive payments under our tax receivable agreement. To pay for these rights, which were entitled to receive approximately $1.4 billion over time on an undiscounted basis. We paid approximately $625 million, consisting of approximately $475 million in aggregate face value of Series C perpetual preferred stock and approximately $150 million of cash. Based on our forecast of payments that would have been due under the tax receivable agreement over the foreseeable planning horizon, we believe this transaction results in accretion to free cash flow over that time period and provides robust net present value to the company. Finally, the team is preparing to begin construction activities at three of our larger Illinois solar and energy storage developments at our former coal plant sites this spring. We believe these projects will continue to exceed our targeted return thresholds despite some headwinds in this higher cost and interest rate environment. The three key tenets of our responsible energy transition reliability, affordability and sustainability will continue to guide our renewables development program. We remain disciplined in our approach and continue to benchmark all projects against other uses of capital, including our share repurchase program. Touching quickly on slide 11. As we have done in prior quarters, we have provided an update on the out-year forward price curves as of February 23. While the ERCOT forward price curves continue to reflect on backwardation, the prices remain higher than the April 29, 2022, curves when we first spoke to you about increased EBITDA earnings potential in the out years. These curves together with the continued execution of our comprehensive hedging program, give us confidence in the ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity for 2025 in the range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion for Vistra stand-alone discussed last quarter. Again, we expect to update the 2025 opportunity, including the expected contribution from Energy Harbor on the first quarter results call. We are extremely proud of the performance of our generation retail and commercial teams during 2023 and the start of 2024. We believe our commercial optimization activities and flexible generation assets combined with an industry-leading retail business provides significant opportunities going forward. We will continue to focus on being a reliable, cost-efficient operator of assets, while producing adjusted free cash flow yields that translate directly into significant returns for our stockholders. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. Yes, Shar, again, we noted in the comments, I think the primary purpose of the TRA, it does have some benefits that aren't economic related, but the primary purpose was economic. When you take an instrument out that is entitled to $1.4 billion, and then we did it with a little bit more than $600 million. And more than three quarters of that is perpetual stock. It's just -- it became a transaction that was very economically beneficial for the company. And so we really focused on the economics of it. As far as cleaning it up, it does simplify the capital structure. It's a topic that we're pleased to not talk much about going forward. But it still is just one of the impediments to a split. There are still other debt securities at the Vistra operations level, and we still have preferred stock in place. So, there would be other things to address. So, that wasn't the primary purpose for this transaction. It was really -- we thought it was a great economic benefit to the company, including a significant amount of NPV for us. Yes, Julian, I would say, you hit it with the Energy Harbor transaction. So as that closes, as we look forward, we talked about expecting to spend $2.25 billion on share repurchases over 2024 and 2025. We also have a little bit of debt to repay, and we have some growth that you see for our renewables and energy storage business. But on top of that, we do expect to have additional cash available for allocation that's unallocated. We think it's preliminary right now to get into the levels that, that is because we just want to make sure to get this Energy Harbor deal closed and put the two businesses, start integrating the businesses. But I do think, we will come back to you and talk about an additional amount that over the next two years that we have to allocate on top of the share repurchase estimate that we're making. And so, I don't believe that any of those opportunities would disrupt our pacing on share repurchases. We'll -- we're going to continue to come back. I still think that the -- we haven't ever announced it as a percentage, but I think as a gross amount in this $1 billion-plus range on a per year basis, we don't see anything that would move us off that now. But we will continue to evaluate that with our Board. Thank you, Julien. As we do. We do see some benefits on a -- just a straight free cash flow basis, it is positive from free cash flow. So if you look -- as we talked about, we spent about $150 million of cash and then we issued the preferred. And so over the course of five years, our cash cost for that repurchase is in the neighborhood of $350 million, our estimates that we previously had would have shown that the TRA payments would have been roughly twice that. So there is some free cash flow pickup and that will factor into our conversion percentage. We still see -- obviously, we're in a higher cost and higher interest rate environment. So there are puts and takes. And so I think we still feel really good about saying that our -- our expectation is that we would be 55% on average over the planning horizon. Some years, we expect to be more like this year, you see in our materials that we end up just over 60% conversion. In some years, depending on the timing of maintenance capital could be a little bit lower. But I think on average, 55%, the mid-50s is the right place for our conversion ratio. Yes. So we're going to focus here on Energy Harbor and getting it closed. I do think that whether it's on that call or a future call, we are going to continue to assess what is the best way for us to communicate the ongoing value of this company. And so I do think we will -- at the very -- we do expect to plan -- we do expect to give updated guidance for this year. But as we go forward, what metrics we use and how we communicate what we see as the value of the business, we're going to continue to work through that, and we will come back to you whether that. It could come on the May call, but it could come also later this year. We're going to think through that and make sure that we've thought through all the issues."

            "name": "Jim Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. I appreciate all of you taking the time to join our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. First, I am proud to share the very strong results that the hard-working Vistra team delivered in 2023. And second, I am excited to announce that we expect to close the Energy Harbor acquisition on Friday, March 1. The Energy Harbor acquisition fits squarely with our continued focus on our four strategic priorities as laid out on slide 5, which starts with operating an integrated business model that combines retail and wholesale operations leading to more resilient and sustainable earnings and a variety of weather and pricing environments. This was not only true in delivering results $440 million above our original guidance level in 2023 and but was recently apparent during Winter Storm Heather in January of this year, where our core competency of operating generation assets was evidenced by our 98% commercial availability, which is particularly impressive in an environment where the ERCOT overall market outage rate for the five days impacted by the storm was 2.5 times Vistra outage rate. Turning to the other key priorities. We continue to execute on our capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we have returned to our investors approximately $4.3 billion through share repurchases and dividends. Further, we are excited to announce the Board approval of an additional $1.5 billion of share repurchases, which we expect to fully utilize by year-end 2025. Importantly, we have strengthened and simplified our balance sheet while maintaining our capital return plan. Net leverage remains low at 2.4 times, and although we expect to be slightly above our three times net leverage target when Energy Harbor closes, we project to return to below three times by year-end 2024. The successful repurchase of approximately 98% of our outstanding tax receivable agreement rights marks further progress in our efforts to simplify Vistra's capital structure, while improving our free cash flow conversion over the foreseeable planning horizon. Our disciplined capital approach also enables us to invest in renewables and energy storage growth that capitalizes on sites and interconnects in the Vistra portfolio. We delivered the Moss Landing 350 megawatt energy storage expansion in June of last year, and we began construction on three of our larger Illinois solar and energy storage developments located at our former coal plant sites in the spring of 2024. With grids in most of our markets tightening in the coming years as older fossil generation retires, mode continues to grow and with interconnection and transmission challenges, Vistra is well-positioned to continue to find ways to serve our customers reliably, affordably and sustainably while remaining disciplined about our capital allocation. Turning to slide 6. We received FERC's approval for both the acquisition of Energy Harbor and the corresponding sale of our Richland and Stryker generation facilities. Energy Harbor is a transformative acquisition and represents another significant step forward for our company. We are diligently working towards closing this transaction, which, as I already mentioned, we expect to close on March 1st. Despite closing later than we had hoped, we remain comfortable with our ability to successfully integrate our teams and deliver the initial guidance of pre-tax run rate synergies of $125 million by year-end 2025. We are also reiterating a 12-month 2024 and 2025 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities from Energy Harbor of $700 million and $800 million, respectively, as well as the expected run rate ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity on an unhedged and open basis of $900 million. However, given the anticipated closing date, you can expect our updated 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range, which we expect to provide on the first quarter 2024 results call will reflect only 10 months of contribution from Energy Harbor this year. Moving now to slide 7. As a reminder, we began the year with initial guidance for 2023 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA with a midpoint of $3.7 billion. This guidance was subsequently revised on both our second and third quarter calls, ultimately raised to a midpoint of $4.025 billion. As I stated earlier, despite another year of volatile weather, characterized by mostly mild weather, excluding the unprecedented summer heat in ERCOT during the third quarter, we were able to exceed the midpoint of our original guidance range by $440 million. Importantly, this translated to higher than expected ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth of approximately $2.491 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our original guidance range by $441 million. These results were achieved through strong customer count and margin performance at our retail segment and a nearly 96% commercial availability rate for our Generation segment. Now, I'd like to quickly turn to the 2024 guidance. Given the recent regulatory approval and the upcoming transaction closing, we anticipate providing combined Vistra and Energy Harbor guidance, including an update on synergies, as part of our first quarter 2024 results call. However, we can reaffirm the Vistra stand-alone 2024 guidance for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. We are eager and excited to join with the men and women of Energy Harbor and execute on behalf of our customers and communities as one team. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to discuss our quarterly performance in more detail. Yes. Thank you, Shar. I'll let Kris address the TRA, but I'll start with the direction we're headed. I think the Energy Harbor acquisition, as we said, is transformative for the company. It obviously brings a dispatchable 24/7 carbon-free element to the portfolio enhances our starting point that we had with Comanche Peak and Vistra Zero. The other part of the portfolio that I think is incredibly critical is the dispatchable assets that we have with our fossil fleet. Flexibility is an increasingly valuable attribute on these grids, particularly with the renewables penetration that we're seeing across the country, particularly ERCOT and California. So, from our standpoint, with such a large retail position and a growing retail position, the integration of how we can match the customer needs with assets that can provide the base load and the ramp products is an important part of risk management and value creation for our company. So, we see this still as one team. We see it as Vistra delivering on an integrated basis across our business for the long-term. And I think this excitement we have around closing Energy Harbor is it's a path we've been on for quite some time with the other acquisitions we've done. This is yet another one that fits neatly into what customers are looking for and that's why we're ready to get on to this next chapter. I'll let Kris quickly address the TRA. Yes, great question. Well, the demand growth surprised, I think many of us, both what we saw last summer and even with Heather. So, robust, low growth in Texas coupled with extreme weather, you start to see the grid getting pushed, obviously to a level of tightness, we haven't seen in quite some time. The loan program clearly was a signal from the legislature and policymakers that they would like to see the dispatchable resources grow in Texas, at a minimum to backstop the level of growth that we see with intermittent resources in Texas and we see like in winter storm Heather, on the tightest days of winter storm Heather about 5% during the hours that were the tightest. About 5% of the power coming \u2013 were coming from intermittent sources, about 95% from dispatchable. So I think the desire is there. The loan program is clearly a boost because the interest rate at 3%, that's better than where market is. But you raised another point that I think is critical, which is there's a series of market reforms that are contemplated at the moment that sit between ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission, they generally are around the ancillaries. So ECRS is one. DRS is another. And there's details of these that are yet to be defined. We hope to hear more about ECRS here in a few months. It's likely that ECRS could actually dispatch a little earlier, could actually end up being brought into the market earlier than it was last summer, which could have a little bit of a dampening effect on prices. The DRS is pushed out in time and it's unclear, what kind of effect on price signals that might have? And then lastly, PCM, this performance credit mechanism, which is in the law, the House Bill 1500, that is also probably on a 2027 time frame. And I think the balance, Shar, that all policymakers are trying to strike is what's the sufficient revenue stream to incentivize someone to write an equity check and at the same time, deliver affordable electricity in Texas that's obviously reliable. And there's a tension there. And that tension shows up in some of the rule makings and the procedures that are going to follow -- we're going to learn more as they follow through on these in the next three to six months. So the loan program is certainly helpful. We don't view that as sufficient as a revenue signal you still see in our PowerPoint deck, there's backwardation in the spark spreads for ERCOT. So why they are higher than they were when we first started to talk to you about long-dated curves in 2022, they're still backwardated. We need to see some support for the price signals to be able to be confident that a 20- to 30-year life asset has a reasonable prospect for a return. And I think people are working hard to try to make that happen, but that's still TBD. Hey, David. Sure. Yes. Thanks, David, for the question. I'll step back just a second to say that as the grids have become a little bit tighter across the country, we're seeing the fossil assets retire, particularly coal. And then we're seeing more electrification. We're seeing customers approach us at a rate that we haven't seen in my history with this industry. And data center specifically, they're looking for speed to market, so they're trying to get online as fast as they can. They're obviously looking for where they've got good fiber, particularly potentially access to water for cooling needs, but reliability is now entering that discussion. So many of them are talking about while they can do it out on the grid, they're interested in also being behind-the-meter. And depending on who the customer is, it doesn't need to be a nuclear plant. They're actually entertaining gas plants for behind-the-meter opportunities. And we've done that with some of the crypto load already in Texas. We've done some behind-the-meter. So we're familiar with it. Whether that load goes behind-the-meter or out on the grid, it's new demand. And that's part of the supply and demand equation that might also send the price signals that could also then incentivize new supply. But it's meaningful, David. It's hard to get locked in on any one forecast. But most forecasts have a doubling of this data center load by 2030. Texas is a pretty easy place to do business. So Texas, which is already the second largest data center market in the country, may end up getting a disproportionate amount of it. But we do see this as a real opportunity for our company. I will tell you in terms of customers approaching us, way more customers approaching us around data centers than we've had so far on hydrogen. And part of that is just the rules uncertainty around hydrogen, but also I think we're serving a customer demand. There's actually a demand for where this is going, where the hydrogen has been a little bit more supply driven and trying to create a product that's inexpensive. This is more pull from the customer, and we're having a lot of conversations. We're pretty excited about it. Yeah. The behind-the-meter activity, it still takes some planning studies that we work on with ERCOT and the wires company. You may also need to be doing the substation construction, get some of the high-voltage switchgear. So you could still be looking at a couple of years for something to go from concept to reality. So I wouldn't say that it's immediately around the corner for something, that's a new conversation. There are clearly some current data centers that could actually even be repowered. Those can actually go from existing chips that are used more for cloud services to the more energy-intensive AI purpose chips. That could be happening over the course of the next two years. But I would say it's a couple of year process, David, from my perspective. Yeah. Thanks David. Yes, Julien, thank you very much for the questions. I'll start with the data center opportunities, as I mentioned, whether behind-the-meter or whether out on the grid, they have a natural sort of demand increase that could send some price signals for wholesale power prices in the out year. Some of that could be factored into these curves already. I mean people have been reading about this. The curves are stronger today than they were in the spring of 2022 when we first put out our multiyear guidance range. So I think, Vistra being net long in ERCOT has an opportunity, whether we are directly involved with the data center or not. So then you beg the question, when would we get directly involved? It's if we found that there's a return on that capital to do something that would make sense relative to our other capital allocation alternatives. I would say that, I'm not in the detail at a level of comfort yet, that I would tell you, that's actionable. So we know that from a free cash flow yield perspective, it's still pretty attractive for us to be returning capital through the buyback. So we would need to see a level of, what I'd call, transactable economics that have the long-term agreement to bring that to bear as an alternative to our capital allocation strategy, in which case, I think our shareholders would be pleased to see it. But I view this as an opportunity for us with our native position that I think it's specifically an enhanced opportunity for our own assets, if we choose to do something behind the meter. In addition, I didn't even mention, but in addition to the data center, of course, we have population growth in Texas, which is still strong. And we have a Permian Basin growth rate for load that ERCOT has put out some studies that suggest that you could see 13 gigawatts of growth out west from 2023 to 2030. That's oil and gas driven, it's population driven. It's also got some data center loan growth there. So, this is a general theme and then how that -- I think will benefit an asset position like Vistra. And then specifically, how we might target our own assets, I view that as incremental upside, none of which is factored in to our long-range plan at this point. And in terms of when we'll update from a capital allocation and how we think about longer-term buybacks, I'm going to have Kris jump in. Good morning, Durgesh. Durgesh, what I would add is, once we close Energy Harbor, we will go through a process to confirm the synergy numbers. So we'll talk about that on the May call. That will then lead to the 2024 expectation, as Kris said, of the combined companies. We will also, as he noted in his script, we'll talk about where we see the 2025 headed as well. And obviously, the synergies are part of that. Capital allocation, there will be an amount that's still unallocated that we see that we will be talking to our Board with, with respect to how we think about the best use of that capital. But what you could expect to hear about in May, at least to 2024 with a nod to 2025 with our guidance and then these updated synergy expectations. As far as the best metrics, clearly, with Constellation's call yesterday, very successful in their description of how to think about the value drivers. For our business, where we have looked at it and since the buyback program was enhanced in 2021. So far, we've really focused on the return of cash and capital to the shareholders. And on a per share basis, between the buyback programs and the dividends, you're seeing that in the sort of $4.45 on the high end and that's an opportunity that's per share. And so that's just from a return of capital standpoint. In terms of the adjusted free cash flow before growth on a per share basis, it's much higher on a stand-alone basis, that's closer to $6 a share. As far as working through GAAP and working through the mark-to-market, working through depreciation and amortization, we will be taking a look at that. What we've tried to focus on to date has been much more about the proof points around the capital we're returning and the sustainability of that and frankly, the upsizing of that. But clearly, the investor response yesterday was super positive. And if there's opportunities for us to be more clear about the value drivers and the comfort that investors are looking for, for the long term, we owe it to them. We'll be certainly taking a look at that. Good morning. Yeah, Michael, I would say it has been -- we have been updating it ourselves as we're tracking kind of through the process of working to close. We feel good about it. So when we looked at $700 million on a 12-month basis, I do think we'll be in the ballpark of prorating 10th, 12ths of that number. If you do that and you add it to our Vistra stand-alone as we sit today, then you're in the $4.5 billion sort of range for calendar year 2024. That's above where we were when we announced the acquisition in March of 2023. The synergy numbers, I think there'll be some upside to the synergy numbers, but not likely in calendar year 2024 because we thought we could close this deal later last year. So we're getting a later start. But I think by the end of this year, we'll be about where we expected from a run rate perspective. I think there's upside to the out years on how we're thinking about it. So we'd expect to talk about that on the May call. But the way you're thinking about it is correct, Michael. I think it's always helpful to close a deal work with the teams day-in and day-out, make sure we understand all the assumptions and then affirm and potentially, we see a chance to upsize some things on the May call, we'll do it at that time. Sure. Yes, we believe we're in really good shape. Michael, we have, as I've indicated on previous calls, we have, as Vistra done some additional procurement through time since we announced the transaction. Obviously, we had a high percentage likelihood in our view of being able to close the transaction. Either way, the markets continue to go up in price, and that's been speculation on the part of a number of folks based on whether Russia pans or limitations would ultimately be put in place. So we have a physical procurement strategy that we are secure for both Energy Harbor sites and our site Comanche Peak through 2027 refuelings. And we feel good about that. We're also substantially hedged into 2028 as well. So we feel good about the risk management around that. And of course, long term, depending on where this goes with the domestic fuel supply capabilities and whether the federal government will incentivize more domestic capabilities for enrichment remains to be seen. But I think we have a very good line of sight and very consistent with everything that we've shared publicly so far and our expectations of this deal. Thank you, Michael. Good morning, Angie. Yes, Angie, thank you for that. New England was a better clear than we've seen in a while. In fact, about 50% higher in the 2027, 2028 auction than what we saw just prior in the previous auction. Good for our gas fleet, obviously, up in New England. PJM has delayed some of their auctions. So we have to play catch-up with PJM. So we'll see what comes forward. There's going to be a number of auctions that happen in the next 12 months to get caught up in PJM. There have been market reforms proposed for PJM. Some of those are going to be implemented. Some of them were not supported by FERC. So again, it's still a little bit of a struggle as to what is going to be the effect on the capacity, things like market seller offer cap have been very difficult to move the needle on, which has had a dampening effect on capacity prices. But this effective load-carrying capability or ELCC, where potentially the dispatchable assets get proportionally more credit than the intermittent. That's an opportunity for the PJM capacity clear. So I think they are coming to the same conclusion that other grid operators, which is we -- PJM used to be really flushed with excess capacity, but a lot of it is retiring. And the gas plants are critical because the intermittent sources for wind and solar are not nearly as naturally supported in PJM as they are in places like ERCOT in California. As far as Texas is concerned, as I mentioned, the spark, and you see it in the graph that Chris covered, the spark spread has definitely moved up. So gas prices went up and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have come back down. Sparks have stayed elevated relative to that time frame, but they're still strongly backwardated. And I think that still comes from the concern of how much renewables will continue to come in. And then also, will the market reforms support price formation in ERCOT. And ECRS was an example where price formation occurred last summer. There was a lot of concern from a lot of customers and others that maybe there was too much price formation. And so they start having to revisit the rules. And now I would say it's just uncertain how some of these things like ECRS will play out. So certainty around some of these ancillaries will help certainty around PCM will help. That, coupled with the demand growth that is actualized on the ground I think, could help address some of the backwardation in ERCOT, which could then help address the investment signal. But we've said that for a while, ERCOT has been backwardated for about forever. If you go long enough out back in history, so the prop will always be pretty strong because that's where a reality meets the supply/demand. But out in the forwards, you still see concern around whether the price signals will be there. And that's part of the Texas market reform and ultimately, the gas plant investment that folks are considering. But I think that's still yet to play out. Yes. Angie, it's a fair question. I would say the data center growth behind the meter at a nuclear plant is still early stages for anybody in the market. It's certainly been discussed and being considered, but it still takes time for some of these to play out. I do think the two units having an opportunity to have redundancy will be attractive for customers. So Veeva Valley has been the one that is it working towards this path and then Comanche Peak as well. However, I'll go back to a comment I made on an earlier question, between the colocation companies and the hyperscalers, speed is very important to them. So while the redundancy may not be there on a single unit site, pulling from the grid would still be an option. And that's how we manage the behind the meter that we work with, with our gas plant. So while there is a preference list from a customer standpoint of things that check every box, I think there's going to be a balance of factors that the potential data center companies will be considering when they do a site selection. And speed is one of them. Economics is one of them, access to water is another one. So there's a number of variables there beyond just the two units versus one unit. But all things being equal, that would probably be a preferred site Angie. But I -- the fact that we're being approached about gas plants tells you that it isn't just about the carbon attributes. It's about some of these others as well. Yeah. That is an excellent question, Angie. I don't know if it's an all or nothing approach because we have a lot of assets with a lot of length. But with -- if you're speaking nuclear first with a production tax credit that escalates with inflation and our curves are basically sitting at those levels, you would need to see something attractive from a customer to lock it in and it would have to be at a reasonable premium to what your view is of the alternative, which is to stay long to have the PTC as some support on the bottom, but still retain some of the upside for that asset. For other assets like the gas plants, I think you could potentially have more flexibility because you're not necessarily going to see that -- you're not going to see the PTC support for some of those. But from a nuclear standpoint, I don't think there's a rush here for the reasons that you mentioned. And it also takes time because of the complexity of these to put these in place. So I think we agree with how you're framing the question, Angie, and we're going to be patient about how we think about these opportunities. Thank you, Angie. Perfect. Thank you. First, I want to start with just thanking the Vistra team. 2023 was a heck of a year, and we look forward to what is in store with Energy Harbor, who I also want to thank they have done an excellent job running a business during a year of uncertainty, whenever an announcement is made, the units are running very well. The team has been incredibly cooperative on our integration efforts. And we're excited about this Friday and becoming one team. We're going to continue to execute our plan, which includes returning capital in an environment of very strong long-term fundamentals. I think that came out in a number of the questions that we were asked. And I also hope that we get to see many of you in New York next week. We'll be up there for a couple of days, and it's always good to see folks face-to-face. So, thank you for your time this morning, and we'll hopefully see you soon."

I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Thanks. And I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Meagan. Good morning, and I appreciate all of you for taking the time to join our third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am proud to deliver our third quarter results this morning, which was a very successful quarter for all facets of the business. We'll start this morning on Slide 5. I'll speak to this quarter's operational and financial performance in more detail in a moment, but notably, this quarter's adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of approximately $1.6 billion underscored Vistra's capability of achieving consistently strong earnings through its integrated business model, with excellent operational performance by each of our generation retail and commercial teams and a variety of pricing and weather environments. In the prior two quarters, we experienced average power prices clearing lower than our realized hedge prices, which highlighted the significant downside risk protection to our earnings at our comprehensive hedging strategy provides. This quarter that scenario held in the markets outside of ERCOT were milder weather kept prices lower. In these markets, we were able to capitalize on our dynamic position management of our hedged portfolio to capture significant earnings in our generation segment. We saw this paradigm flip in the ERCOT market and while we were significantly hedged, we did have some open length and the generation fleet's operating flexibility was optimized by our integrated teams to respond to higher market prices, while keeping the lights and much needed air conditioning on at competitive prices for our customers throughout the markets we serve. With each of our four strategic priorities, our aim is to challenge ourselves with high performance goals and then consistently deliver. To that end this quarter, you saw us continue to advance our other three strategic priorities as well, as we focus on a strong balance sheet, our capital return program and our energy transition goals. As of November 2, we've now returned over $3.785 billion of capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and our dividend program, since the capital allocation was first announced in November of 2021. After we close Energy Harbor acquisition and develop a long-range plan for the combined company, we will work with our Board on a new multi-year capital allocation plan and expect to disclose the specifics of that plan in the first half of 2024. In the meantime, we continue to opportunistically invest in renewables and energy storage growth, including our expectation that we will begin construction in spring of 2024 on our three largest solar and energy storage developments located at our former Illinois Coal plant sites while maintaining our sub-three times leverage ratio. I want to move now to slide 6 to discuss our third quarter operational performance. This past quarter, we saw unprecedented heat and ERCOT. It was the highest third quarter on record even beating the record-setting heat of 2011. Temperatures in Texas were six degrees above normal in August and early September frequently topping 105 degrees in Dallas and over 100 degrees in Houston and San Antonio. Cooling degree days were 23% above the 30-year normal for the June through September comparable time period and ERCOT set a new peak demand 10 different times this summer. On August 10, ERCOT experienced its all-time record peak load of over 85,000 megawatts. It was vital for our generation team to keep the plants running in these extreme conditions to ensure that people of Texas could continue to live and work in healthy and comfortable environment. In ERCOT, the solar generation ramp down hours of around 6 to 8 p.m., have proven to be a critical time period for the grid. It is still very hot during those times with strong customer energy demand but it is also the time period where we see solar start to ramp down and at times the wind may not make up the difference especially in August. The ERCOT grid is operationally complex having to predict the availability of not only dispatchable resources but also intermittent resources such as solar and wind, limited duration energy storage and demand response activities. As the generation mix of intermittent resources increases, ERCOT needs more reserves as a backstop to ensure there is adequate generation to cover demand and avoid emergency conditions. In these scenarios, you see flexible generation fleets like ours ramping to meet as much of this demand as possible. And that is exactly what we did, exceeding 97% commercial availability on average during those critical hours. During these tough weather seasons, our number one priority is ensuring our customers can consistently access competitively priced power to maintain their quality of life and keep the economy strong. That's where our retail business excelled. This summer's marketing campaigns featured several differentiated products tailored to our customers' needs, including a seasonal discount product that helps customers manage the size of their electricity bill through the higher usage summer months. Our customer-focused multi-brand and marketing channel strategy and responsive service, allowed us to grow our ERCOT residential customer counts over the prior quarter. In addition, our business market segment grew customer volume 16% year-over-year as strong margins. While the retail and generation teams stood ready to meet these demands for our customers and the people we serve, our commercial team optimized our financial position to create significant value for our shareholders. Specifically, in August, the ERCOT market saw average real-time pricing around $196 with 43 hours in August clearing over $1,000. And during those critical hours at 6:00 to 8:00 PM in August, we saw prices clear on average around $843. Leveraging customer usage insights and our generation fleets strong commercial availability, our commercial team optimized and managed our risk position to create significant value on our open positions. The commercial team further set us up for success in our markets outside of ERCOT where the weather was milder, strategically managing our positions and flexing our generation output to optimize our hedge positions and achieve strong results for the quarter. We see this trend of new peak demand records at ERCOT continuing for the foreseeable planning horizon, demand that we believe our retail products are designed to attract and our diverse and flexible generation fleet is uniquely positioned to serve. Moving now to slide 7. Again I am proud of the team's exceptional, tightly coordinated performance this quarter that helped Vistra achieve its $1.613 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Not only did the retail team grow residential customer accounts, TXU Energy maintained the PUC of Texas five-star rating, extending its streak to 12 straight months. Our ERCOT fleet delivered 2.5 terawatt hours more than any other quarter's output in at least the past 10 years, a 10% increase over the next highest quarterly generation output achieved in the third quarter of 2019. It was a notable feat that when paired with a strong performance by the commercial team to adapt to a variety of weather conditions created significant value across all of our markets. With the important summer months behind us and only two months left in the year, today we are raising and narrowing the guidance range we announced last quarter from $3.6 billion to $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations to now $3.95 billion to $4.1 billion. We are similarly increasing and narrowing the range of adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations to a new range of $2.35 billion to $2.5 billion. Turning now to slide 8. We introduced 2024 guidance ranges for Vistra stand-alone without including any Energy Harbor contributions. We are forecasting adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations in the range of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion and adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. Notably our ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint for 2024 of $3.9 billion is higher than the midpoint opportunities we previewed on our most recent earnings call in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. We are confident in our forecast as we expect consistent earnings from our retail business paired with expected strong performances from our reliable, diverse and flexible generation fleet that stands ready to deliver in a variety of economic and weather conditions just as it has this year. Of course, we will update our guidance ranges to include Energy Harbor performance expectations after we close the acquisition. Speaking of the Energy Harbor acquisition slide 9 provides an update on the status of the transaction. Since we last spoke, we have received approval from the NRC in September and we declared substantial compliance with the DOJ's second request on August 31st. We have responded to all requests from FERC and that process is progressing. Given our commitment to sell the Richland/Stryker generation plants, which we believe eliminates any potential remaining concerns around market competition, we continue to target a closing before the end of the year. Our team has worked with the Energy Harbor team to prepare for a smooth integration. And we are prepared to close the transaction promptly after receiving approval from FERC. As noted before, we intend to provide combined Vistra and Energy Harbor forecast and guidance information, after we close the acquisition. But as shown on slide 9, we continue to expect the Energy Harbor business to deliver an average of approximately $750 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2024 and 2025 including the impact of the hedges and synergies with that number growing to approximately $900 million when considered on an open basis. I'll now turn the call over to Kris, to discuss our quarterly performance in more detail.\nKris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 11, Vistra's performance in Q3 2023 was a reflection of available opportunities and outstanding execution throughout the country by both our Generation and Retail segments. Generation segment exhibited the benefits of maintaining a diverse, flexible and durable fleet of assets with the team delivering strong results in both ERCOT, where third quarter temperatures were on average the hottest on record and outside of ERCOT where temperatures were milder. Notably, the $1.44 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations delivered by the Generation segment, in Q3 2023, was almost $400 million higher than the same quarter last year. Moving to the Retail segment. Despite the challenges of high loads and prices in ERCOT in Q3, the Retail team delivered outstanding results for the quarter by focusing on customer counts and margins and consistently optimizing its supply position throughout the quarter. Although Retail is not typically expected to contribute much adjusted EBITDA, if any, in the summer months when prices are higher, the team was able to deliver $173 million in Q3 this year. Looking at year-to-date, each of the Generation and Retail segments are outperforming as compared to last year, with Vistra earning over $800 million more in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA through the third quarter of this year, as compared to the same period in 2022. We are proud of the team's execution thus far this year. And we are looking forward to finishing the year strong. Turning to Slide 12. We provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan. As of November 2nd, we had executed approximately $3.26 billion of share repurchases, leading to an approximately 26% reduction in the number of shares that were outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $1 billion of the total $4.25 billion authorization by year-end 2024. However, as Jim noted, we do expect to review our capital available for allocation, shortly after we close the Energy Harbor acquisition and would expect to announce a new comprehensive capital allocation plan in the first half of 2024. Moving to our dividend program. We announced last week a fourth quarter 2023 common stock dividend of $0.213 per share, which represents a substantial growth of 42% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 when our capital allocation plan was first established. This growth highlights the significant returns available to our shareholders, as we reduce share count while paying a constant quarterly dividend amount. Turning to the balance sheet. In light of the results achieved in the third quarter, culminating an updated 2023 guidance ranges Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits significantly below three times. While net debt will increase upon closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, we currently expect our net leverage ratio to be below three times on a pro forma basis in 2024. Finally, in addition to the transformation we are achieving with the Energy Harbor acquisition, the team has been busy with development and pre-construction activity this year at our three largest solar and energy storage developments at our former Illinois coal plant sites, for which we now anticipate construction to begin next spring. Despite some headwinds in this higher cost and interest rate environment, these projects continue to comfortably exceed our targeted return thresholds. As we've stated before, we believe in a responsible energy transition that targets disciplined capital outlays for strategic projects and the zero carbon generation growth we will achieve with these three coal to solar sites are reflective of that core principle. Touching quickly on Slide 13, as we have done in prior quarters, we have provided an update on the out-year forward price curves as of November 2. While the ERCOT forward price curve continues to reflect some backwardation, the prices still remain higher than the April 29, 2022 curves, when we first spoke to you about increased EBITDA earnings potential in the out years. The curves and sparks are holding together well and support our initiated 2024 guidance ranges. Those curves together with the continued execution of our comprehensive hedging program provide us confidence in an adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations midpoint opportunity for 2025 in the range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. To wrap up, Slide 14 provides some additional breakdown of our 2024 initiated guidance ranges including midpoint expectations among the current business segments. As we have discussed previously, the acquisition of Energy Harbor will accelerate the transformation of our company and we expect it to alter the way we analyze our business results. Accordingly, after we closed the transaction, we expect to re-segment our businesses. While we will have more say on that after closing, we do expect to provide you with more visibility into our nuclear and renewable businesses. I want to reiterate Jim's comments. We are extremely proud of the collaborative work and performance of each of our generation retail and commercial teams. We have great line of sight to keep that momentum going for the foreseeable future. And we will keep striving to meet the expectations of our customers and our communities to keep the lights on in an affordable and reliable manner in markets in which we operate. And at the same time, we will manage the company in a cost-efficient and strategic manner to continue producing adjusted free cash flow yields that we are translating directly into significant returns for our shareholders. I know I speak on behalf of all of our employees and partners, when I say that we are striving to end 2023 on a strong note and to execute against our targets for 2024. With that operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey, everyone. Good morning.\nJim Burke: Hey, good morning, Michael.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey, Jim just wanted to start with maybe what kind of gives you conviction in being able to close the deal by the year-end and we'll be able to hear something from FERC in a timely manner here?\nJim Burke: Yes, Michael. We've noted the progress that we've made with this transaction. Originally we thought NRC would be the longer pole in the tent and we were pleased to get that approval a few months ago. Where we sit at the moment is we've got feedback from DOJ and we think we've addressed DOJ's concern. We expect to have addressed FERC's concern by selling the Richland/Stryker facility. We did not think it was a concern at the time we initiated the deal and we still don't believe that's a concern. But out of an abundance of caution we are making that move. We have obviously responded to all of their information requests and the interveners have done the same. So our anticipation is that FERC has all the information that they need. We've asked for a feedback by the middle of November. We feel confident that we'll get to something by the end of this year and that we target to -- we're planning and targeting to close by the end of this year. But I think it's just been a process Michael and it's been one that we've been obviously very responsive to and I think from a FERC standpoint they've got the information and they've got to do their due diligence, but there's been no new issues raised to us at this point and that's why we think we're going to get this done by year end.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on the new financial outlook here I wanted to ask on some of the dynamics below EBITDA and at the free cash flow line. So it looks like the free cash flow for 2023 actually improved more than EBITDA. So I wanted to get a sense what's driving that? And then it looks like the conversion to free cash then drops again in 2024? And just also on that I wanted to confirm like does that include the interest cost associated with the debt you issued for Energy Harbor but obviously not the EBITDA yet. Yes. Sorry that was a bunch here but...\nJim Burke: Yes, Michael, thank you for that. I'll start by saying that our results for this year which obviously we've continued to guide up as we've gone through the year. Most of that improvement is EBITDA-driven and we did a nice job operating in the third quarter with extreme opportunities with pricing and weather being coincident particularly in ERCOT. That EBITDA largely drops through to the bottom-line when we built the plan at the beginning of the year you wouldn't have expected the kind of weather conditions that actually played out. So that free cash flow in this near term obviously will fall through and you're seeing that improved conversion. We started the year with an expected lower conversion rate because we wouldn't have had this kind of EBITDA opportunity built into a more normal weather scenario. We actually talked about free cash flow conversion being a little bit lower in 2023 and 2024 when we set our plans and we talked about the capital required to run the units pulling in some of the long-term service agreement spend for CapEx was one of the main drivers. You'll see in the capacity factors that are in the back of the deck our units have been running really well but they've also been running hard. And so we'll spend some capital in 2024 and probably have to spend some capital in 2025 to make sure the fleet stays in tip top condition. And so I think the surprise was not where we see 24 playing out from a free cash flow conversion. We actually had some positive free cash flow conversion due to the EBITDA opportunities that came our way in 2023. As far as Energy Harbor interest and how we're thinking about that financing and its effect on our results in 2023 -- in 2024 I'll ask Kris to comment.\nKris Moldovan: Yes, Michael I think you hit it. There are a couple of factors. For 2023 we did plan for some financing that would have some interest that would hit into 2023. And those were -- we didn't execute a financing until later in the year and the first interest payment on that financing will be next year. So, we actually -- it's a little bit counterintuitive but versus our plan from the start of the year we're in a benefit position on interest for 2023. And then you're right, 2024, the number that you're seeing here does take into account the interest expense on the debt that we raised for Energy Harbor and that we're holding right now. And as you noted, we don't have any contribution from Energy Harbor results.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay, super helpful. Thanks a lot.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Thank you guys very much. Really appreciate the opportunity to connect here. Just coming back to the capital allocation update commentary from the call real quickly. I mean obviously you're going to be introducing a new year in the first half of the year I think you said. But can you give us a little bit of a sense as to what the parameters are? I mean is it just really about how to capitalize the business? Are you thinking about this vis-\u00e0-vis new and novel growth avenues that could be emerging here pro forma for the acquisition and/or any other directions there? I just want to make sure I'm understanding what you're saying there? Is this more about addressing the potential 2025 and 2026 $1 billion buybacks? Or is there something more that you're kind of alluding to in terms of how you think about the future growth of the business here?\nJim Burke: Julien, thank you for the question. Good morning. I appreciate the comprehensive question on capital allocation. I think it's several things. First of all, as asked earlier, we want to close this Energy Harbor acquisition get -- make sure we've got embedded fully a multiyear view of the potential for that business as well as the synergies that we're anticipating to be able to deliver over a multiyear basis. We also -- because we've raised the Vistra stand-alone guidance, we see more cash available for allocation. So, we want to put all of that together and go through that process of discussion obviously with our Board when we can have a comprehensive discussion about a number of things. We've mentioned some Vistra Zero opportunities in this deck that we will continue to execute on. The buyback program we've been executing actually slightly ahead of pace. We would anticipate that when we come back through the approval process with the Board, they'll remain supportive of the buyback program potentially at the current or even a potential higher pacing than where we've been executing. We did not feel like going out too far at this point given that we need to close the acquisition and put the full plan together. We didn't feel just highlighting one element of a buyback amount in 2025 or 2026 was appropriate at this point, but our commitment to our four strategic priorities and I think the execution against those has been on track if not exceeded and I would expect that to continue. As far as growth vectors, there are a lot of things that the future holds that are still being sorted out particularly with the Inflation Reduction Act. And are there going to be opportunities here to utilize behind-the-meter opportunity some of the hydrogen opportunities, I think just from our standpoint we still own nearly 60 sites worth of land and interconnect. So, we've got plenty of opportunities to still develop a number of avenues of our business from a growth strategy, but they need to meet our return requirements. And I think that's the discipline we wanted to continue to demonstrate through this presentation and why we want to come back with a comprehensive capital allocation plan is, we have to look at all of the options on the table, and look at the best ones, and not just the ones that we've been executing on to this point. But I see us remaining focused on the four core principles, and I think that's worked well. I think our investors understand our mindset around these, and we look forward to hopefully given another set of opportunity for our investors to see how we'll create value once we close the Energy Harbor acquisition.\nQ \u2013 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. And just speaking of which, right I mean obviously, the 2024 guidance today is not apples-to-apples with maybe what Street is \"using\" out there. I mean any chance that you could give us a little bit of a sense of what the EH impact is mark-to-market today even in a ballpark, sense to try to kind of square your guidance?\nJim Burke: I think Julien, it is a little bit from a timing standpoint, an apple and an orange, but I do think you can take a couple of pieces and add them together. So if you look at our stand-alone guidance for next year, we're looking at a midpoint of $3.9 billion. And then we unpacked the Energy Harbor 2024 2025 numbers, because we what we wanted to do we gave you an average last time of 750. Now we're unpacking it saying 700 for 2024. That's still using some data that we got originally, through our cases but we're tracking curves. We have a sense of things are about where they were at the time, we announced the deal from a power price standpoint. So there alone you're taking the 3.9 and the 700 here, you're getting to 4.6. We had been at a midpoint of 4.35, on average when we gave you that direction when we announced the deal. So, I think the two pieces just added together put us north of where we have been signaling the combined opportunity. And this still has the targeted synergy levels in here. I think we could potentially exceed those targeted synergy levels, but we need to get into the business fully have the details around that execution plan before, we would upsize anything there Julien. So, I do appreciate you calling out, because I think there's been some consensus that is included. Energy Harbor and some that has been stand-alone. Our stand-alone is well north of anything that we have signaled, at this point and we think our Energy Harbor at this point is on track. And when we get into it, I think we might be able to find some additional upside. But at this point, we're not reflecting that.\nQ \u2013 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: At least, on track with those synergies it seems. But thank you very much again for time, guys. Appreciate and I\u2019ll pass it.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Julien.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nQ \u2013 David Arcaro: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nJim Burke: Good morning, David.\nQ \u2013 David Arcaro: Could you comment on the retail trends that you're seeing, do you expect this retail strength to continue? And I guess looking into the 2024 guidance, you've got some solid growth that you're reflecting year-over-year in the Retail segment. Wondering if 2024, could be potentially considered kind of a new baseline, I guess for the performance of that segment?\nJim Burke: Yes, David I'll start off. I'd like Scott Hudson, our President of Retail to add some commentary. I think the business \u2013 obviously, we break our business apart, quite a bit. There's different geographies in the business. ERCOT has its own unique design. The other markets obviously, have a different one more with the TDU, the wires company doing the billing. Our business has a very heavy residential footprint from an earnings profile standpoint, but a very large-scale business and profitable business in the Commercial & Industrial segment. The business has performed better than we expected it to perform this year relative to plan. And next year is pretty flat to that. So I think it's actually more stable is how I would describe the retail business not a large growth assumption or a moonshot required for us to be delivering in our 2024 guidance. And the team has done a really nice job adapting to a variety of weather conditions extreme weather and ERCOT and actually milder than normal weather in most of the rest of the country. But I think the underlying trends are a function of the creative products and the marketing channels. I'd like Scott to comment on that. So, you get a feel beyond just the numbers of how the team actually executes dynamically to meet customer needs.\nScott Hudson : Yes. Thank you Jim, and thanks for the question. We did see strong margins and growth across all of our customer segments and geographies in the quarter-over-quarter. On the residential side in ERCOT, which is a large concentration of what we do, Jim mentioned, the summer campaigns that we had very successful across six brands we have in the markets across multiple different products, our seasonal discount product, which helps flatten the customer bill with the discount in the summer for the customer is very popular. And then on the retention side, we have an advanced analytics team that actually identifies customers that we give customer credits to. We call them comfort credits and that's also a way to retain customers in these very extreme summer periods. That's a program we've had in place for several years, but we continue to refine. On the C&I side, what we see is that really strong margin performance. When there's volatility in these markets and power costs are up and down, this is really an opportunity for us for really providers at scale that have reliable generation and sophisticated commercial capabilities. So we saw some nice margin expansion both in ERCOT and in the Midwest and Northeast market. So those are just a few examples to give you a flavor, but to Jim's point, we're always looking to optimize our customer counts, our margins, our risk capabilities along with the customer experience. And it really is that optimization that allows the business to be consistent and stable.\nJim Burke : And David the thing I would conclude on Scott's remarks, which we're spot on with how we think about the business is the customer could be put under a lot of pressure with volatile pricing. With the hedging strategies, which we've described before are pretty conservative about the way in which we procure to handle extreme weather. Our goal is to insulate the customer as much as possible from those kinds of bill shocks. That helps franchise value in the long run. It helps the customers sort of get through the seasonal events. But it does take resources to be -- to hedge at that level. It takes capital you have to post collateral at times. You have to be a little bit more conservative on how you think about some of your pricing structures. But I think it pays off in the long run. And that's why the business not only had a really strong financial quarter they grew accounts in the quarter. Growing accounts in the quarter as being one of the largest market share participants is not an easy thing to do. But if you're providing that stable value proposition to the customer, the customers do respond well. And I think that's where we shine better is when we've got this kind of volatility that's when the model I think really differentiates itself.\nDavid Arcaro: Yes. Excellent. Yes, I appreciate that color. And thanks for the clarification on the trajectory into 2024. And could I ask just does the retail contribution as you look into 2025 and the indicative midpoint guidance there? Does it stay flat into that year off of $24 million?\nJim Burke: David, we haven't put anything out specifically on retail, but we've given you a sense of where we see 2025 on a combined entity. But, yes, we see it staying fairly flat. And most of the delta that we'd expect to see if any in 2025 would be more driven by where the generation segment is. We're highly hedged in 2025, but we have to carry more open there. So you might see a little bit more variation there than we'd expect to see in retail.\nDavid Arcaro: Yes. Got it. Understood. And just to push out even further just any directional thoughts on 2026 how much might be hedged at this point and just directional trend off to 2025?\nJim Burke: Sure. Yes. If you look at the curves David 2026 is looking stronger than 2025. That particularly has moved in the ERCOT region from the last time we spoke. In fact when we had our call in August it was August 9 and August 10 was the all-time peak in ERCOT. So we were busy and we talked about how we needed to make sure that we got through the summer. Most of the pricing volatility in ERCOT came in the back half of August. And I think the forward curve started to reflect that the sort of on paper level of reserve margin may not actually be what the actual reserve margins are under stress conditions. So we have seen the curves move up. As Kris noted they are higher than where they were in May of 2022 still backwardated, but they are higher. And I think that's a reflection of the supply-demand calculation that folks are revising for ERCOT. We are still majority open out in the 2026 time period. We have not provided a hedge position, but our anticipation at the moment is that Energy Harbor also has largely remained open in 2026. That's why we were comfortable saying we expect it to be around that $900 million range. And then we see upside from where we sit today for the rest of the Vistra stand-alone for 2026 relative to 2025.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Excellent. I appreciate it. Thanks for the time.\nJim Burke: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew -- I'm sorry Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead. \nAngie Storozynski: Good morning.\nJim Burke: Good morning, Angie\nAngie Storozynski: Good morning. I just had a question about market power issues if any and how those could prevent you from any additional transactions. So you were clearly surprised by the issue that came up with Energy Harbor at the FERC level. And again is there any lesson learned from it? Again do you think that you have grown to the point where you might encounter those issues in other PJM zones?\nJim Burke: Angie we -- I don't think we've really learned anything, specifically, from this other than deals get a lot of scrutiny. We actually have in all of our filings and all of the screens we've done that we need to do in order to make our filings complete we did not see and still don't believe that these assets are pivotal in that regard. So I still think we look at the situation in the exact same way as we did when we made the announcement. But we do want to move forward and get this deal done. So we made the modification that we made. Even in ERCOT, our market share -- because the markets continue to grow we're more like a 14%, 15% market share number so there's even headroom for us to do something in ERCOT and that's where we have the highest level of relative size compared to others in the market. So no, I think the field is still open, Angie. I think, we'd love to obviously get this done and move forward and we want to be constructive and work with the regulatory bodies to make sure that that happens in a way they're comfortable. But no, I don't think, there's anything to read through at this point. Of course, we haven't heard finally from FERC on this matter, but we feel very good about our position on this and we think we have headroom to do additional transactions in all the markets.\nAngie Storozynski: Great. And then you mentioned that you guys are waiting for some clarifications around the IRA, especially as those relate to the behind the meter installations. So I'm just wondering, if that's specifically referring to nuclear PTCs and how transactions with affiliates or non-affiliates will be counted towards the energy growth whatever receipts or margin that is currently in the role. Again, a little bit more clarity around what you're waiting for to see.\nJim Burke: Yeah. So, we obviously await guidance from the IRS on a couple of matters. The whole hydrogen topic and whether nuclear -- existing nuclear is going to qualify as a clean energy source whether it's behind the meter or what they call hydrogen by wire where it's more contracted through a PPA type structure we await clarification on that. We don't have growth built into our plans for that. We're not assuming an upside yet on our plans. But that's something Angie that we obviously await guidance on. I think the more immediate material guidance will be the nuclear PTC. And what is the revenue basis for determining whether an asset has earned some of the PTC, because the realized revenue rate is below the floor. We expect to get that guidance some point in the spring, but we're not sure how soon it could come. Obviously it goes into effect beginning of next year. Once again we've not assumed any PTC value in our long-range plan. But the way we think about it is the curves are right at and slightly above where we see the PTC floor. So it's unclear that it would apply at this moment. Now, there is indexing to that PTC. So if the curve stayed flat you might inflate your way into earning some of the PTC. It is still unclear about how affiliate transactions would work. But I feel like, there's been a commentary and some acknowledgment that some basis of spot whether it's real-time or day-ahead prices that there needs to be some reflection of what the market value is of the power and not just how the hedge transactions either were done at the portfolio level or at the asset level. I think that's a cleaner way to think about, it is to think about something in the real-time or day ahead market as a better benchmark for the value at the hub of the power. But again, we await that guidance. It's not baked into the plan. And I think it provides some downside protection. We're not 100% sure how much yet. But since we still have the upside of where the curves could go for the nuclear assets whether it's Texas or Pennsylvania Ohio, we view it as a real opportunity that the IRA provides. We just don't have clarity on the size of that opportunity at this point.\nAngie Storozynski: Great. And if I could ask one last one. So there's some additional media scrutiny around the supply of nuclear fuel and the reliance on Russia here. I remember that, you mentioned that Energy Harbor is well hedged for nuclear fuel. But given that, you are doubling down on nuclear power, I'm just wondering if you have a way to manage the Russia risk, either direct or indirect exposure to 10x especially\u2026\nJim Burke: Yeah, Angie, good question. It is something that the whole industry is paying attention to, because it can affect prices for domestic and more global sources beyond Russia as a source. So it's got implications whether you're sourcing directly from Russia or not. We have increased some of our nuclear fuel purchases. We've done that as Vistra. And we have done that both for our own needs, but also in anticipation of closing this transaction. So I feel very good about our financial and our physical supply with or without any Russian exposure over the next several years. And we feel that we're in good shape from a Vistra standalone actually for the next four to five years. But from a combined basis since we don't have all the detail beyond the next couple of years at this point from Energy Harbor, I think our fleet-wide purchases will actually help bridge, anything we'll see on a combined basis. But we have our -- we started working this issue. We started working even before we made an announcement about Energy Harbor, because obviously this conflict dates back in time. But I think we have done a very nice job. The team has done a nice job not only hedging for the physical part, but financially hedging curves are up for nuclear fuel. There's no doubt. You'll see nuclear fuel quotes in the $9 to $10 a megawatt hour kind of raise that's kind of an all-in value. We're still -- and I mentioned we're -- historically, we were closer to $5, trending up to $6 for Vistra standalone through 2026. That's still where we are. We don't have all the details on the Energy Harbor cost per -- I know they reset some of theirs early on as they did their restructuring, but we could have some exposure towards the back-end of a five-year planning horizon on price, just because the curves have moved up. But there's also a discussion about domestic sources and incentivizing additional supply, non-Russian that may come into play towards the back-end of our planning horizon. But I think we've substantially de-risked physically and financially there, Angie.\nAngie Storozynski: Great. Thank you.\nJim Burke: Thanks Angie\nOperator: Thank you. The final question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey. Good morning, Jim. Thanks for taking my questions. Hey, Jim just a more pointed question on the capital allocation and I appreciate you're going to go to the Board and we'll have a plan here in the first half of next year. But given the move in the stock and I asked you this on the last call as well, do you kind of still view that the security is undervalued here as we think about buybacks prospectively beyond 2024?\nJim Burke: Yeah. Durgesh, it's always difficult for management teams to predict where things will go. But yes, if you look at the multiples and ours now raised EBITDA guidance levels and our expected free cash flow generation, I think the multiples are just staying where they've been. And we're just reflecting a much stronger business profile. I think you can obviously make your case as to what's the right multiple to put on the business. I think there's been a view that the free cash flow yields need to be 20-plus percent in order to compensate for the risk of being in the business. I think our integrated model has shown a real stability to the business model. And we've seen various weather conditions, pricing conditions play out over the course of this year. And I think our team has managed through that exceedingly well and we've raised the out year. So I know Kris put in more of an exclamation point on this on the last call and I'd love to be interested to see if his view has changed, but I'm pretty sure it hasn't. But I'd like to let him close on this, because I want to make sure you guys know we're sticking with these four core principles.\nKris Moldovan: Yeah. Durgesh, I'll just point out obviously as you can see by the pace of our buybacks, we've actually picked up the pace in the third and fourth quarter. And as Jim mentioned as we look forward and we still have to get with the Board and talk about a comprehensive plan. But as Jim mentioned our intention would be to maintain the pace that we set this year and potentially look to see whether it should stay that same on same pace going forward or whether it should be increased. So we still feel good about the prices at which we're buying our stock today.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. That's perfectly clear guys. Thank you both. And then just, can I go back to the 16%, I think that was the number, one-six, of customer count growth in the retail segment. Can you just provide a little bit more color? Is that predominantly ERCOT? And then just for us to digest that what's like a five-year average, so we can see how strong this quarter was really?\nScott Hudson: Yeah, I can take that. This is Scott Hudson. The number that was referenced is in the appendix slide in the materials, but it's volumetric growth in our C&I market business. And we've seen a lot of success in that business both in ERCOT and in the Midwest Northeast markets through these times of volatility. I think what you find is that larger sophisticated customers want to work with players of scale, because we can structure a lot of complex products whether those be indexed, fixed, stability and pass through, new charges in the ERCOT markets, we see a shift of customers to the larger players in this particular environment.\nJim Burke: Yeah, Durgesh. I think Scott -- we had residential growth, but the 16% was a business is a volumetric growth. And so -- but both businesses grew and they grew their business not only in Texas, but outside of Texas. So it was really strong performance for the business to fundamentally grow in a very dynamic power market.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thanks. Appreciate the color guys. Thank you.\nJim Burke: Thanks, Durgesh.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Jim Burke for closing remarks.\nJim Burke: Yes. I want to close by thanking the men and women of Vistra for their hard work and for delivering an exceptional quarter for our customers and the communities we serve. We appreciate your interest in Vistra. And as you saw in our presentation, we have a lot to still accomplish and layouts and we look forward to laying that out for you and speaking to you again soon. Hopefully after we have closed here on the Energy Harbor acquisition and we wish you all a great morning. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Kris Moldovan",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 11, Vistra's performance in Q3 2023 was a reflection of available opportunities and outstanding execution throughout the country by both our Generation and Retail segments. Generation segment exhibited the benefits of maintaining a diverse, flexible and durable fleet of assets with the team delivering strong results in both ERCOT, where third quarter temperatures were on average the hottest on record and outside of ERCOT where temperatures were milder. Notably, the $1.44 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations delivered by the Generation segment, in Q3 2023, was almost $400 million higher than the same quarter last year. Moving to the Retail segment. Despite the challenges of high loads and prices in ERCOT in Q3, the Retail team delivered outstanding results for the quarter by focusing on customer counts and margins and consistently optimizing its supply position throughout the quarter. Although Retail is not typically expected to contribute much adjusted EBITDA, if any, in the summer months when prices are higher, the team was able to deliver $173 million in Q3 this year. Looking at year-to-date, each of the Generation and Retail segments are outperforming as compared to last year, with Vistra earning over $800 million more in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA through the third quarter of this year, as compared to the same period in 2022. We are proud of the team's execution thus far this year. And we are looking forward to finishing the year strong. Turning to Slide 12. We provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan. As of November 2nd, we had executed approximately $3.26 billion of share repurchases, leading to an approximately 26% reduction in the number of shares that were outstanding in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $1 billion of the total $4.25 billion authorization by year-end 2024. However, as Jim noted, we do expect to review our capital available for allocation, shortly after we close the Energy Harbor acquisition and would expect to announce a new comprehensive capital allocation plan in the first half of 2024. Moving to our dividend program. We announced last week a fourth quarter 2023 common stock dividend of $0.213 per share, which represents a substantial growth of 42% over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 when our capital allocation plan was first established. This growth highlights the significant returns available to our shareholders, as we reduce share count while paying a constant quarterly dividend amount. Turning to the balance sheet. In light of the results achieved in the third quarter, culminating an updated 2023 guidance ranges Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits significantly below three times. While net debt will increase upon closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, we currently expect our net leverage ratio to be below three times on a pro forma basis in 2024. Finally, in addition to the transformation we are achieving with the Energy Harbor acquisition, the team has been busy with development and pre-construction activity this year at our three largest solar and energy storage developments at our former Illinois coal plant sites, for which we now anticipate construction to begin next spring. Despite some headwinds in this higher cost and interest rate environment, these projects continue to comfortably exceed our targeted return thresholds. As we've stated before, we believe in a responsible energy transition that targets disciplined capital outlays for strategic projects and the zero carbon generation growth we will achieve with these three coal to solar sites are reflective of that core principle. Touching quickly on Slide 13, as we have done in prior quarters, we have provided an update on the out-year forward price curves as of November 2. While the ERCOT forward price curve continues to reflect some backwardation, the prices still remain higher than the April 29, 2022 curves, when we first spoke to you about increased EBITDA earnings potential in the out years. The curves and sparks are holding together well and support our initiated 2024 guidance ranges. Those curves together with the continued execution of our comprehensive hedging program provide us confidence in an adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations midpoint opportunity for 2025 in the range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. To wrap up, Slide 14 provides some additional breakdown of our 2024 initiated guidance ranges including midpoint expectations among the current business segments. As we have discussed previously, the acquisition of Energy Harbor will accelerate the transformation of our company and we expect it to alter the way we analyze our business results. Accordingly, after we closed the transaction, we expect to re-segment our businesses. While we will have more say on that after closing, we do expect to provide you with more visibility into our nuclear and renewable businesses. I want to reiterate Jim's comments. We are extremely proud of the collaborative work and performance of each of our generation retail and commercial teams. We have great line of sight to keep that momentum going for the foreseeable future. And we will keep striving to meet the expectations of our customers and our communities to keep the lights on in an affordable and reliable manner in markets in which we operate. And at the same time, we will manage the company in a cost-efficient and strategic manner to continue producing adjusted free cash flow yields that we are translating directly into significant returns for our shareholders. I know I speak on behalf of all of our employees and partners, when I say that we are striving to end 2023 on a strong note and to execute against our targets for 2024. With that operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. Yes, Michael I think you hit it. There are a couple of factors. For 2023 we did plan for some financing that would have some interest that would hit into 2023. And those were -- we didn't execute a financing until later in the year and the first interest payment on that financing will be next year. So, we actually -- it's a little bit counterintuitive but versus our plan from the start of the year we're in a benefit position on interest for 2023. And then you're right, 2024, the number that you're seeing here does take into account the interest expense on the debt that we raised for Energy Harbor and that we're holding right now. And as you noted, we don't have any contribution from Energy Harbor results. Yeah. Durgesh, I'll just point out obviously as you can see by the pace of our buybacks, we've actually picked up the pace in the third and fourth quarter. And as Jim mentioned as we look forward and we still have to get with the Board and talk about a comprehensive plan. But as Jim mentioned our intention would be to maintain the pace that we set this year and potentially look to see whether it should stay that same on same pace going forward or whether it should be increased. So we still feel good about the prices at which we're buying our stock today."

            "content": "Thank you, Meagan. Good morning, and I appreciate all of you for taking the time to join our third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am proud to deliver our third quarter results this morning, which was a very successful quarter for all facets of the business. We'll start this morning on Slide 5. I'll speak to this quarter's operational and financial performance in more detail in a moment, but notably, this quarter's adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations of approximately $1.6 billion underscored Vistra's capability of achieving consistently strong earnings through its integrated business model, with excellent operational performance by each of our generation retail and commercial teams and a variety of pricing and weather environments. In the prior two quarters, we experienced average power prices clearing lower than our realized hedge prices, which highlighted the significant downside risk protection to our earnings at our comprehensive hedging strategy provides. This quarter that scenario held in the markets outside of ERCOT were milder weather kept prices lower. In these markets, we were able to capitalize on our dynamic position management of our hedged portfolio to capture significant earnings in our generation segment. We saw this paradigm flip in the ERCOT market and while we were significantly hedged, we did have some open length and the generation fleet's operating flexibility was optimized by our integrated teams to respond to higher market prices, while keeping the lights and much needed air conditioning on at competitive prices for our customers throughout the markets we serve. With each of our four strategic priorities, our aim is to challenge ourselves with high performance goals and then consistently deliver. To that end this quarter, you saw us continue to advance our other three strategic priorities as well, as we focus on a strong balance sheet, our capital return program and our energy transition goals. As of November 2, we've now returned over $3.785 billion of capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and our dividend program, since the capital allocation was first announced in November of 2021. After we close Energy Harbor acquisition and develop a long-range plan for the combined company, we will work with our Board on a new multi-year capital allocation plan and expect to disclose the specifics of that plan in the first half of 2024. In the meantime, we continue to opportunistically invest in renewables and energy storage growth, including our expectation that we will begin construction in spring of 2024 on our three largest solar and energy storage developments located at our former Illinois Coal plant sites while maintaining our sub-three times leverage ratio. I want to move now to slide 6 to discuss our third quarter operational performance. This past quarter, we saw unprecedented heat and ERCOT. It was the highest third quarter on record even beating the record-setting heat of 2011. Temperatures in Texas were six degrees above normal in August and early September frequently topping 105 degrees in Dallas and over 100 degrees in Houston and San Antonio. Cooling degree days were 23% above the 30-year normal for the June through September comparable time period and ERCOT set a new peak demand 10 different times this summer. On August 10, ERCOT experienced its all-time record peak load of over 85,000 megawatts. It was vital for our generation team to keep the plants running in these extreme conditions to ensure that people of Texas could continue to live and work in healthy and comfortable environment. In ERCOT, the solar generation ramp down hours of around 6 to 8 p.m., have proven to be a critical time period for the grid. It is still very hot during those times with strong customer energy demand but it is also the time period where we see solar start to ramp down and at times the wind may not make up the difference especially in August. The ERCOT grid is operationally complex having to predict the availability of not only dispatchable resources but also intermittent resources such as solar and wind, limited duration energy storage and demand response activities. As the generation mix of intermittent resources increases, ERCOT needs more reserves as a backstop to ensure there is adequate generation to cover demand and avoid emergency conditions. In these scenarios, you see flexible generation fleets like ours ramping to meet as much of this demand as possible. And that is exactly what we did, exceeding 97% commercial availability on average during those critical hours. During these tough weather seasons, our number one priority is ensuring our customers can consistently access competitively priced power to maintain their quality of life and keep the economy strong. That's where our retail business excelled. This summer's marketing campaigns featured several differentiated products tailored to our customers' needs, including a seasonal discount product that helps customers manage the size of their electricity bill through the higher usage summer months. Our customer-focused multi-brand and marketing channel strategy and responsive service, allowed us to grow our ERCOT residential customer counts over the prior quarter. In addition, our business market segment grew customer volume 16% year-over-year as strong margins. While the retail and generation teams stood ready to meet these demands for our customers and the people we serve, our commercial team optimized our financial position to create significant value for our shareholders. Specifically, in August, the ERCOT market saw average real-time pricing around $196 with 43 hours in August clearing over $1,000. And during those critical hours at 6:00 to 8:00 PM in August, we saw prices clear on average around $843. Leveraging customer usage insights and our generation fleets strong commercial availability, our commercial team optimized and managed our risk position to create significant value on our open positions. The commercial team further set us up for success in our markets outside of ERCOT where the weather was milder, strategically managing our positions and flexing our generation output to optimize our hedge positions and achieve strong results for the quarter. We see this trend of new peak demand records at ERCOT continuing for the foreseeable planning horizon, demand that we believe our retail products are designed to attract and our diverse and flexible generation fleet is uniquely positioned to serve. Moving now to slide 7. Again I am proud of the team's exceptional, tightly coordinated performance this quarter that helped Vistra achieve its $1.613 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Not only did the retail team grow residential customer accounts, TXU Energy maintained the PUC of Texas five-star rating, extending its streak to 12 straight months. Our ERCOT fleet delivered 2.5 terawatt hours more than any other quarter's output in at least the past 10 years, a 10% increase over the next highest quarterly generation output achieved in the third quarter of 2019. It was a notable feat that when paired with a strong performance by the commercial team to adapt to a variety of weather conditions created significant value across all of our markets. With the important summer months behind us and only two months left in the year, today we are raising and narrowing the guidance range we announced last quarter from $3.6 billion to $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations to now $3.95 billion to $4.1 billion. We are similarly increasing and narrowing the range of adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations to a new range of $2.35 billion to $2.5 billion. Turning now to slide 8. We introduced 2024 guidance ranges for Vistra stand-alone without including any Energy Harbor contributions. We are forecasting adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations in the range of $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion and adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations in the range of $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion. Notably our ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint for 2024 of $3.9 billion is higher than the midpoint opportunities we previewed on our most recent earnings call in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. We are confident in our forecast as we expect consistent earnings from our retail business paired with expected strong performances from our reliable, diverse and flexible generation fleet that stands ready to deliver in a variety of economic and weather conditions just as it has this year. Of course, we will update our guidance ranges to include Energy Harbor performance expectations after we close the acquisition. Speaking of the Energy Harbor acquisition slide 9 provides an update on the status of the transaction. Since we last spoke, we have received approval from the NRC in September and we declared substantial compliance with the DOJ's second request on August 31st. We have responded to all requests from FERC and that process is progressing. Given our commitment to sell the Richland/Stryker generation plants, which we believe eliminates any potential remaining concerns around market competition, we continue to target a closing before the end of the year. Our team has worked with the Energy Harbor team to prepare for a smooth integration. And we are prepared to close the transaction promptly after receiving approval from FERC. As noted before, we intend to provide combined Vistra and Energy Harbor forecast and guidance information, after we close the acquisition. But as shown on slide 9, we continue to expect the Energy Harbor business to deliver an average of approximately $750 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2024 and 2025 including the impact of the hedges and synergies with that number growing to approximately $900 million when considered on an open basis. I'll now turn the call over to Kris, to discuss our quarterly performance in more detail. Hey, good morning, Michael. Yes, Michael. We've noted the progress that we've made with this transaction. Originally we thought NRC would be the longer pole in the tent and we were pleased to get that approval a few months ago. Where we sit at the moment is we've got feedback from DOJ and we think we've addressed DOJ's concern. We expect to have addressed FERC's concern by selling the Richland/Stryker facility. We did not think it was a concern at the time we initiated the deal and we still don't believe that's a concern. But out of an abundance of caution we are making that move. We have obviously responded to all of their information requests and the interveners have done the same. So our anticipation is that FERC has all the information that they need. We've asked for a feedback by the middle of November. We feel confident that we'll get to something by the end of this year and that we target to -- we're planning and targeting to close by the end of this year. But I think it's just been a process Michael and it's been one that we've been obviously very responsive to and I think from a FERC standpoint they've got the information and they've got to do their due diligence, but there's been no new issues raised to us at this point and that's why we think we're going to get this done by year end. Yes, Michael, thank you for that. I'll start by saying that our results for this year which obviously we've continued to guide up as we've gone through the year. Most of that improvement is EBITDA-driven and we did a nice job operating in the third quarter with extreme opportunities with pricing and weather being coincident particularly in ERCOT. That EBITDA largely drops through to the bottom-line when we built the plan at the beginning of the year you wouldn't have expected the kind of weather conditions that actually played out. So that free cash flow in this near term obviously will fall through and you're seeing that improved conversion. We started the year with an expected lower conversion rate because we wouldn't have had this kind of EBITDA opportunity built into a more normal weather scenario. We actually talked about free cash flow conversion being a little bit lower in 2023 and 2024 when we set our plans and we talked about the capital required to run the units pulling in some of the long-term service agreement spend for CapEx was one of the main drivers. You'll see in the capacity factors that are in the back of the deck our units have been running really well but they've also been running hard. And so we'll spend some capital in 2024 and probably have to spend some capital in 2025 to make sure the fleet stays in tip top condition. And so I think the surprise was not where we see 24 playing out from a free cash flow conversion. We actually had some positive free cash flow conversion due to the EBITDA opportunities that came our way in 2023. As far as Energy Harbor interest and how we're thinking about that financing and its effect on our results in 2023 -- in 2024 I'll ask Kris to comment. Thank you, Michael. Julien, thank you for the question. Good morning. I appreciate the comprehensive question on capital allocation. I think it's several things. First of all, as asked earlier, we want to close this Energy Harbor acquisition get -- make sure we've got embedded fully a multiyear view of the potential for that business as well as the synergies that we're anticipating to be able to deliver over a multiyear basis. We also -- because we've raised the Vistra stand-alone guidance, we see more cash available for allocation. So, we want to put all of that together and go through that process of discussion obviously with our Board when we can have a comprehensive discussion about a number of things. We've mentioned some Vistra Zero opportunities in this deck that we will continue to execute on. The buyback program we've been executing actually slightly ahead of pace. We would anticipate that when we come back through the approval process with the Board, they'll remain supportive of the buyback program potentially at the current or even a potential higher pacing than where we've been executing. We did not feel like going out too far at this point given that we need to close the acquisition and put the full plan together. We didn't feel just highlighting one element of a buyback amount in 2025 or 2026 was appropriate at this point, but our commitment to our four strategic priorities and I think the execution against those has been on track if not exceeded and I would expect that to continue. As far as growth vectors, there are a lot of things that the future holds that are still being sorted out particularly with the Inflation Reduction Act. And are there going to be opportunities here to utilize behind-the-meter opportunity some of the hydrogen opportunities, I think just from our standpoint we still own nearly 60 sites worth of land and interconnect. So, we've got plenty of opportunities to still develop a number of avenues of our business from a growth strategy, but they need to meet our return requirements. And I think that's the discipline we wanted to continue to demonstrate through this presentation and why we want to come back with a comprehensive capital allocation plan is, we have to look at all of the options on the table, and look at the best ones, and not just the ones that we've been executing on to this point. But I see us remaining focused on the four core principles, and I think that's worked well. I think our investors understand our mindset around these, and we look forward to hopefully given another set of opportunity for our investors to see how we'll create value once we close the Energy Harbor acquisition.\nQ \u2013 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. And just speaking of which, right I mean obviously, the 2024 guidance today is not apples-to-apples with maybe what Street is \"using\" out there. I mean any chance that you could give us a little bit of a sense of what the EH impact is mark-to-market today even in a ballpark, sense to try to kind of square your guidance? I think Julien, it is a little bit from a timing standpoint, an apple and an orange, but I do think you can take a couple of pieces and add them together. So if you look at our stand-alone guidance for next year, we're looking at a midpoint of $3.9 billion. And then we unpacked the Energy Harbor 2024 2025 numbers, because we what we wanted to do we gave you an average last time of 750. Now we're unpacking it saying 700 for 2024. That's still using some data that we got originally, through our cases but we're tracking curves. We have a sense of things are about where they were at the time, we announced the deal from a power price standpoint. So there alone you're taking the 3.9 and the 700 here, you're getting to 4.6. We had been at a midpoint of 4.35, on average when we gave you that direction when we announced the deal. So, I think the two pieces just added together put us north of where we have been signaling the combined opportunity. And this still has the targeted synergy levels in here. I think we could potentially exceed those targeted synergy levels, but we need to get into the business fully have the details around that execution plan before, we would upsize anything there Julien. So, I do appreciate you calling out, because I think there's been some consensus that is included. Energy Harbor and some that has been stand-alone. Our stand-alone is well north of anything that we have signaled, at this point and we think our Energy Harbor at this point is on track. And when we get into it, I think we might be able to find some additional upside. But at this point, we're not reflecting that.\nQ \u2013 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: At least, on track with those synergies it seems. But thank you very much again for time, guys. Appreciate and I'll pass it. Thank you, Julien. Good morning, David.\nQ \u2013 David Arcaro: Could you comment on the retail trends that you're seeing, do you expect this retail strength to continue? And I guess looking into the 2024 guidance, you've got some solid growth that you're reflecting year-over-year in the Retail segment. Wondering if 2024, could be potentially considered kind of a new baseline, I guess for the performance of that segment? Yes, David I'll start off. I'd like Scott Hudson, our President of Retail to add some commentary. I think the business \u2013 obviously, we break our business apart, quite a bit. There's different geographies in the business. ERCOT has its own unique design. The other markets obviously, have a different one more with the TDU, the wires company doing the billing. Our business has a very heavy residential footprint from an earnings profile standpoint, but a very large-scale business and profitable business in the Commercial & Industrial segment. The business has performed better than we expected it to perform this year relative to plan. And next year is pretty flat to that. So I think it's actually more stable is how I would describe the retail business not a large growth assumption or a moonshot required for us to be delivering in our 2024 guidance. And the team has done a really nice job adapting to a variety of weather conditions extreme weather and ERCOT and actually milder than normal weather in most of the rest of the country. But I think the underlying trends are a function of the creative products and the marketing channels. I'd like Scott to comment on that. So, you get a feel beyond just the numbers of how the team actually executes dynamically to meet customer needs. And David the thing I would conclude on Scott's remarks, which we're spot on with how we think about the business is the customer could be put under a lot of pressure with volatile pricing. With the hedging strategies, which we've described before are pretty conservative about the way in which we procure to handle extreme weather. Our goal is to insulate the customer as much as possible from those kinds of bill shocks. That helps franchise value in the long run. It helps the customers sort of get through the seasonal events. But it does take resources to be -- to hedge at that level. It takes capital you have to post collateral at times. You have to be a little bit more conservative on how you think about some of your pricing structures. But I think it pays off in the long run. And that's why the business not only had a really strong financial quarter they grew accounts in the quarter. Growing accounts in the quarter as being one of the largest market share participants is not an easy thing to do. But if you're providing that stable value proposition to the customer, the customers do respond well. And I think that's where we shine better is when we've got this kind of volatility that's when the model I think really differentiates itself. David, we haven't put anything out specifically on retail, but we've given you a sense of where we see 2025 on a combined entity. But, yes, we see it staying fairly flat. And most of the delta that we'd expect to see if any in 2025 would be more driven by where the generation segment is. We're highly hedged in 2025, but we have to carry more open there. So you might see a little bit more variation there than we'd expect to see in retail. Sure. Yes. If you look at the curves David 2026 is looking stronger than 2025. That particularly has moved in the ERCOT region from the last time we spoke. In fact when we had our call in August it was August 9 and August 10 was the all-time peak in ERCOT. So we were busy and we talked about how we needed to make sure that we got through the summer. Most of the pricing volatility in ERCOT came in the back half of August. And I think the forward curve started to reflect that the sort of on paper level of reserve margin may not actually be what the actual reserve margins are under stress conditions. So we have seen the curves move up. As Kris noted they are higher than where they were in May of 2022 still backwardated, but they are higher. And I think that's a reflection of the supply-demand calculation that folks are revising for ERCOT. We are still majority open out in the 2026 time period. We have not provided a hedge position, but our anticipation at the moment is that Energy Harbor also has largely remained open in 2026. That's why we were comfortable saying we expect it to be around that $900 million range. And then we see upside from where we sit today for the rest of the Vistra stand-alone for 2026 relative to 2025. Thank you, David. Good morning, Angie Angie we -- I don't think we've really learned anything, specifically, from this other than deals get a lot of scrutiny. We actually have in all of our filings and all of the screens we've done that we need to do in order to make our filings complete we did not see and still don't believe that these assets are pivotal in that regard. So I still think we look at the situation in the exact same way as we did when we made the announcement. But we do want to move forward and get this deal done. So we made the modification that we made. Even in ERCOT, our market share -- because the markets continue to grow we're more like a 14%, 15% market share number so there's even headroom for us to do something in ERCOT and that's where we have the highest level of relative size compared to others in the market. So no, I think the field is still open, Angie. I think, we'd love to obviously get this done and move forward and we want to be constructive and work with the regulatory bodies to make sure that that happens in a way they're comfortable. But no, I don't think, there's anything to read through at this point. Of course, we haven't heard finally from FERC on this matter, but we feel very good about our position on this and we think we have headroom to do additional transactions in all the markets. Yeah. So, we obviously await guidance from the IRS on a couple of matters. The whole hydrogen topic and whether nuclear -- existing nuclear is going to qualify as a clean energy source whether it's behind the meter or what they call hydrogen by wire where it's more contracted through a PPA type structure we await clarification on that. We don't have growth built into our plans for that. We're not assuming an upside yet on our plans. But that's something Angie that we obviously await guidance on. I think the more immediate material guidance will be the nuclear PTC. And what is the revenue basis for determining whether an asset has earned some of the PTC, because the realized revenue rate is below the floor. We expect to get that guidance some point in the spring, but we're not sure how soon it could come. Obviously it goes into effect beginning of next year. Once again we've not assumed any PTC value in our long-range plan. But the way we think about it is the curves are right at and slightly above where we see the PTC floor. So it's unclear that it would apply at this moment. Now, there is indexing to that PTC. So if the curve stayed flat you might inflate your way into earning some of the PTC. It is still unclear about how affiliate transactions would work. But I feel like, there's been a commentary and some acknowledgment that some basis of spot whether it's real-time or day-ahead prices that there needs to be some reflection of what the market value is of the power and not just how the hedge transactions either were done at the portfolio level or at the asset level. I think that's a cleaner way to think about, it is to think about something in the real-time or day ahead market as a better benchmark for the value at the hub of the power. But again, we await that guidance. It's not baked into the plan. And I think it provides some downside protection. We're not 100% sure how much yet. But since we still have the upside of where the curves could go for the nuclear assets whether it's Texas or Pennsylvania Ohio, we view it as a real opportunity that the IRA provides. We just don't have clarity on the size of that opportunity at this point. Yeah, Angie, good question. It is something that the whole industry is paying attention to, because it can affect prices for domestic and more global sources beyond Russia as a source. So it's got implications whether you're sourcing directly from Russia or not. We have increased some of our nuclear fuel purchases. We've done that as Vistra. And we have done that both for our own needs, but also in anticipation of closing this transaction. So I feel very good about our financial and our physical supply with or without any Russian exposure over the next several years. And we feel that we're in good shape from a Vistra standalone actually for the next four to five years. But from a combined basis since we don't have all the detail beyond the next couple of years at this point from Energy Harbor, I think our fleet-wide purchases will actually help bridge, anything we'll see on a combined basis. But we have our -- we started working this issue. We started working even before we made an announcement about Energy Harbor, because obviously this conflict dates back in time. But I think we have done a very nice job. The team has done a nice job not only hedging for the physical part, but financially hedging curves are up for nuclear fuel. There's no doubt. You'll see nuclear fuel quotes in the $9 to $10 a megawatt hour kind of raise that's kind of an all-in value. We're still -- and I mentioned we're -- historically, we were closer to $5, trending up to $6 for Vistra standalone through 2026. That's still where we are. We don't have all the details on the Energy Harbor cost per -- I know they reset some of theirs early on as they did their restructuring, but we could have some exposure towards the back-end of a five-year planning horizon on price, just because the curves have moved up. But there's also a discussion about domestic sources and incentivizing additional supply, non-Russian that may come into play towards the back-end of our planning horizon. But I think we've substantially de-risked physically and financially there, Angie. Thanks Angie Yeah. Durgesh, it's always difficult for management teams to predict where things will go. But yes, if you look at the multiples and ours now raised EBITDA guidance levels and our expected free cash flow generation, I think the multiples are just staying where they've been. And we're just reflecting a much stronger business profile. I think you can obviously make your case as to what's the right multiple to put on the business. I think there's been a view that the free cash flow yields need to be 20-plus percent in order to compensate for the risk of being in the business. I think our integrated model has shown a real stability to the business model. And we've seen various weather conditions, pricing conditions play out over the course of this year. And I think our team has managed through that exceedingly well and we've raised the out year. So I know Kris put in more of an exclamation point on this on the last call and I'd love to be interested to see if his view has changed, but I'm pretty sure it hasn't. But I'd like to let him close on this, because I want to make sure you guys know we're sticking with these four core principles. Yeah, Durgesh. I think Scott -- we had residential growth, but the 16% was a business is a volumetric growth. And so -- but both businesses grew and they grew their business not only in Texas, but outside of Texas. So it was really strong performance for the business to fundamentally grow in a very dynamic power market. Thanks, Durgesh. Yes. I want to close by thanking the men and women of Vistra for their hard work and for delivering an exceptional quarter for our customers and the communities we serve. We appreciate your interest in Vistra. And as you saw in our presentation, we have a lot to still accomplish and layouts and we look forward to laying that out for you and speaking to you again soon. Hopefully after we have closed here on the Energy Harbor acquisition and we wish you all a great morning. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMeagan Horn : Good morning and thank you all for joining Vistra's investor webcast discussing our second quarter 2023 results. Today's discussion is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There you can also find copies of today's investor presentations and earnings release.  Leading the call today, are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer and Kris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary.  Our earnings release presentation and other matters discussed on our call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation all available in the Investor Relations section of Vistra's website.  Also today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explains the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures.  Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.\nJim Burke : Thank you, Megan. Good morning. And thank you all for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. The second quarter proved to be another strong one for the business as we delivered $1,008 million in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Typically, we do not formally adjust our guidance ranges until after we get through the critical summer months, but based on performance to-date and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are confident in our ability to deliver in the upper half of the guidance ranges introduced on the third quarter earnings call last year.  Accordingly, we are narrowing that original range which was $3.4 billion to $4 billion to a new range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA.  Looking beyond 2023, the market curves continued to support a strong consistent outlook as well. Our commercial team is working to strategically lock in these opportunities, employing comprehensive hedging strategies to provide better line of sight to our earnings over our planning horizon, which in turn allows us to plan for capital return to our shareholders that is consistent and predictable.  In addition, I'm proud of the great strides we're making in the expansion of Vistra zero-carbon generation portfolio with our 350-megawatt addition to the Moss Landing Energy Storage facility that came online this quarter.  I'll speak to that milestone momentarily, but first, I'd like to turn to Slide 5 where we once again highlight our four strategic priorities. I think it's important to continue to reiterate our focus on these priorities each quarter with some notable accomplishments, as I believe these are critical to long-term value creation. This quarter saw continued strong generation and commercial team execution combined with our retail business that continues to deliver strong counts and margin performance. This year is proving it can consistently deliver substantial and resilient earnings in a variety of power price and weather conditions.  Just as last quarter on average, we saw power prices this quarter clear lower than our realized hedge prices. This is highlighting the significant downside risk protection to our earnings that our comprehensive hedging strategy across the integrated business can and does consistently provide. These de-risks consistent earnings give Vista the confidence to announce aggressive shareholder return programs, and then stick with those programs and amounts equal to or higher than those originally announced.  I'll let Chris provide the detailed update on our capital allocation plan, but of the aggregate upsized $7.75 billion capital return plan we originally announced in November of 2021, we've already returned $3.35 billion through August 4, 2023, which is approximately $250 million ahead of the originally announced plan levels.  We regularly evaluate how best to bring value to our shareholders and we expect to continue buying back stock and paying dividends that grow each quarter, based on a reduced share count.  Our balance sheet strength remains a top of this as well. You saw this quarter that we structured a $450 million P-Cap transaction which is unique and allowing us to post-treasury securities as margin deposits, returning more cash to the balance sheet. We expect to utilize that cash plus the margin deposits that have been returned as expected, as our hedges have settled throughout this year to fund a significant portion of the purchase price we expect to pay in the fourth quarter for Energy Harbor, substantially reducing the amount of acquisition debt to be issued.  Finally, as it relates to our opportunities with the energy transition, in addition to the progress we are making on the Energy Harbor acquisition, which I'll speak to in a minute, I would like to turn to Slide 6 regarding our Moss Landing Facility. The Vistra team did an excellent job in bringing online an additional 350 megawatts to add to the existing 400 megawatts at our Moss Landing site in California, which is the largest energy storage facility of its kind in the world. This addition came online ahead of schedule and on budget despite a challenging supply chain environment and extreme rainfall. This is now a total of 750 megawatts of energy storage backed by contracted revenues through our PG&E Resource Adequacy Agreements.  Importantly, we continue to see additional opportunities to add batteries to this site in the future. The facility is located in the [Indiscernible] energy market, which is experiencing significantly higher gas price volatility, as well as the potential for scarcity pricing due to high demand and import competition from the neighbouringh balancing authorities.  These factors result in favorable conditions for the earnings outlook for a Moss Landing battery facility and our co-located combined cycle plant which has 1,020-megawatts of capacity. This is a tremendous site and a great example of our ability to invest in a discipline way in Vistra zero while also providing for the reliable and affordable energy customers need.  Moving to Slide 7, the $1,008 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA achieved this quarter was a result of strong performance by each of our generation retail and commercial teams with retail achieving attractive counts and margin performance and all customer categories and our generation team delivering commercial availability of approximately 95%. Our people working hard in this extended high yield environment, and they continue to perform extremely well.  When we originally announced 2023 guidance in the third quarter of last year, we estimated a range of $3.4 billion to $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. As mentioned earlier, we are confident in our ability to deliver in the upper half of that range, leading us to formally update our guidance to reflect the new range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations and a new range for adjusted free cash flow before growth. Of course, there was a lot of execution still to go in the balance of the year, and our people remain focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders.  Turning to Slide 8, I just wanted to reiterate that all three key agencies continue to work on the necessary approvals to close the Energy Harbor acquisition. We are working constructively with each agency and an all involved parties and as I mentioned before, we continue to anticipate a fourth quarter closing.  We believe Energy Harbor is a terrific transaction for district adding a substantial amount of nuclear generation with the support of the production tax credit. We continue to expect significant contributions from Energy Harbor, including the opportunities for synergies. I think back to the announcement of the Dynegy acquisition when we projected annual ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.8 billion. Through the hard work of the Vistra and Dynegy teams and including the acquisition and successful integration of Crius and Ambit, together with the expected closing of Energy Harbor later this year, it is exciting that we could see ongoing adjusted EBITDA on average in the '24 to '25 timeframe of $4.5 billion, including synergies and out year prospects potentially even higher.  Kris, I'll now turn the call over to you to discuss our quarterly performance in more detail.\nKris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Starting on Slide 10, Vistra delivered $1,008 million in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, including $510 million from generation and $498 million from retail. Generation's results were favorable compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher energy margin achieved through our comprehensive hedging strategy. And as we did last quarter, our ability to capture value by backing down generation in times when prices are below unit costs.  Retails results were also favorable as compared to the second quarter of 2022. While the segment was impacted by less favorable weather, this was more than offset by continued strong counts and margin performance. As I discussed last quarter or the entire year shaping that damping the first quarter's earnings contribution to the overall year was offset as expected in the second quarter.  Turning to Slide 11, as Jim mentioned, we have been consistently delivering on our capital allocation plan. As of August 4, we have executed approximately $2.9 billion of share repurchases since beginning the program in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $1.35 billion of the total $4.25 billion authorization by year-end 2024. Notably, our outstanding share count has been reduced to approximately 367.5 million shares as of August 4, an impressive approximately 24% reduction in the number of shares that were outstanding in November 2021. This meaningful and consistent share reduction has led to robust dividend growth.  For example, the recently approved third quarter 2023 common stock dividend of $0.206 per share represents an increase of approximately 12% per share, as compared to the dividend paid in the third quarter of 2022.  Finally, as Jim mentioned, we remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and a disciplined approach to growth. We have fully allocated the net proceeds from the December 2021 Green-preferred stock issuance and are now turning to securing non-recourse project or portfolio level financing to, among other things support the growth CapEx needs of the company. We anticipate launching the first such financing in the coming months.  To wrap up on Slide 12, we have provided an update on the out year forward price curves as of August 4. As you can see the forward continue to hold together well. Specifically, since our last call we've seen forward curves increase in ERCOT in '24 and '25, increasing our confidence in our ability to achieve the previously disclosed $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities in those years.  As a reminder, we are significantly hedged in years 2023 through 2025 approximately 86% on average of expected generation across all markets, with a balance of 2023 expected generation hedged at approximately 98% and 2024 expected generation hedged at approximately 95%.  Finally, Crius and Ambit [ph] continue to provide opportunities to lock in significant earnings, especially during times of scarcity. Our commercial team continues to work to de-risk these opportunities by executing on our multiyear comprehensive hedging strategy, which strategy continues to be supported by our standby liquidity facilities.  We are proud of the performance of our generation retail and commercial teams as far this year and are excited to continue our work towards executing against our remaining 2023 goals and long-term strategic priorities, as we translate that success and to shareholder returns. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our third quarter call.  With that operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nJim Burke : Hey, good morning, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning. So first up, I guess you're now obviously the third IPP to report stronger retail margins. Could you just unpack a little more what you saw this quarter, kind of within the strength as we're thinking about optimization versus actual margin expansion, and the degree to which I guess you guys see this as being durable? Thanks.\nJim Burke: Sure. Shar, I'm going to start. I'm actually going to have Scott Hudson to give a little bit of perspective on the market dynamics as well. You realized last year when we were in a climbing power environment, due to the conflict that we saw with Russia-Ukraine, and then the commodity curves moving up. So retailers in general, were climbing the hill in 2022. We started to see that obviously come off at the beginning of this year. And the team does a very nice job of looking at the multiyear nature of the contracts for large commercial, the 12-month to 24-month range for residential. And their objective, of course, is to have normalized margins. We tend to buy forward as a company, we try to normalize the experience for customers, because our experience has been, if you move the customers price too much, it's not the expectation that they had when they signed up with you.  So even on renewals, we're careful about how we manage this. So from a durability standpoint, the retail business has earned strong margins in follow years and in stable years. And I think as part of the brand power of the business, is that we're not selling an index type product that's just floating with a spot price, we're actually taking some of that predictability, risk by hedging forward and giving that benefit to the customer. So I feel very good about the durability.  And I would -- Scott, I'd let you to add about the market dynamics. \nScott Hudson : Sure. Shar thanks for the question. I would just add to what Jim said is that we've got multi-brands at play in the ERCOT markets, and each of those brands are designed to attract a different customer segment.  But in general in ERCOT, on the residential side transactions remain at historical levels. So there were a lot of moves and switches and opportunities to win customers in the market. This really reflects the health of the Texas market migrations to consumers to it. As Jim said, prices have come down materially compared to this time last year, and the number of offers in the market has increased as have the number of competitors, in these markets. So very robust.  But I think where, we're successful in both accounts in the margin side is the differentiation of our products and services across those brands. So our summer campaign, this summer features three distinct products, seasonal discount product to first to market time of use product and then also an electric vehicle product, which really is doing well on the gains and helping us mitigate losses as well.\nJim Burke: And I would add Shar that the annual view for retail that outlook has improved from when we originally set our guidance for 2023. As Kris noted, the Q1 to Q2 effect is more about the shaping of the cost of goods sold because retail will buy power, according to the shape by month for the year. So the winter costs are much higher than the spring, the summer costs are much higher than the fall and into December. So we see that retail profitability much higher in our results in 2Q and 4Q, and we see less from retail in 1Q and 3Q. So I was giving you the annual view as to how I think about the durability, but there is a quarter to quarter difference because of how we buy power for retail reflecting the shape of power costs. So I hope that helps.\nShar Pourreza: No, it does. And that's helpful. Thank you for that. And then just lastly, I don't want to push too far but such great color on '24 and '25. Can you just speak to how the EBITDA opportunity to look for '26 or at least the degree to which you've been able to hedge that far. And just maybe refresh us on the Energy Harbor EBITDA opportunity that far out? Are you still seeing things north of $900 million? Thank you, guys.\nJim Burke : Yeah. You bet. So Shar, we have obviously continued our progress of hedging. As we said, we would, we consistently look for opportunities to provide a predictable earnings stream. And so first of all on '24-'25, we feel good about where we are from a outlook standpoint for Vistra stand alone. And that's really the data that we are operating with here Shar. We don't have a view into updates regarding Energy Harbor, and how they look at the moment for '24-'25 because we're going through the regulatory process. And so the data, we have this more the data we had at the time of the announcement.  But our view is because we're obviously in the market, and we view the curves, is that we're set up well, for Vistra standalone for '24-'25. We still feel good about raising that range that we mentioned where it was originally 3.5 to 3.7 and now we're looking at 3.7-3.8. So I feel good about where we sit in terms of Vistra standalone.  Energy Harbor, we know that had some out of the money hedges at the time that we announced '24-'25. And so our view there was that on a combined basis, we were 4.35 or so on a combined basis recognizing they had some hedges that were out of the money. We believe that there's an opportunity for our business, because of our update that we gave, because we were at 3.6, when we gave you the update for Vistra standalone. If we're at 3.75 now for Vistra standalone, again, be in between 3.7-3.8. That puts the combined enterprise in that for 4.45 to 4.5 range. So $4.5 billion on average in that '24-'25 timeframe. '26, we're pretty open still. In fact, I would say, Steve Muscato is here -- when we look at the markets, we look for opportunities. But when we last talked to you, we were seeing curves in AD Hub, for instance, in PJM that were pretty attractive. They were in sort of the $50 range. Those have come off now to about $44 in that 2026 timeframe, very close to the acquisition case that we announced. So I think we're on track for that $900 million. The upside to that for that piece would need some support from the '26 curve because we've seen that move around from $45 up to the low-50s and back to that sort of 44% range.  And we're still pretty open. We assume they're still open. Again, we don't know what hedging they've done for the long term. But I think 900 is still a solid number for 2026 for Energy Harbor.  And in terms of our business, Vistra standalone we've seen PJM come off. We've seen ERCOT come up. And ERCOT has come up, and it's been attractive and Steve, I used and you shared some thoughts about how you have seen these markets unfold even in the last month or two.\nSteve Muscato : Sure. We've seen ERCOT because of the heat that we've been experiencing and the periodic bouts of scarcity that have been kind of a routine issue here in the last at least several weeks with the heat in Texas. It has rippled into the forward curves, and so fixed price is holding in there. So we're able to hedge some of our solid fuel free.  And we're also seeing sparks, to your point, Jim, expand as we move out into that period. And so we're opportunistically hedging ERCOT where available, as you can imagine, '26 is somewhat illiquid, but we are having some success open our retail and wholesale channels and increasing those hedge percentages when the opportunities present themselves.\nJim Burke : And of course, with the AD hub and with Energy Harbor, we have some PTC support ultimately, Shar, we don't view it as meaningful because it's kind of -- all the curves are close to at the money right now on that, but that's one of the reasons the deal was attractive as well was the support to the downside if we had it. So -- thank you, Steve, and Scott, for the context on that. Shar, thank you for the questions.\nShar Pourreza: Yeah, terrific, guys. Congrats and very good color. Appreciate it. \nJim Burke : Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Sullivan : Hey, good morning, everyone. And thanks for the color on those last couple of questions. Hey, Jim. Wanted to shift over to -- from the debt -- from the EBITDA side more to the debt side pro forma. I think, Jim, you were mentioning you did the PCAP and then you have some margin collateral posting coming back. Can you just give a better sense of like how much new debt you will ultimately have to issue and if that's changed from when you announced the deal and then what on a pro forma consolidated basis, where the debt is going from where you are today?\nJim Burke : Sure. Michael, I would say that the conditions, obviously, in terms of margin deposits and the return of cash has been pretty favorable this year. I'll turn it to Kris to talk about how that influences the way we think about financing Energy Harbor and the overall credit metrics and targets that we're looking at.\nKris Moldovan : Yeah. Thanks, Michael, for the question. I'll put it into two buckets. As we -- when we announced the transaction, we had shown an assumption that we would use $600 million of cash and $2.6 billion of debt. And of course, we knew that there was going to be some more cash coming back from margin deposits or we expect it to come back for margin deposits, but we wanted to be conservative and make sure that we maintain sufficient liquidity. As we have settled those hedges throughout this year, that money has returned as expected. But that number also included plan to do some nonrecourse financing at Vistra Zero, which we still intend to do. So I would say, over the balance of the year, there's really two different things that we're looking at. There's the acquisition financing you can -- that has with the return of the margin deposits and the cash and the PCAPs transaction that has also returned cash. That has brought that $2.6 billion down to again, assuming we go to the next stage on the non-recourse financing, but that's probably brought that number down to $1 billion to $1.5 billion, somewhere in that range.  And then we still have nonrecourse financing in the works that was in our plan that was assumed in those numbers. And I think as we said in the remarks that we still expect to see a transaction in the coming months. And so that will fill in the rest. We still have enough commitment that we're still being conservative with our -- the financing commitment that we have in place. But -- that's really it.  And from a debt perspective, as we said, we're still targeting sub three times. At the closing, I think we continue to believe that we're going to be just above that. And as we look forward through a combination of debt repurchases and increasing EBITDA, we think we can get to that sub three times in the 2020 -- as early as 2024. Potentially leaking into the first part of 2025, but we don't see there being a long wait for us to get to the target levels that we're looking at.\nMichael Sullivan : Okay. Thanks. I appreciate all the color there. And then maybe just on ERCOT looking forward here, obviously, been pretty hot down there. What are you seeing in terms of just the grid holding up for the rest of the summer? And then thoughts on potential new build response later this year around the referendum vote.\nJim Burke : Sure. Yeah, Michael, it's been a very active kind of last three weeks. I would say it's a daily area of focus Steve would say it's a minute-by-minute focus. And that's really because the grid, as you know, in Texas, it's been a robust, low growth market. And the additional resources that have been added over the last three to five years have largely been wind and solar. The solar move has been consequential 4,000 to 5,000 megawatts year-over-year. which is helping that evening period, and we're getting to the point where solar is filling in that six to eight-hour range fairly well, and we're all focused on the wins ability to pick up where solar left off at that sort of seven to eight hour and beyond. A couple of good points is that earlier in June, while wind overall was lower in third and second quarter this year in ERCOT than last year, at peak times during this evening hours, wind actually when the grid was at 80,000 megawatts or higher, wind actually performed relatively well in the early part of the summer. We didn't see much price formation. In July, late-July and early-August, we're starting to see that the wind in those periods of time is returning more to kind of normal expectations, and we're starting to see that tightness in those late evening hours. And of course, we're talking about the marginal resource of wind or solar. That assumes nuclear, coal, gas are all operating the way they need to be. And that's we sometimes lose focus on that because that's the majority of the grid. The units are running hard. There's no end in sight for this heat that we're in. And so -- the team is doing a terrific job keeping these units online.  And I would say, overall, the ERCOT grid and the operators have done a nice job keeping the grid supplied, but there's an asymmetric risk to the upside on prices when you look at how tight the grid actually is. And we're starting to see those forwards in '24-'25, I think, start to reflect that there actually is meaningful supply-demand tightening that's occurring in ERCOT. And as far as whether gas newbuild comes it's a three-year process for the most part from the time you get started. And the loan referendum is in November, the PCM, which was part of the House Bill 1500, the Sunset bill, it has a net billion dollar cap that was inserted as part of that legislation. It could be several years to there years before that could be implemented, the PCM. So there are a lot of variables that are moving at the moment that developers would have to get comfortable with in terms of are they seeing enough to build because the curves are still backwardated. Even though we're saying the curves have moved up in '24-'25 and we're working through it, ERCOT still has -- there's still an assumption in this market. It's going to get overbuilt or there's going to be a lot coming that's just going to be potentially supported by PTCs and create downward pressure on pricing.  So I think it remains to be seen what kind of queue there's going to be for gas-fired generation, but there clearly was support in this legislative session to try to keep existing thermal generation and try to incentivize new. Not all stakeholders agreed on what the right solution is to do that, but at least there's recognition that the thermal resources existing and new are important. And that was a good outcome. But there's still a lot of work to do with the P&C and ERCOT in various stakeholder groups to get this over the finish line.\nMichael Sullivan : Thanks so much. Appreciate it. \nJim Burke : Thanks, Michael. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey, good morning. Thank you very much for the time. Appreciate it. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on the conversation on the '24-'25, the 4.5 there. Can you elaborate a little bit on what the retail assumptions are there? I know Shar tried to get at this a little bit, but it seems like you're just collapsing the transaction in there. Ultimately come up with that new number in the mid-4s. How do you think about these other retail pieces there? And ultimately, just also what were you alluding to on '26? I know you said it was quite open. Just what does that transposed into '26 if you can start to go there just quickly in terms of the puts and takes?\nJim Burke : Sure. Well, if you look at our revised guidance for 2023 and you look at that sort of midpoint, if you take that and add the Energy Harbor numbers to it, that I'd shared with you for '24-'25, you're getting to that $4.5 billion number.  And what we've seen in our business model, Julian, is because of where we've hedged and how we've been able to hedge, the realized kind of margin expectations are pretty flat from this kind of '23-'24-'25 timeframe. And the split between retail and gen might vary a little bit, but not materially. And I think that's 1 of the durable parts about our model is. And we saw it last year. And we're going to see it a little bit this year is that you may see a little bit of movement between retail and gen based on market conditions.  But retail is very solid in this kind of $1 billion range over that horizon. And I would expect the difference being the wholesale to get to that 3.8. And that's actually, I think one of the things that we've been excited to share is that the business is stable doesn't mean we're not working hard every day to hold on to it. I don't want to make it sound like just because we've hedged it. It's going to be realized. We have to deliver every single day on the business. But the outlook is actually above where we were in May of last year when we announced it and stable. And we'll be adding Energy Harbor to it. And so that line of sight with those hedge percentages we feel really good about where we are in that '24-'25 timeframe. Certainly '26 is more open.  And as I mentioned earlier, ERCOT is looking favorable relative to the last time we talked. But PJM is down on fixed price power at this point in 2016, but then we also have some PTC support for that for the Energy Harbor length. It doesn't look like ERCOT would be in that PTC range right now because of where the curves have moved up to.  But we've got kind of geographic flexibility segment, flexibility in -- or I should say, diversification and how I think 2026 will play out.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. And if I can ask you to clarify your forward ERCOT expectations. I mean we've got a few different programs yet to be implemented, I suppose, is the procurement program with a certain level of subsidy baked in there coming, I suppose at some point, curious on your sense of timing on that for any real impact? And then related, we have other reserve programs yet to be fully implemented. I'd be curious on your initial assessment of some of these programs, like the dispatchable reserve strength?\nJim Burke : Sure. I'll start. I think by subsidy, I think you're referring maybe to the loan program and the grants that could be coming Julien?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Yeah.\nJim Burke : So yes, that -- obviously, the referendum is in November. The initial amount that was shared as part of the bill was $10 billion. The amount that has been provided for in the budget is $5 billion. And then the amount of the $5 billion that's going to be allocated to building new gas plants is unknown at this point. So let's say it's something in the $3 billion to $3.5 billion range potentially.  When we've looked at the math, the 3% interest on a 60% loan to value, it can move your returns a couple of points. So it is helpful, but it does not make up for potentially missing revenue in a backwardated market. And that gets to your other point, which is do these other programs, whether it's an ORDC bridge PCM being implemented, eCRS was just implemented. DRS will be implemented by the end of 2024, do those cumulatively add a recognition of reliability for the assets that Ken provided. And if so, can we get enough line of sight to build into that? And I think we don't know yet for us. I mean, we're still evaluating it. Steve, in terms of how the new ancillaries like eCRS and DRS, how you see that playing in Artic bridge be interested and share your thoughts on how you see the market adapting to these?\nSteve Muscato : Sure. I think let's start with eCRS because it's the latest and we've actually seen how it's been implemented. And they're putting it in when I say the ERCOT is dispatching it only when critically needed. And so, I think it's serving well from a reliability perspective in terms of keeping ERCOT out of an EEA situation. But one of the other things I've seen is it hasn't necessarily impacted price formation too much. So I really think it gets into how ERCOT handles these reserve products. If they handle them in the way that they're designed, which is really when the grid is approaching tight conditions, and it's not necessarily used to -- for price formation, which is what we're seeing so far.  When I see ECRS dispatch, it's been on the very hot days, at the peak hours when needed. And it hasn't been very price suppressive. So we think it's working the way it's intended. And we'll have to see on these new reserves that they're putting in. But to the extent they use them in the same way as ECRS, I think we're in the best of both words where we're avoiding what I'll call emergency conditions on the grid, but we're still seeing very solid price formation when it does get tight.\nJim Burke : And I think it's too early to call DRS at this point. I mean it's still early stage to think about that one. Julian. That was one of the ones that some certain stakeholders were pushing as kind of the market solution. And so I believe the P&C and ERCOT have enough tools that they can work with to try to build some incentives for existing and new assets to be recognized and rewarded for their reliability, including a firming requirement for assets that come on to the grid after January 1, '27. And that they have to effectively be able to backstop the expected generation that they are committing to.  Those were all the right, I think, concepts. It's just early stage for us to know at this point how that's going to affect prices.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Right. Net-net, though, there does seem to be some kind of timing discrepancy between when these reserve programs come in. And any ultimate effect of any kind of procurement program here?\nJim Burke : I think so. The procurement program or the loan program and grant program alone, like I said, is marginally it's beneficial but it does not solve the broader problem that we entered the session trying to solve. And I think that's why we ended up with a menu of things. And frankly, it's a ton of work for the Public Utility Commission in ERCOT to work through this. And they're going to have their plate more than full. I mean, there's real-time co-optimization that has to fit in there before even PCM.  So there is a lot still to, I think, figure out. And we'll obviously be active and work with the stakeholders involved to try to bring clarity to it. But yes, on a calendar basis, it's multiyear at this point.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith : Excellent, guys. Good luck. Thank you so much. Talk to you soon. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra : Hey, good morning, Jim. Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, good morning, Jim. Just on the hedges, I think you answered part of my question in your prepared remarks. But the '22 to '25 hedges stayed at 86% and no change since the Q1 update call. Is that just you willing to stay more open given the market conditions? You mentioned the ERCOT curves -- or is it just more normal course of business and you're going to opportunistically hedge more? Just any thoughts there?\nJim Burke : Yes, it's a very good question, Durgesh. I would say there's a combination of factors. One is we've actually added some length given that the curves have moved up. So that's a good thing. There's more hours in the money for the fleet. So that means there's actually more to hedge. That's ultimately a good thing. And so when you look at the percentage, it's not a static amount of generation. So that's 1 element.  The second element is that's as of 6/30 that we were giving you these percentages. We've continued to hedge since 6/30 particularly in the 2025 timeframe. I don't feel that where we sit working with our team that we feel '26 is at a place where you have to go lock it all in because of the dynamics we talked about earlier. We think there's still upside in some of these markets. And we feel good about the visibility we've given for '24-'25, and we've got time to work on '26.  So the curves, as I mentioned, in '26 for PJM had come down ERCOT has gone up, but not anything that we need to go rush out and move materially on '26 at this stage.\nDurgesh Chopra : How about just within that '23 to '25 period. I guess what the message here is that 86% should move higher as we get along here.\nJim Burke : It's already higher since 6/30 Durgesh. And so the '26 hasn't moved much, but we have moved up on '25 and we're nearly fully hedged obviously for '24. But these percentages do move because, again, being in the money means you have more hours to hedge because there's gross margin. So the hedge percentage could drop, but your earnings forecast could go up as a function of just simply looking at the opportunity set. So some of it is just the timing and the fact that these curves do move around.\nDurgesh Chopra : Understood. Thanks. And then, Jim, one of the questions we consistently get from investors. Obviously, as you look at the stock, right, I mean, since I believe you initiated this buyback program, it was Q3-Q4 '21 the stock was in mid-teens. You broke 30 today. Just your updated thoughts on capital allocation, share buyback versus growth opportunities. How are you thinking about all of that here as the stock hit $30 \nJim Burke : Sure. Well, Daesh, it is good to see that the stock has moved up. We view this as a long-term strategy when we initiated it, and we still feel that way.  If you look at the stock price move, and this is a very imprecise science, but a good portion of the move, you could explain by virtue of the reduction in the share count and not necessarily seeing the enterprise value move that materially. Now that's still a good thing for the existing shareholders, and it's an opportunity for existing shareholders that are effectively increasing their percentage of ownership in Vistra.  I also believe that since the May timeframe of last year and where we are today, we have materially improved the earnings outlook of the company, which in theory, would result potentially in a multiple expansion. And we really haven't seen that much of a multiple expansion. And I'm not here to argue what the right multiple actually is. But I still feel there's recognition that I believe the market will continue to see as we put, I call it points on the board, delivering on our scorecard and our results. And at some point in time, when folks are comfortable that the earnings power is sustainable for the -- in the duration of a horizon beyond even the two to three years we talk about you might actually see some multiple expansion. We're not really there yet. And so our capital allocation plan for the foreseeable future, and I would put that in partly the high-class problem if we have to revisit it. But we feel very good about the capital allocation plan. And we might lean in a little more aggressively on the pace of the buybacks if we continue to overperform and see where we are with our -- obviously, cash needs to do that, fund Energy Harbor, which is our focus is to get this transaction closed in the fourth quarter. And then we're being disciplined on the Vistra Zero projects. And when we're reflecting that. And we want our shareholders to be confident that we do things, and we do look at the buyback as an alternate use of capital relative to the growth options. So the growth options need to be attractive. And so we'll pace the Vistra Zero projects to make sure that we're hitting the best ones and not chasing just the renewable projects. And I like our portfolio there. And we mentioned MOS 350 was an excellent project to bring online and an excellent job by the team.  So capital allocation plan is intact. And we're excited to, I'd say, hit the gas pedal on the capital allocation plan because we think it's the right mix for our shareholders as well as our debt holders.\nSteve Muscato : I just -- I would just add, obviously, you're talking about, as you mentioned, $30. We do as you would expect, internally have our own valuation of what management and the team feels like the stock is worth. And I think, as Jim said, we're still comfortable buying and potentially leaning in at these prices. And so it gives you a feel for where we think fair value is. And we're not there yet.\nDurgesh Chopra : Got it. Thank you, both. And congrats on the solid execution here on several quarters. Thanks. \nJim Burke : Thanks, Durgesh. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro : Thanks so much good morning. \nJim Burke : Good morning, Dave. \nDavid Arcaro : Steve. I was wondering, I noticed a decline in the CapEx for 2023 for solar and storage development. Wondering what's driving that. And then similarly, just looking out to the development plan, some of the in-service dates moved out for several of the solar and storage development projects. Wondering if you could give some color around that dynamic.\nJim Burke : Yeah, absolutely. Those two are related, David. We have the Illinois coal to solar, we had the majority of that reduction that you see was some movement out of 2023 and -- and into '24-'25. We're still working the procurement cycle with working with vendors on EPC and obviously, the equipment. And we're still working that process in Illinois. So it's more just a deferral at this point for the coal to solar projects. And that was about two thirds of what was moving out.  The other is, as I mentioned on a couple of previous calls, on the ERCOT solar, we're starting to see the solar hours kind of cannibalize the solar hours. And so we'll move forward on solar projects with a PPA, but we're not going to move those in a merchant type model. And that really was the other part of what lowered the CapEx.  Now as I've mentioned as well, we own these projects, the pacing of these, a project may not be ripe now, could be ripe three years from now, depending on market conditions and depending on how some of these rules played out that we talked about on one of the earlier questions. But that is really a reduction at this point this year, that's a deferral on the coal to solar. But I would say in Texas Solar, but I would say next year, we're probably still in this kind of $600 million number. So we're not pushing number down this year to then take the next year number up fully. We're showing the discipline because the Texas piece, in particular is something that we want to keep a close eye on. So I think even for next year, you're going to see a development number for CapEx that's pretty close to this year.\nDavid Arcaro : Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And I guess just maybe following on to that, how do you think of if there's or now maybe this is a little bit separately. I imagine if that growth CapEx number goes down, that was going to be largely financed with non0recourse project financing anyway. \nSteve Muscato : That's correct. \nKris Moldovan: So we open up additional cash available for allocation at the overall Vistra entity?\nKris Moldovan : You have that right. As we look at this, the amount of price [Technical Difficulty].\nUnidentified Analyst: My question is it just like a structural change that we see in retail margins? Again, if only because of the higher cost of financing? Or is it just we are coming off from a really high price, power price environment? And there's some pricing arbitrage between where we were and what's the current costs to serve these retail contracts?\nJim Burke : Yes, there's a lot in your question, Angie. And I'll break it down I think into two big market distinctions. The ERCOT market is more of a scarcity-driven market. And we have seen in just the last two months, the volatility pickup and the cost that a retailer needs to be prepared to pay to insure against that volatility has moved up. So you had the whole energy complex move up in '22, then it started to come off earlier this year. Now we're having the actual scarcity of basically supply demand tightening and ERCOT. And we're starting to see the costs for swing, which is part of that full requirements, particularly for residential, that's very costly. Large commercial and industrial does not have as much of a swing aspect to its load profile. So we are a very residential, heavy retail book. We have a great LCI business, but we are dominated from an earnings standpoint by our presence in residential. So we manage that swing in the pricing for our customer. Scott Hudson has to provide for the fact that he's wearing full requirements risk and serving this load.  And we have the assets to back it up. And I think that's what's distinctive about our model is that we've got the base load the intermediate and the peakers, so that Steve Muscato and the team can fulfill. And so if there's any issue with that we get it just right on the quantity hedged, which hedging is always imperfect. We've got an opportunity between the retail and the gen side to balance each other out. And ERCOT where we've really seen that volatility.  In the other market, it's been more gas-driven. And we've seen a general downward slope in the gas curves and these other markets and retailers generally can expand margin in a declining gas and power cost environment. And they might see some compression in margins and are rising. And I think, some of the tailwind in 2023 in signing deals is based on the fact that if you signed deals in 2022, that were multiyear deals with large commercial, you might have had negative margins in the first year and 2022, because power costs were so high because you average the cost for the customer. And then you would have seen positive margins in the out years. That's normalized now.  You can now sign deals and see positive margins in '23-'24-'25. So that's part of the tailwind. But this is a cyclical business. And I think you've got to run it for the long-term. And you've got to set customer expectations around being predictable and not move them around too much, as I mentioned earlier.  So those are the two dynamics I see in the market. Scott, is there anything you'd like to add to that?\nScott Hudson : No, I think that's right, Jim. I think the most dramatic change that we've seen year-over-year is residential customers in the Midwest and Northeast, where it's a cyclic market. We just have an opportunity to bring on more customers, particularly digitally and online, because of where the price to compare is. At we still -- \nJim Burke : Price to compare is still much higher. \nScott Hudson : Much higher. \nJim Burke : And our power costs are lower. But I think, there was such an extreme last year that that'll stabilize overtime, but you really do have to think about these as very market specific. And then customer product and brand-specific segments.  Thank you. Thank you, Scott.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, and just one other question. So as we keep going back to the rising cost of financing, but also strengthening of your stock, even though there might be little to no margin expansion yet. If you were I mean -- if you were to do another M&A transaction, just talk to me -- talk me through the financing of any potential deal. Again given the rising cost of financing, you are seemingly that dedicated to share buybacks. So, again, I'm just debating if you are a sufficient scale have pro forma Energy Harbor and if there are additional economies of scale to be had both from an operational perspective and a financing perspective that you would benefit from basically adding one more generation portfolio.\nJim Burke : So, Angie thank you. Always looking ahead. We are clearly focused on Energy Harbor. And as Kris mentioned earlier, we've got some return of cash this year. So it can help change our what our financing needs are to close the Energy Harbor transaction.  We don't comment on any potential M&A, but I think we demonstrated that we keep an eye out and we have the right conversations to be aware of the opportunity set. And if there is an attractive one at the right price, we'd be in a position to move. But I've also said and I said it on our Vistra standalone case. We liked the Vistra standalone the case at the time we announced Energy Harbor. So we had to get comfortable to Energy Harbor would truly be accretive in a long-term good fit for our company. And we made that determination. And we're very excited about it. We would use a similar lens on anything else. And we still think the capital allocation plan, which we kept intact, through Energy Harbor. I think we still need to consider that in anything that we're doing that our shareholders have come to expect that capital allocation plan that will execute on it, increase any comments on the financing markets, and how we think about it. But that's sort of another step down the road, even from this Energy Harbor transaction.\nKris Moldovan: Yeah, Jim, I would just add As we have talked about, and as we have increased our forecasts for '24-'25 and as we see opportunities in 2026 one thing Angie, to note, and we'll have more to say on this after the Energy Harbor closing. But we still have capital to allocate even above and beyond the billion dollar -- the minimum billion dollars a year of share repurchases that we've talked about and the $300 million of dividends and getting our debt where we needed to get it to go in our renewables growth.  So even beyond that, we have a significant amount of cash. And so we'll continue to make decisions. And as I said, we'll have more to say on it coming up. But we'll continue to look at opportunities and that could be growth. There could be additional share repurchases. So, that would damp in any financing that we have. But we feel good about our ability to raise financing. We also have -- we have created a currency with the Vistra Vision equity. We're not looking to use more of that, but there could be a situation where that is available to the extent that it makes sense.  So we have a lot of options. And we'll continue to make sure that we are flexible as we go forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. Thanks. \nJim Burke : Thank you, Angie.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke, President and CEO for any closing remarks.\nJim Burke : Thank you again for joining us on this call and sorry if the call dropped and you had to get back on. But we really appreciate your interest in us and following how we're progressing. And we look forward to talking to you hopefully, if we see on the road before the next quarter. And wish you a great summer. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Sure. We've seen ERCOT because of the heat that we've been experiencing and the periodic bouts of scarcity that have been kind of a routine issue here in the last at least several weeks with the heat in Texas. It has rippled into the forward curves, and so fixed price is holding in there. So we're able to hedge some of our solid fuel free.  And we're also seeing sparks, to your point, Jim, expand as we move out into that period. And so we're opportunistically hedging ERCOT where available, as you can imagine, '26 is somewhat illiquid, but we are having some success open our retail and wholesale channels and increasing those hedge percentages when the opportunities present themselves. Sure. I think let's start with eCRS because it's the latest and we've actually seen how it's been implemented. And they're putting it in when I say the ERCOT is dispatching it only when critically needed. And so, I think it's serving well from a reliability perspective in terms of keeping ERCOT out of an EEA situation. But one of the other things I've seen is it hasn't necessarily impacted price formation too much. So I really think it gets into how ERCOT handles these reserve products. If they handle them in the way that they're designed, which is really when the grid is approaching tight conditions, and it's not necessarily used to -- for price formation, which is what we're seeing so far.  When I see ECRS dispatch, it's been on the very hot days, at the peak hours when needed. And it hasn't been very price suppressive. So we think it's working the way it's intended. And we'll have to see on these new reserves that they're putting in. But to the extent they use them in the same way as ECRS, I think we're in the best of both words where we're avoiding what I'll call emergency conditions on the grid, but we're still seeing very solid price formation when it does get tight. I just -- I would just add, obviously, you're talking about, as you mentioned, $30. We do as you would expect, internally have our own valuation of what management and the team feels like the stock is worth. And I think, as Jim said, we're still comfortable buying and potentially leaning in at these prices. And so it gives you a feel for where we think fair value is. And we're not there yet.

            "name": "Kris Moldovan",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Starting on Slide 10, Vistra delivered $1,008 million in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, including $510 million from generation and $498 million from retail. Generation's results were favorable compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to higher energy margin achieved through our comprehensive hedging strategy. And as we did last quarter, our ability to capture value by backing down generation in times when prices are below unit costs.  Retails results were also favorable as compared to the second quarter of 2022. While the segment was impacted by less favorable weather, this was more than offset by continued strong counts and margin performance. As I discussed last quarter or the entire year shaping that damping the first quarter's earnings contribution to the overall year was offset as expected in the second quarter.  Turning to Slide 11, as Jim mentioned, we have been consistently delivering on our capital allocation plan. As of August 4, we have executed approximately $2.9 billion of share repurchases since beginning the program in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $1.35 billion of the total $4.25 billion authorization by year-end 2024. Notably, our outstanding share count has been reduced to approximately 367.5 million shares as of August 4, an impressive approximately 24% reduction in the number of shares that were outstanding in November 2021. This meaningful and consistent share reduction has led to robust dividend growth.  For example, the recently approved third quarter 2023 common stock dividend of $0.206 per share represents an increase of approximately 12% per share, as compared to the dividend paid in the third quarter of 2022.  Finally, as Jim mentioned, we remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and a disciplined approach to growth. We have fully allocated the net proceeds from the December 2021 Green-preferred stock issuance and are now turning to securing non-recourse project or portfolio level financing to, among other things support the growth CapEx needs of the company. We anticipate launching the first such financing in the coming months.  To wrap up on Slide 12, we have provided an update on the out year forward price curves as of August 4. As you can see the forward continue to hold together well. Specifically, since our last call we've seen forward curves increase in ERCOT in '24 and '25, increasing our confidence in our ability to achieve the previously disclosed $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities in those years.  As a reminder, we are significantly hedged in years 2023 through 2025 approximately 86% on average of expected generation across all markets, with a balance of 2023 expected generation hedged at approximately 98% and 2024 expected generation hedged at approximately 95%.  Finally, Crius and Ambit [ph] continue to provide opportunities to lock in significant earnings, especially during times of scarcity. Our commercial team continues to work to de-risk these opportunities by executing on our multiyear comprehensive hedging strategy, which strategy continues to be supported by our standby liquidity facilities.  We are proud of the performance of our generation retail and commercial teams as far this year and are excited to continue our work towards executing against our remaining 2023 goals and long-term strategic priorities, as we translate that success and to shareholder returns. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our third quarter call.  With that operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. Yeah. Thanks, Michael, for the question. I'll put it into two buckets. As we -- when we announced the transaction, we had shown an assumption that we would use $600 million of cash and $2.6 billion of debt. And of course, we knew that there was going to be some more cash coming back from margin deposits or we expect it to come back for margin deposits, but we wanted to be conservative and make sure that we maintain sufficient liquidity. As we have settled those hedges throughout this year, that money has returned as expected. But that number also included plan to do some nonrecourse financing at Vistra Zero, which we still intend to do. So I would say, over the balance of the year, there's really two different things that we're looking at. There's the acquisition financing you can -- that has with the return of the margin deposits and the cash and the PCAPs transaction that has also returned cash. That has brought that $2.6 billion down to again, assuming we go to the next stage on the non-recourse financing, but that's probably brought that number down to $1 billion to $1.5 billion, somewhere in that range.  And then we still have nonrecourse financing in the works that was in our plan that was assumed in those numbers. And I think as we said in the remarks that we still expect to see a transaction in the coming months. And so that will fill in the rest. We still have enough commitment that we're still being conservative with our -- the financing commitment that we have in place. But -- that's really it.  And from a debt perspective, as we said, we're still targeting sub three times. At the closing, I think we continue to believe that we're going to be just above that. And as we look forward through a combination of debt repurchases and increasing EBITDA, we think we can get to that sub three times in the 2020 -- as early as 2024. Potentially leaking into the first part of 2025, but we don't see there being a long wait for us to get to the target levels that we're looking at. So we open up additional cash available for allocation at the overall Vistra entity? You have that right. As we look at this, the amount of price [Technical Difficulty]. Yeah, Jim, I would just add As we have talked about, and as we have increased our forecasts for '24-'25 and as we see opportunities in 2026 one thing Angie, to note, and we'll have more to say on this after the Energy Harbor closing. But we still have capital to allocate even above and beyond the billion dollar -- the minimum billion dollars a year of share repurchases that we've talked about and the $300 million of dividends and getting our debt where we needed to get it to go in our renewables growth.  So even beyond that, we have a significant amount of cash. And so we'll continue to make decisions. And as I said, we'll have more to say on it coming up. But we'll continue to look at opportunities and that could be growth. There could be additional share repurchases. So, that would damp in any financing that we have. But we feel good about our ability to raise financing. We also have -- we have created a currency with the Vistra Vision equity. We're not looking to use more of that, but there could be a situation where that is available to the extent that it makes sense.  So we have a lot of options.

            "name": "Scott Hudson",
            "content": "Sure. Shar thanks for the question. I would just add to what Jim said is that we've got multi-brands at play in the ERCOT markets, and each of those brands are designed to attract a different customer segment.  But in general in ERCOT, on the residential side transactions remain at historical levels. So there were a lot of moves and switches and opportunities to win customers in the market. This really reflects the health of the Texas market migrations to consumers to it. As Jim said, prices have come down materially compared to this time last year, and the number of offers in the market has increased as have the number of competitors, in these markets. So very robust.  But I think where, we're successful in both accounts in the margin side is the differentiation of our products and services across those brands. So our summer campaign, this summer features three distinct products, seasonal discount product to first to market time of use product and then also an electric vehicle product, which really is doing well on the gains and helping us mitigate losses as well. No, I think that's right, Jim. I think the most dramatic change that we've seen year-over-year is residential customers in the Midwest and Northeast, where it's a cyclic market. We just have an opportunity to bring on more customers, particularly digitally and online, because of where the price to compare is. At we still -- Much higher."

            "name": "Jim Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Megan. Good morning. And thank you all for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. The second quarter proved to be another strong one for the business as we delivered $1,008 million in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Typically, we do not formally adjust our guidance ranges until after we get through the critical summer months, but based on performance to-date and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are confident in our ability to deliver in the upper half of the guidance ranges introduced on the third quarter earnings call last year.  Accordingly, we are narrowing that original range which was $3.4 billion to $4 billion to a new range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA.  Looking beyond 2023, the market curves continued to support a strong consistent outlook as well. Our commercial team is working to strategically lock in these opportunities, employing comprehensive hedging strategies to provide better line of sight to our earnings over our planning horizon, which in turn allows us to plan for capital return to our shareholders that is consistent and predictable.  In addition, I'm proud of the great strides we're making in the expansion of Vistra zero-carbon generation portfolio with our 350-megawatt addition to the Moss Landing Energy Storage facility that came online this quarter.  I'll speak to that milestone momentarily, but first, I'd like to turn to Slide 5 where we once again highlight our four strategic priorities. I think it's important to continue to reiterate our focus on these priorities each quarter with some notable accomplishments, as I believe these are critical to long-term value creation. This quarter saw continued strong generation and commercial team execution combined with our retail business that continues to deliver strong counts and margin performance. This year is proving it can consistently deliver substantial and resilient earnings in a variety of power price and weather conditions.  Just as last quarter on average, we saw power prices this quarter clear lower than our realized hedge prices. This is highlighting the significant downside risk protection to our earnings that our comprehensive hedging strategy across the integrated business can and does consistently provide. These de-risks consistent earnings give Vista the confidence to announce aggressive shareholder return programs, and then stick with those programs and amounts equal to or higher than those originally announced.  I'll let Chris provide the detailed update on our capital allocation plan, but of the aggregate upsized $7.75 billion capital return plan we originally announced in November of 2021, we've already returned $3.35 billion through August 4, 2023, which is approximately $250 million ahead of the originally announced plan levels.  We regularly evaluate how best to bring value to our shareholders and we expect to continue buying back stock and paying dividends that grow each quarter, based on a reduced share count.  Our balance sheet strength remains a top of this as well. You saw this quarter that we structured a $450 million P-Cap transaction which is unique and allowing us to post-treasury securities as margin deposits, returning more cash to the balance sheet. We expect to utilize that cash plus the margin deposits that have been returned as expected, as our hedges have settled throughout this year to fund a significant portion of the purchase price we expect to pay in the fourth quarter for Energy Harbor, substantially reducing the amount of acquisition debt to be issued.  Finally, as it relates to our opportunities with the energy transition, in addition to the progress we are making on the Energy Harbor acquisition, which I'll speak to in a minute, I would like to turn to Slide 6 regarding our Moss Landing Facility. The Vistra team did an excellent job in bringing online an additional 350 megawatts to add to the existing 400 megawatts at our Moss Landing site in California, which is the largest energy storage facility of its kind in the world. This addition came online ahead of schedule and on budget despite a challenging supply chain environment and extreme rainfall. This is now a total of 750 megawatts of energy storage backed by contracted revenues through our PG&E Resource Adequacy Agreements.  Importantly, we continue to see additional opportunities to add batteries to this site in the future. The facility is located in the [Indiscernible] energy market, which is experiencing significantly higher gas price volatility, as well as the potential for scarcity pricing due to high demand and import competition from the neighbouringh balancing authorities.  These factors result in favorable conditions for the earnings outlook for a Moss Landing battery facility and our co-located combined cycle plant which has 1,020-megawatts of capacity. This is a tremendous site and a great example of our ability to invest in a discipline way in Vistra zero while also providing for the reliable and affordable energy customers need.  Moving to Slide 7, the $1,008 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA achieved this quarter was a result of strong performance by each of our generation retail and commercial teams with retail achieving attractive counts and margin performance and all customer categories and our generation team delivering commercial availability of approximately 95%. Our people working hard in this extended high yield environment, and they continue to perform extremely well.  When we originally announced 2023 guidance in the third quarter of last year, we estimated a range of $3.4 billion to $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations. As mentioned earlier, we are confident in our ability to deliver in the upper half of that range, leading us to formally update our guidance to reflect the new range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations and a new range for adjusted free cash flow before growth. Of course, there was a lot of execution still to go in the balance of the year, and our people remain focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders.  Turning to Slide 8, I just wanted to reiterate that all three key agencies continue to work on the necessary approvals to close the Energy Harbor acquisition. We are working constructively with each agency and an all involved parties and as I mentioned before, we continue to anticipate a fourth quarter closing.  We believe Energy Harbor is a terrific transaction for district adding a substantial amount of nuclear generation with the support of the production tax credit. We continue to expect significant contributions from Energy Harbor, including the opportunities for synergies. I think back to the announcement of the Dynegy acquisition when we projected annual ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.8 billion. Through the hard work of the Vistra and Dynegy teams and including the acquisition and successful integration of Crius and Ambit, together with the expected closing of Energy Harbor later this year, it is exciting that we could see ongoing adjusted EBITDA on average in the '24 to '25 timeframe of $4.5 billion, including synergies and out year prospects potentially even higher.  Kris, I'll now turn the call over to you to discuss our quarterly performance in more detail. Hey, good morning, Shar. Sure. Shar, I'm going to start. I'm actually going to have Scott Hudson to give a little bit of perspective on the market dynamics as well. You realized last year when we were in a climbing power environment, due to the conflict that we saw with Russia-Ukraine, and then the commodity curves moving up. So retailers in general, were climbing the hill in 2022. We started to see that obviously come off at the beginning of this year. And the team does a very nice job of looking at the multiyear nature of the contracts for large commercial, the 12-month to 24-month range for residential. And their objective, of course, is to have normalized margins. We tend to buy forward as a company, we try to normalize the experience for customers, because our experience has been, if you move the customers price too much, it's not the expectation that they had when they signed up with you.  So even on renewals, we're careful about how we manage this. So from a durability standpoint, the retail business has earned strong margins in follow years and in stable years. And I think as part of the brand power of the business, is that we're not selling an index type product that's just floating with a spot price, we're actually taking some of that predictability, risk by hedging forward and giving that benefit to the customer. So I feel very good about the durability.  And I would -- Scott, I'd let you to add about the market dynamics. And I would add Shar that the annual view for retail that outlook has improved from when we originally set our guidance for 2023. As Kris noted, the Q1 to Q2 effect is more about the shaping of the cost of goods sold because retail will buy power, according to the shape by month for the year. So the winter costs are much higher than the spring, the summer costs are much higher than the fall and into December. So we see that retail profitability much higher in our results in 2Q and 4Q, and we see less from retail in 1Q and 3Q. So I was giving you the annual view as to how I think about the durability, but there is a quarter to quarter difference because of how we buy power for retail reflecting the shape of power costs. So I hope that helps. Yeah. You bet. So Shar, we have obviously continued our progress of hedging. As we said, we would, we consistently look for opportunities to provide a predictable earnings stream. And so first of all on '24-'25, we feel good about where we are from a outlook standpoint for Vistra stand alone. And that's really the data that we are operating with here Shar. We don't have a view into updates regarding Energy Harbor, and how they look at the moment for '24-'25 because we're going through the regulatory process. And so the data, we have this more the data we had at the time of the announcement.  But our view is because we're obviously in the market, and we view the curves, is that we're set up well, for Vistra standalone for '24-'25. We still feel good about raising that range that we mentioned where it was originally 3.5 to 3.7 and now we're looking at 3.7-3.8. So I feel good about where we sit in terms of Vistra standalone.  Energy Harbor, we know that had some out of the money hedges at the time that we announced '24-'25. And so our view there was that on a combined basis, we were 4.35 or so on a combined basis recognizing they had some hedges that were out of the money. We believe that there's an opportunity for our business, because of our update that we gave, because we were at 3.6, when we gave you the update for Vistra standalone. If we're at 3.75 now for Vistra standalone, again, be in between 3.7-3.8. That puts the combined enterprise in that for 4.45 to 4.5 range. So $4.5 billion on average in that '24-'25 timeframe. '26, we're pretty open still. In fact, I would say, Steve Muscato is here -- when we look at the markets, we look for opportunities. But when we last talked to you, we were seeing curves in AD Hub, for instance, in PJM that were pretty attractive. They were in sort of the $50 range. Those have come off now to about $44 in that 2026 timeframe, very close to the acquisition case that we announced. So I think we're on track for that $900 million. The upside to that for that piece would need some support from the '26 curve because we've seen that move around from $45 up to the low-50s and back to that sort of 44% range.  And we're still pretty open. We assume they're still open. Again, we don't know what hedging they've done for the long term. But I think 900 is still a solid number for 2026 for Energy Harbor.  And in terms of our business, Vistra standalone we've seen PJM come off. We've seen ERCOT come up. And ERCOT has come up, and it's been attractive and Steve, I used and you shared some thoughts about how you have seen these markets unfold even in the last month or two. And of course, with the AD hub and with Energy Harbor, we have some PTC support ultimately, Shar, we don't view it as meaningful because it's kind of -- all the curves are close to at the money right now on that, but that's one of the reasons the deal was attractive as well was the support to the downside if we had it. So -- thank you, Steve, and Scott, for the context on that. Shar, thank you for the questions. Thank you. Sure. Michael, I would say that the conditions, obviously, in terms of margin deposits and the return of cash has been pretty favorable this year. I'll turn it to Kris to talk about how that influences the way we think about financing Energy Harbor and the overall credit metrics and targets that we're looking at. Sure. Yeah, Michael, it's been a very active kind of last three weeks. I would say it's a daily area of focus Steve would say it's a minute-by-minute focus. And that's really because the grid, as you know, in Texas, it's been a robust, low growth market. And the additional resources that have been added over the last three to five years have largely been wind and solar. The solar move has been consequential 4,000 to 5,000 megawatts year-over-year. which is helping that evening period, and we're getting to the point where solar is filling in that six to eight-hour range fairly well, and we're all focused on the wins ability to pick up where solar left off at that sort of seven to eight hour and beyond. A couple of good points is that earlier in June, while wind overall was lower in third and second quarter this year in ERCOT than last year, at peak times during this evening hours, wind actually when the grid was at 80,000 megawatts or higher, wind actually performed relatively well in the early part of the summer. We didn't see much price formation. In July, late-July and early-August, we're starting to see that the wind in those periods of time is returning more to kind of normal expectations, and we're starting to see that tightness in those late evening hours. And of course, we're talking about the marginal resource of wind or solar. That assumes nuclear, coal, gas are all operating the way they need to be. And that's we sometimes lose focus on that because that's the majority of the grid. The units are running hard. There's no end in sight for this heat that we're in. And so -- the team is doing a terrific job keeping these units online.  And I would say, overall, the ERCOT grid and the operators have done a nice job keeping the grid supplied, but there's an asymmetric risk to the upside on prices when you look at how tight the grid actually is. And we're starting to see those forwards in '24-'25, I think, start to reflect that there actually is meaningful supply-demand tightening that's occurring in ERCOT. And as far as whether gas newbuild comes it's a three-year process for the most part from the time you get started. And the loan referendum is in November, the PCM, which was part of the House Bill 1500, the Sunset bill, it has a net billion dollar cap that was inserted as part of that legislation. It could be several years to there years before that could be implemented, the PCM. So there are a lot of variables that are moving at the moment that developers would have to get comfortable with in terms of are they seeing enough to build because the curves are still backwardated. Even though we're saying the curves have moved up in '24-'25 and we're working through it, ERCOT still has -- there's still an assumption in this market. It's going to get overbuilt or there's going to be a lot coming that's just going to be potentially supported by PTCs and create downward pressure on pricing.  So I think it remains to be seen what kind of queue there's going to be for gas-fired generation, but there clearly was support in this legislative session to try to keep existing thermal generation and try to incentivize new. Not all stakeholders agreed on what the right solution is to do that, but at least there's recognition that the thermal resources existing and new are important. And that was a good outcome. But there's still a lot of work to do with the P&C and ERCOT in various stakeholder groups to get this over the finish line. Thanks, Michael. Sure. Well, if you look at our revised guidance for 2023 and you look at that sort of midpoint, if you take that and add the Energy Harbor numbers to it, that I'd shared with you for '24-'25, you're getting to that $4.5 billion number.  And what we've seen in our business model, Julian, is because of where we've hedged and how we've been able to hedge, the realized kind of margin expectations are pretty flat from this kind of '23-'24-'25 timeframe. And the split between retail and gen might vary a little bit, but not materially. And I think that's 1 of the durable parts about our model is. And we saw it last year. And we're going to see it a little bit this year is that you may see a little bit of movement between retail and gen based on market conditions.  But retail is very solid in this kind of $1 billion range over that horizon. And I would expect the difference being the wholesale to get to that 3.8. And that's actually, I think one of the things that we've been excited to share is that the business is stable doesn't mean we're not working hard every day to hold on to it. I don't want to make it sound like just because we've hedged it. It's going to be realized. We have to deliver every single day on the business. But the outlook is actually above where we were in May of last year when we announced it and stable. And we'll be adding Energy Harbor to it. And so that line of sight with those hedge percentages we feel really good about where we are in that '24-'25 timeframe. Certainly '26 is more open.  And as I mentioned earlier, ERCOT is looking favorable relative to the last time we talked. But PJM is down on fixed price power at this point in 2016, but then we also have some PTC support for that for the Energy Harbor length. It doesn't look like ERCOT would be in that PTC range right now because of where the curves have moved up to.  But we've got kind of geographic flexibility segment, flexibility in -- or I should say, diversification and how I think 2026 will play out. Sure. I'll start. I think by subsidy, I think you're referring maybe to the loan program and the grants that could be coming Julien? So yes, that -- obviously, the referendum is in November. The initial amount that was shared as part of the bill was $10 billion. The amount that has been provided for in the budget is $5 billion. And then the amount of the $5 billion that's going to be allocated to building new gas plants is unknown at this point. So let's say it's something in the $3 billion to $3.5 billion range potentially.  When we've looked at the math, the 3% interest on a 60% loan to value, it can move your returns a couple of points. So it is helpful, but it does not make up for potentially missing revenue in a backwardated market. And that gets to your other point, which is do these other programs, whether it's an ORDC bridge PCM being implemented, eCRS was just implemented. DRS will be implemented by the end of 2024, do those cumulatively add a recognition of reliability for the assets that Ken provided. And if so, can we get enough line of sight to build into that? And I think we don't know yet for us. I mean, we're still evaluating it. Steve, in terms of how the new ancillaries like eCRS and DRS, how you see that playing in Artic bridge be interested and share your thoughts on how you see the market adapting to these? And I think it's too early to call DRS at this point. I mean it's still early stage to think about that one. Julian. That was one of the ones that some certain stakeholders were pushing as kind of the market solution. And so I believe the P&C and ERCOT have enough tools that they can work with to try to build some incentives for existing and new assets to be recognized and rewarded for their reliability, including a firming requirement for assets that come on to the grid after January 1, '27. And that they have to effectively be able to backstop the expected generation that they are committing to.  Those were all the right, I think, concepts. It's just early stage for us to know at this point how that's going to affect prices. I think so. The procurement program or the loan program and grant program alone, like I said, is marginally it's beneficial but it does not solve the broader problem that we entered the session trying to solve. And I think that's why we ended up with a menu of things. And frankly, it's a ton of work for the Public Utility Commission in ERCOT to work through this. And they're going to have their plate more than full. I mean, there's real-time co-optimization that has to fit in there before even PCM.  So there is a lot still to, I think, figure out. And we'll obviously be active and work with the stakeholders involved to try to bring clarity to it. But yes, on a calendar basis, it's multiyear at this point. Yes, it's a very good question, Durgesh. I would say there's a combination of factors. One is we've actually added some length given that the curves have moved up. So that's a good thing. There's more hours in the money for the fleet. So that means there's actually more to hedge. That's ultimately a good thing. And so when you look at the percentage, it's not a static amount of generation. So that's 1 element.  The second element is that's as of 6/30 that we were giving you these percentages. We've continued to hedge since 6/30 particularly in the 2025 timeframe. I don't feel that where we sit working with our team that we feel '26 is at a place where you have to go lock it all in because of the dynamics we talked about earlier. We think there's still upside in some of these markets. And we feel good about the visibility we've given for '24-'25, and we've got time to work on '26.  So the curves, as I mentioned, in '26 for PJM had come down ERCOT has gone up, but not anything that we need to go rush out and move materially on '26 at this stage. It's already higher since 6/30 Durgesh. And so the '26 hasn't moved much, but we have moved up on '25 and we're nearly fully hedged obviously for '24. But these percentages do move because, again, being in the money means you have more hours to hedge because there's gross margin. So the hedge percentage could drop, but your earnings forecast could go up as a function of just simply looking at the opportunity set. So some of it is just the timing and the fact that these curves do move around. Sure. Well, Daesh, it is good to see that the stock has moved up. We view this as a long-term strategy when we initiated it, and we still feel that way.  If you look at the stock price move, and this is a very imprecise science, but a good portion of the move, you could explain by virtue of the reduction in the share count and not necessarily seeing the enterprise value move that materially. Now that's still a good thing for the existing shareholders, and it's an opportunity for existing shareholders that are effectively increasing their percentage of ownership in Vistra.  I also believe that since the May timeframe of last year and where we are today, we have materially improved the earnings outlook of the company, which in theory, would result potentially in a multiple expansion. And we really haven't seen that much of a multiple expansion. And I'm not here to argue what the right multiple actually is. But I still feel there's recognition that I believe the market will continue to see as we put, I call it points on the board, delivering on our scorecard and our results. And at some point in time, when folks are comfortable that the earnings power is sustainable for the -- in the duration of a horizon beyond even the two to three years we talk about you might actually see some multiple expansion. We're not really there yet. And so our capital allocation plan for the foreseeable future, and I would put that in partly the high-class problem if we have to revisit it. But we feel very good about the capital allocation plan. And we might lean in a little more aggressively on the pace of the buybacks if we continue to overperform and see where we are with our -- obviously, cash needs to do that, fund Energy Harbor, which is our focus is to get this transaction closed in the fourth quarter. And then we're being disciplined on the Vistra Zero projects. And when we're reflecting that. And we want our shareholders to be confident that we do things, and we do look at the buyback as an alternate use of capital relative to the growth options. So the growth options need to be attractive. And so we'll pace the Vistra Zero projects to make sure that we're hitting the best ones and not chasing just the renewable projects. And I like our portfolio there. And we mentioned MOS 350 was an excellent project to bring online and an excellent job by the team.  So capital allocation plan is intact. And we're excited to, I'd say, hit the gas pedal on the capital allocation plan because we think it's the right mix for our shareholders as well as our debt holders. Thanks, Durgesh. Good morning, Dave. Yeah, absolutely. Those two are related, David. We have the Illinois coal to solar, we had the majority of that reduction that you see was some movement out of 2023 and -- and into '24-'25. We're still working the procurement cycle with working with vendors on EPC and obviously, the equipment. And we're still working that process in Illinois. So it's more just a deferral at this point for the coal to solar projects. And that was about two thirds of what was moving out.  The other is, as I mentioned on a couple of previous calls, on the ERCOT solar, we're starting to see the solar hours kind of cannibalize the solar hours. And so we'll move forward on solar projects with a PPA, but we're not going to move those in a merchant type model. And that really was the other part of what lowered the CapEx.  Now as I've mentioned as well, we own these projects, the pacing of these, a project may not be ripe now, could be ripe three years from now, depending on market conditions and depending on how some of these rules played out that we talked about on one of the earlier questions. But that is really a reduction at this point this year, that's a deferral on the coal to solar. But I would say in Texas Solar, but I would say next year, we're probably still in this kind of $600 million number. So we're not pushing number down this year to then take the next year number up fully. We're showing the discipline because the Texas piece, in particular is something that we want to keep a close eye on. So I think even for next year, you're going to see a development number for CapEx that's pretty close to this year. Yes, there's a lot in your question, Angie. And I'll break it down I think into two big market distinctions. The ERCOT market is more of a scarcity-driven market. And we have seen in just the last two months, the volatility pickup and the cost that a retailer needs to be prepared to pay to insure against that volatility has moved up. So you had the whole energy complex move up in '22, then it started to come off earlier this year. Now we're having the actual scarcity of basically supply demand tightening and ERCOT. And we're starting to see the costs for swing, which is part of that full requirements, particularly for residential, that's very costly. Large commercial and industrial does not have as much of a swing aspect to its load profile. So we are a very residential, heavy retail book. We have a great LCI business, but we are dominated from an earnings standpoint by our presence in residential. So we manage that swing in the pricing for our customer. Scott Hudson has to provide for the fact that he's wearing full requirements risk and serving this load.  And we have the assets to back it up. And I think that's what's distinctive about our model is that we've got the base load the intermediate and the peakers, so that Steve Muscato and the team can fulfill. And so if there's any issue with that we get it just right on the quantity hedged, which hedging is always imperfect. We've got an opportunity between the retail and the gen side to balance each other out. And ERCOT where we've really seen that volatility.  In the other market, it's been more gas-driven. And we've seen a general downward slope in the gas curves and these other markets and retailers generally can expand margin in a declining gas and power cost environment. And they might see some compression in margins and are rising. And I think, some of the tailwind in 2023 in signing deals is based on the fact that if you signed deals in 2022, that were multiyear deals with large commercial, you might have had negative margins in the first year and 2022, because power costs were so high because you average the cost for the customer. And then you would have seen positive margins in the out years. That's normalized now.  You can now sign deals and see positive margins in '23-'24-'25. So that's part of the tailwind. But this is a cyclical business. And I think you've got to run it for the long-term. And you've got to set customer expectations around being predictable and not move them around too much, as I mentioned earlier.  So those are the two dynamics I see in the market. Scott, is there anything you'd like to add to that? Price to compare is still much higher. And our power costs are lower. But I think, there was such an extreme last year that that'll stabilize overtime, but you really do have to think about these as very market specific. And then customer product and brand-specific segments.  Thank you. Thank you, Scott. So, Angie thank you. Always looking ahead. We are clearly focused on Energy Harbor. And as Kris mentioned earlier, we've got some return of cash this year. So it can help change our what our financing needs are to close the Energy Harbor transaction.  We don't comment on any potential M&A, but I think we demonstrated that we keep an eye out and we have the right conversations to be aware of the opportunity set. And if there is an attractive one at the right price, we'd be in a position to move. But I've also said and I said it on our Vistra standalone case. We liked the Vistra standalone the case at the time we announced Energy Harbor. So we had to get comfortable to Energy Harbor would truly be accretive in a long-term good fit for our company. And we made that determination. And we're very excited about it. We would use a similar lens on anything else. And we still think the capital allocation plan, which we kept intact, through Energy Harbor. I think we still need to consider that in anything that we're doing that our shareholders have come to expect that capital allocation plan that will execute on it, increase any comments on the financing markets, and how we think about it. But that's sort of another step down the road, even from this Energy Harbor transaction. Thank you, Angie. Thank you again for joining us on this call and sorry if the call dropped and you had to get back on. But we really appreciate your interest in us and following how we're progressing. And we look forward to talking to you hopefully, if we see on the road before the next quarter. And wish you a great summer. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, that today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Meagan Horn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMeagan Horn: Good morning, and thank you all for joining Vistra's investor webcast, discussing our first quarter 2023 results. Today's discussion is being broadcast live on the investor relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There you can also find the copies of today's investor presentation and earnings release. Leading the call today are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra's senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call, as necessary. Our earnings release, presentation and other matters discussed in our call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of Vistra's website. Also today's discussion contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statement included on slide two of the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks and forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Meagan. Good morning. Thank you all for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I will begin on slide five. We entered the year focused on our four strategic priorities, and we are making great strides. First, our integrated model continues to demonstrate its value and effectiveness. As you probably recall, we spent a majority of 2022 executing on our comprehensive hedging strategy that we said was locking in earnings opportunities for 2023 through 2025. We utilized available liquidity last year to support this strategy as we believe the additional EBITDA opportunities were significant. This first quarter of 2023 we saw this strategy translate into real value as mild weather was experienced across the major markets in which we operate, which led to lower than expected cleared power prices. While we saw power prices clear at approximately $30 a megawatt hour on average, our first quarter results reflect a realization of average prices of around $45 per megawatt hour given we were highly hedged entering the year. In addition, in the outer years where we have been more open, we have seen prices and spark spreads increase as compared to this time last year. We have continued to opportunistically hedged to secure an increasing out year earnings potential. We believe this is important not only because it provides an enhanced resiliency of our earnings profile despite an uncertain commodity market, but also because it ensures we can deliver on our commitments to reliably serve our customers, consistently return capital to shareholders, maintain a strong balance sheet, and transform our fleet as we strengthen our position for the long-term. Second, our return of capital to our shareholders remains consistent and robust. Kris will provide a detailed update on our capital allocation plan in just a moment, but I want to highlight that of the aggregate 4.25 billion share repurchase authorization, we have returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders from November, 2021 through May 4th, 2023. Additionally, we are on track to pay $300 million in common stock dividends in 2023 as planned with our Board approving a second quarter dividend in the amount of $20.40, representing an approximately 15% increase over the second quarter dividend paid in 2022. The share repurchase program together with the structure of our dividend plan work in tandem to provide our shareholders with the expectation of dividend growth each quarter, as the aggregate $300 million in annual dividends is spread across a decreasing number of shares of Vistra common stock. Third, we continue our focus on a strong balance sheet. As we see margin deposits return, we are positioned to utilize that cash for opportunistic delevering and/or to reduce the amount of debt we expect to incur to close the Energy Harbor acquisition we announced in March of this year. While the first quarter is typically the lowest free cash flow quarter for Vistra, we were able to repay approximately $500 million of short-term debt. Of course, we're expecting our net debt balance to grow over the balance of the year to fund the Energy Harbor acquisition, which we expect to come with a significant amount of EBITDA. But we remain focused on our goal of a long-term net leverage ratio, excluding any non-recourse debt at Vistra Zero of less than three times, which we expect to achieve in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe. Finally, we are very excited about our announcement just two months ago regarding the acquisition of Energy Harbor, which is expected to close later this year. With this acquisition, our nuclear fleet will grow by an additional 4,000 megawatts in PJM, which will more than double the zero carbon generation we have online today. Turning to slide six, I will discuss this quarter's results. We achieved $554 million of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, strong operational performance and our robust hedging activities helped offset milder than normal weather throughout the U.S. Our retail and generation teams continued their strong operational performance with retail achieving growth in ERCOT customer counts while maintaining attractive margins, and our generation team delivering commercial availability of 97%, while maintaining the focus on safety. The generation team has operated over three years without a significant injury across a large and diverse fleet, and safety remains our number one priority. Looking ahead for the remainder of the year, we are confident in our ability to meet or exceed the midpoint of our $3.4 billion to $4.0 billion adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations guidance range for 2023 as we announced in the third quarter of 2022. We're also reaffirming our $1.75 billion to $2.35 billion adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations guidance range. Of course, with nine months to go in the year, including the important summer months, we believe it would be premature to narrow or otherwise adjust our guidance range for 2023. Kris will cover in more detail while we remain bullish on our opportunities and years ahead. Before I wrap up and turn the call over to Kris to discuss the first quarter's performance in more detail, I want to provide a quick update on the status of our Energy Harbor acquisition. As noted on slide seven, we have filed approval request with each of the three key agencies and anticipate receiving all needed approvals in time to close by the end of this year. As a reminder, we've committed bridge financing in place and an amount sufficient to close the transaction, but we do expect to replace the entirety of our bridge commitments with permanent financing between now and closing. Finally, I think it's worth noting that as we have seen out year forward price curves improve, our financial forecast for Energy Harbor has also improved in the out years. Previous estimates we shared in March indicated average adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities for 2024 through 2025 of approximately $900 million with adjusted free cash flow before growth opportunities at a 65% to 70% range. This is inclusive of synergies and on an open pretax basis. Given recent price curves, we see the average adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities from Energy Harbor for 2026 and beyond to be higher than this original estimate. We expect that we will provide more detailed adjusted EBITDA and other financial projections for the combined company closer to closing or just after. Kris, I'll now turn the call over to you.\nKris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Starting on slide nine, Vistra delivered $554 million in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, including $583 million from generation and a loss of $29 million from retail. Generations results were strong despite the significant impacts of milder weather on pricing, primarily driven by in the money settled hedges opportunistically backing down generation at times when prices were below unit cost, and the recognition of the net bonus position in PJM for Winter Storm Elliott. Those benefits were partially offset by headwinds for the quarter that were known at the time guidance for 2023 was set, including default service migration costs, and lower PJM capacity revenues, as well as entry year impacts relating to timing of hedges and opportunistic acceleration of planned outages into the first quarter. While retail was also impacted by mild weather, it is important to note that due to strong counts in margin management, the results for retail for the first quarter are in the range of what we expected coming into the year. Given the entry year shaping, we continue to see due to higher power costs in the winter and summer months, we anticipate substantially all of the ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA for retail to be achieved in the second and fourth quarters.  Accordingly, we are confident in our ability to meet or exceed the midpoint of the $905 million to $1.065 billion range of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA for retail that we announced on our third quarter 2022 call. Turning now to slide 10, I'll share a quick update on capital allocation. As of May 4th, we had executed approximately $2.7 billion of share repurchases since the beginning of the program in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $1.55 billion of authorization by year in 2024 with at least $1 billion of cumulative repurchases expected in calendar year 2023 as originally planned. Notably as of May 4th, our outstanding share account had fallen to approximately 373 million shares, a significant reduction of approximately 23% from the aggregate number of shares that were outstanding when the program started in November of 2021. As a result of our robust and consistent share purchases, our dividend program of approximately $300 million per year or approximately $75 million per quarter continues to result in significant growth in the dividend per share received by our shareholders. To that end, the second quarter 2023 common stock dividend of $20.4 per share, which is payable on June 30th, 2023, is approximately 15% higher per share as compared to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2022. While we remain committed to consistently returning capital directly to our shareholders, we also remain steadfast in our commitment to a strong balance sheet. Accordingly, we continue to target a long-term net leverage ratio, excluding any non-recourse debt at Vistra Zero of less than three times. Finally, our Vistra Zero growth remains on track. We have allocated over 90% of the net proceeds from the December, 2021 green preferred stock issuance and are focused on securing non-recourse project or portfolio level financing to, among other things, support the growth CapEx needs of the company. We anticipate the first such financing to be in place no later than the end of this year. Turning to slide 11, we provide an update on the out year forward price curves as of May 4th. As you recall, we announced last year on the first quarter call that we estimated a range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion of potential ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities for years 2023 through 2025 based on April 29th, 2022 curves. While we do not expect to update this range before initiating guidance for each applicable year, we did want to note that we currently believe there's upside to the range in each of 2024, 2025, and now 2026, in light of the higher prices in our primary markets and the continued execution of our comprehensive hedging program that has now hedged 2023 through 2025 at approximately 86% on average across all markets, with the balance of 2023 hedge at approximately 99% and 2024 hedge at approximately 96%. As you would expect, 2026 is significantly less hedged, which creates a significant opportunity, but also a wider range given our open position. We remain committed to executing against our 2023 strategic priorities and translating that success into shareholder returns. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our second quarter call. With that operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed.\nShahriar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.\nJim Burke: Hey, good mornings, Shar.\nKris Moldovan: Good morning, Shar.\nShahriar Pourreza: Good morning. Good morning. I think you sort of touched on this quickly, but I guess what point could you revisit and update the two-year commentary you guys have been providing. And then, obviously, those numbers have been floated around first in 2022. I guess, what kind of O&M inflation is embedded in those? Maybe put differently, we've seen a few of your peers kind of flag strong, increases in O&M costs of late, so I guess what are you guys seeing in those numbers as well? Thanks.\nJim Burke: Yeah. Shar -- excuse me. This is Jim. Thanks for your question.\nShahriar Pourreza: Hey, Jim.\nJim Burke: The two-year, if I understood your question, the two-year view you're speaking to is about 2024 and 2025. And as you noted, we had put out the 3.5 to 3.7 range last spring when we started to see the forward curves move and we've been opportunistically hedging into that. When we got to the end of 2022 and we started to talk about 2023, obviously we put out a 3.7 midpoint, which was at the upper end of this midpoint range, which was a construct we were trying to use to signal to the market that we see the earnings power of the business improving, but there's still a lot unhedged at the time we first put it out. Since we've continued to hedge, we see us continuing to move up. So, using the May 4th curves, and this is without including Energy Harbor, we see that midpoint opportunities for 2024 to 2025 start to move up higher than the 3.7, and we see it in sort of the 3.7 to 3.8 range. Again, this is the midpoint of those opportunities, so when we would formalize guidance at the end of this year for 2024, we'll have a bigger range around that, just given the inherent variability of managing through the business. But as we continue to perfect these hedges, we still have some open, obviously, in 2025, we're more hedged in 2024. We see this earnings power definitely improving for 2024, 2025, and in 2026 we're even more open. And if you rolled forward to 2026, we see an increase even further from these numbers.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. And then just -- I'm sorry to ask, but what's the O&M inflation you guys are embedding in those numbers?\nJim Burke: Yeah. So, the O&M inflation, it depends on which category we're referring to, Shar. We're using, and we have consistently seen something between 3% and 10%, depending on the nature of the input. Labor is different from OEMs doing outages, which is different from variable chemicals we use in the power production process. But it's in that range. And obviously, as a competitive company, we're contracting and procuring as competitively as we possibly can, but we don't have any go gets, if you will, built into the numbers to that we are trying to solve for, this is our best line of sight of what it takes to run this business.\nShahriar Pourreza: Perfect. Perfect. And then just last, I would love to get maybe a pulse check on sort of the legislative cycle right now, and your expectations for resource adequacy in ERCOT. Anything seem to be a little quieter. Now that the Senate has passed several items. I guess, what are your expectations for pathways forward as this session comes to a close? Thanks guys.\nJim Burke: Sure. Yeah. Sure. The -- it's coming down to the final three weeks in Austin. I do think there's been a lot of attention and appropriately so on reliability, and we've talked about that, especially when you consider that Texas is the nation's leader in wind and soon to be the nation's leader in solar, which helps from a sustainability point of view, but we've actually see that there's needs to bolster the grid from a dispatchable generation point of view. That was the impetus for the performance credit mechanism that was adopted by the Public Utility Commission in January. And the timing is such that depending on how the legislative process wraps up, the stakeholder process would begin for this PCM mechanism to be able to create a market mechanism to reward reliability. There's still many bills being considered in the house and the Senate, so it's hard to predict what might pass. But I think from our standpoint, the PCM is meant to address not only the incentives for new generation, but ensure that existing generation doesn't retire prematurely because some of the other forms of generation are getting production tax credits, which as you know, can create downward pressure on market power prices. So from our standpoint, we think the reliability focus is important. If the PCM is well designed and it moves forward, we think that it'll bolster the competitive market. We obviously want to continue to see support for our integrated model in Texas. We think it's a business that serves customers well, and we would intend to invest in building gas fire generation if there is a well designed PCM. So, we think policymakers are focused on the right aspects of what it takes to keep the grid affordable, reliable, and sustainable. And sure, our view is we want to be part of that solution here in our home state, but we still have three weeks to go and we'll obviously have to provide more updates as the session wraps up. But I do think the attention on this is well deserved and we'll be involved as much as we can through this session and the stakeholder process.\nShahriar Pourreza: Very helpful, Jim. Thank you so much. Have a good morning. Appreciate it guys.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Shar.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it. Look, I wanted to just follow up on the success of the Energy Harbor transactions. Obviously, got a lot of folks attention. Can you talk a little bit about your thoughts about looking into potential further inquisitive activities? Obviously, there's a NorthStar around, buybacks and commitments there in and maintaining that throughout. But can you talk today, especially in reaction Energy Harbor, how you would think about perhaps leaning in further to, whether that's nuclear or other angles that could include retail renewables or what have you. But we'd love to hear your thoughts.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Julien and good morning. Look, we have generally stayed away from commenting on M&A. I think it's one of those activities that opportunistically comes your way and you have to be prepared for it. You have to always be what we'd say, hang around the hoop a little bit on opportunities. However, I think the Energy Harbor transaction is a very significant one for us. Certainly, it's our focus right now, not only getting through the approval process with the key agencies, but the integration activities with the team at Energy Harbor and with our team. As you note, it's transformative in a lot of ways, because we used it as a platform to highlight just how much of a business we have with the carbon free aspects of our business. And obviously, we're going to more than double that amount of generation with this transaction. The strong balance sheet and the returning capital, the reason we keep repeating the four priorities is because we have to find things that fit within those four priorities and not everything is going to. And I think that's a commitment we've made. I think the Energy Harbor transaction reinforced. We mean those that we're going to stick with those four core principles. So Julien, nothing is ever off the table from the standpoint of looking at it, but it needs to fit the criteria that we've laid out and we're going to remain disciplined in that regard.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. No, fair enough. I appreciate that. Look -- and then with respect to the transaction itself, I mean, can you comment a little bit? I mean, seems like there might be a slight delay in the close the transaction, just what caused that, what approval process, or just the execution process? And then related, you talk about a significant jump in generation here. You all obviously have a pretty sizable retail platform. You saw some quarter-over-quarter declines in retail customers. How do you think about building out that retail platform a little bit further here in light of Energy Harbor, Oregon? Is that less of a priority considering things like the nuclear PTCs that might deemphasize the need to want to quote unquote balance that retail business with generation, if you will?\nJim Burke: Sure. Well, on the first matter, I think we're progressing well on the approvals process. We announced the transaction early March. We made the filings, the key filings in April. We believe the NRC is working towards an early October approval, which to be on the six-month track for a license transfer, we think, is actually on the more efficient side of the scale in terms of where we would go. We've talked about closing this in the fourth quarter, and I think that is achievable.  Julien, as you know, we don't have anything built into our numbers for 2023 related to Energy Harbor. So, hopefully, there's some opportunity there. But just I think we're tracking well. There's nothing that we're concerned about at this stage, but it's still early in the approval process. But so far so good. On the retail side, our reduction in counts has been more outside of the ERCOT market. We've made some strategic exits in a couple states. The Energy Harbor platform does give us an opportunity to bolster some of the areas where we do currently operate in retail. And obviously, it gives us an asset base, including some attributes like the emissions free energy credits, which customers are becoming more interested in that the nuclear units can offer. So, I like our retail, we like our integrated model. We do think the Midwest Northeast market reforms in some of the retail markets is still warranted. As we've talked about, Julien, the level of competition there in terms of the degree to which you can differentiate your products, there is still rather limited. It's more of a hedge channel and being able to serve customers with your assets than it is a true business to consumer or business to business differentiated marketing strategy. We hope to get there in some of these markets and we'll continue our efforts from a stakeholder outreach perspective. But the integrated model is certainly well intact with this acquisition, because it comes with a retail business in addition to a generation. But we do need to see these markets open up a little bit from a reform and being open to innovation in these markets, the way Texas has been open innovation. And so, we do have some work to do there, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right. I'll leave it there. Best of luck guys. We'll see, speak soon.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Julien.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey, good morning.\nJim Burke: Hey, Michael.\nKris Moldovan: Good morning. \nMichael Sullivan: Hey, Jim. Hey, Kris. Wanted to just confirm on the upside you're seeing in 2024 all the way out to 2026, that's based on basically current curves. And then if so, maybe if you could just give us your own point of view on where you think things could go just based on supply/demand dynamics in your major markets.\nJim Burke: You bet, Michael. Thank you. Yes. We base this off of using the May 4th curve. So, it's a function obviously, of where we have hedged, what we still have open, and the curves as of May 4th. Not that the liquidity is infinitely deep in some of these outer years, but it's not based on a point of view. It is based on curves. We know that this is something that you and our investors are trying to follow, which is, are we seeing some upside? As Kris laid out in his chart, from the time we first initiated the strategy of talking about a three-year horizon, the curves have actually improved in those outer years. So, while we've seen the front of the curves come down because of a number of factors, I'm going to ask Steve Muscato, our President of Wholesale, to comment.  We've seen the out years actually strengthen, and we think that that's actually a sign of opportunity for Vistra long-term. But in terms of the dynamics by market, I think it might be helpful for Steve to share a few thoughts as to how we see these markets being impacted by some of the factors obviously late last fall and through this year and where we see that headed. Steve?\nSteve Muscato: Thanks Jim. Sure. I would add, if we start with natural gas, which is kind of a big driver behind power prices, the marginal shell has now become the Hainesville, which is a dry shell. We're seeing limited growth in the Utica and the Marcellus due to limited pipeline take away and all the growth in the Permian that's happening, even though that's a wet shell, it's not the marginal shell. It's being used to really feed growing LNG export markets. So, that's really provided support on natural gas, which is why you're seeing it stay $4 and above, at least 2025 and beyond.  The front end of the curve is really influenced by a -- some excess storage inventories that are due to a mild weather, that if you look going forward, if you assume normal weather should balance itself out once you get to the 2020, late 2024, early 2025 period. In terms of like, say, fundamentals in each market, you're seeing this integration of renewables, particularly challenging in PJM, you see a lot of coal leaving the stack over time, but a slow incremental movement in renewables. Not only are renewables less effective in markets like PJM because lower capacity factors, it doesn't have the same irradiance or wind speeds that you see in markets like Texas and Mico. But it also takes a lot to replace it. You could see five to nine to one replacement levels needed in order to maintain same levels of reliability. You also have problems with east coast gas markets to the extent they can recouple with European markets. That could also cause some volatility. And I think Jim mentioned some of the things that are already happening in ERCOT in terms of reform. You have solar pushing the peak out. You only have one hour batteries coming into ERCOT, which it really doesn't help on an extended heat wave that may occur or extended cold front. And so, I think uncertainty around gas and coal assets and determine what happens with the legislature in addition to an aging fleet provides this collision we're seeing over time, which is going to win out the renewables or fossil fuels, and at least in the intermediate term, it appears gas is going to be needed. It's going to be stressed. And so, we think that's supporting fundamentals out.\nJim Burke: Steve, thanks for that. I'll just add, Michael, that in addition to the dynamics we're seeing of the resource fix and how it's changing, we've seen obviously a handful of significant environmental regulations that have been issued and potentially forthcoming that could also put some pressure on assets that currently are providing a reliability service on these grids. And our assets even with a Vistra Tradition and a Vistra Vision, coal is 25% to 30% on a go forward basis of Vistra Tradition. It's predominantly our combined cycle gas fleet. We think that has a lot of value in helping these grids be able to sustain a reliable operation while integrating more renewables. And then, of course, our Vistra Vision is anchored by Vistra Zero and also Comanche Peak and Energy Harbor assets on a go forward basis. So, we like our asset position to backstop and what we call firm up our customer commitments. And we think the horizon, whether it's the economics of what happens in competitive markets, or whether it's actually some of the incentives and the rules that could come forth from an environmental standpoint, these assets are going to be needed for reliability purposes. And that's our thesis with why we think this business has a long-term earnings potential that we see actually growing through time.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks. That was super comprehensive. Maybe just one quick follow up there on the environmental rules. So, from where you're standing right now, Jim, like any near term impact in terms of whether it be investments that you have to put into some of your coal plants that you were planning to keep online?\nJim Burke: Not in the near term, Michael. A couple things. Obviously, the CCR, ELG rules we have talked about for years, and that does have impacts on our coal fleet, which we've communicated multiple times that will have retirement dates and that sort of 2027, 2028 horizon except for two of our sites. Casper or the Good Neighbor Rule, it did -- it was recently stayed. So, you have an opportunity here for the state of Texas to revisit this rule. Obviously in the fifth circuit, it's going to take some time to sort that out. That could impact some of our old gas units, could impact the Martin Lake if it were to be fully implemented. But I think there were good reasons for the challenge and we're certainly not the only party in that challenge. There's many industry participants outside of even power as well as the state. But no, Michael, we don't have any anticipated large CapEx spend as a result, but we stay active. Again, reliability is important and we think that that this transition that's occurring on the grid needs to be done so thoughtfully, but nothing -- no near term impacts with the stay, maybe a little bit pushed out from that standpoint in terms of impact on our fleet.\nMichael Sullivan: Appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question.\nJim Burke: Hey, Dave.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey. Let's see. Wanted to check on the retail business. Just wanted to confirm, is that on track for the year, given the first quarter results? Are you going to -- need to pursue some more proactive initiatives to keep kind of in line with the guidance range for this year? Or is this really just the -- maybe more natural ebb and flow of the EBITDA results for retail?\nKris Moldovan: Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. As we noted in the comments, 29 -- the loss is $29 million that was expected -- that was within the range of what we expected when we set the guidance. So, that's not far off of what we were expecting going forward. We continue, and I noted this, but we continue to expect retail to be able to meet or exceed the midpoint of its guidance range that we provided in the third quarter of last year. We don't -- we see some timing effects over the balance of the year and some margin and count benefits that have carried through that we see will offset some of the pressures they saw from weather in the first quarter. So, we don't see anything in particular over the balance of the year that we need to stretch to meet that goal. Again, as we would note, the shape continues to be that we're going to see pressure on the retail side from an EBITDA perspective in the first and third quarters. And the second, fourth quarters is where they're going to make substantially all of the EBITDA. And that's because they typically have flat prices through the year, but the power costs in the winter and summer months are the highest. So, there's some pressure on EBITDA in the first and third quarters and the second, fourth quarters is where they make it up.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, similar topic, I was just curious what the latest trends you're seeing are in customers moving to default service. Is that still a trend that's happening or which direction are you seeing right now?\nJim Burke: Yeah. David, we're still seeing some default prices increase in the markets through their kind of delayed procurement, but you are seeing competitive offers in the market that are now south of that default level. So, you are not seeing the same level of migration to default. You're going to start seeing and we are seeing folks moving from default back into the competitive arena that is part of this market dynamic. I was mentioning that from a reform standpoint, ideally you would have a one-to-one relationship with the customer and not have it a customer bouncing between a utility and a retailer. But at this stage of the game, obviously prices have crested, they've started to come off in the wholesale market and that's creating opportunities for our retail business. But it's also creating some of the migration in some markets away from default and default prices because they're still increasing in some markets through May, that's going to create more and more savings opportunities for customers.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Great. That makes sense. Thanks so much.\nJim Burke: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for giving me time. Hey, just wanted to make sure Jim, I sort of heard this clearly in the response to Shar's question earlier, for 2024 and 2025, the midpoint is in the $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion range, and 2026 is expected to be higher than that for the base business?\nJim Burke: That is correct.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. And kind of above $900 million for Energy Harbor in 2026 as well?\nJim Burke: Yeah. That is the view that we have. And obviously we've talked about this on a hedge basis, which is largely open in 2026 Energy Harbor. We've talked -- because we are 2024, 2025 numbers that we've given, you have hedges in them for Energy Harbor. Once you get to 2026, Energy Harbor is pretty open. We're pretty open. And actually you could see Energy Harbor doing better than $900 million when you get out to 2026 again at current curves.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thank you for clarifying that for me. And then just as we look to the end of the year or maybe as you close on Energy Harbor, what should we expect in terms of disclosures? It is your -- is it going to be sort of a three-year, kind of like you did last year EBITDA guidance and free cash flow range? Just any color you can share, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nKris Moldovan: Yeah. We're going to -- I think we will obviously update guidance for the balance of 2023 and then 2024 at or at the time of closing. We haven't made a decision as far as how far out we'll continue to update. We'll probably continue to give directionally where we see things going. But I think we're -- I don't know that we plan to continue to consistently give three-year ranges going forward. But as we get closer to closing, we'll getting updates to what we've put out so far.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thanks Jim and Kris.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Durgesh.\nOperator: Today's final question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please proceed.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So -- actually some questions. One about flexibility in financing of the Energy Harbor transaction. So, I think we're all watching credit spreads. You have this deal to finance. You have the bridge financing in place, but you plan to refinance it before the end of the year. So, I'm just wondering if you could use, for example, any of the project level debt you mentioned at the renewable assets to maybe help yourself here. So that's one. And number two from the -- a bigger picture question. So, when you look at the mark-to-market of earnings of Vistra Vision and Vistra Tradition at these prices, you are solving for deleveraging pretty quickly. Probably 2025 if not sooner. So, would that change your thoughts about keeping these two businesses together, i.e. could we see a separation of Vistra Vision, again, which would unlock the true value of these assets? Thanks.\nKris Moldovan: Angie, I'll handle the first question where we talked about financing of Energy Harbor. Obviously we -- in the -- when we announced the transaction, we put out some assumptions on the amount of cash that we would use and the amount of debt in the split of the debt. We continue to look for opportunities. First as you saw, the margin deposits are coming back as expected. We saw about over $1 billion, approximately $1.2 billion come back from the end of the year into -- through March 31st. And we continue to see some margin of deposit returns as we settle our hedges going through the summer this year. So, you can expect us to continue to optimize the amount of cash that we're going to use from the balance sheet. As we -- and so it could be larger than the amount that we indicated on the call when we announced the transaction. As far as debt, we're going to look at a number of opportunities. We're going to be opportunistic as to timing and which market that we're in. So, we're already preparing for those opportunities. And I think you'll see us look at a number of different avenues to raise that debt and not just wait until the end and try to do it all in one market.\nJim Burke: And Angie, this is Jim. I'll add to Kris' comments on that. The idea obviously with Vistra Vision as it was conceived in order to execute on this transaction and keep a strong balance sheet, did obviously do two things that highlighted the amount of our earning stream that has a zero greenhouse gas emissions profile. It also created an investment vehicle for some of the key shareholders for Energy Harbor to participate in this future entity. I still step back and think about this as a customer business that is -- that has a changing sort of view of what they're looking for from the electric grid, including a more sustainable grid, but also a reliable grid. That in essence is Vistra. I mean, that is what we're doing. We're doing it, we're expressing it through different transactions. Energy Harbor obviously is the most significant one, but with the Ambit and Crius and growing our retail presence and then our launching of our own opportunities with Vistra Zero. So, the dissynergies that could come about by saying that this business is only this and this business is only that, is not really how the electric grid functions. It is obviously a way in which we can think about investors and how they want to express their point of view of what they invest in. But I think we can achieve that even with the structure we have here. And most importantly, we're still a fundamentals based view on value, and we invest in things that generate long-term sustainable cash flows. I know folks do talk to us about what do we think it might take to get a rerate, that's in some level out of our control. What is in our control is our ability to make good decisions, take advantage of the market opportunities as they come about, create some on our own and serve customers extremely well. And if we do that, we're going to return capital to shareholders very aggressively and paydown debt. And I think that's a winning model. It just may not come with the shorter term moves that some people might want to see, but I think we're building an enduring business and I think that's attractive for investors, and we're prepared to execute on that.\nAngie Storozynski: That's great. And just the last one question. So, you mentioned on some of it, that we're seeing relatively limited liquidity in those forward curves for power, right? There's always this question, is gas more liquid versus power and maybe those spark spreads that look incredible in forward years, I mean that are just to be true. So, I mean, is there a way for you to basically capture that strengths even with limited trading liquidity in power markets, either through some derivative transactions, gas driven hedges, you name it.\nJim Burke: Yes. Angie, we can. Obviously, gas is more liquid than power, and gas many times is a good proxy for power. But to your point, it's not a perfect proxy for power. And Steve, why don't you comment a little bit on some of the things that we do to try to use liquidity efficient means and how we're thinking about capturing this value. Because we are sensitive, Angie, that the further out we go, depending on how we hedge, there obviously is a use of liquidity, and we balance that into our thinking. And we're not also thinking that these curves just go away tomorrow because again, the fundamentals of what we think is happening with the electric grid speak to reliability and assets with flexibility, which is our portfolio. And we think those are getting valued and they're getting valued differently than they have in the past, because reliability was taken for granted. But Steve, why don't you comment a little bit on how we're thinking about blocking this in.\nSteve Muscato: Sure. I think for nuclear assets, gas is a decent proxy as a hedge. And so, we are able to use gas instruments like the NYMEX and different NYMEX structures to at least either lock in value or put a range of value in place to kind of protect downside. But we do have the PTC, so that's a consideration. In terms of the sparks, we do have to buy the gas in order to lock in the spark, and some of the specific gas locations is more challenging. I think ERCOT, PJM, there's more liquidity than places like New England for sure. But we try to do it in a liquidity efficient manner because as you get out further, the independent postings or the independent -- the initial margins that you have to post with exchanges can be quite expensive as you go out in time. And so, we're looking at trying to increase credit using first lien structures when we go out that far, or even bilaterally with counterparties to get that done. And so, it's a little bit slower from both, because we're trying to use liquidity efficient channels, and also going directly to customers and other wholesale counterparties. But it is something we've begun working on in 2026, even out as far as 2027. But it will definitely take time. And again, trying to use liquidity efficient channels is important, like first liens and direct to bilaterals.\nAngie Storozynski: Great. Thank you.\nJim Burke: Angie, thank you for the question.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jim Burke for any closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nJim Burke: Yes. Thank you. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We appreciate your interest in Vistra and please know that our Vistra team is working hard to execute well for the summer, and our strategic priorities, and we look forward to giving you future updates. Have a great morning everyone. Thanks.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

It's going to be stressed. And so, we think that's supporting fundamentals out. Sure. I think for nuclear assets, gas is a decent proxy as a hedge. And so, we are able to use gas instruments like the NYMEX and different NYMEX structures to at least either lock in value or put a range of value in place to kind of protect downside. But we do have the PTC, so that's a consideration. In terms of the sparks, we do have to buy the gas in order to lock in the spark, and some of the specific gas locations is more challenging. I think ERCOT, PJM, there's more liquidity than places like New England for sure. But we try to do it in a liquidity efficient manner because as you get out further, the independent postings or the independent -- the initial margins that you have to post with exchanges can be quite expensive as you go out in time. And so, we're looking at trying to increase credit using first lien structures when we go out that far, or even bilaterally with counterparties to get that done. And so, it's a little bit slower from both, because we're trying to use liquidity efficient channels, and also going directly to customers and other wholesale counterparties. But it is something we've begun working on in 2026, even out as far as 2027. But it will definitely take time. And again, trying to use liquidity efficient channels is important, like first liens and direct to bilaterals."

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Starting on slide nine, Vistra delivered $554 million in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, including $583 million from generation and a loss of $29 million from retail. Generations results were strong despite the significant impacts of milder weather on pricing, primarily driven by in the money settled hedges opportunistically backing down generation at times when prices were below unit cost, and the recognition of the net bonus position in PJM for Winter Storm Elliott. Those benefits were partially offset by headwinds for the quarter that were known at the time guidance for 2023 was set, including default service migration costs, and lower PJM capacity revenues, as well as entry year impacts relating to timing of hedges and opportunistic acceleration of planned outages into the first quarter. While retail was also impacted by mild weather, it is important to note that due to strong counts in margin management, the results for retail for the first quarter are in the range of what we expected coming into the year. Given the entry year shaping, we continue to see due to higher power costs in the winter and summer months, we anticipate substantially all of the ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA for retail to be achieved in the second and fourth quarters.  Accordingly, we are confident in our ability to meet or exceed the midpoint of the $905 million to $1.065 billion range of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA for retail that we announced on our third quarter 2022 call. Turning now to slide 10, I'll share a quick update on capital allocation. As of May 4th, we had executed approximately $2.7 billion of share repurchases since the beginning of the program in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect to utilize the remaining approximately $1.55 billion of authorization by year in 2024 with at least $1 billion of cumulative repurchases expected in calendar year 2023 as originally planned. Notably as of May 4th, our outstanding share account had fallen to approximately 373 million shares, a significant reduction of approximately 23% from the aggregate number of shares that were outstanding when the program started in November of 2021. As a result of our robust and consistent share purchases, our dividend program of approximately $300 million per year or approximately $75 million per quarter continues to result in significant growth in the dividend per share received by our shareholders. To that end, the second quarter 2023 common stock dividend of $20.4 per share, which is payable on June 30th, 2023, is approximately 15% higher per share as compared to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2022. While we remain committed to consistently returning capital directly to our shareholders, we also remain steadfast in our commitment to a strong balance sheet. Accordingly, we continue to target a long-term net leverage ratio, excluding any non-recourse debt at Vistra Zero of less than three times. Finally, our Vistra Zero growth remains on track. We have allocated over 90% of the net proceeds from the December, 2021 green preferred stock issuance and are focused on securing non-recourse project or portfolio level financing to, among other things, support the growth CapEx needs of the company. We anticipate the first such financing to be in place no later than the end of this year. Turning to slide 11, we provide an update on the out year forward price curves as of May 4th. As you recall, we announced last year on the first quarter call that we estimated a range of $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion of potential ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities for years 2023 through 2025 based on April 29th, 2022 curves. While we do not expect to update this range before initiating guidance for each applicable year, we did want to note that we currently believe there's upside to the range in each of 2024, 2025, and now 2026, in light of the higher prices in our primary markets and the continued execution of our comprehensive hedging program that has now hedged 2023 through 2025 at approximately 86% on average across all markets, with the balance of 2023 hedge at approximately 99% and 2024 hedge at approximately 96%. As you would expect, 2026 is significantly less hedged, which creates a significant opportunity, but also a wider range given our open position. We remain committed to executing against our 2023 strategic priorities and translating that success into shareholder returns. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our second quarter call. With that operator, we're now ready to open the line for questions. Good morning, Shar. Good morning. Yeah. Thanks for the question, David. As we noted in the comments, 29 -- the loss is $29 million that was expected -- that was within the range of what we expected when we set the guidance. So, that's not far off of what we were expecting going forward. We continue, and I noted this, but we continue to expect retail to be able to meet or exceed the midpoint of its guidance range that we provided in the third quarter of last year. We don't -- we see some timing effects over the balance of the year and some margin and count benefits that have carried through that we see will offset some of the pressures they saw from weather in the first quarter. So, we don't see anything in particular over the balance of the year that we need to stretch to meet that goal. Again, as we would note, the shape continues to be that we're going to see pressure on the retail side from an EBITDA perspective in the first and third quarters. And the second, fourth quarters is where they're going to make substantially all of the EBITDA. And that's because they typically have flat prices through the year, but the power costs in the winter and summer months are the highest. So, there's some pressure on EBITDA in the first and third quarters and the second, fourth quarters is where they make it up. Yeah. We're going to -- I think we will obviously update guidance for the balance of 2023 and then 2024 at or at the time of closing. We haven't made a decision as far as how far out we'll continue to update. We'll probably continue to give directionally where we see things going. But I think we're -- I don't know that we plan to continue to consistently give three-year ranges going forward. But as we get closer to closing, we'll getting updates to what we've put out so far. Angie, I'll handle the first question where we talked about financing of Energy Harbor. Obviously we -- in the -- when we announced the transaction, we put out some assumptions on the amount of cash that we would use and the amount of debt in the split of the debt. We continue to look for opportunities. First as you saw, the margin deposits are coming back as expected. We saw about over $1 billion, approximately $1.2 billion come back from the end of the year into -- through March 31st. And we continue to see some margin of deposit returns as we settle our hedges going through the summer this year. So, you can expect us to continue to optimize the amount of cash that we're going to use from the balance sheet. As we -- and so it could be larger than the amount that we indicated on the call when we announced the transaction. As far as debt, we're going to look at a number of opportunities. We're going to be opportunistic as to timing and which market that we're in. So, we're already preparing for those opportunities. And I think you'll see us look at a number of different avenues to raise that debt and not just wait until the end and try to do it all in one market."

            "name": "Jim Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Meagan. Good morning. Thank you all for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I will begin on slide five. We entered the year focused on our four strategic priorities, and we are making great strides. First, our integrated model continues to demonstrate its value and effectiveness. As you probably recall, we spent a majority of 2022 executing on our comprehensive hedging strategy that we said was locking in earnings opportunities for 2023 through 2025. We utilized available liquidity last year to support this strategy as we believe the additional EBITDA opportunities were significant. This first quarter of 2023 we saw this strategy translate into real value as mild weather was experienced across the major markets in which we operate, which led to lower than expected cleared power prices. While we saw power prices clear at approximately $30 a megawatt hour on average, our first quarter results reflect a realization of average prices of around $45 per megawatt hour given we were highly hedged entering the year. In addition, in the outer years where we have been more open, we have seen prices and spark spreads increase as compared to this time last year. We have continued to opportunistically hedged to secure an increasing out year earnings potential. We believe this is important not only because it provides an enhanced resiliency of our earnings profile despite an uncertain commodity market, but also because it ensures we can deliver on our commitments to reliably serve our customers, consistently return capital to shareholders, maintain a strong balance sheet, and transform our fleet as we strengthen our position for the long-term. Second, our return of capital to our shareholders remains consistent and robust. Kris will provide a detailed update on our capital allocation plan in just a moment, but I want to highlight that of the aggregate 4.25 billion share repurchase authorization, we have returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders from November, 2021 through May 4th, 2023. Additionally, we are on track to pay $300 million in common stock dividends in 2023 as planned with our Board approving a second quarter dividend in the amount of $20.40, representing an approximately 15% increase over the second quarter dividend paid in 2022. The share repurchase program together with the structure of our dividend plan work in tandem to provide our shareholders with the expectation of dividend growth each quarter, as the aggregate $300 million in annual dividends is spread across a decreasing number of shares of Vistra common stock. Third, we continue our focus on a strong balance sheet. As we see margin deposits return, we are positioned to utilize that cash for opportunistic delevering and/or to reduce the amount of debt we expect to incur to close the Energy Harbor acquisition we announced in March of this year. While the first quarter is typically the lowest free cash flow quarter for Vistra, we were able to repay approximately $500 million of short-term debt. Of course, we're expecting our net debt balance to grow over the balance of the year to fund the Energy Harbor acquisition, which we expect to come with a significant amount of EBITDA. But we remain focused on our goal of a long-term net leverage ratio, excluding any non-recourse debt at Vistra Zero of less than three times, which we expect to achieve in the 2024 to 2025 timeframe. Finally, we are very excited about our announcement just two months ago regarding the acquisition of Energy Harbor, which is expected to close later this year. With this acquisition, our nuclear fleet will grow by an additional 4,000 megawatts in PJM, which will more than double the zero carbon generation we have online today. Turning to slide six, I will discuss this quarter's results. We achieved $554 million of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, strong operational performance and our robust hedging activities helped offset milder than normal weather throughout the U.S. Our retail and generation teams continued their strong operational performance with retail achieving growth in ERCOT customer counts while maintaining attractive margins, and our generation team delivering commercial availability of 97%, while maintaining the focus on safety. The generation team has operated over three years without a significant injury across a large and diverse fleet, and safety remains our number one priority. Looking ahead for the remainder of the year, we are confident in our ability to meet or exceed the midpoint of our $3.4 billion to $4.0 billion adjusted EBITDA from ongoing operations guidance range for 2023 as we announced in the third quarter of 2022. We're also reaffirming our $1.75 billion to $2.35 billion adjusted free cash flow before growth from ongoing operations guidance range. Of course, with nine months to go in the year, including the important summer months, we believe it would be premature to narrow or otherwise adjust our guidance range for 2023. Kris will cover in more detail while we remain bullish on our opportunities and years ahead. Before I wrap up and turn the call over to Kris to discuss the first quarter's performance in more detail, I want to provide a quick update on the status of our Energy Harbor acquisition. As noted on slide seven, we have filed approval request with each of the three key agencies and anticipate receiving all needed approvals in time to close by the end of this year. As a reminder, we've committed bridge financing in place and an amount sufficient to close the transaction, but we do expect to replace the entirety of our bridge commitments with permanent financing between now and closing. Finally, I think it's worth noting that as we have seen out year forward price curves improve, our financial forecast for Energy Harbor has also improved in the out years. Previous estimates we shared in March indicated average adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities for 2024 through 2025 of approximately $900 million with adjusted free cash flow before growth opportunities at a 65% to 70% range. This is inclusive of synergies and on an open pretax basis. Given recent price curves, we see the average adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunities from Energy Harbor for 2026 and beyond to be higher than this original estimate. We expect that we will provide more detailed adjusted EBITDA and other financial projections for the combined company closer to closing or just after. Kris, I'll now turn the call over to you. Hey, good mornings, Shar. Yeah. Shar -- excuse me. This is Jim. Thanks for your question. The two-year, if I understood your question, the two-year view you're speaking to is about 2024 and 2025. And as you noted, we had put out the 3.5 to 3.7 range last spring when we started to see the forward curves move and we've been opportunistically hedging into that. When we got to the end of 2022 and we started to talk about 2023, obviously we put out a 3.7 midpoint, which was at the upper end of this midpoint range, which was a construct we were trying to use to signal to the market that we see the earnings power of the business improving, but there's still a lot unhedged at the time we first put it out. Since we've continued to hedge, we see us continuing to move up. So, using the May 4th curves, and this is without including Energy Harbor, we see that midpoint opportunities for 2024 to 2025 start to move up higher than the 3.7, and we see it in sort of the 3.7 to 3.8 range. Again, this is the midpoint of those opportunities, so when we would formalize guidance at the end of this year for 2024, we'll have a bigger range around that, just given the inherent variability of managing through the business. But as we continue to perfect these hedges, we still have some open, obviously, in 2025, we're more hedged in 2024. We see this earnings power definitely improving for 2024, 2025, and in 2026 we're even more open. And if you rolled forward to 2026, we see an increase even further from these numbers. Yeah. So, the O&M inflation, it depends on which category we're referring to, Shar. We're using, and we have consistently seen something between 3% and 10%, depending on the nature of the input. Labor is different from OEMs doing outages, which is different from variable chemicals we use in the power production process. But it's in that range. And obviously, as a competitive company, we're contracting and procuring as competitively as we possibly can, but we don't have any go gets, if you will, built into the numbers to that we are trying to solve for, this is our best line of sight of what it takes to run this business. Sure. Yeah. Sure. The -- it's coming down to the final three weeks in Austin. I do think there's been a lot of attention and appropriately so on reliability, and we've talked about that, especially when you consider that Texas is the nation's leader in wind and soon to be the nation's leader in solar, which helps from a sustainability point of view, but we've actually see that there's needs to bolster the grid from a dispatchable generation point of view. That was the impetus for the performance credit mechanism that was adopted by the Public Utility Commission in January. And the timing is such that depending on how the legislative process wraps up, the stakeholder process would begin for this PCM mechanism to be able to create a market mechanism to reward reliability. There's still many bills being considered in the house and the Senate, so it's hard to predict what might pass. But I think from our standpoint, the PCM is meant to address not only the incentives for new generation, but ensure that existing generation doesn't retire prematurely because some of the other forms of generation are getting production tax credits, which as you know, can create downward pressure on market power prices. So from our standpoint, we think the reliability focus is important. If the PCM is well designed and it moves forward, we think that it'll bolster the competitive market. We obviously want to continue to see support for our integrated model in Texas. We think it's a business that serves customers well, and we would intend to invest in building gas fire generation if there is a well designed PCM. So, we think policymakers are focused on the right aspects of what it takes to keep the grid affordable, reliable, and sustainable. And sure, our view is we want to be part of that solution here in our home state, but we still have three weeks to go and we'll obviously have to provide more updates as the session wraps up. But I do think the attention on this is well deserved and we'll be involved as much as we can through this session and the stakeholder process. Thank you, Shar. Thank you, Julien and good morning. Look, we have generally stayed away from commenting on M&A. I think it's one of those activities that opportunistically comes your way and you have to be prepared for it. You have to always be what we'd say, hang around the hoop a little bit on opportunities. However, I think the Energy Harbor transaction is a very significant one for us. Certainly, it's our focus right now, not only getting through the approval process with the key agencies, but the integration activities with the team at Energy Harbor and with our team. As you note, it's transformative in a lot of ways, because we used it as a platform to highlight just how much of a business we have with the carbon free aspects of our business. And obviously, we're going to more than double that amount of generation with this transaction. The strong balance sheet and the returning capital, the reason we keep repeating the four priorities is because we have to find things that fit within those four priorities and not everything is going to. And I think that's a commitment we've made. I think the Energy Harbor transaction reinforced. We mean those that we're going to stick with those four core principles. So Julien, nothing is ever off the table from the standpoint of looking at it, but it needs to fit the criteria that we've laid out and we're going to remain disciplined in that regard. Sure. Well, on the first matter, I think we're progressing well on the approvals process. We announced the transaction early March. We made the filings, the key filings in April. We believe the NRC is working towards an early October approval, which to be on the six-month track for a license transfer, we think, is actually on the more efficient side of the scale in terms of where we would go. We've talked about closing this in the fourth quarter, and I think that is achievable.  Julien, as you know, we don't have anything built into our numbers for 2023 related to Energy Harbor. So, hopefully, there's some opportunity there. But just I think we're tracking well. There's nothing that we're concerned about at this stage, but it's still early in the approval process. But so far so good. On the retail side, our reduction in counts has been more outside of the ERCOT market. We've made some strategic exits in a couple states. The Energy Harbor platform does give us an opportunity to bolster some of the areas where we do currently operate in retail. And obviously, it gives us an asset base, including some attributes like the emissions free energy credits, which customers are becoming more interested in that the nuclear units can offer. So, I like our retail, we like our integrated model. We do think the Midwest Northeast market reforms in some of the retail markets is still warranted. As we've talked about, Julien, the level of competition there in terms of the degree to which you can differentiate your products, there is still rather limited. It's more of a hedge channel and being able to serve customers with your assets than it is a true business to consumer or business to business differentiated marketing strategy. We hope to get there in some of these markets and we'll continue our efforts from a stakeholder outreach perspective. But the integrated model is certainly well intact with this acquisition, because it comes with a retail business in addition to a generation. But we do need to see these markets open up a little bit from a reform and being open to innovation in these markets, the way Texas has been open innovation. And so, we do have some work to do there, Julien. Thank you, Julien. Hey, Michael. You bet, Michael. Thank you. Yes. We base this off of using the May 4th curve. So, it's a function obviously, of where we have hedged, what we still have open, and the curves as of May 4th. Not that the liquidity is infinitely deep in some of these outer years, but it's not based on a point of view. It is based on curves. We know that this is something that you and our investors are trying to follow, which is, are we seeing some upside? As Kris laid out in his chart, from the time we first initiated the strategy of talking about a three-year horizon, the curves have actually improved in those outer years. So, while we've seen the front of the curves come down because of a number of factors, I'm going to ask Steve Muscato, our President of Wholesale, to comment.  We've seen the out years actually strengthen, and we think that that's actually a sign of opportunity for Vistra long-term. But in terms of the dynamics by market, I think it might be helpful for Steve to share a few thoughts as to how we see these markets being impacted by some of the factors obviously late last fall and through this year and where we see that headed. Steve? Steve, thanks for that. I'll just add, Michael, that in addition to the dynamics we're seeing of the resource fix and how it's changing, we've seen obviously a handful of significant environmental regulations that have been issued and potentially forthcoming that could also put some pressure on assets that currently are providing a reliability service on these grids. And our assets even with a Vistra Tradition and a Vistra Vision, coal is 25% to 30% on a go forward basis of Vistra Tradition. It's predominantly our combined cycle gas fleet. We think that has a lot of value in helping these grids be able to sustain a reliable operation while integrating more renewables. And then, of course, our Vistra Vision is anchored by Vistra Zero and also Comanche Peak and Energy Harbor assets on a go forward basis. So, we like our asset position to backstop and what we call firm up our customer commitments. And we think the horizon, whether it's the economics of what happens in competitive markets, or whether it's actually some of the incentives and the rules that could come forth from an environmental standpoint, these assets are going to be needed for reliability purposes. And that's our thesis with why we think this business has a long-term earnings potential that we see actually growing through time. Not in the near term, Michael. A couple things. Obviously, the CCR, ELG rules we have talked about for years, and that does have impacts on our coal fleet, which we've communicated multiple times that will have retirement dates and that sort of 2027, 2028 horizon except for two of our sites. Casper or the Good Neighbor Rule, it did -- it was recently stayed. So, you have an opportunity here for the state of Texas to revisit this rule. Obviously in the fifth circuit, it's going to take some time to sort that out. That could impact some of our old gas units, could impact the Martin Lake if it were to be fully implemented. But I think there were good reasons for the challenge and we're certainly not the only party in that challenge. There's many industry participants outside of even power as well as the state. But no, Michael, we don't have any anticipated large CapEx spend as a result, but we stay active. Again, reliability is important and we think that that this transition that's occurring on the grid needs to be done so thoughtfully, but nothing -- no near term impacts with the stay, maybe a little bit pushed out from that standpoint in terms of impact on our fleet. Thank you, Michael. Hey, Dave. Yeah. David, we're still seeing some default prices increase in the markets through their kind of delayed procurement, but you are seeing competitive offers in the market that are now south of that default level. So, you are not seeing the same level of migration to default. You're going to start seeing and we are seeing folks moving from default back into the competitive arena that is part of this market dynamic. I was mentioning that from a reform standpoint, ideally you would have a one-to-one relationship with the customer and not have it a customer bouncing between a utility and a retailer. But at this stage of the game, obviously prices have crested, they've started to come off in the wholesale market and that's creating opportunities for our retail business. But it's also creating some of the migration in some markets away from default and default prices because they're still increasing in some markets through May, that's going to create more and more savings opportunities for customers. Thank you, David. That is correct. Yeah. That is the view that we have. And obviously we've talked about this on a hedge basis, which is largely open in 2026 Energy Harbor. We've talked -- because we are 2024, 2025 numbers that we've given, you have hedges in them for Energy Harbor. Once you get to 2026, Energy Harbor is pretty open. We're pretty open. And actually you could see Energy Harbor doing better than $900 million when you get out to 2026 again at current curves. Thank you, Durgesh. And Angie, this is Jim. I'll add to Kris' comments on that. The idea obviously with Vistra Vision as it was conceived in order to execute on this transaction and keep a strong balance sheet, did obviously do two things that highlighted the amount of our earning stream that has a zero greenhouse gas emissions profile. It also created an investment vehicle for some of the key shareholders for Energy Harbor to participate in this future entity. I still step back and think about this as a customer business that is -- that has a changing sort of view of what they're looking for from the electric grid, including a more sustainable grid, but also a reliable grid. That in essence is Vistra. I mean, that is what we're doing. We're doing it, we're expressing it through different transactions. Energy Harbor obviously is the most significant one, but with the Ambit and Crius and growing our retail presence and then our launching of our own opportunities with Vistra Zero. So, the dissynergies that could come about by saying that this business is only this and this business is only that, is not really how the electric grid functions. It is obviously a way in which we can think about investors and how they want to express their point of view of what they invest in. But I think we can achieve that even with the structure we have here. And most importantly, we're still a fundamentals based view on value, and we invest in things that generate long-term sustainable cash flows. I know folks do talk to us about what do we think it might take to get a rerate, that's in some level out of our control. What is in our control is our ability to make good decisions, take advantage of the market opportunities as they come about, create some on our own and serve customers extremely well. And if we do that, we're going to return capital to shareholders very aggressively and paydown debt. And I think that's a winning model. It just may not come with the shorter term moves that some people might want to see, but I think we're building an enduring business and I think that's attractive for investors, and we're prepared to execute on that. Yes. Angie, we can. Obviously, gas is more liquid than power, and gas many times is a good proxy for power. But to your point, it's not a perfect proxy for power. And Steve, why don't you comment a little bit on some of the things that we do to try to use liquidity efficient means and how we're thinking about capturing this value. Because we are sensitive, Angie, that the further out we go, depending on how we hedge, there obviously is a use of liquidity, and we balance that into our thinking. And we're not also thinking that these curves just go away tomorrow because again, the fundamentals of what we think is happening with the electric grid speak to reliability and assets with flexibility, which is our portfolio. And we think those are getting valued and they're getting valued differently than they have in the past, because reliability was taken for granted. But Steve, why don't you comment a little bit on how we're thinking about blocking this in. Angie, thank you for the question."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2024 operational and financial results. It has been an active year on a number of fronts, and I'm very proud of what the Vistra team has been able to deliver so far in 2024 while setting the stage for long-term value creation. Turning to Slide 5. I would like to recognize the Vistra team for another quarter of hard work and strong operational performance. Through their efforts, we achieved a solid quarterly financial results of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $1.444 million despite a continuation of the milder Texas weather we have experienced most of the year. The consistent execution from our team across generation, commercial and retail delivered reliable power and customer solutions that reflect the strength of our integrated business model. As you may remember from our second quarter results call, we indicated our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA was trending toward the upper end of the guidance range. I am pleased to report that with the results announced today and our outlook for the fourth quarter we are raising and narrowing our guidance range for 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to $5.0 billion to $5.2 billion with a midpoint above the upper end of our previous range. We are also raising and narrowing the guidance range for ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth to $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion. As we noted on our previous results call, our guidance excludes any potential benefit related to the nuclear production tax credit, or PTC, as we await clarity from treasury around the interpretation of gross receipts. However, based on year-to-date settled prices and the forward curve for the balance of the year, we believe the impact of the nuclear PTC to our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA could be approximately $500 million. Moving to our longer-term outlook. We are introducing guidance ranges for 2025 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth of $3.0 billion to $3.6 billion. Notably, our ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint of $5.8 billion is higher than the $5.7 billion upper end of our previously communicated range for 2025. While our ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2025 is not currently expected to benefit from the nuclear PTC at any significant amount due to the current level of forward price curves we do expect the availability of the nuclear PTC to provide downside protection in the event prices settle lower. For calendar year 2026, although our current hedge percentage has increased to approximately 64% of expected generation, a meaningful amount of gross margin variability remains. Further, the delay in the 2026, 2027 PJM capacity auction, including the potential modification of the associated auction parameters create some additional uncertainty. For these reasons, we are maintaining our outlook for our 2026 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity of over $6 billion with line of sight to potentially be meaningfully higher. Finally, the third quarter marked an active period of capital allocation and capital returns. On September 16, we announced the acquisition of the Vistra Vision 15% minority interest from our minority investors. We believe this acquisition will be highly accretive to our shareholders with an implied transaction multiple of less than 8 times enterprise value to EBITDA, 100% ownership upon closing at year-end and financial flexibility allow through an extended payment schedule. In addition, the significant share price weakness we experienced in late August and early September resulted in an uptick in repurchases and we were able to execute in the quarter. In all, we repurchased approximately $400 million of shares in the open market in the third quarter at an average purchase price of approximately $83 per share. Combined with the Vistra Vision 15% minority interest acquisition, which we view as similar to a forward share repurchase program with a deferred payment schedule, we were able to allocate a combined approximately $3.5 billion to the repurchase of our equity at an average indicative purchase price between $80 and $85 per share, roughly a 30% discount to our recent share price. Turning to Slide 6. Our four key strategic priorities remain integral to our strong business performance. As we have previously stated, we believe our integrated business model and comprehensive hedging program, provide our stakeholders increased visibility into our future financial performance. From an operational perspective, our team continues to deliver. Our generation team achieved overall commercial availability of approximately 96% for our gas and coal fleet. Our nuclear fleet also had an outstanding quarter with capacity factors averaging approximately 98% for the period as we continue to make great progress on our integration efforts. On the retail side, the team continues to outperform through both strong customer count performance in the Texas and Midwest Northeast markets as well as disciplined margin management. Finally, we are seeing persistent growth in our large business market segment through longer-term customer relationships as a result of providing solutions to meet customers' goals, including sustainability objectives and budget certainty. Switching to capital allocation, we remain disciplined in our approach by targeting a significant return of capital and executing on attractive growth projects like the Energy Harbor acquisition, while also maintaining a strong balance sheet. As part of this approach, we continue to execute the capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we have returned approximately $5.4 billion to our investors through open market share repurchases and common stock dividends. Chris will cover capital allocation in more detail later in the presentation. But you will see that we expect at least an additional $1.5 billion of capital available to allocate through year-end 2026. This number is net of our current capital responsibilities including the recently announced provision, 15% minority interest purchase and the recent Board authorization for an additional $1 billion of share repurchases expected to be executed by year-end 2026. Speaking of the balance sheet, our financial position remains strong with net debt at the end of the third quarter at approximately 2.7 times ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Although our net leverage is expected to move slightly above 3 times with the closing of the Vistra Vision 15% minority interest purchase, we expect it to fall back below 3 times in 2025. Moving to energy transition. As you know, our approach continues to responsibly balance reliability, affordability and sustainability while ensuring disciplined returns for our shareholders. The Vistra Vision 15% minority interest purchase is a great example of this strategy as we view the transaction as an attractive investment in our carbon-free assets and retail franchise. In addition to repurchasing the minority interest in our best-in-class retail business. Through this acquisition, we will increase our ownership of nuclear generation by approximately 970 megawatts and across our four sites at an average price of approximately $2,100 per kilowatt. We believe this compares very favorably to per unit cost for other nuclear generation alternatives such as plant uprates, new build, or additional M&A. Finally, the acquisition will result in an approximately 200-megawatt increase in our solar and storage capacity assets and we look forward to continued growth in this business through the disciplined execution of our existing project pipeline. As highlighted on Slide 7, and this year alone, we have seen numerous announcements of major manufacturing and data center additions by company spanning across industries. These announcements have spurred heightened awareness and projections of power demand growth. Some grid operators have already raised their expectations for demand growth through midyear updates while numerous industry observers have published forecasts reflecting an acceleration in power demand across the country. We also discussed this growth dynamic on our first and second quarter calls, specifically highlighting many of the drivers of power demand growth, including the build-out of large chip manufacturing facilities, partially due to the CHIPS Act the electrification of oil and gas load in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the reshoring of industrial activity and, of course, the build-out of data centers. As shown in the bar chart on the left, actual weather adjusted loan growth for 2024 in PJM and ERCOT not only exceeded historical rates, but is trending towards long-term forecasted levels. We believe the level of growth across both markets confirms our view that low growth is already occurring, and we expect it to continue. While there has been a lot of focus on FERC's rejection of the amended talent interconnection service agreement, or ISA, we believe there will be multiple paths to resolve any issues as it relates to that project and other similar projects. FERC's ruling was narrowly based on the commission's view that the ISA failed to meet previous FERC precedent, leaving the door open for a refiling of a streamlined ISA. Nothing about FERC ruling prevents us or other generators from contracting with customers who are seeking to co-locate for their needs. We will need to address open issues and find the path to FERC approval of interconnection service agreements, which we believe is doable. As we've stated before, there will be many large load opportunities that will have a variety of configurations, whether located next to a generation facility or in a more traditional front of the meter configuration. We don't believe there will be a one-size-fits-all approach to this, and there shouldn't be as customer needs will vary. This transmission is to meet these needs and that of our broader customer base just as we do today. I'm sure we will discuss this more in the Q&A, but I will turn it over to Kris to provide a detailed review of our third quarter results, our outlook and capital allocation. Kris?\nKris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 9. While the third quarter did not benefit from the same weather opportunities as last year, which we estimate added approximately $300 million to our earnings in the third quarter of 2023, Vistra was able to deliver solid results due to excellent operating performance and execution by our generation retail and commercial teams. Despite lower cleared wholesale prices compared to last year, our flexible generation fleet continued to perform extremely well and maximize available opportunities. Turning to retail. As expected, third quarter results reflected higher power costs compared to 2023. However, year-to-date results are meaningfully higher compared to 2023 as the team continues to deliver strong customer count and margin results. Finally, our third quarter 2024 results for both generation and retail benefited from the inclusion of Energy Harbor, which we estimate to be approximately $165 million for generation and approximately $35 million for retail. Moving to Slide 10. As Jim noted, we are raising and narrowing our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $5 billion to $5.2 billion. We are also raising and narrowing our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range to $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion. Although our team is executing at a high level across the business in 2024, this latest increase in our guidance range is primarily related to the performance of our retail business. Moving to 2025. The improvement in our outlook is attributable to increased expectations for both our generation and retail businesses, specifically as it relates to retail, we have previously communicated that we expected this business to contribute adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion on an annual basis. Due to several factors, including the addition of Energy Harbor, and sustained growth in residential demand in Texas and large business market demand across the country. We now expect the annual adjusted EBITDA contribution from this business over the next several years to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. However, for 2024, we do project our retail results to come in above that range due to a few tailwinds that are onetime in nature. Switching to ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth, the midpoint of our guidance range implies a conversion ratio of approximately 58%, comfortably in our previously indicated long-term target range of approximately 55% to 60%. Of course, our guidance and long-term outlook remains supported by our comprehensive hedging program. Our commercial team continues to be opportunistic in taking advantage of recent power market volatility, increasing our wholesale hedge balances to approximately 96% for calendar year 2025 and approximately 64% for calendar year 2026. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 11. Our share repurchase program has generated significant value for our shareholders. Since beginning the program in November 2021, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 30%, repurchasing approximately 158 million shares at an average price per share below $2. Notably, this reduction in our share count has led to an approximately 46% increase in our dividend per share since Q4 2021. Moving to the balance sheet. As of the end of the third quarter, our net leverage was comfortably below our long-term target of 3 times ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Although we expect that ratio to move slightly above 3 times when we close the acquisition of the 15% minority interest, we expect to delever quickly and be comfortably below 3 times by year-end 2025. Importantly, our business remains well capitalized and we continue to manage the balance sheet in a conservative way, as evidenced by the recent upgrade of our corporate credit rating to BB+ by Standard and Poor's. Finally, we will continue to be opportunistic, yet disciplined in the deployment of capital towards growth. To that end, we expect to spend approximately $700 million in 2024 and 2025 as we execute on our development project pipeline, including the recently announced solar projects for Amazon and Microsoft. Of course, we will continue to pursue opportunities to fund those expenditures with third-party capital, including nonrecourse loans. Finishing on Slide 12. Based on our guidance for 2025 and our current expected 2026 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity of at least $6 billion as well as our expectation that we will continue to achieve our targeted long-term ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth conversion rate, we project to generate a meaningful amount of capital through year-end 2026. We also expect our net leverage, excluding our nonrecourse financings to reduce materially as our earnings power improves, providing additional capital flexibility. As you can see, our current capital allocation plan through year-end 2026 continues to focus on shareholder return with over $6.5 billion allocated to the Vistra Vision 15% minority interest purchase, common and preferred dividends and expected open market share repurchases comprised of the approximately $2.2 billion remaining under the existing authorization through 2026, including the additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization announced today. However, despite the significant amount of capital already earmarked for shareholders, we still expect to have approximately $1.5 billion of incremental capital available for allocation through the end of 2026. Because this amount is based on $6 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, we see the potential for upside to this amount. As highlighted on the previous slide, over the last 3 years, we have been significant buyers of our common stock, including jump starting to repurchase by issuing preferred equity. However, it is important to remember that the decision to repurchase our stock was only one aspect of our capital allocation framework, we sought to balance capital return, maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet and executing on an opportunistic growth. We expect this framework to continue to guide our capital allocation decisions, not only through year-end 2026, but also over the longer term. Importantly, our return thresholds for both organic and inorganic growth have not changed, and we remain disciplined in choosing the opportunities we pursue. I do think it is also important to note that we still see our shares trading at an elevated free cash flow yield, especially when compared to the average free cash flow yield for companies in the S&P 500 and we continue to believe allocating capital to share repurchases is an important priority. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys. It's actually James [ph] on for Shar. Good morning and thanks for the time. So I guess maybe just coming back to the Susquehanna ISA and some of your prepared, I guess, how has the rejection impacted your customer conversations in the past week. One of your peers sounds committed to co-locations and other maybe more focused on front of the meter. I guess, where do you fall kind of within those soup polls? It sounds maybe a little more like colos, but just any more color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nJim Burke: James, we were disappointed with the ruling last Friday. But I think if you look at our discussions on this topic in the past, we've acknowledged that these are complicated deals. They take time they're large even by the standards of the customers that we're talking to. Then if you look at the quantity of deals that this country is going to do, the vast majority of them are going to be front of the meter. It's unique to have the large sites that we have and have an opportunity to do a co-located deal. We think there are multiple paths forward on this. We're not 100% sure how the other parties that are obviously active on that particular ISA you're going to want to pursue it. But nothing precludes us from still moving forward with our plans. I would acknowledge that everyone is looking at these types of issues and how do we work through them because they are they are novel. I mean some of the co-located deals even that we've done, they were smaller. And so when things are of this scale, there are more questions that need to be answered. But we think there's multiple paths forward. We can go into some details as to how we think that might play out. But our conversations are still continuing. We still have a number of really good options, both with our nuclear sites as well as gas sites and potentially the new build. And so I don't think that this is a load profile and a customer base that is going to slow down in aggregate. I just think it comes down to which areas of the country are more open to this? Are they able to attract this load because it's a huge economic development opportunity and we'll have to see how that plays out? And it could play out differently in different parts of the country. So I just think that's where we are, and it's a process. And we're going to work through it with our peers in the industry, the vertically integrated utilities. Obviously, the ISOs and any of the other stakeholders as we need.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. And then maybe just kind of piggybacking on that. If we could touch on your thoughts around additionality. Just we heard some commentary from certain members of the PUCT in recent weeks kind of calling for it. So I guess at this point, do you think a colo and ERCOT like Comanche Peak would have to come with additionality? Maybe just some more general thoughts there. Thanks.\nJim Burke: Yes. I do think there are a couple of issues obviously at play here. One is resource adequacy in general, right? So even without the additional data center load that could come to, say, Texas in this example, James, that you mentioned it, there have been questions about whether there's adequate price signals for new investment regardless of just the data center load. In fact, the data center load over the next 5 years to 6 years, will probably not be the largest source of load growth in ERCOT. It just so happens though when you start talking about the data centers, it looks like 1 big chunky load coming at a time, so it gets the attention. As you know, we've put out our announcement of our intention to add megawatts in ERCOT, both with the Coleto Creek conversion as well as the augmentation of existing gas sites, those two alone are going to bring 1,100 megawatts. The peakers are projects that we're still developing still need to see some of the market reforms come to fruition to make those economic or contracts, contracts that could come from bilateral contracts with customers can make those kinds of projects feasible. So I don't think this is a discussion that you can solve with just a rule because we've got multiple customer classes coming that are bringing additional load requirements to ERCOT. But I do think that the objective of the customers that we're talking to, they want to see resources at it. They're not looking to see the grid become tighter and tighter either. So we are very active in the discussion about what additional resources we can bring potentially even in addition to the ones we've already announced. And we hope that if that is a compact that works for all the stakeholders that could help set a confidence that welcoming the load to Texas or any part of the country is actually going to send the investment signal for the supply side and having discussions about whether we may or may not want the load can actually create its own problems. And so we've seen many cycles in this industry. People are prepared to invest and build if the signals are there. I think this is more than just a typical load coming to the market. This is a unique opportunity for regions of the country and specifically for the U.S. to lead on this topic for such a critical load and use its artificial intelligence. And I hope we all see it that way. And that's been our main focus in our discussions with policymakers.\nUnidentified Analyst: Excellent. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nJim Burke: Thank you, James.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey thanks, good morning.\nJim Burke: Good morning, David.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, maybe a little bit of a follow-up on that on your comments there, thanks. Very helpful. We heard yesterday from Encore that they're seeing over 80 gigawatts of data centers looking in just their service territory, at least in the pipeline. I mean just given that scale, there's just got to be a bunch of approaches, maybe diversity of approaches that these data centers are going to consider. And so maybe just given that, like what are you seeing as the interest in co-location at your gas plants in ERCOT? And then wondering if you could elaborate, too, on just that new build idea? Like are there -- are you in conversations with potential data centers that you might be able to partner with contract with a new plant build as well?\nJim Burke: Sure. David, great question. I'm going to start, I'm going to ask Stacey Dor\u00e9, our Head of Strategy, to comment on this. She's working on these types of opportunities on a very near full-time basis. It's certainly an active time for all those types of conversations. I'd start with load forecasts have been obviously extremely robust in ERCOT, CenterPoint put out some information about the kinds of load growth they're seeing in their territory, certainly Encore through the separate call yesterday, and ERCOT itself has revised middle of the summer, it's long-term load forecast. We've been a bit more conservative only because we believe still it's hard to understand the full duplication that could exist not only within a state, but even across the country because folks are looking for PaaS to get speed to be able to bring this load. And so they're exploring all options. I do think that demand, if we can satisfy it, I do think Texas is probably as well positioned as any part of the country to satisfy that demand. And we certainly want to be part of that, not only on providing the relationship for the load, but the potential addition of resources. So I'd like for Stacey to provide some color on the types of conversations we're having and how we're working with Encore, with CenterPoint with ERCOT to make sure that we can all solve this together.\nStacey Dor\u00e9: Yes. Thanks, Jim, and thanks for the question, David. So we are currently pursuing deals at multiple sites in our portfolio. We're also having some early conversations with some of the developers about a kind of portfolio approach where with one customer, we might be able to pursue colocation deals at multiple sites and combine that with even building some new generation. We have -- we're in pretty detailed customer discussions at some of our nuclear sites. There's a lot of interest, obviously, in the nuclear side. But we have ongoing conversations with several different development companies, about a handful of our gas sites, both in PJM and in ERCOT. And we're in early discussions with some of the hyperscalers about nuclear uprates, and some new build as well as Jim mentioned. And then finally, we're in discussions with two particular large companies about building new gas plants to support a data center project. So as you can see, these discussions just take a number of forms with multiple companies around multiple sites. And of course, we're including stakeholders in those conversations as well from policymakers to the applicable transmission distribution utilities. As we've said before, the diligence process for these deals takes a long time. It's an intense effort because these are very long-term commitments to purchasing power. And so we're devoting a lot of time and resources to these discussions, but we're excited about the opportunity, and we believe that the -- whether it's Texas or other states that we operate in, Pennsylvania, Ohio, these are jurisdictions that are really interested in welcoming this load because of the economic development it brings. And so it's a multiparty conversation for all of these projects.\nDavid Arcaro: Thanks for that. It makes sense just given the staggering scale here that so many options are under consideration. And I guess, maybe to ask it more directly to in terms of Comanche Peak. Have you seen Comanche Peak becoming better positioned here just after seeing the FERC challenges that have popped up in PJM? Like has urgency increased there? And just would be curious your latest thinking on what the timing of a deal could potentially be?\nStacey Dor\u00e9: Yes. Thanks, David. So we -- our discussions on Comanche Peak have been ongoing for some time, and there certainly is interest in in that location because of the speed-to-market advantage it has even before the FERC decision, frankly. I mean ERCOT and ERCOT is one of the fastest interconnection processes in the country. And the state prides itself on that, the TDUs and ERCOT as well working together to get load interconnected as an advantage in Texas. So certainly, the fact that ERCOT is not subject to the FERC jurisdiction and the order that came out last Friday has continued to make Comanche Peak an attractive site, but it was before the FERC order as well. So in terms of timing, it's hard to say exactly when we could conclude discussions on that side because, again, there's a lot of work to be done. There's a lot of stakeholders to involve not just ERCOT, policymakers Encore, who is the local TDU at that side, but local officials as well. So there's a lot of conversations to have, and we're well into that deep into that process and continuing to pursue that opportunity, and it's a great opportunity for Vistra and for customers.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fleishman: Hi, I guess I'll dare ask one other question on this topic, which is just Texas has emphasized availability of resources at kind of emergency or peak times and the like. Do you see solutions in ERCOT where you could have the generation even if it's co-located, available for kind of the more sensitive periods?\nJim Burke: Yes, Steve, we do. We have even noted, I think, in previous discussions, customers are learning how they can also manage their load during sort of emergency conditions. So whether it's something around a load response or whether it's the backup generation that could be also configured at the site. Again, I think these large customers, I think they're responding to some of the questions that they're receiving and the concerns around resource adequacy, and they're showing that they want to be part of that solution. So that is, again, to Stacey's earlier point, why these discussions do take some time, and they're complex is there's a lot of variables that we're managing. So I do think there's going to be some flexibility there, Steve, and I think that will help multiple stakeholders become comfortable with it.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then on the -- we just obviously had this big election result. And I'm just -- I know it's two days in, but just the -- any kind of thought process on what this means for kind of both new build gas and then also for your coal fleet?\nJim Burke: Yes, Steve, I'd tell you the election prediction business is tough, and so is the policy prediction business. It's -- I guess some of the thoughts that we are working through the GHG rule, and that's already being challenged, obviously, legally and with the DC circuit. There's -- that could potentially be revised at some point. And you can see that with this administration, that affected not only the coal units, but also new gas. And so that's something that -- we'll have to see how that plays out, and that could still take some time to play out, but that does appear to be more open at the moment, at least in concept. But getting back to this resource adequacy topic and also just the administration changes, it's hard to look at 30, 35-year assets and look at the changes that happen policy-wise on a 4-year cadence, and see through all of that. That's a difficult thing for investors to do. One of the things I like about our business model, and I don't think this is something we talk about a lot is that we're a pretty diversified company. We have geographic diversity across major markets in the U.S., different jurisdictions, all obviously, competitive markets but we have a broad technology diversity. The largest part of our fleet is gas-fired generation, but then it's nuclear and a coal business that's continuing to decline and a growing solar and battery business. So we have a lot of diversity in technologies and in line of business. You heard today, the retail business is large and growing. And that tends to be complementary to the generation business. So it's really hard to look at first and second order effects of potential policy changes, but I think we've demonstrated that we're flexible as a company and that will take opportunities that the market presents us and execute on it. So I view this as -- I wouldn't say this is normal course for Vistra, but this has been a lot of our history in the competitive market is having to adapt. And so we are obviously open to the technologies that you've mentioned. It's a big part of our portfolio, and we'll have to see if that if some of those get some extended life opportunities, but too early to call.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then one last quick one. You added the mention for 2026 of potentially meaningfully above the $6 billion. I don't know if you care to define what meaningfully means and the like or just in the event that -- in the event that the PJM auction just were to price where it did the last auction, is there any kind of more color you could give about that? Is that the main driver? Is it really more ERCOT pricing? Just any color would be helpful. Thank you.\nJim Burke: Steve, I'm going to let Kris take this one. Good question. We know words matter, and that would be one that you pick up on. So Kris?\nKris Moldovan: Yes, Steve, I think it's a combination of those things. I think, obviously, as you look at it, we're only -- we're 64% hedged. We're making progress in that area. But even if you look at our 2025 guidance, there's a good range around that. It's 5% plus or minus around our 2025 guidance, and we're 96% hedged there. So as we look out to 2026, and we see 64% hedged, you can imagine that our range around that is a little bit wider. And you also mentioned the PJM auction, that's an area. So we think it's still prudent to say $6 billion. I think if the auction comes in where we where it came in the last time and as we hedge a little bit more, we have built in some protection against those things potentially going against us. So you could see some upside. And I think that we're not going to we're not going to state where we see the upper end, but you can imagine that we've built in a little bit of upside to that if those things -- as we hedge more and as we see the auction results come in.\nSteven Fleishman: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nJim Burke: Hey Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: I just wanted to pick up, I guess, on the diversified footprint as you mentioned there. Just wondering how you think about the ERCOT versus PJM opportunity set at this point in time, particularly in light of the Town ISA ruling granted it's early days, but do you see things like this kind of starting to favor ERCOT more at the margin?\nJim Burke: I don't think so, Jeremy. The capacity, again, the ISA is one dimension, but a capacity market construct in PJM is something that I think creates a real opportunity to send a price signal and encourage investment, whether that's some assets that are on the grid to not retire or to bring new assets and obviously meeting the load growth that PJM is now forecasting that market design does not exist in Texas. And that's something that from a capacity market discussion, where it's an energy-only market. And so it has been a bit more volatile in terms of you might have a really strong summer in 2023, but we've had weaker clears in 2024. So if you were putting batteries on the grid right now in 2024, you're probably wondering if you're going to get a return on those batteries, whereas you might have felt really good about it heading into the summer of 2023. So the ISA is only one dimension. It's important to note that load is low. If this load comes into PJM, whether it's behind the meter or front of the meter, it's load growth a capacity market should send a signal like it did at the end of July, but there was intervention coming on the heels of that that's now led to a request for a 6-month delay. Again, as I stated earlier, if these markets would consistently run their opportunities for the auction in the case of PJM. And for Texas being clear about signaling wanting the load to come, I think these price signals would be there. There'd be investment opportunities in both of them. But right now, PJM has a more structured way of valuing capacity and signaling in a forward curve basis, the need for that capacity then does the ERCOT market.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Understood on the PJM capacity auction there. But maybe coming back to the power curves, how do you see that evolving over time? Do you think that demand is really reflected in future pricing there? Or how do you see that kind of evolving?\nJim Burke: Yes. That would get more to sort of a fundamental view of where do we think the curves are relative to this load growth. And I would say, it feels to me and Steve Muscato, our Head of our Wholesale and gen business can chime in here, but it feels to me that the curves are not factoring in all of this load growth at this point that there's a lot of forecasts out there, folks are going to want to see more data points that is actually coming to fruition. And we try to put in our presentation, we're seeing that we're on this curve of load growth. We put that in for what we're seeing in 2024. But as noted earlier in some of the questions, there's massive load growth being forecasted by the ISO as well as the wires companies. I would not say the curves reflect all of that coming in at this point. And I think just some of the recency of this summer is also weighing on the curves. And Steve, I would like to have you add some comments to that.\nSteve Muscato: Sure, Jim. I think people are extrapolating what I'll call historical load growth from the last 2 or 3 years of between 3% to 4% over the peaks. And I think they're putting that forward in their models. It really gets down to how much of -- I think someone mentioned the ENCORE study with 80 gigawatts of data. So how much of that actually gets in? And will we exceed the historical trends that we've seen before. And I also do think there's some recency bias. Unfortunately, power is only liquid may be out until 2028, 2029, it's hard to see beyond that, and there's not a lot of activity. And so the recent clears we saw, I think, this summer have weighed a little bit because I think people also try to figure out there's a very large asymmetry in pricing in Texas that we've seen both in the winter and in the summer. And one of the areas I think you'll see Traders focus on more in the future is what kind of premium do you put on winter because even if batteries continue to come into the market, which I think they're going to be challenged because they're -- as you mentioned earlier, Jim, they're cannibalizing the revenue streams. Right now, there's so many of them, there's more batteries in the market right now. Then the ancillary services can handle, which is their primary source of revenue, not necessarily under arbitrage. And when you mix that in with a winter event that's not just 1 or 2 hours in duration. I think you may see some more scarcity come into the winter curves going forward.\nJim Burke: And thank you, Steve. And I'd like to add, Jeremy, just two other dimensions. This was the first month that we've seen where the new additions in the queue for solar and storage and wind were actually less than the number of projects canceled or moved into inactive status. So I do think markets have a way of over time, rationalizing economics. The other thing I think that's weighed on the curves was the curves looked very attractive in the sort of May 2024 time frame. And I think the test the quantity of the test interest and the discussions of continuing TEF or even having a larger TEF. I'm sorry, I'm saying TEF, Texas Energy Fund. That is something that I think the markets are struggling to figure out how to handicap and look at is that only going to be an incentive for new generation only? Or is that going to send a signal to keep existing generation online. And so there's still a lot to sort out, I think, on the TEF because we're still in early stages with the due diligence process, and we're going to enter a legislative session next year. And I think folks are trying to figure out what is the state going to do if they're going to actually increase that quantity of assets qualifying for TEF or if they're going to let the market send a price signal to try to bring that investment. And I think that's still too early to call.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful there. That was kind of getting to my last question here with regards to TEF and just your project development activities in ERCOT, especially with the tough considerations that you said there, could you just, I guess, update us overall on your thought process?\nJim Burke: Sure. Yes. We did submit two peakers as part of the TEF application. Basically, each party that was selected, was selected for one project. So one of our two peakers was selected. As we stated when we made the announcement in May and have continued to stay since then, we want to see the actual development from a market design standpoint make progress. We -- our reliability standard has been developed. It's not linked to a requirement if we fall below a reserve or there are concerns around reliability is not linked to a market mechanism to procure additional resources in the market, but at least the reliability standard has been designed and will be studied on a periodic basis. The PCM performance credit mechanism is now hard capped at $1 billion. It was a net cap. So presumably, that could mean a lower overall quantity of resources being dedicated to a performance credit mechanism. And there are some discussions about even that being challenged potentially in the legislative session. So I think that in the ancillary services like the dispachable reliability reserve service are still to be figured out. Real-time co-optimization is in flight as well for ancillaries and energy that could be bearish for some price formation. And that also speaks to how do we incentivize resources to come into the state to meet the load growth. And I don't think we have all that figured out yet in Texas. And I think that's work that we've got to do as an industry so that we can continue to meet the need. We've designed our projects for the peakers that we're continuing to move forward. The team is working on all the efforts we need on site as well as with our key partners. But we also have off ramps to both of those peakers if the market developments that we need to see don't occur. And we hope that's not the case because we'd like to bring those peakers, but we've got to make economic decisions. And we're still not there yet.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you for that.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Jeremy.\nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So maybe first on 2026, maybe even 2027. So just wondering if by then, by 2026, 2027, you would expect to have any meaningful EBITDA impact from those data center deals, be it colocations or virtual PPAs? And also, if that changes the way you're hedging your especially baseload units in those outer years?\nJim Burke: Yes, Angie, thank you for the question. I would say it's tough to see it being meaningful in 2026, 2027 simply because of the physics building out what you need to on the ground and then obviously powering the site as resources, servers chips become available and installed. And that's after the study processes have to be done on the front end. And so the time line for these, you could be in a 4 to 5-year process before you're putting a meaningful amount of power to a co-located facility. So I think time line wise, it's not really affecting how we're thinking about the hedging in the more near term sort of this 2026, 2027. And if it did, we'd start layering it in, in a more -- we're pretty open, still obviously, 2027, more than 2026. So we hope that opportunity is there to be layering that in, but I would not say from a guidance perspective or from a hedging perspective, it's in the horizon that we've been talking to the market about in terms of our direction here for our earnings power.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then changing OpEx. So a lot of discussion, obviously, in interest in your nuclear plants. You have many more gas plants. Can you just give us a sense directionally about the pricing differential for nuclear assets versus gas assets? Is it as simple as just the carbon-free attributes or again, just even directionally, how these prices compare and the discussions that you have with the data centers. Thank you.\nJim Burke: Yes. Thank you, Angie. I would say we aren't able and really would prefer not to share pricing differences by asset class. But I will say that in previous calls, I've mentioned that customers look at this as a list of preferences. There's things that they are seeking that are more ideal including location and what kind of energy needs there might be for cooling, right? So there's all sorts of variables that are going to go into the equation of how valuable is this to a customer in speed and land and water and other variables are going to play into their willingness to pay under certain circumstances, more or less for different locations. And so I would not expect -- I could be wrong, but I would not expect the gas assets to have the same premium as nuclear because of the carbon 3 24/7 attributes of nuclear. But there is an openness to gas that we're encouraged about. And I think the flexibility of being able to work with these assets is attractive for a number of parties, including co-location partners that aren't directly the hyperscalers themselves. So I think I'd like to leave it at that, Angie, but I think that's the way we're thinking about it.\nAngie Storozynski: And then last one, I know I promised Eric, just one question. But could you comment about the transmission capacity around your PGM assets, especially the especially Beaver Valley. So for example, if there were to be a need for a virtual PPA in like in front of the meter deal for that asset, is the transmission sort of overbuilt around it? Or do you have to wait for upgrades?\nJim Burke: Yes, I'll start, Angie, and I'll ask Stacey for her views, but we sit in a pretty balanced area where we are from a congestion point of view with locations we have, the three locations there in PJM. There's still going to be study processes and efforts to connect load even if there is a perceived capacity available on the transmission system because there is still studying to be done about what adding load and particular spot is going to do to the whole system. And I don't think we view it necessarily as it's going to be faster or slower if there is some capacity or not, I think it's probably going to be slower if it's fun of the meter versus co-located. And I think that's what we need to work. Again, we may end up doing both in the area in that region of the country. Stacey, anything you'd like to add to that?\nStacey Dor\u00e9: I would just add that at Beaver Valley, we do have a necessary study agreement. It's already been studied that a load could be co-located there without negative impact to the grid. And so I agree with Jim that it's the benefit of colocation and the reason customers are pursuing it is for speed to market. So it will be faster than front of the meter. Having said that, again referencing what Jim said, earlier, there will be plenty of front-of-the-meter connections as well. And to the extent as we do with all customers that we can serve those customers with for their front of the meter connection, we're certainly open to those discussions and having some of those discussions as well.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke for any closing remarks.\nJim Burke: Yes. Thank you for joining us today. I want to thank the team for their continued execution and service to our customers and communities. We appreciate we're having this call in a very dynamic time. And I can just assure you our team is focused on delivering. We appreciate your interest in Vistra, and we certainly hope to see you in person soon. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 9. While the third quarter did not benefit from the same weather opportunities as last year, which we estimate added approximately $300 million to our earnings in the third quarter of 2023, Vistra was able to deliver solid results due to excellent operating performance and execution by our generation retail and commercial teams. Despite lower cleared wholesale prices compared to last year, our flexible generation fleet continued to perform extremely well and maximize available opportunities. Turning to retail. As expected, third quarter results reflected higher power costs compared to 2023. However, year-to-date results are meaningfully higher compared to 2023 as the team continues to deliver strong customer count and margin results. Finally, our third quarter 2024 results for both generation and retail benefited from the inclusion of Energy Harbor, which we estimate to be approximately $165 million for generation and approximately $35 million for retail. Moving to Slide 10. As Jim noted, we are raising and narrowing our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $5 billion to $5.2 billion. We are also raising and narrowing our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range to $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion. Although our team is executing at a high level across the business in 2024, this latest increase in our guidance range is primarily related to the performance of our retail business. Moving to 2025. The improvement in our outlook is attributable to increased expectations for both our generation and retail businesses, specifically as it relates to retail, we have previously communicated that we expected this business to contribute adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion on an annual basis. Due to several factors, including the addition of Energy Harbor, and sustained growth in residential demand in Texas and large business market demand across the country. We now expect the annual adjusted EBITDA contribution from this business over the next several years to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. However, for 2024, we do project our retail results to come in above that range due to a few tailwinds that are onetime in nature. Switching to ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth, the midpoint of our guidance range implies a conversion ratio of approximately 58%, comfortably in our previously indicated long-term target range of approximately 55% to 60%. Of course, our guidance and long-term outlook remains supported by our comprehensive hedging program. Our commercial team continues to be opportunistic in taking advantage of recent power market volatility, increasing our wholesale hedge balances to approximately 96% for calendar year 2025 and approximately 64% for calendar year 2026. Turning to capital allocation on Slide 11. Our share repurchase program has generated significant value for our shareholders. Since beginning the program in November 2021, we have reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 30%, repurchasing approximately 158 million shares at an average price per share below $2. Notably, this reduction in our share count has led to an approximately 46% increase in our dividend per share since Q4 2021. Moving to the balance sheet. As of the end of the third quarter, our net leverage was comfortably below our long-term target of 3 times ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Although we expect that ratio to move slightly above 3 times when we close the acquisition of the 15% minority interest, we expect to delever quickly and be comfortably below 3 times by year-end 2025. Importantly, our business remains well capitalized and we continue to manage the balance sheet in a conservative way, as evidenced by the recent upgrade of our corporate credit rating to BB+ by Standard and Poor's. Finally, we will continue to be opportunistic, yet disciplined in the deployment of capital towards growth. To that end, we expect to spend approximately $700 million in 2024 and 2025 as we execute on our development project pipeline, including the recently announced solar projects for Amazon and Microsoft. Of course, we will continue to pursue opportunities to fund those expenditures with third-party capital, including nonrecourse loans. Finishing on Slide 12. Based on our guidance for 2025 and our current expected 2026 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity of at least $6 billion as well as our expectation that we will continue to achieve our targeted long-term ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth conversion rate, we project to generate a meaningful amount of capital through year-end 2026. We also expect our net leverage, excluding our nonrecourse financings to reduce materially as our earnings power improves, providing additional capital flexibility. As you can see, our current capital allocation plan through year-end 2026 continues to focus on shareholder return with over $6.5 billion allocated to the Vistra Vision 15% minority interest purchase, common and preferred dividends and expected open market share repurchases comprised of the approximately $2.2 billion remaining under the existing authorization through 2026, including the additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization announced today. However, despite the significant amount of capital already earmarked for shareholders, we still expect to have approximately $1.5 billion of incremental capital available for allocation through the end of 2026. Because this amount is based on $6 billion of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, we see the potential for upside to this amount. As highlighted on the previous slide, over the last 3 years, we have been significant buyers of our common stock, including jump starting to repurchase by issuing preferred equity. However, it is important to remember that the decision to repurchase our stock was only one aspect of our capital allocation framework, we sought to balance capital return, maintaining a strong and resilient balance sheet and executing on an opportunistic growth. We expect this framework to continue to guide our capital allocation decisions, not only through year-end 2026, but also over the longer term. Importantly, our return thresholds for both organic and inorganic growth have not changed, and we remain disciplined in choosing the opportunities we pursue. I do think it is also important to note that we still see our shares trading at an elevated free cash flow yield, especially when compared to the average free cash flow yield for companies in the S&P 500 and we continue to believe allocating capital to share repurchases is an important priority. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. Yes, Steve, I think it's a combination of those things. I think, obviously, as you look at it, we're only -- we're 64% hedged. We're making progress in that area. But even if you look at our 2025 guidance, there's a good range around that. It's 5% plus or minus around our 2025 guidance, and we're 96% hedged there. So as we look out to 2026, and we see 64% hedged, you can imagine that our range around that is a little bit wider. And you also mentioned the PJM auction, that's an area. So we think it's still prudent to say $6 billion. I think if the auction comes in where we where it came in the last time and as we hedge a little bit more, we have built in some protection against those things potentially going against us. So you could see some upside. And I think that we're not going to we're not going to state where we see the upper end, but you can imagine that we've built in a little bit of upside to that if those things -- as we hedge more and as we see the auction results come in."

            "name": "Jim Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter 2024 operational and financial results. It has been an active year on a number of fronts, and I'm very proud of what the Vistra team has been able to deliver so far in 2024 while setting the stage for long-term value creation. Turning to Slide 5. I would like to recognize the Vistra team for another quarter of hard work and strong operational performance. Through their efforts, we achieved a solid quarterly financial results of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $1.444 million despite a continuation of the milder Texas weather we have experienced most of the year. The consistent execution from our team across generation, commercial and retail delivered reliable power and customer solutions that reflect the strength of our integrated business model. As you may remember from our second quarter results call, we indicated our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA was trending toward the upper end of the guidance range. I am pleased to report that with the results announced today and our outlook for the fourth quarter we are raising and narrowing our guidance range for 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to $5.0 billion to $5.2 billion with a midpoint above the upper end of our previous range. We are also raising and narrowing the guidance range for ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth to $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion. As we noted on our previous results call, our guidance excludes any potential benefit related to the nuclear production tax credit, or PTC, as we await clarity from treasury around the interpretation of gross receipts. However, based on year-to-date settled prices and the forward curve for the balance of the year, we believe the impact of the nuclear PTC to our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA could be approximately $500 million. Moving to our longer-term outlook. We are introducing guidance ranges for 2025 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth of $3.0 billion to $3.6 billion. Notably, our ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint of $5.8 billion is higher than the $5.7 billion upper end of our previously communicated range for 2025. While our ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2025 is not currently expected to benefit from the nuclear PTC at any significant amount due to the current level of forward price curves we do expect the availability of the nuclear PTC to provide downside protection in the event prices settle lower. For calendar year 2026, although our current hedge percentage has increased to approximately 64% of expected generation, a meaningful amount of gross margin variability remains. Further, the delay in the 2026, 2027 PJM capacity auction, including the potential modification of the associated auction parameters create some additional uncertainty. For these reasons, we are maintaining our outlook for our 2026 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity of over $6 billion with line of sight to potentially be meaningfully higher. Finally, the third quarter marked an active period of capital allocation and capital returns. On September 16, we announced the acquisition of the Vistra Vision 15% minority interest from our minority investors. We believe this acquisition will be highly accretive to our shareholders with an implied transaction multiple of less than 8 times enterprise value to EBITDA, 100% ownership upon closing at year-end and financial flexibility allow through an extended payment schedule. In addition, the significant share price weakness we experienced in late August and early September resulted in an uptick in repurchases and we were able to execute in the quarter. In all, we repurchased approximately $400 million of shares in the open market in the third quarter at an average purchase price of approximately $83 per share. Combined with the Vistra Vision 15% minority interest acquisition, which we view as similar to a forward share repurchase program with a deferred payment schedule, we were able to allocate a combined approximately $3.5 billion to the repurchase of our equity at an average indicative purchase price between $80 and $85 per share, roughly a 30% discount to our recent share price. Turning to Slide 6. Our four key strategic priorities remain integral to our strong business performance. As we have previously stated, we believe our integrated business model and comprehensive hedging program, provide our stakeholders increased visibility into our future financial performance. From an operational perspective, our team continues to deliver. Our generation team achieved overall commercial availability of approximately 96% for our gas and coal fleet. Our nuclear fleet also had an outstanding quarter with capacity factors averaging approximately 98% for the period as we continue to make great progress on our integration efforts. On the retail side, the team continues to outperform through both strong customer count performance in the Texas and Midwest Northeast markets as well as disciplined margin management. Finally, we are seeing persistent growth in our large business market segment through longer-term customer relationships as a result of providing solutions to meet customers' goals, including sustainability objectives and budget certainty. Switching to capital allocation, we remain disciplined in our approach by targeting a significant return of capital and executing on attractive growth projects like the Energy Harbor acquisition, while also maintaining a strong balance sheet. As part of this approach, we continue to execute the capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we have returned approximately $5.4 billion to our investors through open market share repurchases and common stock dividends. Chris will cover capital allocation in more detail later in the presentation. But you will see that we expect at least an additional $1.5 billion of capital available to allocate through year-end 2026. This number is net of our current capital responsibilities including the recently announced provision, 15% minority interest purchase and the recent Board authorization for an additional $1 billion of share repurchases expected to be executed by year-end 2026. Speaking of the balance sheet, our financial position remains strong with net debt at the end of the third quarter at approximately 2.7 times ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. Although our net leverage is expected to move slightly above 3 times with the closing of the Vistra Vision 15% minority interest purchase, we expect it to fall back below 3 times in 2025. Moving to energy transition. As you know, our approach continues to responsibly balance reliability, affordability and sustainability while ensuring disciplined returns for our shareholders. The Vistra Vision 15% minority interest purchase is a great example of this strategy as we view the transaction as an attractive investment in our carbon-free assets and retail franchise. In addition to repurchasing the minority interest in our best-in-class retail business. Through this acquisition, we will increase our ownership of nuclear generation by approximately 970 megawatts and across our four sites at an average price of approximately $2,100 per kilowatt. We believe this compares very favorably to per unit cost for other nuclear generation alternatives such as plant uprates, new build, or additional M&A. Finally, the acquisition will result in an approximately 200-megawatt increase in our solar and storage capacity assets and we look forward to continued growth in this business through the disciplined execution of our existing project pipeline. As highlighted on Slide 7, and this year alone, we have seen numerous announcements of major manufacturing and data center additions by company spanning across industries. These announcements have spurred heightened awareness and projections of power demand growth. Some grid operators have already raised their expectations for demand growth through midyear updates while numerous industry observers have published forecasts reflecting an acceleration in power demand across the country. We also discussed this growth dynamic on our first and second quarter calls, specifically highlighting many of the drivers of power demand growth, including the build-out of large chip manufacturing facilities, partially due to the CHIPS Act the electrification of oil and gas load in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the reshoring of industrial activity and, of course, the build-out of data centers. As shown in the bar chart on the left, actual weather adjusted loan growth for 2024 in PJM and ERCOT not only exceeded historical rates, but is trending towards long-term forecasted levels. We believe the level of growth across both markets confirms our view that low growth is already occurring, and we expect it to continue. While there has been a lot of focus on FERC's rejection of the amended talent interconnection service agreement, or ISA, we believe there will be multiple paths to resolve any issues as it relates to that project and other similar projects. FERC's ruling was narrowly based on the commission's view that the ISA failed to meet previous FERC precedent, leaving the door open for a refiling of a streamlined ISA. Nothing about FERC ruling prevents us or other generators from contracting with customers who are seeking to co-locate for their needs. We will need to address open issues and find the path to FERC approval of interconnection service agreements, which we believe is doable. As we've stated before, there will be many large load opportunities that will have a variety of configurations, whether located next to a generation facility or in a more traditional front of the meter configuration. We don't believe there will be a one-size-fits-all approach to this, and there shouldn't be as customer needs will vary. This transmission is to meet these needs and that of our broader customer base just as we do today. I'm sure we will discuss this more in the Q&A, but I will turn it over to Kris to provide a detailed review of our third quarter results, our outlook and capital allocation. Kris? James, we were disappointed with the ruling last Friday. But I think if you look at our discussions on this topic in the past, we've acknowledged that these are complicated deals. They take time they're large even by the standards of the customers that we're talking to. Then if you look at the quantity of deals that this country is going to do, the vast majority of them are going to be front of the meter. It's unique to have the large sites that we have and have an opportunity to do a co-located deal. We think there are multiple paths forward on this. We're not 100% sure how the other parties that are obviously active on that particular ISA you're going to want to pursue it. But nothing precludes us from still moving forward with our plans. I would acknowledge that everyone is looking at these types of issues and how do we work through them because they are they are novel. I mean some of the co-located deals even that we've done, they were smaller. And so when things are of this scale, there are more questions that need to be answered. But we think there's multiple paths forward. We can go into some details as to how we think that might play out. But our conversations are still continuing. We still have a number of really good options, both with our nuclear sites as well as gas sites and potentially the new build. And so I don't think that this is a load profile and a customer base that is going to slow down in aggregate. I just think it comes down to which areas of the country are more open to this? Are they able to attract this load because it's a huge economic development opportunity and we'll have to see how that plays out? And it could play out differently in different parts of the country. So I just think that's where we are, and it's a process. And we're going to work through it with our peers in the industry, the vertically integrated utilities. Obviously, the ISOs and any of the other stakeholders as we need. Yes. I do think there are a couple of issues obviously at play here. One is resource adequacy in general, right? So even without the additional data center load that could come to, say, Texas in this example, James, that you mentioned it, there have been questions about whether there's adequate price signals for new investment regardless of just the data center load. In fact, the data center load over the next 5 years to 6 years, will probably not be the largest source of load growth in ERCOT. It just so happens though when you start talking about the data centers, it looks like 1 big chunky load coming at a time, so it gets the attention. As you know, we've put out our announcement of our intention to add megawatts in ERCOT, both with the Coleto Creek conversion as well as the augmentation of existing gas sites, those two alone are going to bring 1,100 megawatts. The peakers are projects that we're still developing still need to see some of the market reforms come to fruition to make those economic or contracts, contracts that could come from bilateral contracts with customers can make those kinds of projects feasible. So I don't think this is a discussion that you can solve with just a rule because we've got multiple customer classes coming that are bringing additional load requirements to ERCOT. But I do think that the objective of the customers that we're talking to, they want to see resources at it. They're not looking to see the grid become tighter and tighter either. So we are very active in the discussion about what additional resources we can bring potentially even in addition to the ones we've already announced. And we hope that if that is a compact that works for all the stakeholders that could help set a confidence that welcoming the load to Texas or any part of the country is actually going to send the investment signal for the supply side and having discussions about whether we may or may not want the load can actually create its own problems. And so we've seen many cycles in this industry. People are prepared to invest and build if the signals are there. I think this is more than just a typical load coming to the market. This is a unique opportunity for regions of the country and specifically for the U.S. to lead on this topic for such a critical load and use its artificial intelligence. And I hope we all see it that way. And that's been our main focus in our discussions with policymakers. Thank you, James. Good morning, David. Sure. David, great question. I'm going to start, I'm going to ask Stacey Dore\u0301, our Head of Strategy, to comment on this. She's working on these types of opportunities on a very near full-time basis. It's certainly an active time for all those types of conversations. I'd start with load forecasts have been obviously extremely robust in ERCOT, CenterPoint put out some information about the kinds of load growth they're seeing in their territory, certainly Encore through the separate call yesterday, and ERCOT itself has revised middle of the summer, it's long-term load forecast. We've been a bit more conservative only because we believe still it's hard to understand the full duplication that could exist not only within a state, but even across the country because folks are looking for PaaS to get speed to be able to bring this load. And so they're exploring all options. I do think that demand, if we can satisfy it, I do think Texas is probably as well positioned as any part of the country to satisfy that demand. And we certainly want to be part of that, not only on providing the relationship for the load, but the potential addition of resources. So I'd like for Stacey to provide some color on the types of conversations we're having and how we're working with Encore, with CenterPoint with ERCOT to make sure that we can all solve this together.\nStacey Dore\u0301: Yes. Thanks, Jim, and thanks for the question, David. So we are currently pursuing deals at multiple sites in our portfolio. We're also having some early conversations with some of the developers about a kind of portfolio approach where with one customer, we might be able to pursue colocation deals at multiple sites and combine that with even building some new generation. We have -- we're in pretty detailed customer discussions at some of our nuclear sites. There's a lot of interest, obviously, in the nuclear side. But we have ongoing conversations with several different development companies, about a handful of our gas sites, both in PJM and in ERCOT. And we're in early discussions with some of the hyperscalers about nuclear uprates, and some new build as well as Jim mentioned. And then finally, we're in discussions with two particular large companies about building new gas plants to support a data center project. So as you can see, these discussions just take a number of forms with multiple companies around multiple sites. And of course, we're including stakeholders in those conversations as well from policymakers to the applicable transmission distribution utilities. As we've said before, the diligence process for these deals takes a long time. It's an intense effort because these are very long-term commitments to purchasing power. And so we're devoting a lot of time and resources to these discussions, but we're excited about the opportunity, and we believe that the -- whether it's Texas or other states that we operate in, Pennsylvania, Ohio, these are jurisdictions that are really interested in welcoming this load because of the economic development it brings. And so it's a multiparty conversation for all of these projects. Yes, Steve, we do. We have even noted, I think, in previous discussions, customers are learning how they can also manage their load during sort of emergency conditions. So whether it's something around a load response or whether it's the backup generation that could be also configured at the site. Again, I think these large customers, I think they're responding to some of the questions that they're receiving and the concerns around resource adequacy, and they're showing that they want to be part of that solution. So that is, again, to Stacey's earlier point, why these discussions do take some time, and they're complex is there's a lot of variables that we're managing. So I do think there's going to be some flexibility there, Steve, and I think that will help multiple stakeholders become comfortable with it. Yes, Steve, I'd tell you the election prediction business is tough, and so is the policy prediction business. It's -- I guess some of the thoughts that we are working through the GHG rule, and that's already being challenged, obviously, legally and with the DC circuit. There's -- that could potentially be revised at some point. And you can see that with this administration, that affected not only the coal units, but also new gas. And so that's something that -- we'll have to see how that plays out, and that could still take some time to play out, but that does appear to be more open at the moment, at least in concept. But getting back to this resource adequacy topic and also just the administration changes, it's hard to look at 30, 35-year assets and look at the changes that happen policy-wise on a 4-year cadence, and see through all of that. That's a difficult thing for investors to do. One of the things I like about our business model, and I don't think this is something we talk about a lot is that we're a pretty diversified company. We have geographic diversity across major markets in the U.S., different jurisdictions, all obviously, competitive markets but we have a broad technology diversity. The largest part of our fleet is gas-fired generation, but then it's nuclear and a coal business that's continuing to decline and a growing solar and battery business. So we have a lot of diversity in technologies and in line of business. You heard today, the retail business is large and growing. And that tends to be complementary to the generation business. So it's really hard to look at first and second order effects of potential policy changes, but I think we've demonstrated that we're flexible as a company and that will take opportunities that the market presents us and execute on it. So I view this as -- I wouldn't say this is normal course for Vistra, but this has been a lot of our history in the competitive market is having to adapt. And so we are obviously open to the technologies that you've mentioned. It's a big part of our portfolio, and we'll have to see if that if some of those get some extended life opportunities, but too early to call. Steve, I'm going to let Kris take this one. Good question. We know words matter, and that would be one that you pick up on. So Kris? Hey Jeremy. I don't think so, Jeremy. The capacity, again, the ISA is one dimension, but a capacity market construct in PJM is something that I think creates a real opportunity to send a price signal and encourage investment, whether that's some assets that are on the grid to not retire or to bring new assets and obviously meeting the load growth that PJM is now forecasting that market design does not exist in Texas. And that's something that from a capacity market discussion, where it's an energy-only market. And so it has been a bit more volatile in terms of you might have a really strong summer in 2023, but we've had weaker clears in 2024. So if you were putting batteries on the grid right now in 2024, you're probably wondering if you're going to get a return on those batteries, whereas you might have felt really good about it heading into the summer of 2023. So the ISA is only one dimension. It's important to note that load is low. If this load comes into PJM, whether it's behind the meter or front of the meter, it's load growth a capacity market should send a signal like it did at the end of July, but there was intervention coming on the heels of that that's now led to a request for a 6-month delay. Again, as I stated earlier, if these markets would consistently run their opportunities for the auction in the case of PJM. And for Texas being clear about signaling wanting the load to come, I think these price signals would be there. There'd be investment opportunities in both of them. But right now, PJM has a more structured way of valuing capacity and signaling in a forward curve basis, the need for that capacity then does the ERCOT market. Yes. That would get more to sort of a fundamental view of where do we think the curves are relative to this load growth. And I would say, it feels to me and Steve Muscato, our Head of our Wholesale and gen business can chime in here, but it feels to me that the curves are not factoring in all of this load growth at this point that there's a lot of forecasts out there, folks are going to want to see more data points that is actually coming to fruition. And we try to put in our presentation, we're seeing that we're on this curve of load growth. We put that in for what we're seeing in 2024. But as noted earlier in some of the questions, there's massive load growth being forecasted by the ISO as well as the wires companies. I would not say the curves reflect all of that coming in at this point. And I think just some of the recency of this summer is also weighing on the curves. And Steve, I would like to have you add some comments to that. And thank you, Steve. And I'd like to add, Jeremy, just two other dimensions. This was the first month that we've seen where the new additions in the queue for solar and storage and wind were actually less than the number of projects canceled or moved into inactive status. So I do think markets have a way of over time, rationalizing economics. The other thing I think that's weighed on the curves was the curves looked very attractive in the sort of May 2024 time frame. And I think the test the quantity of the test interest and the discussions of continuing TEF or even having a larger TEF. I'm sorry, I'm saying TEF, Texas Energy Fund. That is something that I think the markets are struggling to figure out how to handicap and look at is that only going to be an incentive for new generation only? Or is that going to send a signal to keep existing generation online. And so there's still a lot to sort out, I think, on the TEF because we're still in early stages with the due diligence process, and we're going to enter a legislative session next year. And I think folks are trying to figure out what is the state going to do if they're going to actually increase that quantity of assets qualifying for TEF or if they're going to let the market send a price signal to try to bring that investment. And I think that's still too early to call. Sure. Yes. We did submit two peakers as part of the TEF application. Basically, each party that was selected, was selected for one project. So one of our two peakers was selected. As we stated when we made the announcement in May and have continued to stay since then, we want to see the actual development from a market design standpoint make progress. We -- our reliability standard has been developed. It's not linked to a requirement if we fall below a reserve or there are concerns around reliability is not linked to a market mechanism to procure additional resources in the market, but at least the reliability standard has been designed and will be studied on a periodic basis. The PCM performance credit mechanism is now hard capped at $1 billion. It was a net cap. So presumably, that could mean a lower overall quantity of resources being dedicated to a performance credit mechanism. And there are some discussions about even that being challenged potentially in the legislative session. So I think that in the ancillary services like the dispachable reliability reserve service are still to be figured out. Real-time co-optimization is in flight as well for ancillaries and energy that could be bearish for some price formation. And that also speaks to how do we incentivize resources to come into the state to meet the load growth. And I don't think we have all that figured out yet in Texas. And I think that's work that we've got to do as an industry so that we can continue to meet the need. We've designed our projects for the peakers that we're continuing to move forward. The team is working on all the efforts we need on site as well as with our key partners. But we also have off ramps to both of those peakers if the market developments that we need to see don't occur. And we hope that's not the case because we'd like to bring those peakers, but we've got to make economic decisions. And we're still not there yet. Thank you, Jeremy. Yes, Angie, thank you for the question. I would say it's tough to see it being meaningful in 2026, 2027 simply because of the physics building out what you need to on the ground and then obviously powering the site as resources, servers chips become available and installed. And that's after the study processes have to be done on the front end. And so the time line for these, you could be in a 4 to 5-year process before you're putting a meaningful amount of power to a co-located facility. So I think time line wise, it's not really affecting how we're thinking about the hedging in the more near term sort of this 2026, 2027. And if it did, we'd start layering it in, in a more -- we're pretty open, still obviously, 2027, more than 2026. So we hope that opportunity is there to be layering that in, but I would not say from a guidance perspective or from a hedging perspective, it's in the horizon that we've been talking to the market about in terms of our direction here for our earnings power. Yes. Thank you, Angie. I would say we aren't able and really would prefer not to share pricing differences by asset class. But I will say that in previous calls, I've mentioned that customers look at this as a list of preferences. There's things that they are seeking that are more ideal including location and what kind of energy needs there might be for cooling, right? So there's all sorts of variables that are going to go into the equation of how valuable is this to a customer in speed and land and water and other variables are going to play into their willingness to pay under certain circumstances, more or less for different locations. And so I would not expect -- I could be wrong, but I would not expect the gas assets to have the same premium as nuclear because of the carbon 3 24/7 attributes of nuclear. But there is an openness to gas that we're encouraged about. And I think the flexibility of being able to work with these assets is attractive for a number of parties, including co-location partners that aren't directly the hyperscalers themselves. So I think I'd like to leave it at that, Angie, but I think that's the way we're thinking about it. Yes, I'll start, Angie, and I'll ask Stacey for her views, but we sit in a pretty balanced area where we are from a congestion point of view with locations we have, the three locations there in PJM. There's still going to be study processes and efforts to connect load even if there is a perceived capacity available on the transmission system because there is still studying to be done about what adding load and particular spot is going to do to the whole system. And I don't think we view it necessarily as it's going to be faster or slower if there is some capacity or not, I think it's probably going to be slower if it's fun of the meter versus co-located. And I think that's what we need to work. Again, we may end up doing both in the area in that region of the country. Stacey, anything you'd like to add to that?\nStacey Dore\u0301: I would just add that at Beaver Valley, we do have a necessary study agreement. It's already been studied that a load could be co-located there without negative impact to the grid. And so I agree with Jim that it's the benefit of colocation and the reason customers are pursuing it is for speed to market. So it will be faster than front of the meter. Having said that, again referencing what Jim said, earlier, there will be plenty of front-of-the-meter connections as well. And to the extent as we do with all customers that we can serve those customers with for their front of the meter connection, we're certainly open to those discussions and having some of those discussions as well. Yes. Thank you for joining us today. I want to thank the team for their continued execution and service to our customers and communities. We appreciate we're having this call in a very dynamic time. And I can just assure you our team is focused on delivering. We appreciate your interest in Vistra, and we certainly hope to see you in person soon. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Micek, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEric Micek: Good morning, and thank you all for joining Vistra's Investor Webcast discussing our second quarter 2024 results. Our discussion today is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There you can also find copies of today's investor presentation and earnings release. Leading the call today are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. Our earnings release, presentation, and other matters discussed on the call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of Vistra's website. Also, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. I encourage all listeners to review the Safe Harbor statements included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explains the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2024 operational and financial results. Beginning on Slide 5, you can see the team has been hard at work across multiple parts of our business. Through their efforts, we achieved ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $1.414 billion, a very strong second quarter against a backdrop of lower wholesale energy prices across the country. While results benefited from the inclusion of the first full quarter contribution from the Energy Harbor businesses, consistent execution from our generation, commercial, and retail teams played a major role in this achievement. Specifically, our diversified portfolio of generation assets produced record levels of power for our customers while completing the planned outages needed to prepare the fleet for the crucial summer months. Our retail business led by our flagship TXU Energy brand delivered year-over-year growth, while producing solid margin performance and maintaining a top score on the PUC of Texas power to choose scorecard. Finally, despite the weather volatility across the country in general, power prices cleared below our hedge levels. Through strong execution of our comprehensive hedging program by our commercial team, our second quarter results reflect the solid performance anticipated when we set our expectations for the year. Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our guidance range for 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $4.550 billion to $5.050 billion. Based on performance to date and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are confident in our ability to deliver towards the upper end of this range. As we noted during our first quarter results call, our guidance excludes any potential benefit related to the nuclear production tax credit or PTC, given the uncertainty around the interpretation of gross receipts in the regulations. However, based on where prices settled in the first seven months of the year and the forward curves for the balance of the year, we believe the impact of the PTC to our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA could be upwards of $400 million. Moving to our long-term outlook. Our integrated business model, which combines critical dispatchable generation assets with a premier retail business, positions us well to create long-term value in the current volatile and growing markets. Given our hedging activity over the past several months and the recent 2025-2026 PJM planning year auction results, we are raising our estimated 2025 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA mid-point opportunity range by $200 million to $5.200 billion to $5.700 billion. Similar to our 2024 guidance, our range of 2025 ongoing operations mid-point opportunities excludes any estimates related to the nuclear PTC. However, it is important to note that we believe the nuclear PTC will provide downside support for such range of opportunities and we will continue to evaluate the appropriate timing for including PTC estimates in our forecasts. Underpinning the improvement in our outlook is our focus on our four key strategic priorities outlined on Slide 6. Our integrated business model leverages our diverse portfolio of generation assets coupled with our strong retail brands to deliver more consistent results as evidenced by our second quarter performance. Our core tenant of one team continues to foster not only teamwork, but drives learning and best practices across all aspects of our company to create a culture of continuous improvement, including at our recently added PJM nuclear sites. As discussed on the previous slide, our commercial teams continue to execute on our comprehensive hedging program to provide visibility into the earnings power of the business, while also providing meaningful downside protection to our long-term outlook. While our current 2024 guidance and long-term outlook both exclude any estimates related to the nuclear PTC, we believe the availability of a nuclear PTC de-risks a substantial portion of the earnings potential of our nuclear assets, making them increasingly more valuable. Switching to capital allocation, we view this as a critical responsibility and we will remain disciplined in our allocation process. We continue to execute the capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we've returned approximately $5 billion to our investors, including $4.25 billion of share repurchases through August 5 of this year. We expect to execute at least $2.25 billion of share repurchases throughout 2024 and 2025. Moving to the balance sheet. Our financial position remains strong with net leverage at the end of the quarter at 3x ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. We continue to expect net leverage to be below 3x by year-end 2024. On energy transition, we continue to be opportunistic in executing on a renewable development pipeline. We began construction on two new large scale solar projects, one in Texas and one in Illinois. To ensure full off-take from these facilities, we executed new long-term power purchase agreements with two of the world's leading technology companies, one with Amazon and the other with Microsoft. We are excited to partner with these well-known companies to provide carbon free electricity for their operations. Moving forward, our development opportunity pipeline remains robust. Our large geographic footprint across the country, which encompasses more than 70 sites with grid interconnects and thousands of acres of land for development, provides ample opportunities to meet customer needs for a particular energy technology or to co-locate operations. Our approach to the energy expansion continues to responsibly balance reliability, affordability and sustainability while ensuring disciplined project returns for our shareholders. We have highlighted this approach in our most recent sustainability report, which we published on July 31. We are proud of the approach we take to sustainability, which ensures that we are reducing our emissions while also creating a sustainable business strategy for all of our stakeholders. Moving to Slide 7. We see a potential significant supply gap emerging in the largest markets we serve. During our first quarter results call, we outlined the potential multiple drivers of future demand and these include the reassuring of industrial activity partially due to the CHIPS Act, the build out of data centers, whether behind the meter or in front of the meter, increased electrification of commercial, industrial and residential loads and strong population growth, particularly in Texas. In addition this demand growth, we believe current environmental policies will drive significant retirements of dispatchable thermal generation, notably coal plants, through the end of the decade, creating a supply/demand gap. Many of these policies are driven by decisions at the state level and are less influenced by federal policies. Supported by PJM's recent market reforms, the higher clearing prices for the 2025/2026 capacity auction are beginning to signal to competitive market participants, including investors who can respond to this supply gap. While it is only one auction clear, capacity revenues over time can help offset lower wholesale energy prices, which have softened in the outer year since our last call in May. Generation units are long-lived assets, and a consistent, predictable market framework focused on reliability is necessary to attract capital for new dispatchable supply. The Texas market relies almost exclusively on the wholesale energy price to incentivize new generation, and we have seen a lot of volatility in these forward curves. Policymakers have recently created the Texas Energy Fund to provide lower cost financing and completion bonuses for up to 10 gigawatts of new gas fuel dispatchable generation. This does provide some financial support for new build, but we believe forward price signals and market reforms will be necessary to attract sufficient equity capital to build new gas fuel generation. However, in a competitive market, as has been the case in Texas for nearly 30 years, there will be many market participants and investors to evaluate their opportunities and decide their best path forward. As we announced in late May, we are targeting up to 2,000 megawatts of dispatchable gas fuel generation additions at ERCOT. This includes 500 megawatts of augmentations at existing facilities, nearly half of which we have brought online already this summer, and up to 600 megawatts from the conversion of our Coleto Creek coal plant to a gas fueled unit, which will take place after the plant's retirement in the middle of 2027. These investments represent accretive opportunities for our company while preserving good paying jobs for our fellow Texans. We also submitted our application in July for the Texas Energy Fund financing for up to 860 megawatts of advanced peaker plants in West Texas. As noted in our announcement, we are in the early stages of development of these plants as we monitor the successful implementation of key market reforms focused on grid reliability as well as sufficient market signals. These key reforms include a suite of ancillary services, the performance credit mechanism, or PCM, and an effective reliability standard, a first for Texas. We will continue to work with policymakers and other stakeholders to shape a robust framework for investment in Texas. Looking broadly across the markets we serve, the interconnection queues are largely filled with wind, solar and battery resources for a number of reasons, including tax incentives, state policies and the preferences of large customers. The combination of low growth coal plant retirements and additional intermittent resources will require both baseload and flexible dispatchable units. Vistra is well-positioned with its diversified fleet and we will continue to work with policymakers, customers, and communities to ensure their energy needs are met reliably, affordably, and sustainably. This is what drives our purpose at Vistra and our team is excited about the future set of opportunities. And with that, I will turn it over to Kris to provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Kris?\nKris Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 9, Vistra delivered another strong quarterly result with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.414 billion including $625 million from generation and $789 million from retail. This represents an approximately 40% improvement year-over-year and brings our year-to-date ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to $2.227 billion. Notably, the performance of generation and retail year-to-date, together with our forecast for both businesses for the remainder of the year are driving our confidence in Vistra's ability to deliver 2024 aggregate results towards the upper end of the guidance range. Focusing on year-over-year results despite continued mild summer weather in Texas and lower wholesale prices across competitive markets, the generation team once again capitalized on the volatility in the quarter by optimizing the run profile of our generation units, including ramping down and buying power from the market when economically appropriate. The team's ability to perform in a variety of market conditions is made possible by the consistently high operational performance, the diversity and the flexibility of our fleet. Turning to retail, our second quarter results benefited from the continuation of higher counts and margins cited in the first quarter. Additionally, as expected, due to the evolving seasonality of underlying power costs, the retail team delivered a significantly higher portion of the expected annual ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2024 as compared to 2023. Finally, our 2024 results for generation of retail have benefited from the inclusion of the former energy harbor businesses, which benefit totaled approximately $200 million for the second quarter and approximately $260 million year-to-date. The contribution from these businesses for both the second quarter and year-to-date results was primarily driven by the PJM nuclear fleet, which accounted for approximately three quarters of the contribution in both periods. Moving to Slide 10. We have seen significant volatility in forward power price curves in the last several months. However, our commercial team was able to take advantage of this volatility, increasing our wholesale hedge balances to approximately 86% in calendar year 2025 and approximately 55% in calendar year 2026 at what we believe to be attractive prices. As Jim noted earlier, given our current hedge positions in 2025, combined with the prices realized in the recent 2025/2026 PJM planning year capacity auction, we increased our estimate for the 2025 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA mid-point opportunity range by $200 million. Although forward power prices have generally fallen since our first quarter earnings call, the additional hedges we have executed and the 2025/2026 PJM auction results continue to give us confidence in our estimated 2026 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA mid-point opportunity of more than $6 billion even before we update our assumptions for the upcoming 2026/2027 PJM planning year capacity auction. Notably, as is the case with our 2024 guidance, our long-term outlook excludes any estimates related to the nuclear PTC, which could be meaningful. Finally, we continue to target a conversion rate of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow before growth of 55% to 60% for 2025 and beyond, excluding any upside from the nuclear PTC, which is generally expected to benefit adjusted free cash flow before growth at least one year after being recognized in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. As a result, we expect to generate a meaningful amount of unallocated capital through 2026, which we expect to discuss in more detail on our third quarter results call in November. Finally, we provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan on Slide 11. Our share repurchase program has generated significant value to our shareholders. Since beginning the program in November 2021, we reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 135 million shares or approximately 29% at an average price per share of approximately $27.50. Despite the increase in our stock price in 2024, we still see our shares trading at an elevated free cash flow yield and continue to believe allocating capital to share repurchases is an important priority. To that end, as Jim noted, we expect to execute at least $2.25 billion of share repurchases over the course of 2024 and 2025, and at least an additional $1 billion in 2026. Moving to the balance sheet. Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits at 3x ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, despite the additional debt that was required to close the Energy Harbor acquisition in the first quarter of this year. We expect it to return to below 3x by the end of 2024. We continue to target a long-term net leverage ratio, not including the benefit of margin deposits below 3x. As Jim discussed earlier, we are excited to announce the two long-term power purchase agreements with Amazon and Microsoft for two new large scale solar facilities. As a reminder, we expect to fund approximately 60% to 70% of our solar and energy storage capital expenditures with non-recourse financing. We remain committed to our opportunistic approach to our solar and energy storage growth strategy and continue to target levered returns of mid-teens or higher for these projects. Finally, as we highlighted in the first quarter results call, in connection with the closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, we have begun paying dividends to the minority investors in Vistra Vision. Our current expectation is that we will pay approximately $135 million of such dividends in 2024. We view these dividends as part of our capital allocation program as we continue to analyze Vistra's earnings power on a consolidated basis. We are very proud of the Vistra team's performance in the first half of the year and we remain committed to executing against our four strategic priorities. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions.\nOperator: We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning, Jim. Jim, just in light of the PJM capacity print, would you consider investing in new gas or storage and RTO at this point? I mean, do you think one or two more prints at this level are sufficient to attract new entry? Does this kind of change any of your thinking regarding any potential coal to gas on the Sunset fleet? Thanks.\nJim Burke: Yes. Shar, it's a great question. PJM has been working on market reforms for quite some time, and we've talked about that on previous calls. It's a long process, and I think they've made great headway in looking at the sort of contribution that different resource classes, like dispatchable, can provide. And I think we saw that reflected in this most recent clear. It is only one auction, of course, and not long enough out in the future to be starting a new project because they are behind, obviously, and they're catching up on the number of auctions in the next couple of years. This December will be another interesting signal. We think it can clear at or above where this most recent clear was just given some of the fundamentals. And I think that does make PJM attractive. I think that's one of the things that PJM is offering now is a signal towards assets that provides us reliability benefit. We have a number of sites in PJM operating. We obviously have some coal plants, we could look at potential conversions at some point to gas. And I think others will look at that as well. But it is a good signal. Shar, it's still early stages, but I think a lot of progress has been made there.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then just, Jim, on 2026, right, obviously, you reiterated the mid-point opportunity, but we saw some trade-offs between the curves falling in the blowout PJM capacity number.\nJim Burke: Right.\nShar Pourreza: But the question is like, would you have been at that $6 billion figure before the auction results? Maybe if you could just put a little bit of a finer point on the ranges around the year, even directionally? Thanks.\nJim Burke: Sure. Yes, good question, Shar. So when we first announced the $6 billion plus, we were talking about this on the May call. Curves were actually quite strong at that point in time in the market in Texas and PJM, frankly, across the country. As you know, the curves have come off quite a bit. We were about 50% hedged on that call. Now we're about 55% hedged. So we have seen some gross margin for particularly the unhedged portion, erode some of the 2026 earnings. But we had a sense because of our open position, Shar, we wouldn't have put $6 billion plus out if we couldn't handle some volatility in the curves because that's just the nature of the business we're in. With this clear, obviously, that captures only part of 2026 and this auction coming up in December will capture the other part of 2026. We did not revise the 2026 number. As you noted, we did revise 2025. I think with these -- with the clear we've had, in this upcoming clear, we are strongly above the $6 billion plus figure, but we're going to refresh that next quarter. When we come out next quarter, we'll give you a 2025 guidance number, which is not what we've provided today. We merely reflected the auction clear for 2025, and we'll give more visibility into 2026. But the business has been very resilient. And I think these -- the diversification of our fleet, plus having the retail business, the earnings power of the business is strong.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then just one more quick one. Just on the FERC Technical Conference, I know you guys have been obviously super vocal in the Susquehanna ISA amendment process. Has that -- the technical conference, has that slowed any of the conversations you've been having with customers around co-location opportunities? Thanks.\nJim Burke: Hey Shar, it has not slowed. The conversation is down. I think, first of all, these conversations are numerous. They are not only are there a lot of customers having -- that we're having conversations with, but they're having conversations with a lot of potential suppliers like ourselves. We're making really good progress with our customers. We're in due diligence for a number of sites. Clearly, this process, including a technical conference will -- it is of interest to folks. But these are some long-dated conversations and these are sizable decisions that folks are making. If they contract for one of our larger sites, for instance, they could be approaching $1 billion a year in power costs at a single site. So these take time to evolve, but it has not slowed the pace of play. I think there's going to be plenty of data center load behind the meter or co-located and also front of the meter. I think there's going to be plenty. And I think they're evaluating these customers are evaluating all their options. So we'll see how the technical conference goes. We're clearly in support FERC approving this amended ISA. We think the record is very clear on that, but more to come, and we're going to stay active, as I know all of the market participants will. But this is a really big opportunity for our industry to meet customer needs. And frankly, create a lot of jobs, a lot of economic development, and I hope as an industry we don't get in our own way here and that we're able to see that this load growth is really beneficial for our economy broadly. And we expect these conversations to stay active until we get to a decision with a couple of key customers, which we're pretty optimistic about.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. Thank you guys so much. Much appreciated. See you again.\nJim Burke: Thank you, Shar.\nOperator: The next question is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So just continuing on this topic of the co-locations and general, the load growth. So we're seeing some raised conversations from wires on the utilities and competitive markets, PJM, in particular, they are seemingly concerned about the load growth and reliability of the electric service over the next couple of years as this load materializes. And so that led to some concerns about potential interventions in competitive power markets, regulated new build, you name it. And that seemingly is not just response to the new build projections, but also to this last PJM capacity auction. I mean, it's somewhat concerning, right, because the same parties were not raising their hands to support merchant power plants when power prices were super low. And seemingly, it should be a cyclical market where we should spikes in power and capacity prices to incentivize new build. So I mean, how do you manage this narrative? Do you sort of rush your assets to contract them to protect them against any sort of market interventions? Is it just -- do you think that this is just a rhetoric that will pass? Is the basically the pull so big that all parties can benefit? I mean my take has been that just -- that goes to show that wires on the utilities know that the best way to benefit is through generation assets, but I'm just going to wonder how you're going to approach that.\nJim Burke: Yes. Angie, there's a lot in that question. It is something we think about quite a bit. The beauty of a competitive market is anybody can build generation in a competitive market, and that includes the regulated utilities as long as they're doing it in the competitive market context. That framework has shown over the years to over $80 billion has been invested by competitive companies in PJM since the market opened over $100 billion has been invested by competitive companies at ERCOT since the market opened. This is the first clear, as we just talked about, that has shown real life in quite some time. And while it looks like it's 9x to 10x higher than the last clear, on average is bringing maybe 40% to 50% of what you would need to build a new gas plant. This is not a clear that in and of itself without energy margin makes all the math work from an investor point of view. I know the regulated utilities feel a need to serve their customers with a reliable product, and we feel that need as well. That is a core tenant of our strategy. I think there's plenty of investment opportunities on the transmission and distribution side to not only serve new load but to connect the new generation resources. And that queue has been slow to develop in PJM, and I know PJM wants to accelerate that. So I still go back to what I said just a minute ago, I don't think we should be worried about, are there some ancillary services that need to be paid or some wires charges that need to be paid. The customers we're talking to, want to pay for the services that they're being delivered, whether that's on the wire side or the generation side. I think there's plenty of opportunity for all of us to work together to not only make this an economic opportunity for our respective companies, but to meet the customer need. That's ultimately what we're doing here is meeting a customer need and I think we're going to all have to work together to do it. But it's something that I think, Angie, is going to unfold through time. Nothing happens in the power market as fast as the technology space would like it to. And frankly, as fast as we would like it to. So I think we just need to keep the dialogue open and work through these issues. But we think there's plenty to go around for this to be a real boom for all stakeholders.\nAngie Storozynski: And then as far as your approach to those co-location deals and any other long-term contracts, I mean it seems like you were taking this portfolio strategy. But I'm just wondering, it almost feels like the time is of the essence, not just about the time to market for tech companies, but also as far as regulatory scrutiny of these deals. I mean, don't you think that maybe it would be worth pulling forward some of these transactions not to wait for all of the reviews to happen just to announce these deals on like a plant by plant? Again, in other portfolio announcements, but just plant by plant deals, again, if only because there could be more risk to future deals as well as these co-locations happen?\nJim Burke: Yes. I think, Angie, the regulatory questions obviously are getting some attention, but I still view this as a customer-driven event. The customers are going to want to sign these contracts and get comfortable with the resources, the location, the speed with which they will energize the terms under which we'll do business. So it isn't just up to our company to just move quickly. It's up to our company to be responsive to customer needs, and we need to work through the necessary filings and the studies to make that happen. But if the customer pull is there, I think Vistra is going to be right there with any of the other parties to be able to meet this need. But I also think the regulators are doing the job they need to do, which is ask questions. And I think the response that's been provided in the amended ISA has answered those questions, and we're optimistic that, that will get approved. But this is not simply up to Vistra in terms of how fast Vistra wants to move. There are real customers here with real resources that they're committing just like we'll be committing and those conversations take time. These are complicated deals, and they're valuable for all of us. But we hear your question. I just think that it's not just a one-way direction for Vistra to control. I think this is something that we need to work together to get it done on the right time frame.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And the last one, you mentioned both behind the meter and in front of the meter co-location. Do you have any preference? I mean, it almost feels like in front of the meter co-location would have addressed some of the concerns raised in Talent's ISA?\nJim Burke: Yes, absolutely. I think -- first of all, I think there's going to be both. There is -- this is -- the frustration, I think, that comes into this discussion at times from players is everybody views these as one or the other. There's so much load growth, and if you follow what folks are looking at, not only for data centers, but other sources of electrification and reindustrialization there's going to be a lot -- the vast majority will be front of the meter. There's just no way to meet all of these needs behind the meter. So we view that as load growth in either way and that is going to help supply demand kind of fundamentals. The behind the meter piece is just a unique opportunity really for us to co-locate much like other large customers have done for the last 20 years, and we can provide a speed to market advantage because there should not be the same level of resources needed to build out on the transmission side simply from a time frame perspective. When if we've got the land and the ability to provide them the reliable product that they're looking for, we should be able to contract and earn a margin for doing so. So I think both of those are valuable opportunities, Angie, and we're pursuing both with our customers.\nOperator: The next question is from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks so much. Could you give an update on your latest views on newbuild in ERCOT, how that's going to shake out? How much could we see as we think about this TEF, the final proposals there? And in your view, are prices high enough when you look out the curve to really justify the economics of newbuild?\nJim Burke: And David, great question. So a couple of things there. I do think the curve is coming off in the last couple of months, just starting there in and of itself is a different view than where we were even sitting in the first week of May. And so if you just simply look at the curves, these projects are challenged. And I think we're a long -- a net long generator as a company. We have a lot more generation length than we serve retail load. So if we only were looking at the curve and the curve is not that liquid, so you can't overreact to the curves in early May, and you can't overreact to the curves here in early August. But on a curve-only basis, the Texas market is a different investment construct than other markets in the country. And I think the legislature recognized that. That's why they pass the test, and then the Sunset Bill last session, they also put in a couple of other things to work on some reliability reserve service, which is a new ancillary, and they also codified the performance credit mechanism. So in our view, what the Texas legislature did, would say we need to provide some low-cost financing to encourage gas plants to be built. And that has a maximum of 10,000 megawatts. So regardless of how many had notification of interest and how many are in the application process, the max is 10,000 megawatts. That was expected to have $10 billion of funding to back it. And right now, they have funded $5 billion. But it's likely the additional $5 billion could come, before the next session or during the next session, to fully fund up to the 10,000 megawatts. Our view is that low-cost financing and some completion bonuses alone would not make these projects justifiable. The lower cost of financing is helpful, but you still need adequate revenue to be able to make these projects work. So the market reforms we believe are very important part of the overall package. And when we made our announcement in May about the 2,000 megawatts, we're comfortable proceeding with the augmentations. We're comfortable proceeding with the conversion of Coleto, and we don't have any test requests for that, and we expect the -- given the economics of those, those would move forward. However, we did file for TEF for the two new peakers, and we think that the TEF loan is, again, helpful, but we also still need to see the revenue construct that the market reforms are intended to help address. We don't know how those are going to ultimately shake out because there's been so much interest in the TEF that I think some folks believe that maybe that's enough to address the concerns around grid reliability in Texas. We're not sure how much of the TEF generation ultimately gets built. I think it's too early to tell. But for the long-term, not only to incentivize the right reliable -- reliability assets, but also to preserve the reliability assets that are currently on the grid, some of which are aging quite -- to quite long lives, 40, 50 years plus, there needs to be some revenue signals. Not all stakeholders in agreement on that. The advocacy from the large industrials and commercial customer base is very price sensitive, very cost sensitive. This is a market that values low energy prices. So I don't know how the stakeholder process will ultimately work out. We're going to monitor that from here, and we're very active in it, and we'll see how it develops throughout the session. But I think it's too early to tell how all of this is going to come to fruition, especially if some of the market reform aspects are not supported through the end of the process, consistent with the Sunset Bill at SB3.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for all the color. I'll leave it there. Appreciate it.\nJim Burke: Thank you, David.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Just to maybe follow-up on that last question on the TEF. Could you give us a better sense of like when the go/no-go decision might need to be made by you and others through this process for whatever the curves? Yes, when do you have to make a decision really?\nJim Burke: So at the end of August, we expect to hear who's been selected from a due diligence perspective to move forward with the TEF process. So on the loan and bonus program, Steve, I think all market participants will hear by the end of August, whether they make it to the next round. And then the due diligence process can take time. And ultimately, there will be an award made for the loans, and we'll have to see from a timeframe perspective, how quickly those monies will be made available. I believe they need to be dispersed. I'm going to look to stay through real quick by late 2025. And our timeframe, Steve, in terms of our decision making is that we have engineering work, we have site work, we have the interconnect process we're working through. We anticipate a go/no-go decision on some of these -- on the peakers to line up probably closer to early next summer. And then we'll have a lot more information at that point in time. But that's the timeline as we see it. And obviously, we expect to learn more, and we'll be active in the market and the stakeholder process between now and then.\nSteve Fleishman: That's helpful. And then a couple, I guess, maybe numbers questions. You -- thank you for that disclosure of the $400 million that you would have had from nuclear PTC in 2024, roughly, if you included it. You then say for 2025 that it would provide downside support? Does that mean that on average right now for 2025 you are above the PTC floor? Are you just trying to kind of -- you're not really -- you're just saying that because you're not quantifying it yet. Just could you give more color on that?\nJim Burke: Sure. Steve, your question depends on which week we're talking about. Literally, right at that PTC floor, and then as of August 5, we're right below the PTC floor. So I think the way we can obviously change our annual views day-to-day, week-to-week like this. But our communication in that range was we merely wanted to reflect the capacity revenue flow through, so that you could see that it's not needed to cover some other underlying softness in our business. We feel strongly about 2025 as we did before, and we're adding the $200 million for the capacity revenues. The downside protection comes in, and if curves stayed exactly where they are, maybe we get a little bit more PTC upside. But certainly, if curves came off, you would get a lot more PTC protection. And that's really what we're communicating for 2025, it's not only have we raised the range, but we feel the PTC provides some downside protection that's valuable. You're going to see it in our 2024 results, if the regs come out the way we think they are, we're giving you that $400 million number over and above the upper end of the range that we're communicating for 2024. So that's how it works. It isn't always an in-the-money tool, but it certainly provides the downside protection that should give our investors some comfort.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then one last question. Just on the upside from the PJM auction in 2025, the $200 million increase. That seems somewhat less than we would have calculated just based on the actual auction outcome. Could you just talk to maybe some of the offsets that might be in there?\nJim Burke: Yes. So when we look at putting out our numbers for 2025, that we had already disclosed last quarter, we had a revenue assumption on an auction clear -- embedded in that than half, Steve, what the auction clear turned out to be. So we've already have a starting point in the 2025 numbers. And then if you look at how our business works, particularly in the retail piece on residential, you do some forward sale of not only energy, but capacity. So those are not as long dated of the deal, particularly in the residential space, but you have some of that, which effectively is a fixed price commitment for customers. So you wouldn't expect that to pass-through at the full value. Some of the commercial industrial contracts would pass-through. But on residential, it is not typical to be passing through the capacity piece. So when you see the $200 million, obviously, that six months of the planning period. And then, of course, there's 2026 benefit as well. By the time you get to the 2026/2027 auction, there's even less retail that would be -- that would have forward sold capacity. So you would see even more flow through at these levels of clear as you move forward.\nOperator: The next question is from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey Jim, good morning. Thanks for give me time.\nJim Burke: Hey, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning. Hey Jim, I hate to put you on the spot, but the burning question every time we talk to you on the earnings is, when are you going to sign a data center co-location opportunity? This has been asked to you before several times, but just any more color you can share on timing? I understand there's a lot of moving pieces. Just trying to understand whether we can see something this year? Or how are you thinking about potential announcement and timing there?\nJim Burke: Yes. Durgesh, it is a hard question to answer, and I don't mind being put on the spot. I can only answer the question the best I can, which is, these are large complicated deals and they do depend on not only our desire to get one done, but the customers' comfort with getting these deals done. I do think some of the details we're working through extremely well. We have strong engagement and due diligence processes but we know that they're having conversations with multiple parties, not just Vistra. So there's a lot of work in the industry from a power generation as well as the hyperscalers and co-locators, and I do think that there's going to be a process of the funnel working its way down to realistic options. For example, with the questions being raised in the PJM environment regarding the amended ISA. Well, ERCOT does not have that same jurisdiction. So there's a Comanche Peak on a relative value perspective, step up in the process, and we're seeing some interest in Comanche Peak and even as these discussions with PJM have started to become more public on that amended ISA. So Durgesh, it's a dynamic market. It's about the best thing I can say to that, and we're moving as fast as we can, but it does take the customer side to be comfortable with this. As I mentioned, these are very large complicated deals. So our fundamentals of our business, Durgesh, they don't depend on doing a lot of data center deals. I think the supply/demand fundamentals that we've talked about, they're there, whether they're front of the meter or behind the meter, it's just a unique opportunity for a company like ours with so many sites and so many opportunities to partner directly with customers, it is upside. And we have not baked that into our forecast and our views. And so -- but I can tell you we're a competitive bunch that our team is working as hard as we can to get to a deal.\nDurgesh Chopra: Great. Thank you for sharing that color. My second question is that just as we -- there's a lot of chatter around a hard landing scenario here, a bad recession, what does that mean? I know the long-term power supply demand dynamic is a major tailwind for you. But what does that mean near-term implications on power prices and then for your business?\nJim Burke: We've been through some economic shocks a number of times in our 24 years as kind of a competitive company. Obviously, the near-term, and when I say near-term, the next two years to three years, we feel really strong about our ability to generate consistent returns. But as you move out into 2027 and beyond, our business is going to be more open to the macroeconomic environment. That's not only power price and natural gas price levels, but also just the customer demand is the demand there. We have a very healthy baseload business and a very healthy residential business that tend to be pretty recession proof. And most of our business that's commercial and industrial, we don't have contracts where we're taking sort of the swing or the load risk in that. We tend to sell more take-or-pay or fixed quantity type products to those customers. So I think our business is set up well, Durgesh. I think it's a business that has shown that even when things get soft, we're able to back down some of our units, buyback hedges in the marketplace cost effectively, earn margin, whether we're generating or whether we back down. So I think we've proven the resiliency in the business model, but certainly, long-term, it make you think about your capital allocation and your investment, if you really thought we were at a prolonged sort of downturn. But that is not -- that's not anything we'll worry about in this near-term planning horizon.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thank you. I appreciate the discussion.\nJim Burke: Thanks, Durgesh.\nOperator: The next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys, it's actually [indiscernible] for Julien. Hope you are well doing, Jim and Kris. So to follow-up on the data center side, I know you haven't signed anything yet. But maybe can you comment on how the discussion on pricing for these potential contracts has evolved to start evaluating contracts with data center providers? Like the value of reliable baseload capacity is getting more and more recognized. You just had the PJM capacity auction. How do you see pricing trending? And how does that play into your level of comfort into signing a long-term deal?\nJim Burke: Yes. Well, we are a competitive company and pricing is a sensitive topic to be discussing on our earnings call. But I would say that the customers that we are engaged with understand the value of -- particularly on the nuclear units, they understand the value of the carbon-free attribute. They understand the value of reliability. They understand the potential speed to market benefit and they're willing to pay for that. I mean, again, you're in a competitive process. So other people are offering that, that have similar resources to Vistra. So this is, again, a buyer and a seller needing to reach agreement on what that value is. But we are having those conversations, and I think those are moving along well. Ultimately, there's more options than just the nuclear fleet. The gas fleet is also part of the conversation, and they provide other benefits for customers. They wouldn't necessarily be paying the same premium for the carbon-free attribute. But obviously, the gas assets provide reliability. They provide the opportunity to potentially be grid connected in some cases and use the renewables that are on the grid to optimize price for the customer. So there's a lot of variables to this that are going to be deal and customer-specific. But the capacity clear was noted. I think that's something that a customer, whether front of the meter or behind the meter, they're going to be looking at these kind of capacity clears as something that load is going to need to pay. And so I do think that it was a little bit more unclear before this last auction, that the auction revenues might actually be more than what they've been in previous auctions. I think this auction and the parameter shaping up for this December, show that there is actually a need for more supply in PJM. And so we'd expect the clears to stay at that level or higher, and we know that customers are savvy and they see this coming from a power cost perspective.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you. And then lastly, we've been talking a lot about new builds, but these take time to come online. How do you think about buying existing assets? Do you see any opportunities out there? How wide the sort of bid-ask spread has been today?\nJim Burke: Yes. We have actually grown our business considerably through acquisition. And I think the history of the IPP sector, unfortunately, has been that brand new assets usually end up trading at a discount. In many cases, the IPPs themselves have not stayed financially solvent and folks have picked up those assets much more cheaply in the aftermath. And so you see that even with a recent sale that was announced of a competitive fleet, largely PJM, where those assets are receiving a value that one could argue is still $0.50, $0.60 on the dollar for new build. And I think that's the challenge with when people look at ERCOT forward curves and we talk to partners about an off-take agreement on a gas plant, for instance, they might look at the forward curves and say it's still cheaper to be leaning on the market and buying on the market than paying for a brand new asset with a return requirement. That's true whether that's a regulated asset or in a market or that's true, whether it's in a competitive market. So I think we have shown an ability to pick up assets and integrate them and earn the synergies, and we're still open to doing that. There are more assets coming to the market. I think people have seen the value of these gas assets have improved, but they haven't improved to the level that it costs to do new build. And that gap is not closed meaningfully. And so yes, we will be active. We always are active in looking at opportunities. But we'll be looking to see if those two things converge down the road. But right now, there is still a delta.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks, Jim and congrats on the quarter.\nJim Burke: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke for any closing remarks.\nJim Burke: Yes. I just want to thank everyone for joining. I want to thank our team for their continued execution and service to our customers and our communities. We appreciate your interest in Vistra, and we'll continue to work hard to power through the summer months here and deliver on our strategic priorities. And we hope to see you in-person soon. So have a nice end of your summer, and we'll talk to you again on our next quarter call in November. Thanks.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "Kris Moldovan",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 9, Vistra delivered another strong quarterly result with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.414 billion including $625 million from generation and $789 million from retail. This represents an approximately 40% improvement year-over-year and brings our year-to-date ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to $2.227 billion. Notably, the performance of generation and retail year-to-date, together with our forecast for both businesses for the remainder of the year are driving our confidence in Vistra's ability to deliver 2024 aggregate results towards the upper end of the guidance range. Focusing on year-over-year results despite continued mild summer weather in Texas and lower wholesale prices across competitive markets, the generation team once again capitalized on the volatility in the quarter by optimizing the run profile of our generation units, including ramping down and buying power from the market when economically appropriate. The team's ability to perform in a variety of market conditions is made possible by the consistently high operational performance, the diversity and the flexibility of our fleet. Turning to retail, our second quarter results benefited from the continuation of higher counts and margins cited in the first quarter. Additionally, as expected, due to the evolving seasonality of underlying power costs, the retail team delivered a significantly higher portion of the expected annual ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2024 as compared to 2023. Finally, our 2024 results for generation of retail have benefited from the inclusion of the former energy harbor businesses, which benefit totaled approximately $200 million for the second quarter and approximately $260 million year-to-date. The contribution from these businesses for both the second quarter and year-to-date results was primarily driven by the PJM nuclear fleet, which accounted for approximately three quarters of the contribution in both periods. Moving to Slide 10. We have seen significant volatility in forward power price curves in the last several months. However, our commercial team was able to take advantage of this volatility, increasing our wholesale hedge balances to approximately 86% in calendar year 2025 and approximately 55% in calendar year 2026 at what we believe to be attractive prices. As Jim noted earlier, given our current hedge positions in 2025, combined with the prices realized in the recent 2025/2026 PJM planning year capacity auction, we increased our estimate for the 2025 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA mid-point opportunity range by $200 million. Although forward power prices have generally fallen since our first quarter earnings call, the additional hedges we have executed and the 2025/2026 PJM auction results continue to give us confidence in our estimated 2026 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA mid-point opportunity of more than $6 billion even before we update our assumptions for the upcoming 2026/2027 PJM planning year capacity auction. Notably, as is the case with our 2024 guidance, our long-term outlook excludes any estimates related to the nuclear PTC, which could be meaningful. Finally, we continue to target a conversion rate of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to adjusted free cash flow before growth of 55% to 60% for 2025 and beyond, excluding any upside from the nuclear PTC, which is generally expected to benefit adjusted free cash flow before growth at least one year after being recognized in ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. As a result, we expect to generate a meaningful amount of unallocated capital through 2026, which we expect to discuss in more detail on our third quarter results call in November. Finally, we provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan on Slide 11. Our share repurchase program has generated significant value to our shareholders. Since beginning the program in November 2021, we reduced our shares outstanding by approximately 135 million shares or approximately 29% at an average price per share of approximately $27.50. Despite the increase in our stock price in 2024, we still see our shares trading at an elevated free cash flow yield and continue to believe allocating capital to share repurchases is an important priority. To that end, as Jim noted, we expect to execute at least $2.25 billion of share repurchases over the course of 2024 and 2025, and at least an additional $1 billion in 2026. Moving to the balance sheet. Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits at 3x ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA, despite the additional debt that was required to close the Energy Harbor acquisition in the first quarter of this year. We expect it to return to below 3x by the end of 2024. We continue to target a long-term net leverage ratio, not including the benefit of margin deposits below 3x. As Jim discussed earlier, we are excited to announce the two long-term power purchase agreements with Amazon and Microsoft for two new large scale solar facilities. As a reminder, we expect to fund approximately 60% to 70% of our solar and energy storage capital expenditures with non-recourse financing. We remain committed to our opportunistic approach to our solar and energy storage growth strategy and continue to target levered returns of mid-teens or higher for these projects. Finally, as we highlighted in the first quarter results call, in connection with the closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, we have begun paying dividends to the minority investors in Vistra Vision. Our current expectation is that we will pay approximately $135 million of such dividends in 2024. We view these dividends as part of our capital allocation program as we continue to analyze Vistra's earnings power on a consolidated basis. We are very proud of the Vistra team's performance in the first half of the year and we remain committed to executing against our four strategic priorities. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions."

            "name": "Jim Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2024 operational and financial results. Beginning on Slide 5, you can see the team has been hard at work across multiple parts of our business. Through their efforts, we achieved ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $1.414 billion, a very strong second quarter against a backdrop of lower wholesale energy prices across the country. While results benefited from the inclusion of the first full quarter contribution from the Energy Harbor businesses, consistent execution from our generation, commercial, and retail teams played a major role in this achievement. Specifically, our diversified portfolio of generation assets produced record levels of power for our customers while completing the planned outages needed to prepare the fleet for the crucial summer months. Our retail business led by our flagship TXU Energy brand delivered year-over-year growth, while producing solid margin performance and maintaining a top score on the PUC of Texas power to choose scorecard. Finally, despite the weather volatility across the country in general, power prices cleared below our hedge levels. Through strong execution of our comprehensive hedging program by our commercial team, our second quarter results reflect the solid performance anticipated when we set our expectations for the year. Turning to guidance. We are reaffirming our guidance range for 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $4.550 billion to $5.050 billion. Based on performance to date and our forecast for the remainder of the year, we are confident in our ability to deliver towards the upper end of this range. As we noted during our first quarter results call, our guidance excludes any potential benefit related to the nuclear production tax credit or PTC, given the uncertainty around the interpretation of gross receipts in the regulations. However, based on where prices settled in the first seven months of the year and the forward curves for the balance of the year, we believe the impact of the PTC to our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA could be upwards of $400 million. Moving to our long-term outlook. Our integrated business model, which combines critical dispatchable generation assets with a premier retail business, positions us well to create long-term value in the current volatile and growing markets. Given our hedging activity over the past several months and the recent 2025-2026 PJM planning year auction results, we are raising our estimated 2025 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA mid-point opportunity range by $200 million to $5.200 billion to $5.700 billion. Similar to our 2024 guidance, our range of 2025 ongoing operations mid-point opportunities excludes any estimates related to the nuclear PTC. However, it is important to note that we believe the nuclear PTC will provide downside support for such range of opportunities and we will continue to evaluate the appropriate timing for including PTC estimates in our forecasts. Underpinning the improvement in our outlook is our focus on our four key strategic priorities outlined on Slide 6. Our integrated business model leverages our diverse portfolio of generation assets coupled with our strong retail brands to deliver more consistent results as evidenced by our second quarter performance. Our core tenant of one team continues to foster not only teamwork, but drives learning and best practices across all aspects of our company to create a culture of continuous improvement, including at our recently added PJM nuclear sites. As discussed on the previous slide, our commercial teams continue to execute on our comprehensive hedging program to provide visibility into the earnings power of the business, while also providing meaningful downside protection to our long-term outlook. While our current 2024 guidance and long-term outlook both exclude any estimates related to the nuclear PTC, we believe the availability of a nuclear PTC de-risks a substantial portion of the earnings potential of our nuclear assets, making them increasingly more valuable. Switching to capital allocation, we view this as a critical responsibility and we will remain disciplined in our allocation process. We continue to execute the capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we've returned approximately $5 billion to our investors, including $4.25 billion of share repurchases through August 5 of this year. We expect to execute at least $2.25 billion of share repurchases throughout 2024 and 2025. Moving to the balance sheet. Our financial position remains strong with net leverage at the end of the quarter at 3x ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA. We continue to expect net leverage to be below 3x by year-end 2024. On energy transition, we continue to be opportunistic in executing on a renewable development pipeline. We began construction on two new large scale solar projects, one in Texas and one in Illinois. To ensure full off-take from these facilities, we executed new long-term power purchase agreements with two of the world's leading technology companies, one with Amazon and the other with Microsoft. We are excited to partner with these well-known companies to provide carbon free electricity for their operations. Moving forward, our development opportunity pipeline remains robust. Our large geographic footprint across the country, which encompasses more than 70 sites with grid interconnects and thousands of acres of land for development, provides ample opportunities to meet customer needs for a particular energy technology or to co-locate operations. Our approach to the energy expansion continues to responsibly balance reliability, affordability and sustainability while ensuring disciplined project returns for our shareholders. We have highlighted this approach in our most recent sustainability report, which we published on July 31. We are proud of the approach we take to sustainability, which ensures that we are reducing our emissions while also creating a sustainable business strategy for all of our stakeholders. Moving to Slide 7. We see a potential significant supply gap emerging in the largest markets we serve. During our first quarter results call, we outlined the potential multiple drivers of future demand and these include the reassuring of industrial activity partially due to the CHIPS Act, the build out of data centers, whether behind the meter or in front of the meter, increased electrification of commercial, industrial and residential loads and strong population growth, particularly in Texas. In addition this demand growth, we believe current environmental policies will drive significant retirements of dispatchable thermal generation, notably coal plants, through the end of the decade, creating a supply/demand gap. Many of these policies are driven by decisions at the state level and are less influenced by federal policies. Supported by PJM's recent market reforms, the higher clearing prices for the 2025/2026 capacity auction are beginning to signal to competitive market participants, including investors who can respond to this supply gap. While it is only one auction clear, capacity revenues over time can help offset lower wholesale energy prices, which have softened in the outer year since our last call in May. Generation units are long-lived assets, and a consistent, predictable market framework focused on reliability is necessary to attract capital for new dispatchable supply. The Texas market relies almost exclusively on the wholesale energy price to incentivize new generation, and we have seen a lot of volatility in these forward curves. Policymakers have recently created the Texas Energy Fund to provide lower cost financing and completion bonuses for up to 10 gigawatts of new gas fuel dispatchable generation. This does provide some financial support for new build, but we believe forward price signals and market reforms will be necessary to attract sufficient equity capital to build new gas fuel generation. However, in a competitive market, as has been the case in Texas for nearly 30 years, there will be many market participants and investors to evaluate their opportunities and decide their best path forward. As we announced in late May, we are targeting up to 2,000 megawatts of dispatchable gas fuel generation additions at ERCOT. This includes 500 megawatts of augmentations at existing facilities, nearly half of which we have brought online already this summer, and up to 600 megawatts from the conversion of our Coleto Creek coal plant to a gas fueled unit, which will take place after the plant's retirement in the middle of 2027. These investments represent accretive opportunities for our company while preserving good paying jobs for our fellow Texans. We also submitted our application in July for the Texas Energy Fund financing for up to 860 megawatts of advanced peaker plants in West Texas. As noted in our announcement, we are in the early stages of development of these plants as we monitor the successful implementation of key market reforms focused on grid reliability as well as sufficient market signals. These key reforms include a suite of ancillary services, the performance credit mechanism, or PCM, and an effective reliability standard, a first for Texas. We will continue to work with policymakers and other stakeholders to shape a robust framework for investment in Texas. Looking broadly across the markets we serve, the interconnection queues are largely filled with wind, solar and battery resources for a number of reasons, including tax incentives, state policies and the preferences of large customers. The combination of low growth coal plant retirements and additional intermittent resources will require both baseload and flexible dispatchable units. Vistra is well-positioned with its diversified fleet and we will continue to work with policymakers, customers, and communities to ensure their energy needs are met reliably, affordably, and sustainably. This is what drives our purpose at Vistra and our team is excited about the future set of opportunities. And with that, I will turn it over to Kris to provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Kris? Yes. Shar, it's a great question. PJM has been working on market reforms for quite some time, and we've talked about that on previous calls. It's a long process, and I think they've made great headway in looking at the sort of contribution that different resource classes, like dispatchable, can provide. And I think we saw that reflected in this most recent clear. It is only one auction, of course, and not long enough out in the future to be starting a new project because they are behind, obviously, and they're catching up on the number of auctions in the next couple of years. This December will be another interesting signal. We think it can clear at or above where this most recent clear was just given some of the fundamentals. And I think that does make PJM attractive. I think that's one of the things that PJM is offering now is a signal towards assets that provides us reliability benefit. We have a number of sites in PJM operating. We obviously have some coal plants, we could look at potential conversions at some point to gas. And I think others will look at that as well. But it is a good signal. Shar, it's still early stages, but I think a lot of progress has been made there. Right. Sure. Yes, good question, Shar. So when we first announced the $6 billion plus, we were talking about this on the May call. Curves were actually quite strong at that point in time in the market in Texas and PJM, frankly, across the country. As you know, the curves have come off quite a bit. We were about 50% hedged on that call. Now we're about 55% hedged. So we have seen some gross margin for particularly the unhedged portion, erode some of the 2026 earnings. But we had a sense because of our open position, Shar, we wouldn't have put $6 billion plus out if we couldn't handle some volatility in the curves because that's just the nature of the business we're in. With this clear, obviously, that captures only part of 2026 and this auction coming up in December will capture the other part of 2026. We did not revise the 2026 number. As you noted, we did revise 2025. I think with these -- with the clear we've had, in this upcoming clear, we are strongly above the $6 billion plus figure, but we're going to refresh that next quarter. When we come out next quarter, we'll give you a 2025 guidance number, which is not what we've provided today. We merely reflected the auction clear for 2025, and we'll give more visibility into 2026. But the business has been very resilient. And I think these -- the diversification of our fleet, plus having the retail business, the earnings power of the business is strong. Hey Shar, it has not slowed. The conversation is down. I think, first of all, these conversations are numerous. They are not only are there a lot of customers having -- that we're having conversations with, but they're having conversations with a lot of potential suppliers like ourselves. We're making really good progress with our customers. We're in due diligence for a number of sites. Clearly, this process, including a technical conference will -- it is of interest to folks. But these are some long-dated conversations and these are sizable decisions that folks are making. If they contract for one of our larger sites, for instance, they could be approaching $1 billion a year in power costs at a single site. So these take time to evolve, but it has not slowed the pace of play. I think there's going to be plenty of data center load behind the meter or co-located and also front of the meter. I think there's going to be plenty. And I think they're evaluating these customers are evaluating all their options. So we'll see how the technical conference goes. We're clearly in support FERC approving this amended ISA. We think the record is very clear on that, but more to come, and we're going to stay active, as I know all of the market participants will. But this is a really big opportunity for our industry to meet customer needs. And frankly, create a lot of jobs, a lot of economic development, and I hope as an industry we don't get in our own way here and that we're able to see that this load growth is really beneficial for our economy broadly. And we expect these conversations to stay active until we get to a decision with a couple of key customers, which we're pretty optimistic about. Thank you, Shar. Yes. Angie, there's a lot in that question. It is something we think about quite a bit. The beauty of a competitive market is anybody can build generation in a competitive market, and that includes the regulated utilities as long as they're doing it in the competitive market context. That framework has shown over the years to over $80 billion has been invested by competitive companies in PJM since the market opened over $100 billion has been invested by competitive companies at ERCOT since the market opened. This is the first clear, as we just talked about, that has shown real life in quite some time. And while it looks like it's 9x to 10x higher than the last clear, on average is bringing maybe 40% to 50% of what you would need to build a new gas plant. This is not a clear that in and of itself without energy margin makes all the math work from an investor point of view. I know the regulated utilities feel a need to serve their customers with a reliable product, and we feel that need as well. That is a core tenant of our strategy. I think there's plenty of investment opportunities on the transmission and distribution side to not only serve new load but to connect the new generation resources. And that queue has been slow to develop in PJM, and I know PJM wants to accelerate that. So I still go back to what I said just a minute ago, I don't think we should be worried about, are there some ancillary services that need to be paid or some wires charges that need to be paid. The customers we're talking to, want to pay for the services that they're being delivered, whether that's on the wire side or the generation side. I think there's plenty of opportunity for all of us to work together to not only make this an economic opportunity for our respective companies, but to meet the customer need. That's ultimately what we're doing here is meeting a customer need and I think we're going to all have to work together to do it. But it's something that I think, Angie, is going to unfold through time. Nothing happens in the power market as fast as the technology space would like it to. And frankly, as fast as we would like it to. So I think we just need to keep the dialogue open and work through these issues. But we think there's plenty to go around for this to be a real boom for all stakeholders. Yes. I think, Angie, the regulatory questions obviously are getting some attention, but I still view this as a customer-driven event. The customers are going to want to sign these contracts and get comfortable with the resources, the location, the speed with which they will energize the terms under which we'll do business. So it isn't just up to our company to just move quickly. It's up to our company to be responsive to customer needs, and we need to work through the necessary filings and the studies to make that happen. But if the customer pull is there, I think Vistra is going to be right there with any of the other parties to be able to meet this need. But I also think the regulators are doing the job they need to do, which is ask questions. And I think the response that's been provided in the amended ISA has answered those questions, and we're optimistic that, that will get approved. But this is not simply up to Vistra in terms of how fast Vistra wants to move. There are real customers here with real resources that they're committing just like we'll be committing and those conversations take time. These are complicated deals, and they're valuable for all of us. But we hear your question. I just think that it's not just a one-way direction for Vistra to control. I think this is something that we need to work together to get it done on the right time frame. Yes, absolutely. I think -- first of all, I think there's going to be both. There is -- this is -- the frustration, I think, that comes into this discussion at times from players is everybody views these as one or the other. There's so much load growth, and if you follow what folks are looking at, not only for data centers, but other sources of electrification and reindustrialization there's going to be a lot -- the vast majority will be front of the meter. There's just no way to meet all of these needs behind the meter. So we view that as load growth in either way and that is going to help supply demand kind of fundamentals. The behind the meter piece is just a unique opportunity really for us to co-locate much like other large customers have done for the last 20 years, and we can provide a speed to market advantage because there should not be the same level of resources needed to build out on the transmission side simply from a time frame perspective. When if we've got the land and the ability to provide them the reliable product that they're looking for, we should be able to contract and earn a margin for doing so. So I think both of those are valuable opportunities, Angie, and we're pursuing both with our customers. And David, great question. So a couple of things there. I do think the curve is coming off in the last couple of months, just starting there in and of itself is a different view than where we were even sitting in the first week of May. And so if you just simply look at the curves, these projects are challenged. And I think we're a long -- a net long generator as a company. We have a lot more generation length than we serve retail load. So if we only were looking at the curve and the curve is not that liquid, so you can't overreact to the curves in early May, and you can't overreact to the curves here in early August. But on a curve-only basis, the Texas market is a different investment construct than other markets in the country. And I think the legislature recognized that. That's why they pass the test, and then the Sunset Bill last session, they also put in a couple of other things to work on some reliability reserve service, which is a new ancillary, and they also codified the performance credit mechanism. So in our view, what the Texas legislature did, would say we need to provide some low-cost financing to encourage gas plants to be built. And that has a maximum of 10,000 megawatts. So regardless of how many had notification of interest and how many are in the application process, the max is 10,000 megawatts. That was expected to have $10 billion of funding to back it. And right now, they have funded $5 billion. But it's likely the additional $5 billion could come, before the next session or during the next session, to fully fund up to the 10,000 megawatts. Our view is that low-cost financing and some completion bonuses alone would not make these projects justifiable. The lower cost of financing is helpful, but you still need adequate revenue to be able to make these projects work. So the market reforms we believe are very important part of the overall package. And when we made our announcement in May about the 2,000 megawatts, we're comfortable proceeding with the augmentations. We're comfortable proceeding with the conversion of Coleto, and we don't have any test requests for that, and we expect the -- given the economics of those, those would move forward. However, we did file for TEF for the two new peakers, and we think that the TEF loan is, again, helpful, but we also still need to see the revenue construct that the market reforms are intended to help address. We don't know how those are going to ultimately shake out because there's been so much interest in the TEF that I think some folks believe that maybe that's enough to address the concerns around grid reliability in Texas. We're not sure how much of the TEF generation ultimately gets built. I think it's too early to tell. But for the long-term, not only to incentivize the right reliable -- reliability assets, but also to preserve the reliability assets that are currently on the grid, some of which are aging quite -- to quite long lives, 40, 50 years plus, there needs to be some revenue signals. Not all stakeholders in agreement on that. The advocacy from the large industrials and commercial customer base is very price sensitive, very cost sensitive. This is a market that values low energy prices. So I don't know how the stakeholder process will ultimately work out. We're going to monitor that from here, and we're very active in it, and we'll see how it develops throughout the session. But I think it's too early to tell how all of this is going to come to fruition, especially if some of the market reform aspects are not supported through the end of the process, consistent with the Sunset Bill at SB3. Thank you, David. So at the end of August, we expect to hear who's been selected from a due diligence perspective to move forward with the TEF process. So on the loan and bonus program, Steve, I think all market participants will hear by the end of August, whether they make it to the next round. And then the due diligence process can take time. And ultimately, there will be an award made for the loans, and we'll have to see from a timeframe perspective, how quickly those monies will be made available. I believe they need to be dispersed. I'm going to look to stay through real quick by late 2025. And our timeframe, Steve, in terms of our decision making is that we have engineering work, we have site work, we have the interconnect process we're working through. We anticipate a go/no-go decision on some of these -- on the peakers to line up probably closer to early next summer. And then we'll have a lot more information at that point in time. But that's the timeline as we see it. And obviously, we expect to learn more, and we'll be active in the market and the stakeholder process between now and then. Sure. Steve, your question depends on which week we're talking about. Literally, right at that PTC floor, and then as of August 5, we're right below the PTC floor. So I think the way we can obviously change our annual views day-to-day, week-to-week like this. But our communication in that range was we merely wanted to reflect the capacity revenue flow through, so that you could see that it's not needed to cover some other underlying softness in our business. We feel strongly about 2025 as we did before, and we're adding the $200 million for the capacity revenues. The downside protection comes in, and if curves stayed exactly where they are, maybe we get a little bit more PTC upside. But certainly, if curves came off, you would get a lot more PTC protection. And that's really what we're communicating for 2025, it's not only have we raised the range, but we feel the PTC provides some downside protection that's valuable. You're going to see it in our 2024 results, if the regs come out the way we think they are, we're giving you that $400 million number over and above the upper end of the range that we're communicating for 2024. So that's how it works. It isn't always an in-the-money tool, but it certainly provides the downside protection that should give our investors some comfort. Yes. So when we look at putting out our numbers for 2025, that we had already disclosed last quarter, we had a revenue assumption on an auction clear -- embedded in that than half, Steve, what the auction clear turned out to be. So we've already have a starting point in the 2025 numbers. And then if you look at how our business works, particularly in the retail piece on residential, you do some forward sale of not only energy, but capacity. So those are not as long dated of the deal, particularly in the residential space, but you have some of that, which effectively is a fixed price commitment for customers. So you wouldn't expect that to pass-through at the full value. Some of the commercial industrial contracts would pass-through. But on residential, it is not typical to be passing through the capacity piece. So when you see the $200 million, obviously, that six months of the planning period. And then, of course, there's 2026 benefit as well. By the time you get to the 2026/2027 auction, there's even less retail that would be -- that would have forward sold capacity. So you would see even more flow through at these levels of clear as you move forward. Hey, Durgesh. Yes. Durgesh, it is a hard question to answer, and I don't mind being put on the spot. I can only answer the question the best I can, which is, these are large complicated deals and they do depend on not only our desire to get one done, but the customers' comfort with getting these deals done. I do think some of the details we're working through extremely well. We have strong engagement and due diligence processes but we know that they're having conversations with multiple parties, not just Vistra. So there's a lot of work in the industry from a power generation as well as the hyperscalers and co-locators, and I do think that there's going to be a process of the funnel working its way down to realistic options. For example, with the questions being raised in the PJM environment regarding the amended ISA. Well, ERCOT does not have that same jurisdiction. So there's a Comanche Peak on a relative value perspective, step up in the process, and we're seeing some interest in Comanche Peak and even as these discussions with PJM have started to become more public on that amended ISA. So Durgesh, it's a dynamic market. It's about the best thing I can say to that, and we're moving as fast as we can, but it does take the customer side to be comfortable with this. As I mentioned, these are very large complicated deals. So our fundamentals of our business, Durgesh, they don't depend on doing a lot of data center deals. I think the supply/demand fundamentals that we've talked about, they're there, whether they're front of the meter or behind the meter, it's just a unique opportunity for a company like ours with so many sites and so many opportunities to partner directly with customers, it is upside. And we have not baked that into our forecast and our views. And so -- but I can tell you we're a competitive bunch that our team is working as hard as we can to get to a deal. We've been through some economic shocks a number of times in our 24 years as kind of a competitive company. Obviously, the near-term, and when I say near-term, the next two years to three years, we feel really strong about our ability to generate consistent returns. But as you move out into 2027 and beyond, our business is going to be more open to the macroeconomic environment. That's not only power price and natural gas price levels, but also just the customer demand is the demand there. We have a very healthy baseload business and a very healthy residential business that tend to be pretty recession proof. And most of our business that's commercial and industrial, we don't have contracts where we're taking sort of the swing or the load risk in that. We tend to sell more take-or-pay or fixed quantity type products to those customers. So I think our business is set up well, Durgesh. I think it's a business that has shown that even when things get soft, we're able to back down some of our units, buyback hedges in the marketplace cost effectively, earn margin, whether we're generating or whether we back down. So I think we've proven the resiliency in the business model, but certainly, long-term, it make you think about your capital allocation and your investment, if you really thought we were at a prolonged sort of downturn. But that is not -- that's not anything we'll worry about in this near-term planning horizon. Thanks, Durgesh. Yes. Well, we are a competitive company and pricing is a sensitive topic to be discussing on our earnings call. But I would say that the customers that we are engaged with understand the value of -- particularly on the nuclear units, they understand the value of the carbon-free attribute. They understand the value of reliability. They understand the potential speed to market benefit and they're willing to pay for that. I mean, again, you're in a competitive process. So other people are offering that, that have similar resources to Vistra. So this is, again, a buyer and a seller needing to reach agreement on what that value is. But we are having those conversations, and I think those are moving along well. Ultimately, there's more options than just the nuclear fleet. The gas fleet is also part of the conversation, and they provide other benefits for customers. They wouldn't necessarily be paying the same premium for the carbon-free attribute. But obviously, the gas assets provide reliability. They provide the opportunity to potentially be grid connected in some cases and use the renewables that are on the grid to optimize price for the customer. So there's a lot of variables to this that are going to be deal and customer-specific. But the capacity clear was noted. I think that's something that a customer, whether front of the meter or behind the meter, they're going to be looking at these kind of capacity clears as something that load is going to need to pay. And so I do think that it was a little bit more unclear before this last auction, that the auction revenues might actually be more than what they've been in previous auctions. I think this auction and the parameter shaping up for this December, show that there is actually a need for more supply in PJM. And so we'd expect the clears to stay at that level or higher, and we know that customers are savvy and they see this coming from a power cost perspective. Yes. We have actually grown our business considerably through acquisition. And I think the history of the IPP sector, unfortunately, has been that brand new assets usually end up trading at a discount. In many cases, the IPPs themselves have not stayed financially solvent and folks have picked up those assets much more cheaply in the aftermath. And so you see that even with a recent sale that was announced of a competitive fleet, largely PJM, where those assets are receiving a value that one could argue is still $0.50, $0.60 on the dollar for new build. And I think that's the challenge with when people look at ERCOT forward curves and we talk to partners about an off-take agreement on a gas plant, for instance, they might look at the forward curves and say it's still cheaper to be leaning on the market and buying on the market than paying for a brand new asset with a return requirement. That's true whether that's a regulated asset or in a market or that's true, whether it's in a competitive market. So I think we have shown an ability to pick up assets and integrate them and earn the synergies, and we're still open to doing that. There are more assets coming to the market. I think people have seen the value of these gas assets have improved, but they haven't improved to the level that it costs to do new build. And that gap is not closed meaningfully. And so yes, we will be active. We always are active in looking at opportunities. But we'll be looking to see if those two things converge down the road. But right now, there is still a delta. Thank you. Yes. I just want to thank everyone for joining. I want to thank our team for their continued execution and service to our customers and our communities. We appreciate your interest in Vistra, and we'll continue to work hard to power through the summer months here and deliver on our strategic priorities. And we hope to see you in-person soon. So have a nice end of your summer, and we'll talk to you again on our next quarter call in November. Thanks."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Eric Micek, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nEric Micek: Good morning, and thank you all for joining Vistra's investor webcast discussing our first quarter 2024 results. Our discussion today is being broadcast live from the Investor Relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. There, you can also find copies of today's investor presentation and earnings release. \n Leading the call today are Jim Burke, Vistra's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kris Moldovan, Vistra's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They are joined by other Vistra senior executives to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. \n Our earnings release, presentation, and other matters discussed on the call today include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation available in the Investor Relations section of Vistra's website. \n Also, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements. \n I encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on Slide 2 of the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. \n I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Jim Burke. \nJames Burke: Thank you, Eric. I appreciate all of you taking the time to join our first quarter 2024 results call. This call is taking place in conjunction with a major milestone for Vistra, namely the first day of inclusion of our stock in the S&P 500. I want to recognize the hard work of our Vistra team and the support and patience exhibited by our shareholders as this is a result of both strong execution over time, bolstered by improving market dynamics in the power sector. We are pleased to be included in the index and excited about the future prospects for Vistra and its stakeholders. \n Turning to Slide 5. Before we cover the positive results for the quarter, it's worth noting that we see a significant increase in Vistra's long-term outlook. Our team has been hard at work to ensure Vistra's best positioned for the increasing power demand fundamentals while providing reliable, affordable and sustainable power to our customers. \n Continuing the theme of execution, our integration teams were hard at work during this quarter with the closing of our acquisition of Energy Harbor on March 1. We were ready on day 1 to unify under the Vistra name and welcome our new colleagues. \n The core theme throughout the integration process has been 1 team, and we believe that is crucial to a sustainable, high-performance organization. The sites are working closely with each other to share best practices and create a culture of continuous improvement. As a result, the teams identified the potential for several operational and performance improvements throughout the nuclear fleet. \n As Kris will cover later, including the expected financial benefits of these improvements and the additional synergies we've identified, we now expect the run rate adjusted EBITDA contribution from Energy Harbor to exceed $1.1 billion beginning in 2026. \n Turning to the other key priorities. We continue to execute on our capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we've returned to our investors approximately $4.6 billion, including $3.9 billion of share repurchases through May 3 of this year. We continue to view our shares as an attractive investment and expect to execute at least $2.25 billion of share repurchases throughout '24 and '25. Crucially, our balance sheet remains strong, enabling the ongoing capital return plan. \n Our net leverage finished the quarter at approximately 3x, exceeding our expectations indicated on the previous quarter results call. We expect net leverage to be below 3x by year-end 2024. Our disciplined capital approach also enables us to invest in solar and energy storage growth that capitalizes on sites interconnects in the Vistra portfolio. Our Baldwin and Calpine sites where construction began earlier this year on paired solar energy storage facilities are good examples of this strategy, and we expect these to be online by the end of the year. Finally, we've completed our first nonrecourse financing in Vistra Zero, providing attractive capital for our growing portfolio of operating renewable assets. \n Moving to Slide 6. We achieved ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $813 million, a 47% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. As you can see, many of the themes contributing to results last year continued into the first quarter of this year. The first quarter of 2024 again reflected the benefits of our comprehensive hedging program as the warmest winter on record in the U.S. led to lower-than-expected cleared power prices across the country. Specifically, while power prices in the markets we serve cleared below $30 per megawatt hour on average for the first quarter, our first quarter results reflect an average realized power price of over $50 per megawatt hour. \n In these volatile weather environments, which included a winter event in mid-January and then mild weather in February and March, our generation team once again delivered with another strong quarter of commercial availability at approximately 98%. Being flexible with, not only daily operations, including ramping down when economics signal us to do so, but rescheduling planned outages to optimize opportunities enabled the business to deliver strong results. \n Finally, the retail team delivered another positive quarter of customer count growth across our Texas and Midwest and Northeast geographies. With the acquisition of Energy Harbor now complete, we're initiating a guidance on a combined basis for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $4,550,000,000 to $5,050,000,000 and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth of $2,200,000,000 to $2,700,000,000. It's important to note that this guidance excludes any potential benefit from the nuclear production tax credit, or PTC, given the uncertainty around how it will be implemented when the regulations are issued later this year. \n However, based on where prices settled in the first quarter and the forward curves for the balance of the year, we believe the PTC could add a significant amount to our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range. \n Finally, you will note that the implied conversion rate from ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth for 2024 is below our stated target of 55% to 60%, primarily due to a couple of timing impacts. We expect to return to our target 55% to 60% range in 2025 and beyond. \n While we are not providing guidance to reflect specific ranges for Vistra Vision and Vistra Tradition, our view is that each is expected to contribute roughly half of our adjusted EBITDA over time. However, given the business mix and current capital structure, you can expect Vistra Vision will convert adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow before growth at a higher rate over time, roughly 60% to 65% compared to Vistra Tradition, which we expect to convert at a rate of approximately 50% to 55%. \n Turning to Slide 7. There has been much discussion in recent months about the substantial power demand growth forecast, including from the potential build-out of data centers and other sources of electricity demand. Third-party research indicates data center-related activity could approach 35 gigawatts of additional demand by 2030. However, our teams also see multiple additional potential drivers of demand in the geographies we serve. These drivers include: continued reshoring of industrial activity as evidenced by multiple large chip manufacturing site build-outs, partially due to the CHIPS Act; increased electrification of commercial, industrial, and residential load across the country, as evidenced by the expectation of approximately 20 gigawatts of additional power demand in West Texas by 2030; and strong population growth, particularly in the state of Texas, which has been steady at 1.5% to 2% per year. \n With these drivers, we see the potential demand outcome skewing higher, albeit with a wider range. In their most recent report, PJM's load growth expectations through 2030 doubled from their 2023 estimate. In Texas, recent reports from ERCOT suggest load growth from 2030 in a wide range from as low as 1.6% per year to as high as 6% growth per year or even higher if more than half of the large loads recently discussed to ERCOT actually materialize. \n The trailing 10 years has been approximately 2.5%, and that was before some of these more recent drivers of the Permian electrification, the CHIPS Act, and the data center demand. This increase in demand across the country will need to be served by an electric grid that will continue to see coal plant retirements in all markets. The Inflation Reduction Act will continue to incentivize wind, solar, and battery resources, and we will also need gas-fired generation to back up those intermittent sources. \n The new greenhouse gas rules issued from the EPA on April 25 are expected to make it more challenging to economically build baseload combined cycle gas turbine facilities. But we expect those rules to be litigated, and it's unclear what the final outcome will be. \n Natural gas peakers could be a solution that threads the needle of environmental rules and demand needs. In addition, it is likely that existing assets will need to run at higher capacity factors to meet overall annual energy needs as more coal retires. We see Vistra is well positioned for these trends, given our diversified portfolio of reliable and sustainable assets in growing markets. \n As you can see on Slide 8, the forward curves have moved up considerably in both the Texas and PJM markets on the improved demand outlook, particularly on the longer end of the curve. As an example, ERCOT North around-the-clock fixed price forwards for calendar 2026 increased over $7 per megawatt hour or approximately 13% since we last provided guidance in November 2023. \n For 2027 and 2028, the increases were even more significant. In the past, we've commented that the backwardation and forward curves did not reflect the tighter grid conditions that we expected to result from continued load growth and planned thermal asset retirements. \n With the recent improvement in both forward power prices and some additional market interest in transacting further out on the curve, we believe the market is beginning to recognize these dynamics. As I stated at the beginning of the call, our integrated business model, which combines increasingly critical dispatchable generation assets with a premier retail business, positions us well to create long-term value in this dynamic and growing market. \n As a result, based on recent market curves, we are currently estimating a combined ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity for 2025 of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. In addition, while significant uncertainty to both the upside and downside remains for 2026, given our 2026 hedge percentage which is approximately 50%, we have line of sight to an ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity of more than $6 billion. Like the 2024 guidance, our long-term outlook excludes any potential benefit from the nuclear PTC, and we will continue to evaluate the appropriate timing for including any of that potential benefit. \n Even without the inclusion of any PTC benefit, the improvement in near-term and long-term outlook for Vistra is expected to result in a meaningful amount of unallocated capital through 2026. \n And with that, I will turn it over to Kris to provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Kris? \nKristopher Moldovan: Thank you, Jim. \n Turning to Slide 10. Vistra delivered strong first quarter results in 2024 with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $813 million, including $841 million from generation, offset by negative $28 million from retail. This represents a $259 million improvement, nearly 50% year-over-year. \n For generation, despite another quarter of mild weather conditions, including the warmest winter on record, our comprehensive hedging program, combined with the team's ability to optimize our flexible assets enabled another quarter of strong results. \n Turning to retail. As was the case in 2023, the first quarter result was within the range of what we expected. We continue to see higher hedge power costs in the winter and summer months due to entry year shaping and therefore anticipate substantially all of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA for retail to be achieved in the second and fourth quarters. We believe continued strong accounts and margins in the first quarter position retail well for the balance of the year. Finally, our first quarter results benefited from the inclusion of 1 month of Energy Harbor, which totaled approximately $60 million for generation and retail combined. \n On Energy Harbor, we provided an update on the integration process on Slide 11. As Jim mentioned earlier, the team has made significant progress integrating the businesses despite a later-than-expected closing. In the short time since completing the acquisition, the team has identified approximately $150 million of timing and gross margin benefits that are expected to be realized in 2024. These benefits are expected to bring the in-year 2024 contribution from Energy Harbor to approximately $700 million, which compares favorably to our 10-month contribution estimate. \n Turning to integration benefits. We've previously communicated expected run rate synergies of $79 million by year-end 2024 and a run rate of $125 million by year-end 2025. Based on the efforts of the teams completed to date, we are increasing the amount of expected run rate synergies by $25 million to a total of $150 million. \n Further, when we first announced the acquisition of Energy Harbor, we highlighted our core competency of integrating generation assets, citing the achievements of our Operational Performance Improvement, or OPI, program following the Dynegy acquisition. I am pleased to report that this program continues to deliver, with the teams having identified opportunities for more efficient operations across our nuclear fleet that we expect to lead to $50 million of run rate adjusted EBITDA improvements by year-end 2026. Importantly, we expect these additional opportunities to be achieved with little incremental capital spend. \n Finally, we provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan on Slide 12. As of May 3, we executed approximately $3.9 billion of share repurchases, leading to an approximately 28% reduction compared to the number of shares that were outstanding in November 2021. In line with our statements on the fourth quarter 2023 call, we expect to execute at least $2.25 billion of share repurchases over the course of 2024 and 2025. With the long-term update provided today, we still see our shares trading at an elevated free cash flow yield and thus continue to believe share repurchases to be a sound use of our capital. \n Moving to our dividend program. We announced last week our first quarter 2024 common stock dividend of $0.2175 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 7% over the dividend paid in Q2 2023 and an impressive 45% increase over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 when our capital allocation plan was first established. \n Turning to the balance sheet. Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits at 3x. As Jim stated earlier, we expect to return to below 3x by the end of 2024 and continue to target a long-term net leverage ratio below 3x. As you may have seen, we successfully issued $1.5 billion of senior secured and unsecured notes at the beginning of April. These notes were issued primarily to fund our 2024 maturities and are not expected to increase our overall leverage levels. We are very pleased with the transaction and view the tight issuance spreads as recognition by bondholders of Vistra's well-positioned business model and favorable outlook. \n Finally, the first quarter of the year was an active period for Vistra Zero. Our team began construction activities at 2 of our larger Illinois solar and energy storage developments at our former coal plant sites this spring. Notably, despite the current inflationary environment, we continue to expect these projects to comfortably exceed our targeted return thresholds. \n Importantly, we took the initial step in developing the long-term capital structure of the Vistra Zero Renewables business, closing on a nonrecourse financing at Vistra Zero. The $700 million term loan, which was also well received, is the first step towards our goal to fund our solar and energy storage growth with a combination of free cash flow from operating renewable projects and nonrecourse financings. \n Finally, in connection with the closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, we have begun paying dividends to the minority investors in Vistra Vision. Our current expectation is that we will pay approximately $100 million in 2024. We view these dividends as part of our capital allocation program as we continue to analyze Vistra's earnings power on a consolidated basis. \n We are very proud of the Vistra team's performance to begin the year, and we remain committed to executing against our 4 strategic priorities. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our second quarter call. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. \nShahriar Pourreza: Jim, not to sound like a broken record here, but obviously, the moves we've seen in sparks, does that change your thoughts around maybe Tradition's stand-alone viability and potentially separating the 2 companies sooner rather than later or kind of vice versa? And then maybe at the very least, should we expect more details around resegmentation with the roll forward later this year as the moves in the curves can obviously change kind of that top level disclosure you just provided between the 2 segments or it's just not a priority? \nJames Burke: Sure. Thank you, Shar. Yes, as you've noted, the sparks have obviously increased. Fixed-price power has also increased. This discussion about the value of tradition, which I think has come into focus a lot in the last 2 months, has been really positive for Vistra overall. As you note, the Vistra Tradition business is a key part of how we integrate our model overall. So we have a very large retail business that we have in Vistra Vision, and a lot of that business is residential. Residential has a level of usage that can vary with weather. And that's something that the asset side in Vistra Tradition supports extremely well.\n On the Vision side, we, of course, have a large nuclear fleet and our storage and solar, but that will not help us with the intraday and some of the weather swings that we would see in the seasons. And so Shar, I think what we were hoping to happen is happening, which is the Vistra Tradition side is being recognized for being highly valuable. I think there was months ago, obviously, already a view that the assets in Vistra Vision were valuable. There was a question mark about the Tradition side. I think that's being addressed by the tightening you're seeing in the marketplace. And frankly, the inbounds that we receive of folks interested in assets in Tradition because these are hard assets to replicate. And I would suggest with some of the EPA rules that have been issued, they're going to be even harder to replicate. \n So we think the integrated model has a lot of value as far as disclosures. We try, and obviously, in our script today, we shared some information about the free cash flow conversion of Vision and Tradition and the relative EBITDA weights. So our goal here was to provide some insights into how the financials work on the integrated model. But I don't think at this point, it's a priority for us to do a GAAP reporting associated with that. I think our goal is to provide our investors the key insights that drive the economics, which, as you know, have a lot more to do with the forwards and our ability to capture it than some of the traditional segmentation methods. So that's a little bit, I think, of color, Shar, is how we're thinking about it. \nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. That's perfect. And then, Jim, just on the market dynamics. I mean, a big investor debate right now over a new entry in ERCOT and whether it will even make a dent in demand through the end of the decade. I guess what's your house view on gas due builds and scarcity at this point? Are we kind of setting up for another early 2000s rush of turbines? \nJames Burke: Great question, Shar. I think -- so first of all, I think the queue of gas is starting to build a little bit. The application process will officially open for the Texas loan program in June. I think it's different than the early 2000s in a couple of ways. Number one, while sparks have improved over the -- even the last 2 months, in ERCOT, we no longer have the severe backwardation that we are accustomed to seeing. So that's a bullish sign. The loan program would be a bullish sign.\n However, the EPA rules, the proposed rule and the final rule that was issued last week will make it very difficult for somebody to be comfortable with the combined cycle gas turbine technology, which was different than the early 2000s. That baseload technology, if it were to run over 40% capacity factor, would need to have the carbon capture capability installed by 2032. We do not see an operating combined cycle with carbon capture technology anywhere in the world that we can point to. So I think the emphasis ultimately will be on peakers. The peakers are a higher heat rate. Machines are going to run and would need to run less than 40% capacity factor.\n And I think with the build-out of renewables, the solar, the wind, and even the shorter duration batteries, peakers make sense from a build-out standpoint. But I don't think they're going to be the 60-plus percent capacity factor assets that you saw coming in, in the early 2000s.\n As far as is it an oversupply, I think we're in a chicken-and-egg situation with ERCOT. I think the demand is there and the demand is going to be waiting for the supply. And so I don't think it's a situation where we're dealing with static demand and which asset can best serve it. I think it's going to be an ever-increasing demand that will continue to come as long as assets are coming on to the grid. And I believe Texas, which has positioned itself as open for business, wants to be a leader in this economic development opportunity. And I think that's true for transmission, I think it's true for renewables. I think it's true for dispatchable assets like gas peakers. So I think the fundamentals are really different than what we saw a couple of decades ago. \nShahriar Pourreza: Perfect. And then just 1 really quick one for Kris. Kris, just on the '26 midpoint opportunity, how much incremental EBITDA would there be if you were fully opened in '26? So I guess how sensitive are you to that number? \nKristopher Moldovan: Yes. On the sensitivity, what I'll say is we feel good about the $6 billion number. We have a high confidence in that number, given where the curves are and where our hedge percentage is. As we look to sensitivities, we haven't given that. But as we think about it versus what you'll see in our deck on 2025, it's roughly twice, I would say, as sensitive to moves in power and sparks is what we're showing for 2025. But we do feel confident in that $6 billion number. \nShahriar Pourreza: Jim, fantastic execution today. Thank you. \nJames Burke: Thank you, Shar. \nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. \nDurgesh Chopra: Congrats on the solid print. Just maybe can I ask you on the free cash flow conversion? So it looks like the '24 guidance is about 50% of EBITDA and then you gave us the numbers for Vistra Vision and then Tradition. Just how do you see that trending? The answer to that is higher, but what are the drivers that get you from 50% on the Vision side of the things to 60%? Is that integration, more efficiencies? Maybe just talk to that, please. \nKristopher Moldovan: Yes, that's a good question. As you would expect, we put a lot of emphasis internally on the free cash flow conversion rate. And as Jim said in our prepared remarks, we target 55% to 60%, and we're a little bit lower than that based on 2 timing issues, I would say, this year. One of those is that of the -- on Slide 11, you'll see that Energy Harbor increased $150 million. One of that is -- $100 million of that $150 million is really due to a change in accounting methodology for outage expense recognition. So that's a noncash item that is increasing EBITDA but not turning into cash. So that is hurting free cash flow conversion.\n And then the other one is that, as you would expect, the retail team enters into contract for future periods, we generally -- as the prices have increased, we generally see the hedge of that -- we do that hedging through a variety of structures. And if that price has risen in the outer years, the cost of those products has increased. So that does create a timing mismatch between when we pay the cash premiums on those options and when we recognize the revenue in future years. So we would expect that to reverse as we go forward.\n So if you just reverse those 2 timing impacts, our free cash flow conversion this year would be closer to 55%. And then we just see some other improvements that get us closer to the 60% starting next year and moving forward. \nJames Burke: Durgesh, what I would add to Kris's comment is, as you see the curves rise, some of that does not necessarily require additional capital and expense to achieve the higher earnings and free cash flow. So as you see the projections improve, you would expect to see some of the free cash flow conversion improve by the nature of the gross margin expansion and more of that dropping to the bottom line. So that is part of the trend that we're describing when we gave you the outlook for the free cash flow conversion. \nDurgesh Chopra: I appreciate all that color. Very helpful. And then just Jim and Kris, there's a lot of debate around how long are you going to do these share buybacks. I appreciate there's not a clear-cut answer, but can you give us some parameters? What metrics are you looking at? Is it free cash flow yield? Is it EBITDA? What is the comp group you're comparing it to? Is it IPPs or the broader market as we think about your decision-making on those share buybacks going forward? \nJames Burke: Sure. Durgesh, I'll start and argue, as a more of a free cash flow yield comparison and how does that compare to the next best use of capital. When we started this process, of course, years ago, we were talking about free cash flow yields north of 20% for the business. It was a very obvious choice, I think, as to how we would deploy capital, recognizing where our relative value was in the marketplace.\n As we've continued to see our share price move, which is a good thing, we've also seen the forward curves move and the earnings power of the business move. And so we still certainly see upside from where we sit today from a share value. But you'll see the free cash flow yields have certainly come down, still well above some peers in the market. But we also have other competitive projects now with those free cash flow yields.\n The ability to do our Vistra Zero projects in the mid-teens type of free cash flow type returns, that gives us some confidence there. We've got some organic opportunities, including some gas plants that we think are competitive. There may be inorganic opportunities like M&A on both retail and generation. Those are all more competitive today where we're currently trading. And the good news is that I think we could do multiple of those, not an either/or. So I still believe where we sit today with the free cash flow yield, the returning capital through our buybacks, as we've discussed, through 2025, the $2.25 billion makes a lot of sense.\n We have additional unallocated cash flow that we could do either more return of capital through buybacks, other shareholder opportunities such as dividends, but we're really focused on other growth opportunities. And as long as they're competitive with that benchmark on the return of capital through repurchases, we've got a lot of options on the table. I think that's an exciting place to be for Vistra. It's not where we were 3 years ago in terms of this choice set, but it's opened up considerably. Kris, anything you'd like to add? \nKristopher Moldovan: Yes. I would just, again, reiterate that we do maintain an internal model and evaluation. And then we get feedback from our partners, our consultants as well, and we've done that recently. And we continue to look at different ways to value our stock. And right now, where it sits is any way we look at it, given the update that we've provided today, we still feel like our stock is a good buy. To the extent it gets to the point where it exceeds our internal valuation, which we don't see as being a near-term issue, but we would have to then discuss -- we will be disciplined in how we spend our capital. \nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Arcaro: Great update.  I was wondering, could you talk [indiscernible] I'm curious, which location... \nJames Burke: David, this is Jim. I think I heard you mention data centers and curious about locations. Was that the question? It broke up a little bit on us, I'm sorry. \nDavid Arcaro: Sorry about that. I was wondering the data center opportunity with your nuclear plants, could you give an update as to potential timing, which locations might be more attractive than others? \nJames Burke: Sure. Yes, thank you, David. I think the conversation certainly has picked up this year. We started our process actually last year looking at  our -- at the time, it was a prospective close of Energy Harbor, which, of course, is now in the rearview mirror, which is great. And of course, the Talen AWS deal came out early March. So that was certainly a benchmark and a watershed event for the industry.\n I will say the 2 unit sites still have -- this is an order of preference that I think the market is grappling with. The 2 unit sites have more desirability for what their redundancy can provide. Then there's the single-unit sites, of course. And then there's the gas plants. So what's been very interesting, David, about our discussions with potential partners is we have normally sort of tried to search for opportunities for us to find partners and bid into their energy needs. Now this has been reversed. We actually have partners, potential partners coming to us directly.\n And speed is really very important to them. I would say gas has become as interesting to many of them as nuclear has, in fact, even a preference for some. So from our standpoint, all options are on the table with 40,000 megawatts. And we've got, obviously, 12 states and 40,000 megawatts that we can do some of our projects with. But we've actually flipped it a little bit so we've actually put out some RFPs ourselves. So instead of just responding to the inbounds, we've actually gone out to the marketplace to handle actually multiple conversations simultaneously and see what the best opportunity might be for us. And so that process has not concluded yet, but we're in the middle of that process. And we're very excited about the interest. \n Of course, you can imagine the hyperscalers, the colocators and the specific developers are in that process. We're dedicating a ton of time to it as I am personally. And it's probably been the most exciting development for our industry in quite some time. But we think we can be a great partner to one or more capable parties because of the size of the fleet in multiple geographies. And I don't know yet which one is going to happen first. But it's a huge opportunity set for us, David, and one that I think we're going to be making really good progress on here shortly. \nDavid Arcaro: Great, that's really helpful color. Was wondering if you could also touch on just other power plants and other colocation opportunities at gas plants. And are you potentially considering new build yourself as well, would be curious? \nJames Burke: Yes, David. It actually ties into the earlier question, which is you have existing assets that we have in our portfolio, large-scale combined cycle assets. The goal, obviously, for any of these potential partners with the data centers is speed and then reliability that they can count on for supply. It's going to be really hard to build an asset like a combined cycle to support a new data center without it having the carbon capture equipment that we were talking about. That's a huge lift.\n That carbon capture equipment could double, if not triple the cost of the combined cycle. So I don't view that as a really attractive near-term option at this point until that technology matures. So I think the existing combined cycles are an opportunity for somebody to colocate. I think the next best alternative, if it's involving gas, is likely to be peakers. But that will probably require that, that data center needs to also be prepared to pull from the grid so they could get the cheaper wind and solar power on the margin when available but be prepared to run the peakers for continuity of supply and potentially a price hedge. That I think is a potential model.\n And I think some of our partners we're talking to are wrestling with the fact that to build out the number of gigawatts that they're talking about, there's only so many large meters you can leave behind. You're going to have to actually add supply to the grid, and you're probably going to have to work in a hybrid type situation where you're pulling when there's surplus but then producing when you need. And I think peakers could potentially play that role. And I think, again, that plays into this queue discussion of what if there's a lot of gas to be built.\n I actually think that means more load comes and then we might have to build more gas along with the wind, solar and battery that is, as you know, already heavily in the queue. But this gas from a reliability standpoint, I think, will play a role one way or the other. I just don't see it being combined -- brand new combined cycles for that purpose until there's more clarity about these EPA rules. They're likely to be litigated. I think it's tough to invest into an environment where you've got uncertainty with protracted litigation. And so I think it's going to be difficult to create new baseload assets with confidence. And that's why I think the existing baseload assets are getting as much attention as they are. \nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: So just first maybe starting with your credit metrics and investment-grade aspirations. So just wondering what's the time line when we think you're going to hit -- the low -- I mean, investment-grade metrics? And how you could potentially use like stock-based M&A to actually accelerate this path to investment-grade? \nKristopher Moldovan: Thanks, Angie. I appreciate that. As you know, we just said today, we're right at 3x. I think there's a -- we're 2 notches away from investment-grade with 2 of the agencies and 1 notch away from the other one. So we have some work to do even to get closer to investment grade. I think we're continuing to look at -- as we look at the outlook, I mean, our leverage metrics go down just with the increase in EBITDA that you're seeing over time.\n And then we have sufficient -- a significant amount of cash that is yet to be allocated. And so some of that will go to debt repayment. So we do expect to -- that there could be opportunities to be talking about investment-grade metrics in the next year or 2. First, we want to make sure that we get the agencies to the 1 level below, and then we'll really start talking to them about timing for the deleveraging and where we need to get. I think we said on the last call, it's important for us to get to investment grade.\n If we do that, that we are comfortably in investment grade, we don't want to be right at the edge of the metrics. We want to be significantly into that area. So we haven't had those detailed discussions yet because like I said, we're still waiting to get the upgrade to the 1 notch below.\n I think as you think about our currency, as we said, we're still -- we've been focused. The price of the stock has come up and  there could be opportunities to use it in transactions. But at this point, as we just noted earlier in the call, we still see room for our stock to run and we're currently buying. So I don't think that, that would be the driver for why investment-grade wouldn't be the driver for any deal like that. We would certainly think about our ratings as we did any potential opportunistic transaction. But we're comfortable where we are. We do think we'll get to investment-grade metrics, but we don't have a specific time line to do so. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And then changing topics a bit, like your sunset assets and the brownfield site especially those associated with the former Dynegy coal plant. So just wondering, is there any change in your views about the longevity of those sunset assets? Now it seems like they're economic, right? I'm sure that some of the increased output from these assets is embedded in those EBITDA ranges that you provided us with. But I just wonder if some of these assets might get reallocated back to this provision, meaning that you will not put them in that sunset bucket. And number two, if there's any upside associated with these brownfield sites from the former coal plants, especially in Illinois. \nJames Burke: So Angie, I think on the coal plants themselves, the main driver that we're looking at on a go-forward basis is really the EPA rules that we need to comply with, which means that all but 2 of our coal plants, the 2 being Martin Lake and Oak Grove, will be retiring in that 2027 time frame unless there's some other change in rule or law that we don't anticipate.\n They are more economic, given these curves. I think part of the reason the backward -- the farther dated parts of the curve, particularly 2028 in PJM and even in Texas has moved up because the dates are becoming more real. And I think the supply-demand dynamic is becoming more apparent. And so it's not as much about the economics of those sites at this point that are in Ohio and Illinois and more about the compliance, which, of course, we're going to comply with the EPA rules that are in effect.\n As far as Martin Lake and Oak Grove, with the new rules that played out last week, we would either have to add carbon capture technology to those sites, which again would be very difficult to do, similarly to the comments I made about combined cycle or co-fire 40% with gas, which we believe is a possibility, something that we think could extend the life of those assets are needed potentially all the way up to 2039. That's something we would have to evaluate because we've got to have the sufficient gas supply to be doing co-firing at that level. And currently, we don't. We have some co-fire at Oak Grove, but it's a much lower level.\n So I think, Angie, this transition is happening on the grid, this baseload across the country, whether it's regulated markets or competitive markets, has to comply with these EPA rules. And I think the opportunity for us to do something with those sites and redevelop the sites down the road is possible but to operate in the coal configuration that it is right now seems unlikely for those sites in Ohio and Illinois. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And just 1 last 1 about capacity prices. I'm just wondering what kind of assumptions did you embed or like versus at least the last [indiscernible] capacity auction in those ranges that you provided us with, given that we're awaiting the next capacity auction in PJM? And we're seeing some bilateral contracts. We think those incremental capacity auctions clearing meaningfully higher than that last auction. I'm just wondering at least directionally if you can give us a sense what you expect and what is embedded in those ranges. \nJames Burke: Yes, Angie, we do see some bilateral trades that are indicating improvement in PJM capacity clears. I think we've still been pretty conservative with our forecast and how we've built assumptions for the auctions that are forthcoming, the first one coming in July. I think where we've seen some of these clears, we've seen them in the $90, $100 kind of megawatt day range. Whether we're going to see that in this upcoming clear or it's going to be one later in December, we like the steps that PJM has been attempting to bring forward.\n They haven't been successful in all of the market reforms that they've recommended, but I think there is a recognition of the tightening supply-demand dynamics and also the fact that this coal is going to be retiring. And there's, frankly, interest in stakeholders. At our visits to Ohio state leaders, they'd like to see some new gas plants built. So it's not just a Texas market dynamic. It's other places where they're attracting industry and the reshoring, the CHIPS build out, and they want to see more assets come to ground, which capacity markets play certainly a key role in sending that signal.\n So we have an improvement embedded, Angie, but certainly not anything that I would call a big lift from what we've seen some historical clears be. But it's going to have to prove out in the auctions themselves. And at this point, we await to -- they've been delayed for a while so we're all eager to see how these next couple of auctions play out. Steve, anything you'd like to add? \nStephen Muscato: No. I think, Jim, you hit it. It's basically, if you look historically, PJM cleared on average $100 a megawatt day historically. We see that happening at the very least. And obviously, as grids continue to get tighter with demand growth in PJM and the retirements of coal that Jim mentioned, which are really more environmentally driven than they are price-driven, that market should continue to tighten. \nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Fleishman: Thanks for some of the new disclosures. I'm going to go back to an earlier question just on the 2026 hedging, the 50% hedged. Could you give a little more color on just how the pricing of those hedges are versus current market and/or kind of the timing? Like that 50% number, where was it at year-end '23, Q1 '24? Just that would be helpful. \nJames Burke: Sure, Steve, the hedging, obviously, from our standpoint, we look at it as more opportunistic. So we look at where the price obviously is, where our fundamental view is and then is there actual liquidity in the market to transact. So just to give a perspective, at the end of last year, so December time frame, we were in a hedge percentage that was going to be closer to 10% to 15% hedged for 2026. So the team, as they've seen this move particularly more recently, have been moving more volume, Steve. There's also been more liquidity in the marketplace.\n And I'm going to ask Stephen Muscato to comment on that a little bit because, obviously, if you're looking to move some of your volume, depending on the depth in the market, you could be having impacts as well and the team is sensitive to that. I'd like Steve to comment on how he's seen that dynamic change because it's been more recent, and I think it's been indicative again of this recognition by market participants that the load is coming, some of the baseload is retiring, and this is coming together in a supply-demand dynamic. And Steve, I'd like for you to comment. \nStephen Muscato: Sure, Jim. As you pointed out, we've been waiting for the curve in ERCOT to no longer be in backwardation and move up into a contango formation, which it is. And the second thing we look for is basically liquidity events, meaning there's going to be people that are willing to buy it with enough scale for us to get our hedges off. And we're starting to see that liquidity come in.\n We're seeing trades that are no longer, let's say, 10 or 15 megawatts out in the '26 through '28 period. We are seeing people willing to buy a couple of hundred megs at a time. And so we try to scale into that because it is a finite market. It is something we can scale up. And now that we're seeing some of that contango come in, we're taking some off the table. I don't think we're done yet. I think the gas prices are part of the reason why ERCOT is in contango, not just heat rate.\n But if you look at sparks, sparks are expanding. But if you look at heat rates, and I really want to bring that to your focus, heat rates are not expanding as fast as you would think, given a tightening market. So a lot of this contango is gas-driven, and we think there's more to come in terms of heat rate expansion. \nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then just 2, I guess, other questions on hedging. Is there -- in that 50%, is there a big difference between your hedges between ERCOT and PJM? Are they both around 50% or... \nJames Burke: Yes, Steve, we weren't planning to comment on specifically by region on that front. But obviously, those are our 2 biggest portfolios so I would just leave it at that. I think it depends on the depth in the market and where we feel we can comfortably move some of the volume. And Steve, I do want to correct 1 thing I shared a minute ago. I was 1 file off as I was trying to respond to your question. We were closer around a 25% hedge at the end of the year in 2023, and that's moved up closer to the 50%. So I was trying to be a little bit too nimble in pulling out my information. \nSteven Fleishman: Yes, no worries. Directionally correct. Okay. And then just we've been getting a lot of questions on nuclear fuel with the current law being passed. Just could you comment on how you're positioned on enriched uranium and the like, that would be helpful. \nJames Burke: Sure. Yes, we have -- Steve, we have secured the supply physically for the outages all the way through 2027 and substantially financially. There's a few of our products that have some index pricing to it. And we are significantly hedged into 2028 as well. So we feel really good about fueling the 6 units over this planning horizon. With the Russian ban, with an uncertain or to be determined waiver process, I should say, we're very active in the discussions just to make sure that there's ample liquidity in the market as folks will look at these disruptions potentially, and it can cause the spot prices to move up considerably.\n We're fairly well hedged in the financial range. We're kind of looking at a $7 over the whole kind of time period, including Energy Harbor and the Comanche Peak site. So we were a little bit further hedged out for the Texas site, a little bit more open on the back end with Energy Harbor. If we put it all together and locked it all down, it's roughly a $7 a megawatt hour average over that period.\n But the spot markets are in the $11 to $12 range, so DOE, with the additional funding of roughly $2.7 billion, we'll be looking to incentivize domestic production and we'll see how that develops. But that's probably going to take into that time frame of the end of this decade to see something physically materialize there. But I think we've done a good job of locking down some of these risks, both physically and financially, and that's embedded in the numbers we've provided today. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bill Appicelli with UBS. \nWilliam Appicelli: Most of my questions have been answered. But just on the retail side, can you remind us the average duration of the contracts and the ability to roll those prices forward as the wholesale prices go higher as we move through time? \nJames Burke: Sure. Yes, Bill. So the business contracts that we sell can be a duration of 1 to 2 years all the way up to 10 years. Now our portfolio is more skewed to the residential business, which I would say those tend to be 1- to 2-year contracts. Residential customers don't tend to have as much appetite for the longer-dated contracts. And so if you see a sustained higher price environment, you would expect the competitive market from a retail perspective to reflect the new cost of goods sold over time. And that would mean higher prices in a sustained high power market.\n It also has meant in the past lower prices, when you've seen lower power prices sustain themselves and retailers need to respond to that. I do believe that in this situation, this has been a relatively stable and steady build in power prices. So these aren't shock-driven like the polar vortex and even Winter Storm Uri, where there were large bills being sent by retailers that hadn't fully hedged. This has been more of a steady build, I think, more consistent with inflation that folks have been seeing in other categories that they procure.\n But from our integrated model standpoint, you would expect that after you get past the 1- to 2-year horizon, you start to reflect the higher or lower retail revenues associated with wholesale power costs. And we try to target more of a steady dollar per megawatt hour type margin in retail so that it's additive to whatever is happening on the wholesale side. \nWilliam Appicelli: That's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on that same topic. In terms of the -- given the population growth, can you just speak to your market share and the customer counts as you've seen a growing pool of potential customers in the state? \nJames Burke: Sure, Bill. I'm going to ask Scott Hudson, our President of the Retail business is here, and I'll ask Scott to cover. \nScott Hudson: Sure. Well, first of all, let me just touch on current retail performance. We really had strong performance in the quarter and year-over-year. We grew residential direct-to-consumer customer counts by 13%. That came not only from the Energy Harbor acquisition, and we had some really nice success in the market that just opened, but we're also growing these books across all markets sort of organically. So really nice growth rates in Texas around the population. As Jim mentioned earlier, roughly 1.5% to 2%. And it's our goal at retail to grow with the market or exceed that market and grow kind of market share.\n So we have a very large flagship brand with TXU Energy that holds significant share in the ERCOT market, but we also have 5 other brands that continue to complement one another. And our goal is sort of optimizing those brands by targeting them towards specific populations. It really is that coordination and sort of our use of advanced analytics to understand what populations, what brands and what particular products that allow us to continue to grow in these markets. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Burke for any closing remarks. \nJames Burke: Yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us, and I again want to thank the Vistra team, which includes our new members in Ohio and Pennsylvania. And we are very excited about our platform and our unique growth opportunities. The S&P 500 inclusion is a great milestone and our future looks bright. We appreciate your interest and investment in Vistra, and we look forward to visiting soon. Have a great day. Thank you. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristopher Moldovan",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. \n Turning to Slide 10. Vistra delivered strong first quarter results in 2024 with ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of approximately $813 million, including $841 million from generation, offset by negative $28 million from retail. This represents a $259 million improvement, nearly 50% year-over-year. \n For generation, despite another quarter of mild weather conditions, including the warmest winter on record, our comprehensive hedging program, combined with the team's ability to optimize our flexible assets enabled another quarter of strong results. \n Turning to retail. As was the case in 2023, the first quarter result was within the range of what we expected. We continue to see higher hedge power costs in the winter and summer months due to entry year shaping and therefore anticipate substantially all of ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA for retail to be achieved in the second and fourth quarters. We believe continued strong accounts and margins in the first quarter position retail well for the balance of the year. Finally, our first quarter results benefited from the inclusion of 1 month of Energy Harbor, which totaled approximately $60 million for generation and retail combined. \n On Energy Harbor, we provided an update on the integration process on Slide 11. As Jim mentioned earlier, the team has made significant progress integrating the businesses despite a later-than-expected closing. In the short time since completing the acquisition, the team has identified approximately $150 million of timing and gross margin benefits that are expected to be realized in 2024. These benefits are expected to bring the in-year 2024 contribution from Energy Harbor to approximately $700 million, which compares favorably to our 10-month contribution estimate. \n Turning to integration benefits. We've previously communicated expected run rate synergies of $79 million by year-end 2024 and a run rate of $125 million by year-end 2025. Based on the efforts of the teams completed to date, we are increasing the amount of expected run rate synergies by $25 million to a total of $150 million. \n Further, when we first announced the acquisition of Energy Harbor, we highlighted our core competency of integrating generation assets, citing the achievements of our Operational Performance Improvement, or OPI, program following the Dynegy acquisition. I am pleased to report that this program continues to deliver, with the teams having identified opportunities for more efficient operations across our nuclear fleet that we expect to lead to $50 million of run rate adjusted EBITDA improvements by year-end 2026. Importantly, we expect these additional opportunities to be achieved with little incremental capital spend. \n Finally, we provide an update on the execution of our capital allocation plan on Slide 12. As of May 3, we executed approximately $3.9 billion of share repurchases, leading to an approximately 28% reduction compared to the number of shares that were outstanding in November 2021. In line with our statements on the fourth quarter 2023 call, we expect to execute at least $2.25 billion of share repurchases over the course of 2024 and 2025. With the long-term update provided today, we still see our shares trading at an elevated free cash flow yield and thus continue to believe share repurchases to be a sound use of our capital. \n Moving to our dividend program. We announced last week our first quarter 2024 common stock dividend of $0.2175 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 7% over the dividend paid in Q2 2023 and an impressive 45% increase over the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2021 when our capital allocation plan was first established. \n Turning to the balance sheet. Vistra's net leverage ratio currently sits at 3x. As Jim stated earlier, we expect to return to below 3x by the end of 2024 and continue to target a long-term net leverage ratio below 3x. As you may have seen, we successfully issued $1.5 billion of senior secured and unsecured notes at the beginning of April. These notes were issued primarily to fund our 2024 maturities and are not expected to increase our overall leverage levels. We are very pleased with the transaction and view the tight issuance spreads as recognition by bondholders of Vistra's well-positioned business model and favorable outlook. \n Finally, the first quarter of the year was an active period for Vistra Zero. Our team began construction activities at 2 of our larger Illinois solar and energy storage developments at our former coal plant sites this spring. Notably, despite the current inflationary environment, we continue to expect these projects to comfortably exceed our targeted return thresholds. \n Importantly, we took the initial step in developing the long-term capital structure of the Vistra Zero Renewables business, closing on a nonrecourse financing at Vistra Zero. The $700 million term loan, which was also well received, is the first step towards our goal to fund our solar and energy storage growth with a combination of free cash flow from operating renewable projects and nonrecourse financings. \n Finally, in connection with the closing of the Energy Harbor acquisition, we have begun paying dividends to the minority investors in Vistra Vision. Our current expectation is that we will pay approximately $100 million in 2024. We view these dividends as part of our capital allocation program as we continue to analyze Vistra's earnings power on a consolidated basis. \n We are very proud of the Vistra team's performance to begin the year, and we remain committed to executing against our 4 strategic priorities. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our second quarter call. With that, operator, we're ready to open the line for questions. Yes. On the sensitivity, what I'll say is we feel good about the $6 billion number. We have a high confidence in that number, given where the curves are and where our hedge percentage is. As we look to sensitivities, we haven't given that. But as we think about it versus what you'll see in our deck on 2025, it's roughly twice, I would say, as sensitive to moves in power and sparks is what we're showing for 2025. But we do feel confident in that $6 billion number. Yes, that's a good question. As you would expect, we put a lot of emphasis internally on the free cash flow conversion rate. And as Jim said in our prepared remarks, we target 55% to 60%, and we're a little bit lower than that based on 2 timing issues, I would say, this year. One of those is that of the -- on Slide 11, you'll see that Energy Harbor increased $150 million. One of that is -- $100 million of that $150 million is really due to a change in accounting methodology for outage expense recognition. So that's a noncash item that is increasing EBITDA but not turning into cash. So that is hurting free cash flow conversion.\n And then the other one is that, as you would expect, the retail team enters into contract for future periods, we generally -- as the prices have increased, we generally see the hedge of that -- we do that hedging through a variety of structures. And if that price has risen in the outer years, the cost of those products has increased. So that does create a timing mismatch between when we pay the cash premiums on those options and when we recognize the revenue in future years. So we would expect that to reverse as we go forward.\n So if you just reverse those 2 timing impacts, our free cash flow conversion this year would be closer to 55%. And then we just see some other improvements that get us closer to the 60% starting next year and moving forward. Yes. I would just, again, reiterate that we do maintain an internal model and evaluation. And then we get feedback from our partners, our consultants as well, and we've done that recently. And we continue to look at different ways to value our stock. And right now, where it sits is any way we look at it, given the update that we've provided today, we still feel like our stock is a good buy. To the extent it gets to the point where it exceeds our internal valuation, which we don't see as being a near-term issue, but we would have to then discuss -- we will be disciplined in how we spend our capital. Thanks, Angie. I appreciate that. As you know, we just said today, we're right at 3x. I think there's a -- we're 2 notches away from investment-grade with 2 of the agencies and 1 notch away from the other one. So we have some work to do even to get closer to investment grade. I think we're continuing to look at -- as we look at the outlook, I mean, our leverage metrics go down just with the increase in EBITDA that you're seeing over time.\n And then we have sufficient -- a significant amount of cash that is yet to be allocated. And so some of that will go to debt repayment. So we do expect to -- that there could be opportunities to be talking about investment-grade metrics in the next year or 2. First, we want to make sure that we get the agencies to the 1 level below, and then we'll really start talking to them about timing for the deleveraging and where we need to get.

We do think we'll get to investment-grade metrics, but we don't have a specific time line to do so."

I think the gas prices are part of the reason why ERCOT is in contango, not just heat rate.\n But if you look at sparks, sparks are expanding. But if you look at heat rates, and I really want to bring that to your focus, heat rates are not expanding as fast as you would think, given a tightening market. So a lot of this contango is gas-driven, and we think there's more to come in terms of heat rate expansion."

            "name": "James Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. I appreciate all of you taking the time to join our first quarter 2024 results call. This call is taking place in conjunction with a major milestone for Vistra, namely the first day of inclusion of our stock in the S&P 500. I want to recognize the hard work of our Vistra team and the support and patience exhibited by our shareholders as this is a result of both strong execution over time, bolstered by improving market dynamics in the power sector. We are pleased to be included in the index and excited about the future prospects for Vistra and its stakeholders. \n Turning to Slide 5. Before we cover the positive results for the quarter, it's worth noting that we see a significant increase in Vistra's long-term outlook. Our team has been hard at work to ensure Vistra's best positioned for the increasing power demand fundamentals while providing reliable, affordable and sustainable power to our customers. \n Continuing the theme of execution, our integration teams were hard at work during this quarter with the closing of our acquisition of Energy Harbor on March 1. We were ready on day 1 to unify under the Vistra name and welcome our new colleagues. \n The core theme throughout the integration process has been 1 team, and we believe that is crucial to a sustainable, high-performance organization. The sites are working closely with each other to share best practices and create a culture of continuous improvement. As a result, the teams identified the potential for several operational and performance improvements throughout the nuclear fleet. \n As Kris will cover later, including the expected financial benefits of these improvements and the additional synergies we've identified, we now expect the run rate adjusted EBITDA contribution from Energy Harbor to exceed $1.1 billion beginning in 2026. \n Turning to the other key priorities. We continue to execute on our capital return plan put in place during the fourth quarter of 2021. Since that time, we've returned to our investors approximately $4.6 billion, including $3.9 billion of share repurchases through May 3 of this year. We continue to view our shares as an attractive investment and expect to execute at least $2.25 billion of share repurchases throughout '24 and '25. Crucially, our balance sheet remains strong, enabling the ongoing capital return plan. \n Our net leverage finished the quarter at approximately 3x, exceeding our expectations indicated on the previous quarter results call. We expect net leverage to be below 3x by year-end 2024. Our disciplined capital approach also enables us to invest in solar and energy storage growth that capitalizes on sites interconnects in the Vistra portfolio. Our Baldwin and Calpine sites where construction began earlier this year on paired solar energy storage facilities are good examples of this strategy, and we expect these to be online by the end of the year. Finally, we've completed our first nonrecourse financing in Vistra Zero, providing attractive capital for our growing portfolio of operating renewable assets. \n Moving to Slide 6. We achieved ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $813 million, a 47% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. As you can see, many of the themes contributing to results last year continued into the first quarter of this year. The first quarter of 2024 again reflected the benefits of our comprehensive hedging program as the warmest winter on record in the U.S. led to lower-than-expected cleared power prices across the country. Specifically, while power prices in the markets we serve cleared below $30 per megawatt hour on average for the first quarter, our first quarter results reflect an average realized power price of over $50 per megawatt hour. \n In these volatile weather environments, which included a winter event in mid-January and then mild weather in February and March, our generation team once again delivered with another strong quarter of commercial availability at approximately 98%. Being flexible with, not only daily operations, including ramping down when economics signal us to do so, but rescheduling planned outages to optimize opportunities enabled the business to deliver strong results. \n Finally, the retail team delivered another positive quarter of customer count growth across our Texas and Midwest and Northeast geographies. With the acquisition of Energy Harbor now complete, we're initiating a guidance on a combined basis for ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA of $4,550,000,000 to $5,050,000,000 and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth of $2,200,000,000 to $2,700,000,000. It's important to note that this guidance excludes any potential benefit from the nuclear production tax credit, or PTC, given the uncertainty around how it will be implemented when the regulations are issued later this year. \n However, based on where prices settled in the first quarter and the forward curves for the balance of the year, we believe the PTC could add a significant amount to our 2024 ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA guidance range. \n Finally, you will note that the implied conversion rate from ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA to ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth for 2024 is below our stated target of 55% to 60%, primarily due to a couple of timing impacts. We expect to return to our target 55% to 60% range in 2025 and beyond. \n While we are not providing guidance to reflect specific ranges for Vistra Vision and Vistra Tradition, our view is that each is expected to contribute roughly half of our adjusted EBITDA over time. However, given the business mix and current capital structure, you can expect Vistra Vision will convert adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow before growth at a higher rate over time, roughly 60% to 65% compared to Vistra Tradition, which we expect to convert at a rate of approximately 50% to 55%. \n Turning to Slide 7. There has been much discussion in recent months about the substantial power demand growth forecast, including from the potential build-out of data centers and other sources of electricity demand. Third-party research indicates data center-related activity could approach 35 gigawatts of additional demand by 2030. However, our teams also see multiple additional potential drivers of demand in the geographies we serve. These drivers include: continued reshoring of industrial activity as evidenced by multiple large chip manufacturing site build-outs, partially due to the CHIPS Act; increased electrification of commercial, industrial, and residential load across the country, as evidenced by the expectation of approximately 20 gigawatts of additional power demand in West Texas by 2030; and strong population growth, particularly in the state of Texas, which has been steady at 1.5% to 2% per year. \n With these drivers, we see the potential demand outcome skewing higher, albeit with a wider range. In their most recent report, PJM's load growth expectations through 2030 doubled from their 2023 estimate. In Texas, recent reports from ERCOT suggest load growth from 2030 in a wide range from as low as 1.6% per year to as high as 6% growth per year or even higher if more than half of the large loads recently discussed to ERCOT actually materialize. \n The trailing 10 years has been approximately 2.5%, and that was before some of these more recent drivers of the Permian electrification, the CHIPS Act, and the data center demand. This increase in demand across the country will need to be served by an electric grid that will continue to see coal plant retirements in all markets. The Inflation Reduction Act will continue to incentivize wind, solar, and battery resources, and we will also need gas-fired generation to back up those intermittent sources. \n The new greenhouse gas rules issued from the EPA on April 25 are expected to make it more challenging to economically build baseload combined cycle gas turbine facilities. But we expect those rules to be litigated, and it's unclear what the final outcome will be. \n Natural gas peakers could be a solution that threads the needle of environmental rules and demand needs. In addition, it is likely that existing assets will need to run at higher capacity factors to meet overall annual energy needs as more coal retires. We see Vistra is well positioned for these trends, given our diversified portfolio of reliable and sustainable assets in growing markets. \n As you can see on Slide 8, the forward curves have moved up considerably in both the Texas and PJM markets on the improved demand outlook, particularly on the longer end of the curve. As an example, ERCOT North around-the-clock fixed price forwards for calendar 2026 increased over $7 per megawatt hour or approximately 13% since we last provided guidance in November 2023. \n For 2027 and 2028, the increases were even more significant. In the past, we've commented that the backwardation and forward curves did not reflect the tighter grid conditions that we expected to result from continued load growth and planned thermal asset retirements. \n With the recent improvement in both forward power prices and some additional market interest in transacting further out on the curve, we believe the market is beginning to recognize these dynamics. As I stated at the beginning of the call, our integrated business model, which combines increasingly critical dispatchable generation assets with a premier retail business, positions us well to create long-term value in this dynamic and growing market. \n As a result, based on recent market curves, we are currently estimating a combined ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity for 2025 of $5 billion to $5.5 billion. In addition, while significant uncertainty to both the upside and downside remains for 2026, given our 2026 hedge percentage which is approximately 50%, we have line of sight to an ongoing operations adjusted EBITDA midpoint opportunity of more than $6 billion. Like the 2024 guidance, our long-term outlook excludes any potential benefit from the nuclear PTC, and we will continue to evaluate the appropriate timing for including any of that potential benefit. \n Even without the inclusion of any PTC benefit, the improvement in near-term and long-term outlook for Vistra is expected to result in a meaningful amount of unallocated capital through 2026. \n And with that, I will turn it over to Kris to provide a detailed review of our first quarter results. Kris? Sure. Thank you, Shar. Yes, as you've noted, the sparks have obviously increased. Fixed-price power has also increased. This discussion about the value of tradition, which I think has come into focus a lot in the last 2 months, has been really positive for Vistra overall. As you note, the Vistra Tradition business is a key part of how we integrate our model overall. So we have a very large retail business that we have in Vistra Vision, and a lot of that business is residential. Residential has a level of usage that can vary with weather. And that's something that the asset side in Vistra Tradition supports extremely well.\n On the Vision side, we, of course, have a large nuclear fleet and our storage and solar, but that will not help us with the intraday and some of the weather swings that we would see in the seasons. And so Shar, I think what we were hoping to happen is happening, which is the Vistra Tradition side is being recognized for being highly valuable. I think there was months ago, obviously, already a view that the assets in Vistra Vision were valuable. There was a question mark about the Tradition side. I think that's being addressed by the tightening you're seeing in the marketplace. And frankly, the inbounds that we receive of folks interested in assets in Tradition because these are hard assets to replicate. And I would suggest with some of the EPA rules that have been issued, they're going to be even harder to replicate. \n So we think the integrated model has a lot of value as far as disclosures. We try, and obviously, in our script today, we shared some information about the free cash flow conversion of Vision and Tradition and the relative EBITDA weights. So our goal here was to provide some insights into how the financials work on the integrated model. But I don't think at this point, it's a priority for us to do a GAAP reporting associated with that. I think our goal is to provide our investors the key insights that drive the economics, which, as you know, have a lot more to do with the forwards and our ability to capture it than some of the traditional segmentation methods. So that's a little bit, I think, of color, Shar, is how we're thinking about it. Great question, Shar. I think -- so first of all, I think the queue of gas is starting to build a little bit. The application process will officially open for the Texas loan program in June. I think it's different than the early 2000s in a couple of ways. Number one, while sparks have improved over the -- even the last 2 months, in ERCOT, we no longer have the severe backwardation that we are accustomed to seeing. So that's a bullish sign. The loan program would be a bullish sign.\n However, the EPA rules, the proposed rule and the final rule that was issued last week will make it very difficult for somebody to be comfortable with the combined cycle gas turbine technology, which was different than the early 2000s. That baseload technology, if it were to run over 40% capacity factor, would need to have the carbon capture capability installed by 2032. We do not see an operating combined cycle with carbon capture technology anywhere in the world that we can point to. So I think the emphasis ultimately will be on peakers. The peakers are a higher heat rate. Machines are going to run and would need to run less than 40% capacity factor.\n And I think with the build-out of renewables, the solar, the wind, and even the shorter duration batteries, peakers make sense from a build-out standpoint. But I don't think they're going to be the 60-plus percent capacity factor assets that you saw coming in, in the early 2000s.\n As far as is it an oversupply, I think we're in a chicken-and-egg situation with ERCOT. I think the demand is there and the demand is going to be waiting for the supply. And so I don't think it's a situation where we're dealing with static demand and which asset can best serve it. I think it's going to be an ever-increasing demand that will continue to come as long as assets are coming on to the grid. And I believe Texas, which has positioned itself as open for business, wants to be a leader in this economic development opportunity. And I think that's true for transmission, I think it's true for renewables. I think it's true for dispatchable assets like gas peakers. So I think the fundamentals are really different than what we saw a couple of decades ago. Thank you, Shar. Durgesh, what I would add to Kris's comment is, as you see the curves rise, some of that does not necessarily require additional capital and expense to achieve the higher earnings and free cash flow. So as you see the projections improve, you would expect to see some of the free cash flow conversion improve by the nature of the gross margin expansion and more of that dropping to the bottom line. So that is part of the trend that we're describing when we gave you the outlook for the free cash flow conversion. Sure. Durgesh, I'll start and argue, as a more of a free cash flow yield comparison and how does that compare to the next best use of capital. When we started this process, of course, years ago, we were talking about free cash flow yields north of 20% for the business. It was a very obvious choice, I think, as to how we would deploy capital, recognizing where our relative value was in the marketplace.\n As we've continued to see our share price move, which is a good thing, we've also seen the forward curves move and the earnings power of the business move. And so we still certainly see upside from where we sit today from a share value. But you'll see the free cash flow yields have certainly come down, still well above some peers in the market. But we also have other competitive projects now with those free cash flow yields.\n The ability to do our Vistra Zero projects in the mid-teens type of free cash flow type returns, that gives us some confidence there. We've got some organic opportunities, including some gas plants that we think are competitive. There may be inorganic opportunities like M&A on both retail and generation. Those are all more competitive today where we're currently trading. And the good news is that I think we could do multiple of those, not an either/or. So I still believe where we sit today with the free cash flow yield, the returning capital through our buybacks, as we've discussed, through 2025, the $2.25 billion makes a lot of sense.\n We have additional unallocated cash flow that we could do either more return of capital through buybacks, other shareholder opportunities such as dividends, but we're really focused on other growth opportunities. And as long as they're competitive with that benchmark on the return of capital through repurchases, we've got a lot of options on the table. I think that's an exciting place to be for Vistra. It's not where we were 3 years ago in terms of this choice set, but it's opened up considerably. Kris, anything you'd like to add? David, this is Jim. I think I heard you mention data centers and curious about locations. Was that the question? It broke up a little bit on us, I'm sorry. Sure. Yes, thank you, David. I think the conversation certainly has picked up this year. We started our process actually last year looking at  our -- at the time, it was a prospective close of Energy Harbor, which, of course, is now in the rearview mirror, which is great. And of course, the Talen AWS deal came out early March. So that was certainly a benchmark and a watershed event for the industry.\n I will say the 2 unit sites still have -- this is an order of preference that I think the market is grappling with. The 2 unit sites have more desirability for what their redundancy can provide. Then there's the single-unit sites, of course. And then there's the gas plants. So what's been very interesting, David, about our discussions with potential partners is we have normally sort of tried to search for opportunities for us to find partners and bid into their energy needs. Now this has been reversed. We actually have partners, potential partners coming to us directly.\n And speed is really very important to them. I would say gas has become as interesting to many of them as nuclear has, in fact, even a preference for some. So from our standpoint, all options are on the table with 40,000 megawatts. And we've got, obviously, 12 states and 40,000 megawatts that we can do some of our projects with. But we've actually flipped it a little bit so we've actually put out some RFPs ourselves. So instead of just responding to the inbounds, we've actually gone out to the marketplace to handle actually multiple conversations simultaneously and see what the best opportunity might be for us. And so that process has not concluded yet, but we're in the middle of that process. And we're very excited about the interest. \n Of course, you can imagine the hyperscalers, the colocators and the specific developers are in that process. We're dedicating a ton of time to it as I am personally. And it's probably been the most exciting development for our industry in quite some time. But we think we can be a great partner to one or more capable parties because of the size of the fleet in multiple geographies. And I don't know yet which one is going to happen first. But it's a huge opportunity set for us, David, and one that I think we're going to be making really good progress on here shortly. Yes, David. It actually ties into the earlier question, which is you have existing assets that we have in our portfolio, large-scale combined cycle assets. The goal, obviously, for any of these potential partners with the data centers is speed and then reliability that they can count on for supply. It's going to be really hard to build an asset like a combined cycle to support a new data center without it having the carbon capture equipment that we were talking about. That's a huge lift.\n That carbon capture equipment could double, if not triple the cost of the combined cycle. So I don't view that as a really attractive near-term option at this point until that technology matures. So I think the existing combined cycles are an opportunity for somebody to colocate. I think the next best alternative, if it's involving gas, is likely to be peakers. But that will probably require that, that data center needs to also be prepared to pull from the grid so they could get the cheaper wind and solar power on the margin when available but be prepared to run the peakers for continuity of supply and potentially a price hedge. That I think is a potential model.\n And I think some of our partners we're talking to are wrestling with the fact that to build out the number of gigawatts that they're talking about, there's only so many large meters you can leave behind. You're going to have to actually add supply to the grid, and you're probably going to have to work in a hybrid type situation where you're pulling when there's surplus but then producing when you need. And I think peakers could potentially play that role. And I think, again, that plays into this queue discussion of what if there's a lot of gas to be built.\n I actually think that means more load comes and then we might have to build more gas along with the wind, solar and battery that is, as you know, already heavily in the queue. But this gas from a reliability standpoint, I think, will play a role one way or the other. I just don't see it being combined -- brand new combined cycles for that purpose until there's more clarity about these EPA rules. They're likely to be litigated. I think it's tough to invest into an environment where you've got uncertainty with protracted litigation. And so I think it's going to be difficult to create new baseload assets with confidence. And that's why I think the existing baseload assets are getting as much attention as they are. So Angie, I think on the coal plants themselves, the main driver that we're looking at on a go-forward basis is really the EPA rules that we need to comply with, which means that all but 2 of our coal plants, the 2 being Martin Lake and Oak Grove, will be retiring in that 2027 time frame unless there's some other change in rule or law that we don't anticipate.\n They are more economic, given these curves. I think part of the reason the backward -- the farther dated parts of the curve, particularly 2028 in PJM and even in Texas has moved up because the dates are becoming more real. And I think the supply-demand dynamic is becoming more apparent. And so it's not as much about the economics of those sites at this point that are in Ohio and Illinois and more about the compliance, which, of course, we're going to comply with the EPA rules that are in effect.\n As far as Martin Lake and Oak Grove, with the new rules that played out last week, we would either have to add carbon capture technology to those sites, which again would be very difficult to do, similarly to the comments I made about combined cycle or co-fire 40% with gas, which we believe is a possibility, something that we think could extend the life of those assets are needed potentially all the way up to 2039. That's something we would have to evaluate because we've got to have the sufficient gas supply to be doing co-firing at that level. And currently, we don't. We have some co-fire at Oak Grove, but it's a much lower level.\n So I think, Angie, this transition is happening on the grid, this baseload across the country, whether it's regulated markets or competitive markets, has to comply with these EPA rules. And I think the opportunity for us to do something with those sites and redevelop the sites down the road is possible but to operate in the coal configuration that it is right now seems unlikely for those sites in Ohio and Illinois. Yes, Angie, we do see some bilateral trades that are indicating improvement in PJM capacity clears. I think we've still been pretty conservative with our forecast and how we've built assumptions for the auctions that are forthcoming, the first one coming in July. I think where we've seen some of these clears, we've seen them in the $90, $100 kind of megawatt day range. Whether we're going to see that in this upcoming clear or it's going to be one later in December, we like the steps that PJM has been attempting to bring forward.\n They haven't been successful in all of the market reforms that they've recommended, but I think there is a recognition of the tightening supply-demand dynamics and also the fact that this coal is going to be retiring. And there's, frankly, interest in stakeholders. At our visits to Ohio state leaders, they'd like to see some new gas plants built. So it's not just a Texas market dynamic. It's other places where they're attracting industry and the reshoring, the CHIPS build out, and they want to see more assets come to ground, which capacity markets play certainly a key role in sending that signal.\n So we have an improvement embedded, Angie, but certainly not anything that I would call a big lift from what we've seen some historical clears be. But it's going to have to prove out in the auctions themselves. And at this point, we await to -- they've been delayed for a while so we're all eager to see how these next couple of auctions play out. Steve, anything you'd like to add? Sure, Steve, the hedging, obviously, from our standpoint, we look at it as more opportunistic. So we look at where the price obviously is, where our fundamental view is and then is there actual liquidity in the market to transact. So just to give a perspective, at the end of last year, so December time frame, we were in a hedge percentage that was going to be closer to 10% to 15% hedged for 2026. So the team, as they've seen this move particularly more recently, have been moving more volume, Steve. There's also been more liquidity in the marketplace.\n And I'm going to ask Stephen Muscato to comment on that a little bit because, obviously, if you're looking to move some of your volume, depending on the depth in the market, you could be having impacts as well and the team is sensitive to that. I'd like Steve to comment on how he's seen that dynamic change because it's been more recent, and I think it's been indicative again of this recognition by market participants that the load is coming, some of the baseload is retiring, and this is coming together in a supply-demand dynamic. And Steve, I'd like for you to comment. Yes, Steve, we weren't planning to comment on specifically by region on that front. But obviously, those are our 2 biggest portfolios so I would just leave it at that. I think it depends on the depth in the market and where we feel we can comfortably move some of the volume. And Steve, I do want to correct 1 thing I shared a minute ago. I was 1 file off as I was trying to respond to your question. We were closer around a 25% hedge at the end of the year in 2023, and that's moved up closer to the 50%. So I was trying to be a little bit too nimble in pulling out my information. Sure. Yes, we have -- Steve, we have secured the supply physically for the outages all the way through 2027 and substantially financially. There's a few of our products that have some index pricing to it. And we are significantly hedged into 2028 as well. So we feel really good about fueling the 6 units over this planning horizon. With the Russian ban, with an uncertain or to be determined waiver process, I should say, we're very active in the discussions just to make sure that there's ample liquidity in the market as folks will look at these disruptions potentially, and it can cause the spot prices to move up considerably.\n We're fairly well hedged in the financial range. We're kind of looking at a $7 over the whole kind of time period, including Energy Harbor and the Comanche Peak site. So we were a little bit further hedged out for the Texas site, a little bit more open on the back end with Energy Harbor. If we put it all together and locked it all down, it's roughly a $7 a megawatt hour average over that period.\n But the spot markets are in the $11 to $12 range, so DOE, with the additional funding of roughly $2.7 billion, we'll be looking to incentivize domestic production and we'll see how that develops. But that's probably going to take into that time frame of the end of this decade to see something physically materialize there. But I think we've done a good job of locking down some of these risks, both physically and financially, and that's embedded in the numbers we've provided today. Sure. Yes, Bill. So the business contracts that we sell can be a duration of 1 to 2 years all the way up to 10 years. Now our portfolio is more skewed to the residential business, which I would say those tend to be 1- to 2-year contracts. Residential customers don't tend to have as much appetite for the longer-dated contracts. And so if you see a sustained higher price environment, you would expect the competitive market from a retail perspective to reflect the new cost of goods sold over time. And that would mean higher prices in a sustained high power market.\n It also has meant in the past lower prices, when you've seen lower power prices sustain themselves and retailers need to respond to that. I do believe that in this situation, this has been a relatively stable and steady build in power prices. So these aren't shock-driven like the polar vortex and even Winter Storm Uri, where there were large bills being sent by retailers that hadn't fully hedged. This has been more of a steady build, I think, more consistent with inflation that folks have been seeing in other categories that they procure.\n But from our integrated model standpoint, you would expect that after you get past the 1- to 2-year horizon, you start to reflect the higher or lower retail revenues associated with wholesale power costs. And we try to target more of a steady dollar per megawatt hour type margin in retail so that it's additive to whatever is happening on the wholesale side. Sure, Bill. I'm going to ask Scott Hudson, our President of the Retail business is here, and I'll ask Scott to cover. Yes. Thank you, everyone, for joining us, and I again want to thank the Vistra team, which includes our new members in Ohio and Pennsylvania. And we are very excited about our platform and our unique growth opportunities. The S&P 500 inclusion is a great milestone and our future looks bright. We appreciate your interest and investment in Vistra, and we look forward to visiting soon. Have a great day. Thank you."
