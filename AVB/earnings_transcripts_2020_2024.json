At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the Company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. \nJason Reilley: Thank you Eli and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the Company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks. Tim?\nTimothy Naughton: Thanks Jason and welcome to our Q4 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, Matt Birenbaum and for the first time Ben Schall. Sean, Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. Before turning to our prepared remarks I would like to take a minute to introduce Ben who many of you have met either during his previous job or since the announcement in early December. Most recently Ben served as the CEO and President of Seritage Growth Properties where he led the company from its inception and oversaw the transformation of the company from a portfolio of  stores into a mix of shopping, dining, entertainment mix these destinations. Prior to Seritage Ben was COO of Rouse Properties and owner of regional shopping malls and before that he was SVP with Vornado Realty Trust. Ben brings a deep background developing, operating, activating real estate in addition to broad experience in many markets in which we do business. This is only Ben's second week on the job. So he will likely a limited role on the call today, but I thought I'd given the floor for a couple of minutes to share a few comments. Ben?\nBen Schall: Thank you Tim. It's terrific to be here and I'm truly honored by the opportunity to join this team and organization. Avalon Bay is one of the rare private group of companies in my mind, led by Tim and the senior team that has been able to successfully shape, build and grow an enterprise of this quality and scale and do so with a core culture with a focus on integrity, caring and continuous improvement that remain a real differentiator for the organization.\nTimothy Naughton: Great. Thanks Ben and great to have you and welcome again. Our prepared comments today will focus on providing a summary of Q4 results and some perspective on 2021, and how it impacts our plans for this year. Before I getting started on the slides maybe just offer a few introductory comments on the quarter and the year. The fourth quarter was a tough end to what was already a very challenging year for the company and the business. The normal effects of an economic downturn on the apartment sector were magnified by work from home mandates, civil unrest in our city centers and the growing strength of the sale market.\nSean Breslin: All right. Thanks Tim. Moving to slide 7, you could see the impact of the pandemic on physical occupancy and the absolute effective rent we achieved over the past year broken out between urban and suburban submarkets. Chart 1 reflects our suburban submarkets which makes up about two thirds of our portfolio. We experienced some deterioration in both occupancy and rate during the spring and summer of 2020, but have recovered most of the occupancy over the past four months and as of January, effective rental rates were up about 1% sequentially from December and a roughly 4% below where we restarted 2020. The primary driver of the weakness in our suburban portfolio has been the performance of assets located in job centered hubs where employers have adopted extended work from home policies and transit oriented developments with use of mass transit has declined materially during the pandemic. Some examples include assembly row in Boston, Tysons corner in Northern Virginia, Mount View and Cupertino in Northern California and Redmond in Washington State.\nKevin O'Shea: Thanks Sean. Turning to slide 9 we highlight our financial outlook for 2021. Although we prefer to provide our traditional full year outlook the uncertain resolution of the pandemic and the related regulatory orders including evictions moratorium across our footprint has reduced our visibility on a performance later this year. Consequently, for 2021, we are providing operating earnings outlook for the first quarter only and we are providing guidance for development, capital activity and other select items for the full year. Nevertheless, to assist investors in driving their own perspective on our outlook for the year we have enhanced our disclosure and expected performance in the first quarter 2021. Specifically we identified actual residential revenue performance in January, 2021, for our same-store communities which reflected a year-over-year decrease of 7.8% and a sequential decrease of 40 basis points from December 2020.\nTimothy Naughton: Thanks Kevin. Turning to slide 15, I thought I might provide some longer-term perspective on this downturn in our business. This slide shows an index for same-store based rental revenue since 1999 or over the 22 years and plus or minus since the Avalon and Bay merger. A couple of things worth mentioning here, first you can see the long-term trend is positive and reflects a healthy business. Over the last three cycles annual compounded same-store revenue growth has been roughly 3%. Rents have grown a little faster than that during the expansionary phase of the cycle generally contract for one to two years during a downturn as they're doing now and then re-accelerate during the recovery phase at the start of the next cycle. Housing has been a consistent performer over many cycles as demand has  generally grow in tandem over the cycle with net completions roughly matching the pace of household formation most years except during recessions with a number of households temporarily contracts. During the downturns it can be difficult to project operating performances. No two downturns and recoveries look exactly alike. Just to demonstrate that the downturn in the early 2000s was reasonably deep for the apartment sector. In fact, it took almost 5 years for rents to recover back to their prior peak across our footprint. And  rents didn't fully recover for 15 years. The downturn in the late 2000's was comparatively steeper as the economy and labor market was significantly impacted by the financial crisis and while it was steeper it was also shallower for the apartment sector as rental demand benefited from the correction in the for-sale housing sector. The current downturn brought on by the pandemic has been the steepest yet for the economy after the apartment sector and while we are perhaps seeing the early signs of stabilization it is difficult to predict the timing and strength of the recovery given the myriad of uncertainties that directly impact our business whether the economic, regulatory or health-related. Importantly though, we are confident that the apartment housing markets will recover, that we will return to sustain growth in rents and revenues over the next cycle just as we seen of the last several cycles in a multifamily it\u2019ll be a good business for the long-term. Turning now to the last slide and summary, operating performance continue to decline in Q4 during the quarter and the early part of Q1 we began to see early signs of stabilization and some important operating trends. We saw healthy gains on sequential with urban submarkets recovery about half the occupancy we lost earlier in the year. Rent growth began to level off after declining for most of the last three quarters and some regions even began to see modest sequential improvement. Transaction market has recovered and strengthened significantly in recent months with suburban assets generally now selling at or above pre-COVID values. As Kevin mentioned our balance sheet liquidity remained in great shape and well-positioned to support new growth opportunities. In fact, given recent operating trends and improved capital transaction market conditions, we decided to activate the development pipeline starting three new developments this past quarter after having been cautious for most of 2020. Our start to 2021 will be focusing submarkets that have been less impacted by the downturn where the economic still offer reasonable risk-adjusted return. And with that Eli, we are happy to open up the call for some Q&A.\nOperator: Of course. Thank you.  And we will go ahead and take our first question from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, it's  here for Nick. I wanted to ask you sort of on development underwriting and ultimately bring that into the conversations because it's a little bit about mixed-use about you're now underwriting these projects, how are you thinking about those ancillary service locations that are going to be part of the community whether they be retail or even office and historically Avalon has partnered with others to do those. I think about the deal you bought in Virginia where Regency took the retail I think about assembly where federal obviously brought you to do the Reggie how do you think it's going to revolve? Can those pieces stay capitalized separately or will it require someone to come in and take a loss on retail or loss on office to support the multifamily rental effectively you have to get higher returns on multifamily to make the math work.\nTimothy Naughton: Yes, Michael I think we talked a bit about this in the past and obviously it's probably more interested just given the events of last few quarters, yes we talked about mixed-use. We pursued in a number ways often times partnering as you suggest whether it's with federal or Regency or  a number of projects where it's more of a condo structure. We may be building out the core and shell and ultimately turning back at retail to them and that's been sort of the MO in cases where it's been a pretty significant pieces of a retail. We felt like it was, we are able to reasonably sort of separate the execution and helps with the management of the two pieces. We are also feeling fair bit of mix-use that I sort of think horizontal more kind of  if you will where we may be assembling maybe semi site a good example of this where you would be there may be a separate adjacent used back there would be as part of the community but it was on the free sample not a condo structure but a free sample by a different retail developer that also had a for-sale housing component. It also had a restricted and age restricted component as well. So particularly the suburban locations we will look to do that. I would say it's kind of some of the infill locations will probably contain a partner with the some of the top retailers in the country then the third category, which I think is where your question was headed was when the users are so  sort of linking where it's probably in the interest of the asset that it be controlled by a single entity where that entity is a partnership or whether we control the entity a 100%. I think probably our preferred solution that case is where we are again partnering with somebody's expert area of retail and underwrite help operate that but our partners venture with us and so we be looking at the economics of the entire venture together and trying to optimize them in terms of trade off, so we inevitably make between the ground plane which is because of the retail and the residential complex. So I think if you sort of fast forward over the next 5 to 10 years I think you'll see more of the third category emerging and companies like us will be partnering with agencies federals and agencies of the worlds like that to make that happen.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then just in terms of the rent recovery, I know you pointed out that extraordinarily the timing and strength of recovered quickly in the submarkets is difficult to project. You made a comment about the early 2000 and San Jose didn't recover from rent perspective to prior peak for 15 years. I guess when you think about New York in terms of this which you still have a fair amount of exposure to get I guess what are you trying underwrite? So I would assume having a view would dictate your capital allocation decisions about rotating capital out of these markets or trying to go deeper overall if you have a 16 year timeframe that can make it a lot more difficult. So where is your mindset today about when you take the rent recovery and had fundamentals in New York and San Fransisco return?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Thanks. I didn't use the San Jose example to suggest that's what you think is going to happen to New York City and down town San Francisco. Obviously, San Jose case was extreme because there has been a big spike during the tech run-up in the late 90s, and in 2000. So a lot of that period of gain was just before sort of the tech crash but I think your point is, I think part of the point is that some of these can be long cycles. We still believe New York and San Francisco we believe in our costal market as an investment at the  I would think they are going to be centers of innovation, homes and great research universities, extend over indexing in our view in terms of the knowledge economy we\u2019re hiring in terms and productivity and intensity of knowledge that's contained in markets it's critically valuable particularly start ups and companies getting up the ground. Now those companies continue to grow and mature they are going to distribute the workforces as we have seen over the last year to satellite, some satellite markets and other markets and with the additional work from home hybrid positions maybe perhaps all over the math. So I think it's too early to underwrite sort of what relationship between demand and supply is going to look like over the next 5 years. We don't see those markets in long term decline to be clear. When you think customer the power core in this country it's still Washington the boss on the East coast and LA to San Francisco on the West Coast and those are long cycles too. Those aren't themselves over 5 or 10 years. So inevitably we are looking to allocate capital to your some of the other markets that I think some within a beneficiaries by may be some spillover effect from New York and San Francisco to DC Seattle or Boston as well as recent expansion markets Denver and southeast Florida. But there is probably other expansion markets in our future as well that they are likely that has some of the same characteristics research university, attractive knowledge workers as particularly some of these larger mature companies disperse their workforces across a wider geography.\nUnidentified Analyst:  New York, and Texas  that will be other sort of sales to do it or just rating capital to expand. \nTimothy Naughton: Yes. I think don't think we are at a point where we think it probably makes sense to pursue sales just given the performances of markets right now. I think we, I think all of us we are going to feel a lot better when we see how much they bounce back, I am not saying they are going to bounce 100% back from where they were a year or even two years ago. But until it is little bit more visibility there I just don't think, I think the bit ask is just going to be too wide on assets in those market. And Sean that -- in urban markets we are seeing rents down 18% down more than that in Northern California and New York South of the city side. So I think it's it\u2019s safe to say that some work probably the next growth is going to be for the portfolio just like if your Google or Facebook  your net growth is going to in Mountain View and Park. So that doesn't mean you abandon those regions. So there is going to be core to, they are going to be continue to be core of our portfolio but it's probably where the growth is going to come from as it relates to from capital allocation standpoint.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks Tim.\nOperator: And we will go ahead and take our next question from Richard Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRichard Hill: Hey, good afternoon guys, and Ben it's nice to hear from you on AVB earnings call. Look forward to working with you. Hey guys I wanted to spend a little bit more time thinking about the bridge from 1Q versus 4Q. I recognize that the sales in 4Q probably had a $0.04 to $0.05 hit and I appreciate the additional disclosure on capitalized interest which is another $0.01 to $0.02 but it still seems like the guide is at mid point to the little bit lower than what maybe we were expecting. So as you think about that given the green shoots is it something to do with the mix of apartments coming online or how should we think about that difference which given the green shoots I would've expected maybe the guide to be called $0.05 to $0.07 higher. Maybe I am just trying to understand like how you get there and if you can break that down a little bit more for us?\nKevin O'Shea: Rich this is Kevin. Maybe I will sort of take a site of that I try to walk people through that in my opening remarks. So I don't know that I have a whole lot of details. So let me begin by maybe repeating that and then if you have further questions around that we can try to dive a little bit deeper. So just as a reference point we anticipate core FFO per share to midpoint declining from $2.02 in Q4 to the $1.90 in Q1 in terms of this $0.12 sequential decline relative to our budget what we have is an $0.08 sequential decline in residential same-store NOI, $0.04 sequential decline related to dispositions that were completed in the fourth quarter. You need to bear in mind, we did sale about $450 million of assets in the fourth quarter that were present for much of the fourth quarter and are no longer present in the first quarter. So that's the $0.04 sequential decline from that line item. $0.04 sequential decline as well from increased overhead in strategic initiatives and those total call it $0.16 or so and they are partially offset by sequential increase in other community classifications primarily which include increasing lease of NOI from development and a commercial NOI which is expected to recover sequentially because that was burden in Q4 by the way straight line rent receivables. So that was kind of a backdrop for it. Again it's hard for me to reconcile against your expectations would seem to have been about $0.05 higher but that's the backdrop. I would be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's very helpful. That's very helpful and I follow all of that. What I was trying to understand a little bit more was the $0.08 headwind the same store NOI because it seems like the quarter is going to be maybe a little bit more challenging than 4Q despite some of the green shoots that have emerged and maybe I'm just asking a naive question but I wanted to maybe understand why same store NOI is a headwind versus 4Q despite what looks like to be improving occupancy and improving effective blended rents.\nSean Breslin: Yes Rich. This is Sean. I am going to provide some high level commentary on that that I think may help and then if you're looking for additional detail we can certainly take it offline but one thing to keep in mind here is that what we're talking about sort of green shoots in terms of leveling off of rents and such we do have sort of the cumulative effect of both lease rent reductions as well as the amortization of concessions that will bleed through the P&L as we move through 2021. So in other words the expectation would be as you look forward over the next couple of months the impact from the amortization of concessions and the cumulative effect of those lease rates will be higher than it has been in Q4. So that's something that I'm not sure people always think about but one sort of broad way to look at it as an example is we granted about $47 million in cash concessions in 2020. We only amortized about $16 million of those. So there is still another $31 million of concessions that will amortize through 2021. So that will continue as Tim mentioned his talking points to impact the growth rates as we move forward over the next several months. So that provides some additional color on the headwind.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. That's very helpful guys and I think the simple explanation and sorry for complicated it is there is just an earned benefit that still has to burn off over time which makes it little bit more of a of a tougher comp but that's very helpful. Hey, one more just clarification question and I'll get back in the queue but that $0.04 of strategic initiative that you mentioned is that one time or is that reoccurring as we think about modeling?\nSean Breslin: It's recurring. It's part of our full year guidance for overhead costs which includes a significant component which is investment in building out our digital capabilities and other strategic initiatives and so it's the capability that we've been adding and continue to add to our business and is therefore occurring throughout the course of the year. So it's something that you can kind of think about as continuing on.\nTimothy Naughton: Yes Rich just add on to that one as well, we may talk about it in more detail in the coming quarter or two but it ties into some of the information that we provided back in sort of late \u201819 in terms of our investment in digital capabilities, AI, Machine Learning things of that sort that if anything has only accelerated as we've moved through the pandemic, if you think about what's been happening with virtual tours and self-guided tours and smart access and things of that sort I think if you talk to not only us but our peers and others there's even probably more conviction in making those investments and the ROI associated with them that we would expect to continue to invest in those capabilities over the next couple of years for sure and then see those payoffs come through.\nMatt Birenbaum: Hey Rick just to add to that as we are making those investments in innovation there's a bit of a geography issue. You get it may be hitting the overhead line but the benefit oftentimes flowing through to the assets and so when we they're able to save some payroll things like that it may not be obvious because the payroll expense is a big number the property  is a big number maybe compared to what the strategic initiative number is.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Guys thank you very much. I know this was sort of wonky modeling questions but I really appreciate you spending the time to detail it out a little bit more. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And we'll now move to our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nRich Hightower: Hey good afternoon guys and again welcome to Ben on these calls. So my first question I kind of want to hone in again on San Grancisco and New York and the big sequential occupancy gains in the fourth quarter. Obviously a lot of that must have been driven by pricing in the market as opposed to anything related to return to office or sort of the normal seasonal leasing pattern that we might consider but in pattern that we might consider but as you think about the page and the drivers of the demand going forward as we go through 2021, what do you think the key drivers are that we should be expecting and how does that overlay which is what is normally decreasing starting in the spring and how do we fold in return to office and how do you guys think about the moving parts giving the business is going to be a strange year in all respects?\nSean Breslin: I think the first shot at that and  negative, but I think the factors that we would like to monitor our first what you mentioned in terms of  basically reopening their offices and clung people back to work and mix-use environment. That is obviously a key driver here. As I mentioned earlier we are quite not expecting 100% to return but certainly a very high percentage are very likely to return. The second component is what I mentioned in my prepared remarks is for the reopening of these major urban universities that really do grow in knowledge but the international too but do occupy apartments in some of these major urban centers and it's not just the student by the  staff, faculty, etc. etc. So we think of New York and San Francisco and markets like that that's pretty significant phenomena and then ultimately what's going to follow that is more business activity where there was corporate demand things of that sort for such that you can make 1% to 2% of the market. So the combination of those factors will really sort of drive demand what we will likely see is people lease apartment a little before they need to be here on campus or back at work or going to some consulting assignment etc. And so the timing which that is something I think we probably all be I think our view at this point based on what's happening with the pandemic and vaccination etc. is that it's probably sometime may be in the summer when you might see that happen depending on how the vaccination of the population occurs over the next few months here. So we could see employers want people back in the summer maybe fall when people are returning to school and stuff. So I think those are the key questions the timing of which is just be determined for to have a material impact on 2021 results however, given the lease expiration that we have from quarter to quarter you really would need to see that happen probably in the late spring to early summer to have any kind of meaningful impact on 2021 compared to what occurs in the fall where we only have maybe 20% to 30% of release expirations remaining you would see the list in 2022. \nRich Hightower: Okay, that's helpful color Sean. I guess my second question here you're obviously ramping up development starts this year. What's the chance that you guys even go bigger than the 650 to 850 guidance if you think we're really on the cusp of the next multi-year recovery in multifamily?\nTimothy Naughton: Well, it's a good question. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks at just some of the function of what we've seen in the market is closed the real estate markets as well as the capital market at this point we're basically funding that development with plan dispositions. Just given where our leverage is right now and trying to sort of protect our credit metrics where it stand. So and I think as we said in the past it's hard to with gain ratios of around 50% it's hard to sell too much if we want to double down we'd end up having to distribution and then it's just not capital. It's not as capital efficient. So I think what would have to happen is, the equity markets. I mean we had a good start today, I guess but the equity markets would need to recover more to level which we think sort of more reflective of intrinsic value and NAV where we might have some, we might have access to those markets as well to really expand the balance sheet in order to accommodate more development. Having said that not all deals we think are sort of ready to go. As I mentioned in my remarks for the most part we're focused on in markets that haven't been as impacted from the run rate standpoint. So that the yields are still at least the current basis so often we think sort of an appropriate risk-adjusted return. That's not true of the entire development of pipeline and how these deals work. You just don't go out and pick up some land options and start the next quarter. These things take even deals that are entitled can take a year or two years to sort of fully gestate before they're ready to start. So the number's probably not going to it's probably just can't flex up too much even if market conditions were great but it's, I suspect it's going to be in this range unless market conditions move dramatically one way or the other.\nRich Hightower: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski from Green Street. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks, Matt could you give us a sense for the two Northern California distributions? How do you think values ultimate allowed to where you what you could have gotten on the sales pre-COVID and any cap rate color for those two deals?\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure John. We sold the two deals in northern town the fourth quarter eastern  was our only asset in Marin county. That's a pretty unique asset in a very supply constrained part of the world with very little existing stock almost no new construction. So I would say that one I don't think that the value there was really impacted much at all. We think the cap rate was a high threes maybe around a 39. So I'm not sure maybe it's down slightly from where it would have been a year ago but that's just such a special asset that it's a bit of a one-off story. The other asset I think we sold at the end of the year was Eaves Diamond Heights that's an older rent-controlled asset in the city of San Francisco and we were a little bit motivated there to close by year-end because the city through about initiative increased their transfer tax to the highest in the country at 6%. So there was definitely some dollar savings by closing before year end. That deal was about a 37 cap as 470,000 units. I would say a year ago that asset probably would have sold for 8% to 10% more, although it's hard to know maybe not as impacted in terms of the NOI as some of the other assets just because it was a rent-controlled asset and so some of the rents were below market but also may be less lift for the buyer on the way out because there will be more constraints on ability to raise rent. So probably a little lower data maybe than some other assets in San Francisco.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then second question for Sean sticking with Northern California just curious your thoughts particularly in San Francisco, San Jose when a lot of your private competitors occupancy is well below your own level and it feels like the entire market's one to three months free and so the short question is are you going to be able to sustain the occupancy and sustain stable rents as your private competitors play catch up or do you feel like the floor is underneath or is it going to be a choppy few quarters here?\nSean Breslin: Yes John that's a good question and I think if you look at basically how the quarter unfolded and not just in Northern California but across some of the more impacted markets whether it's ones you referenced or a New York City or Redmond Washington state as an example is we've certainly seen rents decline as we've built occupancy and now they've sort of leveled off and the question kind of rolling forward is or do they just sort of bounce along the bottom here as we basically try to kind of hold occupancy where it is, we feel like for the most part across the portfolio we're pretty close to where we think market occupancies are and so rents should get better. The question is how much as the rest of the market sort of does what it does as you pointed out I think there's some of the other fears are going to be higher in occupancy some are lower trying to catch up but I think just given what we've seen the belief is that we probably just for the next couple quarters are going to kind of be bouncing around a little bit. I wouldn't say that we're expecting a sharp uptick, I wouldn't say that but should we expect some marginal improvement I think that's reasonable to assume given where the rents were to get the occupancy that we needed. Now we're trying to sort of stabilize a little bit so we should be able to compete without as much inventory available and therefore the rents won't need to be as soft I guess is the way I described that. Every pocket's a little bit different that was the way. I think you need to look at it in terms of what's happening. Is there new supplies or not new supply things like that do impact these sub-markets in potentially a meaningful way depending on what's going on there.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nJohn Kim: Thank you. Comparing the downturn versus the prior recessions on page 14, it's very helpful, I guess one of the big similarities between now and early 2000s is the home ownership rates and the strength of the housing market and I'm wondering if you think this is a factor that's most important in terms of the pace recovery this time around or have landlords including yourselves aggressively cut the rent so that the recovery time could be quicker.\nTimothy Naughton: Hey John it's Tim. It's a good question. I'm definitely seeing the sell market strength. I think part of that is like the early 2000s is demography. As you start to see the kind of 30 to 34 year olds are the leading edge of the millennials come forward and start to purchase. I do think what's happening is you are seeing again just an acceleration of the folks that may have bought a year from now or two years from now three from now accelerate at first decisions because of what quality of life in the urban markets has been like over the last year. So yes we'll have to see when you look at it it's been our view, I think we've talked about this over the last two or three years that housing demand which we rent or sale is going to be more balanced over the next decade that we've seen over the last two decades. The last decade was kind of the renter decade. The decade before that was kind of the homeowner decade. There was some artificial factors driving in particularly in 2000s as you know those going on with terms of just for the home mortgage crisis. But yes , I just think just given kind of the mortgage finance system we have in place now think it's going to be driven more by fundamental factors and speculative factors and for a long time home ownership rates were just sad and it's like just 64% - 65% and they were kind level on a  level and if you look at what's happening in terms of the growth and we've talked about this in terms of this growth single person or a single parent households that population is still growing. And then multi families is a better use for better housing choice for that group. So I think there's a lot of factors when you sort of put it all together to really does suggest sort of balance housing demand going forward. So today we're producing whatever close to the million around a million single family units and three or four maybe 40,000 the multifamily units that feels about right relative to marginal demand. I think it's been accelerated as we are speaking right now just because of the pandemic but as you look at over two, three, four year period it's a sort of strikes us is about sort of the right mix of supply to address marginal demand.\nJohn Kim: That's very helpful. Thank you. Second question is for Kevin, the impact in your earnings from concession to double this quarter versus last quarter, but can you remind us how the concessions have trended throughout the year last year for the average concessions be granted by each quarter.\nMatt Birenbaum: Well, maybe Sean if you want to speak to the average concession value?\nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean I think what I can probably describe to is if you look at the leases that we signed kind of what the pace has been in terms of concession. So Q3, the average concession per lease signed was 1100 bucks. When you look at Q4, the average was 1315 but it did take down as we move through the quarter. So as an example October was 1450 a lease. November was 1400 December was 1190 and then they were down just under 1000 a lease in January. So the trend has been our balance in terms of the impact of concessions. In terms of the accounting event just one comment to reiterate what I mentioned earlier and Kevin is going to address it more clearly as well is we granted $47 million in cash concessions in 2020 but we did only amortize $16 million of them in 2020. So it's still $31 million in the deferred concessions in the book that will be amortized through 2021 and then in addition to that whatever concessions cash concessions we grant in 2021 will also prevents amortization. So hopefully that gives you some sense of sort of the headwind as we move in 2021 from the concessions that were granted that deferred 2020. I hope that answers your specific question. If you have a follow-up.\nKevin O'Shea: I can add a couple of things John. Kevin again. So just to give a sense to frame it if you kind of look at our earnings releases to start the discussion here for  Sean mentioned on page 31 of our earnings release for the full year 2020 we granted $46.6 million of concessions. That's just the granted number. If you kind of go back in Q4 we granted about $19.5 million, Q3 granted about $15.3 million. So the difference pretty much is really what we will did in Q2. So that's going to be call it $12 million or so granted in Q2. And again what we amortized --\nJohn Kim: Is it fair to assume that quarter that year-over-year comps that will be withholding the concession going on?\nTimothy Naughton: It is a function of what concessions we grant in 2021 all of being equal if you just sort of stop today and you stop the concessions going to zero effective February 1, as an example what's on the books today the  concession burn off amortization would be sort of in the April/May timeframe. We're still granting concessions maybe at a lower rate, but we're still granting concessions now. So it's very likely that the peak burn off for the amortization will drift into the summer some time depending on the volume of concessions that we grant and the amount of each concession over the next few months.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks guys. Just wanted to touch on sort of the occupancy rebound again and economic occupancy is now approaching kind of mid 95% range. I think you were 96% plus pre-pandemic. But anyhow, how do you change your view towards, continuing to build occupancy given I guess your view that it could be until Summer time until you start to see surge in demand as people firm up the back office dates and then into the fall for the student population? How does that kind of balance that continuing to grind down I guess on the concessions versus trying to build occupancy to give yourself, maybe some cushion as you get into the spring leasing season and the expiration start to increase?\nSean Breslin: Austin this is Sean. Good question. Kind of from strategy point over the 2-3 months as I mentioned in response to the couple of questions ago we think as we look across sub-urban market and urban market that we are in the range of consider market occupancy based on multiple data points that are available out there. We produce  various other sort of like that and so we have got the ability triangulate into where we think market occupancy is that we are comfortable sort of operating around market occupancy to slightly above the 100 to 200 basis point. Anything beyond that and you're probably give it up too much rate to hold that higher occupancy. So while occupancy may drift up a little bit over the next couple of months here it wouldn't expected to spike materially somewhat of what we have seen in last four months. So for us it will be more about maintaining marginal improvements and physical occupancy and really trying to make sure we find where we can hope those rent and see sequential improvement in effective rents at that occupancy. That\u2019s going forward for us in the sense that there is a pivot where we head in terms of macro environment that will certainly influence our strategy but that is the strategy as we see it today.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. Thank you and then you referenced the 18% decline in rents. I think it was in reference to urban markets, but as we think about that recovery last quarter you did mention you've kind of gone further down in the renter pool from a credit perspective. Can you give us any type of metric to give us a sense of how that change in rental profile how significant it has been or maybe an affordability ratio comparison versus the years leading up to the pandemic?\nSean Breslin: Yes. No. Also good question. And one thing to be clear about is if any kind of our credit standards have become more stringent during the pandemic given the various regulatory orders that are out there particularly the eviction moratoria where we have deep reach down further in the rental pool is more from an income perspective and obviously rents are down. So people can qualify for apartments that maybe they couldn't qualify for last year when you go to New York City or San Francisco and the rents are down 25% but in terms of maybe where you might be going with this is their ability to pay in the future as a few rebounds and are trying to push through rent increases and while income levels are down, rents are down more than that. So actual rent income ratios have come in a little bit last few quarters which just tells us that there is more ability to absorb rent increases on the other side of the pandemic. We see a rebound and one thing to remember as it relates to concessions is well we have to amortize concession for GAAP purposes we don't amortize the concessions for the individual residents. So they may receive a month free as an example upfront but the next month they are striking a check for the full amount of the lease rent. So any renewal that we provide to them at some point in time that at least expires will typically be based off the lease rent as opposed to the base rent. So people are where they can afford what they're writing a check for as opposed to the effectiveness rent.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Right and what's the decrease in the gross or face rent if you will versus that 18%? \nSean Breslin: Yes. So if you look at it on a rent change basis as opposed to the blended values that we were talking about basically we had effective rounds that were down 112 but if you look at release rents they were down about 7%.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes. I saw that for the quarter. More curious I guess over the course of how that 18% number would compare and is income still down less than that face rent number when you remove the concession as you referenced?\nSean Breslin: That's correct yes. Yes. Incomes are down less than the reduction of rental rates.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Alua Askarbek from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAlua Askarbek: Hi everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. I know we're going a little too long. So I'll be quick but I wanted to ask a little bit more on the demand side that you've been seeing just to get a clear idea are you still seeing a lot of those bargain hardcores coming in within markets looking for the deals in your urban markets or are you starting to feel a little bit more demand coming in outside of those markets?\nSean Breslin: Yes. No. It's a good question in terms of the bargain hunters. I guess in the current environment sort of everybody's looking for a deal but as I mentioned in response to the last question and people are well qualified with good incomes that are coming in. So it's I would say that we're now looking for people that really can't afford what we're doing and so they're really trying to drive for a deep discount to make comfort for them. In terms of the question about net new demand coming in from sort of other geographies that's a good question. I don't have that right off the top of my head but I would say for the most part what we're seeing is that given the entire market in many cases has improved in occupancy that there is net new demand coming into these markets as opposed to just a recirculating of the existing demand that's already in place that would allow that to happen. So I don't have specific detail for you in terms of how much of a demand in New York City and San Francisco market occupancy to come up there has to be net new demand.\nAlua Askarbek: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then just a quick question on Boston or New England overall. It looks like the effect the rent really dropped off in 4Q. Is there anything behind that other than maybe the supply that you guys have been talking about?\nSean Breslin: No I mean it's the same phenomena, I mean the urban markets in Boston are still very challenged. It's quite choppy not quite as bad as New York City or San Francisco but the urban markets are driving most of it and there and there are some sort of infill pockets, I mentioned your assembly row asset Newton Chestnut Hill pockets like that that are sort of the inner ring suburbs are also a little bit weaker. Some of them are more distant suburban towns with good school districts and things like that are performing better.\nAlua Askarbek: Got it. Thank you\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNick Yulico: Hi thanks. I just wanted to go back to the slide in the presentation where you gave the occupancy and lending rents for the suburbs and urban environments. And I guess, I'm just wondering for those two different buckets suburbs versus urban if you had, if you can give us feel for kind of the composition of the blended rent, meaning what percentage that was renewals versus new leases for the different regions?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Nick it's good question. It's a lot of big  because of the blended renewals  changes five months.  talking about offline as suppose to trying to walk you through that because it changes month by month.\nTimothy Naughton: I think to think about. I mean if you want you can just go and look at our turnover rate before we had in the earnings release to get a feel for it though. It shows that year-to-date and last couple of quarters. That will give you some feel for the mix.\nNick Yulico: Right. Okay. That was sort of I was kind of wondering if it was kind of similar to the turnover rate because I guess my question here is if you turnover is your lowest point in the year in the fourth quarter and first quarter we are looking at a blended rent number that is in some cases stabilizing or slightly picking up versus higher turnover periods. I guess I am just wondering what we should leading into this because that just means that you are starting less new leases which is where the worst pricing is and so the fact that it's starting to stabilize, but you do more renewals versus new leases and going through the period in the spring where you have a lot of new leases, I guess I am just trying to what we should really be reading into this line of improvement for January and the fourth quarter versus other parts last year.\nSean Breslin: Yes. That's a god question I think to the comment I have made John earlier, it's quite a little too early to tell in terms of calling it a bottom but we are pleased with the fact that during what is typically a sesonally lower period where we had turnover up 15% year-over-year that we have been able to slowly pull back on concessions and see slightly better blended rents sort of that effective basis for now four months basically, three-four months that gives us a sense that we're kind of pricing in the right neighborhood and that was building occupancy. So we don't need to build as much occupancy as we were attempting to do in the last three or four months. Therefore we believe we should be able to do better in terms of absolute effective rents moving forward. To your point though it does what happens in each market as we get to the spring leasing season is yet to be seen. So I think we're kind of bouncing around the bottom now and the question is will we continue to see those sequential improvements now that we're at that occupancy platform that we want to be at that is a function of just through supply and demand in these markets and what happens. So I think it's probably a little too early to call in terms of the specific question that you have whether I should read in this that this is at the bottom and it's going to bounce back I'm not sure we're prepared to say that just yet.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. Thanks guys. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Richard Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead.\nRichard Anderson: Hey thanks good afternoon everyone. So when I think about percentages and talk about percentage you can get sort of misleading if I don't have any jobs were lost in your markets in 2020 but you need kind of 2x growth to get back to where you were in absolute numbers just because you're growing off a smaller base and then the same logic applies to the 18% decline in your urban effective rates you got to do 30 plus off the lower base to get back to where you were in absolute per unit rent and my point is when you look at your slide on page 14 it's taken three to six years for you to just get back to where you were in whether it was the tech bubble or the housing crash. Does this environment which is somewhat more black and white it's sort of virus vaccine it's as bad as it was it's not very complicated, do you think that the recovery back to where you once were in whether you used jobs or rents whatever the metric is will be tighter than that 3% bottom end of the range that you experienced in the history.\nSean Breslin: Rich Sean here. That's obviously one of the things that they hear is to whether this is going to be either a V-shaped or -shaped in terms of recovery and that's ultimately its job, it's what's going to help propel total household formation and the deconsolidation of households that may have consolidated over the last year and while the employment rate is looking pretty good obviously the labor participation rates are pretty low. So it's going to take some really decent economic growth I think to really, I think some yes, suburbans are going to be back a lot quicker, could be a lot quicker than 3 to 5 years as we\u2019ve seen above. I think the question here is really about urban and some of the really tech intensive suburban submarkets like Mountain View or  Park as we're talking about before and that's going to take some economic growth I think. As I think you may see sort of a quick V-shape maybe for the suburban markets and the urban markets, maybe may not be back to those rents for another event three four years.\nRichard Anderson: Yes. So it leads to my second question which is you're not giving full year guidance because you don't have a lot of visibility beyond 90 days, but then you're ramping development. So I just wondered if your confidence in a period of two years from now when you would like to be delivering these assets is higher than it is six months from now and I imagine it is but I am trying to pinpoint where is the development you are turning on sort of specific to those markets in those areas that maybe weren't as impacted by the COVID pandemic.\nSean Breslin: It's a lot of point that you are making. It's so I think suburban rents could be back, back to where they were in a year. They were only down 4%. It doesn't take a lot of growth to get that 4% back in those markets. And so we're focused we're kind of activating that lever and markets where we think as I said in my prepared comments where I think the risk adjusted return is make sense right now.\nRichard Anderson: All right. Thank you.\nSean Breslin: Yes.\nRichard Anderson: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: We will go ahead and take our next question from Anthony Paolone from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Yes, thanks. On the expense side is there anything for 2021 as we look out that could bring just expense growth back down to sort of an inflation number or does the turnover and some of these other dynamics just step function this up for higher growth this year?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. It's good question. I think it's more the latter. I mean a lot of the stuff that we're seeing is sort of related to the pandemic and then promoted whether it's higher turnover cost, extra cleaning cost. Associates are on leave and therefore driving temporary labor contract laborers overtime, things like that. These are kind of going to play their way through and obviously it's a tough comp just given first half of the last year particularly with second quarter  in a number of different areas. The turnover came, down  etc. etc. So I think it's just going to put pressure on both particularly as Kevin mentioned in the first half of this year given that tough comp. It will be a little bit easier when in the second half because expenses held turnover and all that will be more comfortable particular the first half.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay and then just same question for Kevin. $160 million to $170 million of total overhead for 2021, do you have the comparable number for 2020 just understand the increase because I think it's a couple items and a variety of adjustments to get there? \nKevin O'Shea: Sorry you are referring to the kind of core expense overhead number?\nAnthony Paolone: Yes. I think you gave brackets around I guess it combines like SG&A and property management a few things like that.\nKevin O'Shea: Core expense overhead for core FFO is $160 million and $170 million. The reference point for the priory was about $150 million \u2013 $151 million. So it's about $14 million year-over-year increase where most of that is as we alluded before related to investment it's very strategic and related initiatives with strategic initiatives alone were about $7 million of that number probably 5 on the growth basis and there's an ancillary investments as well and there's some additional compensation cost including executive transition costs.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: We will go ahead and take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Sure. Good afternoon and Ben welcome aboard. I'm assuming that you decline the free rent incentives, so you can do your part to help earnings. Two questions here, the first just going to guidance Tim and Kevin you have laid out definitely that you think things are bottoming. You're not sure how things will go but in general you've laid out sort of a base case. So with that in mind why couldn't you provide s full year number even if it's a wide range because it seems like you're sort of tracking in the sort of 750-760 something like there midpoint and just sort of curious what prevents you from providing even if it's just a wide range something because as I say from your first quarter observations it sounds like you feel comfortable with where things are shaking and you have a general sense that if that continues then you sort of would know where you work for full year.\nTimothy Naughton: Yes Alex. It's a fair question. I mentioned in my kind of earlier remarks it's more than just one or two things that kind of a play here. We didn't even get into the issue of eviction moratoria where we've got call it 3% of our units were tied up and people that are paying we have essentially a federal stimulus that we may benefit from and actually help us to actually potentially even reverse some bad debts that we have taken for. Sean, terms of work from home and dates when they expire makes a big difference in terms of only might get initially a good occupancy boost but with that comes other income and other things as well. So when you put them all together you start plant these variables, it gets arranges until we just think it's not that reliable and frankly, it's I think in the past we've actually haven't given quarterly guidance. We have given annual guidance. That's how we manage our business in typical year manage it quarter-to-quarter. The reality is we\u2019re managing it week to week, month to month, quarter to quarter right now and we feel like we got a enough visibility out about 90 days to provide reliable guidance. Beyond that we just don't think it's that reliable. That's just to be pointed out there and to always be trying to reconcile and sync up it just gets us make really adding anything to the conversation. But so others may choose to provide the outlook with a wide range. I get it and I think if you're here have a  portfolio I think it makes total sense that you'd be precise guidance right now but that's not the situation we are in. Kevin I don't know if you have anything.\nKevin O'Shea: I mean just to add to that I think that covers Tim, can we satisfy the test to providing a reasonably reliable midpoint and a reasonably narrow and useful range. As we know anything's possible to but let me kind of play with these variables and look at the back half of the year. There were things that could be very positive or very negative and they are beyond our ability to regionally produced with accuracy. And so given that we just didn't feel like we could meet the tests of providing a reasonably reliable midpoint forecast, which ultimately would be what we, people would focus on where even if we gave a wide range and then we couldn't provide reasonably narrow range around that. So we just felt like why try to give something that range in the business and Q1 guidance seemed more appropriate. \nTimothy Naughton: Yes Alex maybe last thing to add that's why the reason we showed the slide 14 as well kind of put a circle around the downturns and the recovery, that's when it's hard to protect the business. I mean when you're in an expansion, it's fairly let me you feel like we can get some pretty reliable guidance in terms of how portfolio, how the pro forma over the next 12 months.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay and then the second question is as you guys think about ramping up the development program and using more capital how does that balance with the expansion markets and to the extent that you're looking at other markets like Nashville or Austin or some of the other sort of popular market these days? How do you reconcile your balance of capital between investing and development in your current markets versus using that capital to either in your expansion markets or to enter other new markets?\nTimothy Naughton: Well, it's a good question. I think the reality is if we didn't give guidance around acquisitions and dispositions to the extent that acquisitions let's say to the extent we acquired we would just sell more and existing assets and so it's really be done more through portfolio management basically recycling capital out of certain markets and where we've been recycling largely the northeast into markets like Denver, Southeast Florida and potentially some other expansion markets to come but at this point of the cycle where capital is priced that's probably how we would fund it. If equity values recover in any meaningful way where you think it makes sense to expand the balance sheet in a creative and prudent way that'd be sort of the second alternative.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay and then just finally the New York development site which one was that that was written off? \nMatt Birenbaum: Hey Alex, it's Matt. That was the investment that we had in the East 96th street RFP.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay that was the Cuomo De Blasio one got it. Okay. No problem thanks. \nKevin O'Shea: Hey Aex just to just be clear when we write it off it means it's more probable than not it's less probable than not or did I say that right.  but it's more probable.\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. We have to do this from an accounting point of view and tip the other way and it\u2019s been less probable. \nAlexander Goldfarb: We got it. Thanks.\nOperator: And we will go ahead and take our next question from Brent Dilts from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrent Dilts: Hey thanks guys. Just one for me at this point. Could you talk about how the financial struggles of some of the largest U.S. transit agencies who are talking about permanent cuts to service might impact your transit oriented properties? \nSean Breslin: Yes Brent it's Sean. I can fix that with that one and matter, as Tim jump in but it's probably a little too early to tell right now. I would say I mean certainly ridership has fallen dramatically through the pandemic and all the major transit systems and as a result in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that one of the locations within our suburban footprint that has been most impacted is sort of transit oriented developments just because people don't need it as much. Whether that results in permanent cuts versus just the temporary protections and capacities that we've seen has yet to play out and I suspect that there probably wouldn't be decisions made around permanent cuts until we get beyond the pandemic and people see what ridership sort of normalizes that. So I think it's probably too early to call on that at this point but certainly if there are transit-oriented developments that are out there that are the residents are heavily relying upon transit system and capacity is cut dramatically this would be a negative impact on those assets. It's probably just too early to tell what that might be.\nMatt Birenbaum: I'll just have to say that this is Matt on the other side perhaps marginally it makes the transit agencies a little more aggressive with trying to dispose of some of their land and/or go into some joint development. Actually one of the deals we just started this past quarter was Avalon Somerville which is at a NJT Stop in central New Jersey and we are looking at other sites where transit agencies are probably going to feel more pressure to monetize their land positions. \nBrent Dilts: Okay. Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rob Stevenson from Janney. Please go ahead.\nRob Stevenson: Good afternoon guys. What percentage of your 2021 development starts are locked in cost wise at this point? And what are you seeing with respect to construction costs especially lumber given what's going on there and how decent is the labor supply these days?\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure. Hey Rob it's Matt. I can speak to that one as well. If we haven't started a job yet we have not locked in the cost on anything really except for probably the land and a little bit of the entitlement costs. So the starts that we're looking at potentially for next year, I think we own the land on maybe two or three of them and then there is a couple of others where we have, they're under hard contracts. So everything else is subject to the market. The land and the soft cost usually is around a third 25%-30%-35% of the total. Capital cost the hard cost usually around 65% depending on the product type. We had if you asked at the beginning of the pandemic I'd say we had a pretty high degree of conviction that hard costs should come down particularly in some of these markets that had seen a big run-up over the last couple years. I'd say we've less conviction around that today just seeing how the for sell market has recovered so and lumber right now is very very expensive. Unfortunately we're not in the position of really having to buy much lumber as we sit here today because we didn't start anything for three quarters last year but if lumber pricing doesn't adjust back to where we would expect it to some of those starts may be in question and my guess is like a lot of commodities there is a little bit of a self-correcting element to that that we're not the only ones that will probably find ourselves in that position. There are a number of mills that are shut down right now because of COVID concerns. So we do think supply should start to increase again here by springtime but at this point I'd say our sense is more the costs have leveled off and that except for maybe in a few markets where they were really overheated I'd say the expectation at this point is probably move towards more of a flattening than a real nominal decline in hard costs.\nRob Stevenson: Okay and given that I mean where are the yields on the new start the 2021 starts relative to the 58 on the current pipeline?\nMatt Birenbaum: Right there just about the same and when you look at our current development pipeline and you look at the mix of the current development pipeline it is mostly suburban and even the deals that are in lease up there is a couple of them that are behind pro forma but there is a couple that are actually ahead of pro forma as well. So that kind of makes sense when you look at, when you compare that to kind of near-term start.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then last one for me where are you in terms of the mix of condo sales at Loggia is what's left skewed towards higher or lower price points or is what's left fairly consistent with what you've already sold?\nTimothy Naughton: Congratulations Rob. I was right if we were going to get through the call without a question about Park Loggia, so we've closed 73 units. We have another \u201815 where we've accepted offers or under contract so that would bring us to 88 total. The mix we have sold maybe a few more I think we sold three of the four penthouses. So the mix is going to start to skew a little bit more towards low-priced units just because of that but we still have a reasonable mix up and down the building and that's where we're seeing frankly some pretty good traction now is in the more modest price points in the podium of the building. Traffic's actually picked up quite a bit. We've seen 15 to 20 inquiries a week. In January we've been averaging about four new deals a month the last three months whereas on the last call it was more like three per month. So but we do have a inventory that remains is a little bit more affordable on average.\nRob Stevenson: And is stuff being sold, I mean thus far been primary residents or these largely secondary residents and are you expecting any impact if New York City and state passes additional soak the rich type of tax measures?\nTimothy Naughton: I don't know. Again this is not billionaires row. I mean this is by Manhattan standards. This is a pretty compelling value proposition which is I think why we're continuing to see our sales face maintain pretty strongly. It is not, there's a lot of people buying condos for their kids, in many cases maybe their kids who are going to university in New York and that market obviously it's been a lot of distance learning since the pandemic hit but just may well pick up. So I don't have the exact breakdown of primary versus secondary residences but I would say that if there is a lot of  lot of family type transactions.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Haendel St. Juste Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey thank you. Good afternoon. First question is on the bad debt. Remain elevated in 4Q very similar to the third quarter, I guess first of all are you expecting a similar level? Is that what's embedded within your 1Q guidance here? And second I guess when do you think you can see some improvement there and since you brought it up earlier house extension of the eviction moratoriums until March 31 playing a role into your thinking? Thanks. \nKevin O'Shea: Well Haendel, this is Kevin. Maybe I'll answer the first couple here in terms of the first quarter we are expecting a persistent level of bad debt expense to roll into the first quarter. So not meaningfully different from what he saw in the fourth quarter and I don't know Tim if you want to add sorry, Sean if you want to add any more about kind of \u2013\nSean Breslin: Yes. On the eviction moratoria there is sort of various  related about eviction, related to late fees, running fees and things like that. So it's not just the federal level that we have to  and even local in some cases. So one example you may have noticed that California  through June. So and there is Washington state and various other places CBC order as well federal overwrite. There is quite a bit of  I would say in terms of what you can do at state level.  at this point is that we will probably see most of the whole through mid year very likely depending on how things unfold with vaccination of the population and the economy continuing to recover that is sort of how we view at this point but there's no question that it could be extended beyond that where in some cases if things are going well people let expire sooner. So that will influence our ability to big people. We are continuing other efforts as it relates to collections that we will continue but at this point what we basically feel like it's going to happen is that bad debt that we saw the last three quarters of 2020 will likely continue with that face a little bit of a nice present January but it wasn't quite as bad but the expectation is look more like last three quarters of 2020.\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. I mean just to add to that and I mean so you begin to reverse from 250 to 300 basis points of revenue trends that you've seen the last few quarters is something more typical which is more like 50 to 60 basis points of revenue. Obviously we're going to need resolution of the pandemic and restoration of the kind of landlord remedies perspective to those who are not payers and that can be little wide certainly not something you expect to change materially in the first half of the year.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Very helpful. Second I have a follow-up to some earlier questions on development. You noted has been noted that all three of you development starts our Northeast suburban. So I am curious when you are thinking about new starts what can you see a few more starts in the West Coast or non-Northeast markets in a more urban locations. I'd recognize you have a couple West Coast project underway in the pipeline, but you haven't started a new West Coast project since I think it's the second half of 2019. Thanks.\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure. This is Matt. We do have start likely in southeast Florida this year. We have start in Denver that we are planning and we have a pretty large start in Suburban Seattle. We were planning later this year. California is tough. California is where we're probably finding the most challenged economics right now for new starts but we do have starts in the expansion market in Seattle.\nHaendel St. Juste: And with those threads on your expected development deals versus cap rates be fairly similar that call it 50 - 75 basis points spread you referring to earlier.\nMatt Birenbaum: Again, I think the spread is more than that. I mean if you look at we said that the current book is about a 58. I mean those assets today would sell for sub 4 and half probably low 4 so I think the spread is well over 100 basis points. And it's probably just as wide given that how our low cap rates in Seattle, Denver and Florida. \nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We will go ahead and take our last question from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead.\nDennis McGill: Thank you. Just wanted to touch on supply in your views on how it might play out in 2021 especially in urban environments. It seems from our work they're still quite a bit to deliver and maybe some of that slides out but would seemingly limit some of the pricing power once you rebuild occupancy but just wanted to see how you guys are thinking about those competing balances.\nSean Breslin: Yes Dennis, this is Sean. Good question. Happy to comment on that and hear others Ken as well as well but as it relates to output trend we are expecting deliveries in 2021 to come down about 6% to 7% compared to 2020 and represent about 1.8% of stock. All the regions are expected to be down except for the New York, New Jersey region first where the decline in deliveries and sort of New York area is going to be offset by what we're seeing in northern New Jersey particularly Jersey City increases by about 3500 to 4000 units, even though balance kind of New York City is down maybe 2200. So in terms of trade area is an increase there and then we expected to be relatively flat in Northern California. In terms of urban specific yes we did see a little bit of benefit certainly coming in as I mentioned, New York City, urban Boston a very modest increase in the district. So not terribly different. And San Francisco is basically flat. So no material change there and other market I guess it would LA where  is going to be down about 1500 units. So in general the supply picture in the urban environment with exception to San Francisco and DC will be better in 2021 than it was in 2020 with all things being equal it certainly help support a recovery at this point in time.\nTimothy Naughton: Hey Dennis, Tim here.  I think one of the things  I think about with the urban supplies in \u201821 and \u201822 on stuff that's already been started in \u201819 and \u201820, but the likelihood that we are going to see starts in \u201821 and \u201822 and how that may translate into \u201823 and \u201824 performance. I think it's going to be tough for people to get deals financed just against a narrative of the whole kind of work from home, work from anywhere dispersing your workforce the satellite offices as well as kind of downtown and I think you probably little decade you could be in a position where, we could be a position where we're seeing very little supply delivered where demand maybe down a bit but for the fundamentals actually looks better quite a bit better in urban submarkets and even the suburban markets. It's almost a reverse of what we saw this last decade where at the beginning of the decade 2010 everyone thought was going to outperform and they did from a demand standpoint, but supply more than made up for such that performance, actually asset performance increased in our portfolio and  in the suburbs. That story can completely reverse I think in the next three to four years.\nDennis McGill: That's helpful perspective. Thank you. And then on the share repurchase in the quarter can you maybe just talk about how you triangulate it to getting comfortable on the buyback and then how you might be thinking about that now with where the stock is if it hangs out year or higher is it likely use of capital in \u201921?\nKevin O'Shea: Yes. This is Kevin. So there are a number of variables take into account clearly. First of all with our alternative use and development is our alternative use and as you can see that based on our outlook for the year, we do anticipate starting development and that reflection and it puts a few that at least relative to where our peers have training lately development represented more attractive use for our capital then buying back our shares although our shares do quite compelling and it is a tougher call in the most normal circumstances given how we're trading below NAV. As you can tell from when we were buying back shares we were buying back shares around $150 this year which we felt was pretty dark compelling when we ran that math and we are at different point today. So that price matters to us as well when we're looking at the alternatives. The other factors we need to take into account is not only our source of proceeds that also would be impact on our leverages and we did then and we do now still have the financial capacity and the proceeds from dispositions to engage in the major buyback if it were to make sense to do so. But every time you do so we have to think about the impact on our leverage metrics and what we knew then and what is still true today is our EBITDA has been sequentially declining over the quarters and our net debt to EBITDA was 5.4 times in the last quarter targeted is 5.6 times. When we began the pandemic our ratio was about 4.6 times and so the movement up in that ratio is really been driven not by taking on more debt, but rather by decline in EBITDA and as we pace through the balance of this year and see that the lower lease rates and concessions work into our rent roll in our EBITDA we need to be mindful of managing that ratio so that stays as possible within our targeted range. Engaging in a heavy buyback could potentially work against that a little bit but all that said we stand still ready to engage in a buyback if it made sense on a major basis mindful of our credit metrics but at the moment when we triangulate around what's the best use of our capital development still figures today to be our best use of capital.\nDennis McGill: Got it. That makes sense and I know it's been a long call. So thanks for the time and the transparency.\nOperator: And with that that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Timothy Naughton for his brief closing remarks. Tim?\nTimothy Naughton: Thank you Eli and thanks everybody for being on. I know we've been off for a while. Thanks for all you that's that hung in there for an hour and 45 minutes but I look forward to seeing all of you or many of you virtually  over the next two or three months. Enjoy the rest your day. Thank you. \nOperator: And with that that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Jason and welcome to our Q4 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, Matt Birenbaum and for the first time Ben Schall. Sean, Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. Before turning to our prepared remarks I would like to take a minute to introduce Ben who many of you have met either during his previous job or since the announcement in early December. Most recently Ben served as the CEO and President of Seritage Growth Properties where he led the company from its inception and oversaw the transformation of the company from a portfolio of  stores into a mix of shopping, dining, entertainment mix these destinations. Prior to Seritage Ben was COO of Rouse Properties and owner of regional shopping malls and before that he was SVP with Vornado Realty Trust. Ben brings a deep background developing, operating, activating real estate in addition to broad experience in many markets in which we do business. This is only Ben's second week on the job. So he will likely a limited role on the call today, but I thought I'd given the floor for a couple of minutes to share a few comments. Ben? Great. Thanks Ben and great to have you and welcome again. Our prepared comments today will focus on providing a summary of Q4 results and some perspective on 2021, and how it impacts our plans for this year. Before I getting started on the slides maybe just offer a few introductory comments on the quarter and the year. The fourth quarter was a tough end to what was already a very challenging year for the company and the business. The normal effects of an economic downturn on the apartment sector were magnified by work from home mandates, civil unrest in our city centers and the growing strength of the sale market. Thanks Kevin. Turning to slide 15, I thought I might provide some longer-term perspective on this downturn in our business. This slide shows an index for same-store based rental revenue since 1999 or over the 22 years and plus or minus since the Avalon and Bay merger. A couple of things worth mentioning here, first you can see the long-term trend is positive and reflects a healthy business. Over the last three cycles annual compounded same-store revenue growth has been roughly 3%. Rents have grown a little faster than that during the expansionary phase of the cycle generally contract for one to two years during a downturn as they're doing now and then re-accelerate during the recovery phase at the start of the next cycle. Housing has been a consistent performer over many cycles as demand has  generally grow in tandem over the cycle with net completions roughly matching the pace of household formation most years except during recessions with a number of households temporarily contracts. During the downturns it can be difficult to project operating performances. No two downturns and recoveries look exactly alike. Just to demonstrate that the downturn in the early 2000s was reasonably deep for the apartment sector. In fact, it took almost 5 years for rents to recover back to their prior peak across our footprint. And  rents didn't fully recover for 15 years. The downturn in the late 2000's was comparatively steeper as the economy and labor market was significantly impacted by the financial crisis and while it was steeper it was also shallower for the apartment sector as rental demand benefited from the correction in the for-sale housing sector. The current downturn brought on by the pandemic has been the steepest yet for the economy after the apartment sector and while we are perhaps seeing the early signs of stabilization it is difficult to predict the timing and strength of the recovery given the myriad of uncertainties that directly impact our business whether the economic, regulatory or health-related. Importantly though, we are confident that the apartment housing markets will recover, that we will return to sustain growth in rents and revenues over the next cycle just as we seen of the last several cycles in a multifamily it'll be a good business for the long-term. Turning now to the last slide and summary, operating performance continue to decline in Q4 during the quarter and the early part of Q1 we began to see early signs of stabilization and some important operating trends. We saw healthy gains on sequential with urban submarkets recovery about half the occupancy we lost earlier in the year. Rent growth began to level off after declining for most of the last three quarters and some regions even began to see modest sequential improvement. Transaction market has recovered and strengthened significantly in recent months with suburban assets generally now selling at or above pre-COVID values. As Kevin mentioned our balance sheet liquidity remained in great shape and well-positioned to support new growth opportunities. In fact, given recent operating trends and improved capital transaction market conditions, we decided to activate the development pipeline starting three new developments this past quarter after having been cautious for most of 2020. Our start to 2021 will be focusing submarkets that have been less impacted by the downturn where the economic still offer reasonable risk-adjusted return. And with that Eli, we are happy to open up the call for some Q&A. Yes, Michael I think we talked a bit about this in the past and obviously it's probably more interested just given the events of last few quarters, yes we talked about mixed-use. We pursued in a number ways often times partnering as you suggest whether it's with federal or Regency or  a number of projects where it's more of a condo structure. We may be building out the core and shell and ultimately turning back at retail to them and that's been sort of the MO in cases where it's been a pretty significant pieces of a retail. We felt like it was, we are able to reasonably sort of separate the execution and helps with the management of the two pieces. We are also feeling fair bit of mix-use that I sort of think horizontal more kind of  if you will where we may be assembling maybe semi site a good example of this where you would be there may be a separate adjacent used back there would be as part of the community but it was on the free sample not a condo structure but a free sample by a different retail developer that also had a for-sale housing component. It also had a restricted and age restricted component as well. So particularly the suburban locations we will look to do that. I would say it's kind of some of the infill locations will probably contain a partner with the some of the top retailers in the country then the third category, which I think is where your question was headed was when the users are so  sort of linking where it's probably in the interest of the asset that it be controlled by a single entity where that entity is a partnership or whether we control the entity a 100%. I think probably our preferred solution that case is where we are again partnering with somebody's expert area of retail and underwrite help operate that but our partners venture with us and so we be looking at the economics of the entire venture together and trying to optimize them in terms of trade off, so we inevitably make between the ground plane which is because of the retail and the residential complex. So I think if you sort of fast forward over the next 5 to 10 years I think you'll see more of the third category emerging and companies like us will be partnering with agencies federals and agencies of the worlds like that to make that happen. Yes. I think don't think we are at a point where we think it probably makes sense to pursue sales just given the performances of markets right now. I think we, I think all of us we are going to feel a lot better when we see how much they bounce back, I am not saying they are going to bounce 100% back from where they were a year or even two years ago. But until it is little bit more visibility there I just don't think, I think the bit ask is just going to be too wide on assets in those market. And Sean that -- in urban markets we are seeing rents down 18% down more than that in Northern California and New York South of the city side. So I think it's it's safe to say that some work probably the next growth is going to be for the portfolio just like if your Google or Facebook  your net growth is going to in Mountain View and Park. So that doesn't mean you abandon those regions. So there is going to be core to, they are going to be continue to be core of our portfolio but it's probably where the growth is going to come from as it relates to from capital allocation standpoint. Yes Rich just add on to that one as well, we may talk about it in more detail in the coming quarter or two but it ties into some of the information that we provided back in sort of late \u201819 in terms of our investment in digital capabilities, AI, Machine Learning things of that sort that if anything has only accelerated as we've moved through the pandemic, if you think about what's been happening with virtual tours and self-guided tours and smart access and things of that sort I think if you talk to not only us but our peers and others there's even probably more conviction in making those investments and the ROI associated with them that we would expect to continue to invest in those capabilities over the next couple of years for sure and then see those payoffs come through. Well, it's a good question. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks at just some of the function of what we've seen in the market is closed the real estate markets as well as the capital market at this point we're basically funding that development with plan dispositions. Just given where our leverage is right now and trying to sort of protect our credit metrics where it stand. So and I think as we said in the past it's hard to with gain ratios of around 50% it's hard to sell too much if we want to double down we'd end up having to distribution and then it's just not capital. It's not as capital efficient. So I think what would have to happen is, the equity markets. I mean we had a good start today, I guess but the equity markets would need to recover more to level which we think sort of more reflective of intrinsic value and NAV where we might have some, we might have access to those markets as well to really expand the balance sheet in order to accommodate more development. Having said that not all deals we think are sort of ready to go. As I mentioned in my remarks for the most part we're focused on in markets that haven't been as impacted from the run rate standpoint. So that the yields are still at least the current basis so often we think sort of an appropriate risk-adjusted return. That's not true of the entire development of pipeline and how these deals work. You just don't go out and pick up some land options and start the next quarter. These things take even deals that are entitled can take a year or two years to sort of fully gestate before they're ready to start. So the number's probably not going to it's probably just can't flex up too much even if market conditions were great but it's, I suspect it's going to be in this range unless market conditions move dramatically one way or the other. Hey John it's Tim. It's a good question. I'm definitely seeing the sell market strength. I think part of that is like the early 2000s is demography. As you start to see the kind of 30 to 34 year olds are the leading edge of the millennials come forward and start to purchase. I do think what's happening is you are seeing again just an acceleration of the folks that may have bought a year from now or two years from now three from now accelerate at first decisions because of what quality of life in the urban markets has been like over the last year. So yes we'll have to see when you look at it it's been our view, I think we've talked about this over the last two or three years that housing demand which we rent or sale is going to be more balanced over the next decade that we've seen over the last two decades. The last decade was kind of the renter decade. The decade before that was kind of the homeowner decade. There was some artificial factors driving in particularly in 2000s as you know those going on with terms of just for the home mortgage crisis. But yes , I just think just given kind of the mortgage finance system we have in place now think it's going to be driven more by fundamental factors and speculative factors and for a long time home ownership rates were just sad and it's like just 64% - 65% and they were kind level on a  level and if you look at what's happening in terms of the growth and we've talked about this in terms of this growth single person or a single parent households that population is still growing. And then multi families is a better use for better housing choice for that group. So I think there's a lot of factors when you sort of put it all together to really does suggest sort of balance housing demand going forward. So today we're producing whatever close to the million around a million single family units and three or four maybe 40,000 the multifamily units that feels about right relative to marginal demand. I think it's been accelerated as we are speaking right now just because of the pandemic but as you look at over two, three, four year period it's a sort of strikes us is about sort of the right mix of supply to address marginal demand. It is a function of what concessions we grant in 2021 all of being equal if you just sort of stop today and you stop the concessions going to zero effective February 1, as an example what's on the books today the  concession burn off amortization would be sort of in the April/May timeframe. We're still granting concessions maybe at a lower rate, but we're still granting concessions now. So it's very likely that the peak burn off for the amortization will drift into the summer some time depending on the volume of concessions that we grant and the amount of each concession over the next few months. I think to think about. I mean if you want you can just go and look at our turnover rate before we had in the earnings release to get a feel for it though. It shows that year-to-date and last couple of quarters. That will give you some feel for the mix. Yes. It's good question. I think it's more the latter. I mean a lot of the stuff that we're seeing is sort of related to the pandemic and then promoted whether it's higher turnover cost, extra cleaning cost. Associates are on leave and therefore driving temporary labor contract laborers overtime, things like that. These are kind of going to play their way through and obviously it's a tough comp just given first half of the last year particularly with second quarter  in a number of different areas. The turnover came, down  etc. etc. So I think it's just going to put pressure on both particularly as Kevin mentioned in the first half of this year given that tough comp. It will be a little bit easier when in the second half because expenses held turnover and all that will be more comfortable particular the first half. Yes Alex. It's a fair question. I mentioned in my kind of earlier remarks it's more than just one or two things that kind of a play here. We didn't even get into the issue of eviction moratoria where we've got call it 3% of our units were tied up and people that are paying we have essentially a federal stimulus that we may benefit from and actually help us to actually potentially even reverse some bad debts that we have taken for. Sean, terms of work from home and dates when they expire makes a big difference in terms of only might get initially a good occupancy boost but with that comes other income and other things as well. So when you put them all together you start plant these variables, it gets arranges until we just think it's not that reliable and frankly, it's I think in the past we've actually haven't given quarterly guidance. We have given annual guidance. That's how we manage our business in typical year manage it quarter-to-quarter. The reality is we're managing it week to week, month to month, quarter to quarter right now and we feel like we got a enough visibility out about 90 days to provide reliable guidance. Beyond that we just don't think it's that reliable. That's just to be pointed out there and to always be trying to reconcile and sync up it just gets us make really adding anything to the conversation. But so others may choose to provide the outlook with a wide range. I get it and I think if you're here have a  portfolio I think it makes total sense that you'd be precise guidance right now but that's not the situation we are in. Kevin I don't know if you have anything. Yes Alex maybe last thing to add that's why the reason we showed the slide 14 as well kind of put a circle around the downturns and the recovery, that's when it's hard to protect the business. I mean when you're in an expansion, it's fairly let me you feel like we can get some pretty reliable guidance in terms of how portfolio, how the pro forma over the next 12 months. Well, it's a good question. I think the reality is if we didn't give guidance around acquisitions and dispositions to the extent that acquisitions let's say to the extent we acquired we would just sell more and existing assets and so it's really be done more through portfolio management basically recycling capital out of certain markets and where we've been recycling largely the northeast into markets like Denver, Southeast Florida and potentially some other expansion markets to come but at this point of the cycle where capital is priced that's probably how we would fund it. If equity values recover in any meaningful way where you think it makes sense to expand the balance sheet in a creative and prudent way that'd be sort of the second alternative. Yes. We have to do this from an accounting point of view and tip the other way and it's been less probable. Congratulations Rob. I was right if we were going to get through the call without a question about Park Loggia, so we've closed 73 units. We have another \u201815 where we've accepted offers or under contract so that would bring us to 88 total. The mix we have sold maybe a few more I think we sold three of the four penthouses. So the mix is going to start to skew a little bit more towards low-priced units just because of that but we still have a reasonable mix up and down the building and that's where we're seeing frankly some pretty good traction now is in the more modest price points in the podium of the building. Traffic's actually picked up quite a bit. We've seen 15 to 20 inquiries a week. In January we've been averaging about four new deals a month the last three months whereas on the last call it was more like three per month. So but we do have a inventory that remains is a little bit more affordable on average. I don't know. Again this is not billionaires row. I mean this is by Manhattan standards. This is a pretty compelling value proposition which is I think why we're continuing to see our sales face maintain pretty strongly. It is not, there's a lot of people buying condos for their kids, in many cases maybe their kids who are going to university in New York and that market obviously it's been a lot of distance learning since the pandemic hit but just may well pick up. So I don't have the exact breakdown of primary versus secondary residences but I would say that if there is a lot of  lot of family type transactions. Hey Dennis, Tim here.  I think one of the things  I think about with the urban supplies in \u201821 and \u201822 on stuff that's already been started in \u201819 and \u201820, but the likelihood that we are going to see starts in \u201821 and \u201822 and how that may translate into \u201823 and \u201824 performance. I think it's going to be tough for people to get deals financed just against a narrative of the whole kind of work from home, work from anywhere dispersing your workforce the satellite offices as well as kind of downtown and I think you probably little decade you could be in a position where, we could be a position where we're seeing very little supply delivered where demand maybe down a bit but for the fundamentals actually looks better quite a bit better in urban submarkets and even the suburban markets. It's almost a reverse of what we saw this last decade where at the beginning of the decade 2010 everyone thought was going to outperform and they did from a demand standpoint, but supply more than made up for such that performance, actually asset performance increased in our portfolio and  in the suburbs. That story can completely reverse I think in the next three to four years. Thank you Eli and thanks everybody for being on. I know we've been off for a while. Thanks for all you that's that hung in there for an hour and 45 minutes but I look forward to seeing all of you or many of you virtually  over the next two or three months. Enjoy the rest your day. Thank you."

            "name": "Kevin O'Shea",
            "content": "Thanks Sean. Turning to slide 9 we highlight our financial outlook for 2021. Although we prefer to provide our traditional full year outlook the uncertain resolution of the pandemic and the related regulatory orders including evictions moratorium across our footprint has reduced our visibility on a performance later this year. Consequently, for 2021, we are providing operating earnings outlook for the first quarter only and we are providing guidance for development, capital activity and other select items for the full year. Nevertheless, to assist investors in driving their own perspective on our outlook for the year we have enhanced our disclosure and expected performance in the first quarter 2021. Specifically we identified actual residential revenue performance in January, 2021, for our same-store communities which reflected a year-over-year decrease of 7.8% and a sequential decrease of 40 basis points from December 2020. Rich this is Kevin. Maybe I will sort of take a site of that I try to walk people through that in my opening remarks. So I don't know that I have a whole lot of details. So let me begin by maybe repeating that and then if you have further questions around that we can try to dive a little bit deeper. So just as a reference point we anticipate core FFO per share to midpoint declining from $2.02 in Q4 to the $1.90 in Q1 in terms of this $0.12 sequential decline relative to our budget what we have is an $0.08 sequential decline in residential same-store NOI, $0.04 sequential decline related to dispositions that were completed in the fourth quarter. You need to bear in mind, we did sale about $450 million of assets in the fourth quarter that were present for much of the fourth quarter and are no longer present in the first quarter. So that's the $0.04 sequential decline from that line item. $0.04 sequential decline as well from increased overhead in strategic initiatives and those total call it $0.16 or so and they are partially offset by sequential increase in other community classifications primarily which include increasing lease of NOI from development and a commercial NOI which is expected to recover sequentially because that was burden in Q4 by the way straight line rent receivables. So that was kind of a backdrop for it. Again it's hard for me to reconcile against your expectations would seem to have been about $0.05 higher but that's the backdrop. I would be happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have. I can add a couple of things John. Kevin again. So just to give a sense to frame it if you kind of look at our earnings releases to start the discussion here for  Sean mentioned on page 31 of our earnings release for the full year 2020 we granted $46.6 million of concessions. That's just the granted number. If you kind of go back in Q4 we granted about $19.5 million, Q3 granted about $15.3 million. So the difference pretty much is really what we will did in Q2. So that's going to be call it $12 million or so granted in Q2. And again what we amortized -- Sorry you are referring to the kind of core expense overhead number? Core expense overhead for core FFO is $160 million and $170 million. The reference point for the priory was about $150 million \u2013 $151 million. So it's about $14 million year-over-year increase where most of that is as we alluded before related to investment it's very strategic and related initiatives with strategic initiatives alone were about $7 million of that number probably 5 on the growth basis and there's an ancillary investments as well and there's some additional compensation cost including executive transition costs. I mean just to add to that I think that covers Tim, can we satisfy the test to providing a reasonably reliable midpoint and a reasonably narrow and useful range. As we know anything's possible to but let me kind of play with these variables and look at the back half of the year. There were things that could be very positive or very negative and they are beyond our ability to regionally produced with accuracy. And so given that we just didn't feel like we could meet the tests of providing a reasonably reliable midpoint forecast, which ultimately would be what we, people would focus on where even if we gave a wide range and then we couldn't provide reasonably narrow range around that. So we just felt like why try to give something that range in the business and Q1 guidance seemed more appropriate. Hey Aex just to just be clear when we write it off it means it's more probable than not it's less probable than not or did I say that right.  but it's more probable. Well Haendel, this is Kevin. Maybe I'll answer the first couple here in terms of the first quarter we are expecting a persistent level of bad debt expense to roll into the first quarter. So not meaningfully different from what he saw in the fourth quarter and I don't know Tim if you want to add sorry, Sean if you want to add any more about kind of \u2013 Yes. This is Kevin. So there are a number of variables take into account clearly. First of all with our alternative use and development is our alternative use and as you can see that based on our outlook for the year, we do anticipate starting development and that reflection and it puts a few that at least relative to where our peers have training lately development represented more attractive use for our capital then buying back our shares although our shares do quite compelling and it is a tougher call in the most normal circumstances given how we're trading below NAV. As you can tell from when we were buying back shares we were buying back shares around $150 this year which we felt was pretty dark compelling when we ran that math and we are at different point today. So that price matters to us as well when we're looking at the alternatives. The other factors we need to take into account is not only our source of proceeds that also would be impact on our leverages and we did then and we do now still have the financial capacity and the proceeds from dispositions to engage in the major buyback if it were to make sense to do so. But every time you do so we have to think about the impact on our leverage metrics and what we knew then and what is still true today is our EBITDA has been sequentially declining over the quarters and our net debt to EBITDA was 5.4 times in the last quarter targeted is 5.6 times. When we began the pandemic our ratio was about 4.6 times and so the movement up in that ratio is really been driven not by taking on more debt, but rather by decline in EBITDA and as we pace through the balance of this year and see that the lower lease rates and concessions work into our rent roll in our EBITDA we need to be mindful of managing that ratio so that stays as possible within our targeted range. Engaging in a heavy buyback could potentially work against that a little bit but all that said we stand still ready to engage in a buyback if it made sense on a major basis mindful of our credit metrics but at the moment when we triangulate around what's the best use of our capital development still figures today to be our best use of capital."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks. I didn't use the San Jose example to suggest that's what you think is going to happen to New York City and down town San Francisco. Obviously, San Jose case was extreme because there has been a big spike during the tech run-up in the late 90s, and in 2000. So a lot of that period of gain was just before sort of the tech crash but I think your point is, I think part of the point is that some of these can be long cycles. We still believe New York and San Francisco we believe in our costal market as an investment at the  I would think they are going to be centers of innovation, homes and great research universities, extend over indexing in our view in terms of the knowledge economy we're hiring in terms and productivity and intensity of knowledge that's contained in markets it's critically valuable particularly start ups and companies getting up the ground. Now those companies continue to grow and mature they are going to distribute the workforces as we have seen over the last year to satellite, some satellite markets and other markets and with the additional work from home hybrid positions maybe perhaps all over the math. So I think it's too early to underwrite sort of what relationship between demand and supply is going to look like over the next 5 years. We don't see those markets in long term decline to be clear. When you think customer the power core in this country it's still Washington the boss on the East coast and LA to San Francisco on the West Coast and those are long cycles too. Those aren't themselves over 5 or 10 years. So inevitably we are looking to allocate capital to your some of the other markets that I think some within a beneficiaries by may be some spillover effect from New York and San Francisco to DC Seattle or Boston as well as recent expansion markets Denver and southeast Florida. But there is probably other expansion markets in our future as well that they are likely that has some of the same characteristics research university, attractive knowledge workers as particularly some of these larger mature companies disperse their workforces across a wider geography. Hey Rick just to add to that as we are making those investments in innovation there's a bit of a geography issue. You get it may be hitting the overhead line but the benefit oftentimes flowing through to the assets and so when we they're able to save some payroll things like that it may not be obvious because the payroll expense is a big number the property  is a big number maybe compared to what the strategic initiative number is. Sure John. We sold the two deals in northern town the fourth quarter eastern  was our only asset in Marin county. That's a pretty unique asset in a very supply constrained part of the world with very little existing stock almost no new construction. So I would say that one I don't think that the value there was really impacted much at all. We think the cap rate was a high threes maybe around a 39. So I'm not sure maybe it's down slightly from where it would have been a year ago but that's just such a special asset that it's a bit of a one-off story. The other asset I think we sold at the end of the year was Eaves Diamond Heights that's an older rent-controlled asset in the city of San Francisco and we were a little bit motivated there to close by year-end because the city through about initiative increased their transfer tax to the highest in the country at 6%. So there was definitely some dollar savings by closing before year end. That deal was about a 37 cap as 470,000 units. I would say a year ago that asset probably would have sold for 8% to 10% more, although it's hard to know maybe not as impacted in terms of the NOI as some of the other assets just because it was a rent-controlled asset and so some of the rents were below market but also may be less lift for the buyer on the way out because there will be more constraints on ability to raise rent. So probably a little lower data maybe than some other assets in San Francisco. Well, maybe Sean if you want to speak to the average concession value? Yes. Nick it's good question. It's a lot of big  because of the blended renewals  changes five months.  talking about offline as suppose to trying to walk you through that because it changes month by month. Hey Alex, it's Matt. That was the investment that we had in the East 96th street RFP. I'll just have to say that this is Matt on the other side perhaps marginally it makes the transit agencies a little more aggressive with trying to dispose of some of their land and/or go into some joint development. Actually one of the deals we just started this past quarter was Avalon Somerville which is at a NJT Stop in central New Jersey and we are looking at other sites where transit agencies are probably going to feel more pressure to monetize their land positions. Sure. Hey Rob it's Matt. I can speak to that one as well. If we haven't started a job yet we have not locked in the cost on anything really except for probably the land and a little bit of the entitlement costs. So the starts that we're looking at potentially for next year, I think we own the land on maybe two or three of them and then there is a couple of others where we have, they're under hard contracts. So everything else is subject to the market. The land and the soft cost usually is around a third 25%-30%-35% of the total. Capital cost the hard cost usually around 65% depending on the product type. We had if you asked at the beginning of the pandemic I'd say we had a pretty high degree of conviction that hard costs should come down particularly in some of these markets that had seen a big run-up over the last couple years. I'd say we've less conviction around that today just seeing how the for sell market has recovered so and lumber right now is very very expensive. Unfortunately we're not in the position of really having to buy much lumber as we sit here today because we didn't start anything for three quarters last year but if lumber pricing doesn't adjust back to where we would expect it to some of those starts may be in question and my guess is like a lot of commodities there is a little bit of a self-correcting element to that that we're not the only ones that will probably find ourselves in that position. There are a number of mills that are shut down right now because of COVID concerns. So we do think supply should start to increase again here by springtime but at this point I'd say our sense is more the costs have leveled off and that except for maybe in a few markets where they were really overheated I'd say the expectation at this point is probably move towards more of a flattening than a real nominal decline in hard costs. Right there just about the same and when you look at our current development pipeline and you look at the mix of the current development pipeline it is mostly suburban and even the deals that are in lease up there is a couple of them that are behind pro forma but there is a couple that are actually ahead of pro forma as well. So that kind of makes sense when you look at, when you compare that to kind of near-term start. Yes. I mean just to add to that and I mean so you begin to reverse from 250 to 300 basis points of revenue trends that you've seen the last few quarters is something more typical which is more like 50 to 60 basis points of revenue. Obviously we're going to need resolution of the pandemic and restoration of the kind of landlord remedies perspective to those who are not payers and that can be little wide certainly not something you expect to change materially in the first half of the year. Sure. This is Matt. We do have start likely in southeast Florida this year. We have start in Denver that we are planning and we have a pretty large start in Suburban Seattle. We were planning later this year. California is tough. California is where we're probably finding the most challenged economics right now for new starts but we do have starts in the expansion market in Seattle. Again, I think the spread is more than that. I mean if you look at we said that the current book is about a 58. I mean those assets today would sell for sub 4 and half probably low 4 so I think the spread is well over 100 basis points. And it's probably just as wide given that how our low cap rates in Seattle, Denver and Florida."

            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "All right. Thanks Tim. Moving to slide 7, you could see the impact of the pandemic on physical occupancy and the absolute effective rent we achieved over the past year broken out between urban and suburban submarkets. Chart 1 reflects our suburban submarkets which makes up about two thirds of our portfolio. We experienced some deterioration in both occupancy and rate during the spring and summer of 2020, but have recovered most of the occupancy over the past four months and as of January, effective rental rates were up about 1% sequentially from December and a roughly 4% below where we restarted 2020. The primary driver of the weakness in our suburban portfolio has been the performance of assets located in job centered hubs where employers have adopted extended work from home policies and transit oriented developments with use of mass transit has declined materially during the pandemic. Some examples include assembly row in Boston, Tysons corner in Northern Virginia, Mount View and Cupertino in Northern California and Redmond in Washington State. Yes Rich. This is Sean. I am going to provide some high level commentary on that that I think may help and then if you're looking for additional detail we can certainly take it offline but one thing to keep in mind here is that what we're talking about sort of green shoots in terms of leveling off of rents and such we do have sort of the cumulative effect of both lease rent reductions as well as the amortization of concessions that will bleed through the P&L as we move through 2021. So in other words the expectation would be as you look forward over the next couple of months the impact from the amortization of concessions and the cumulative effect of those lease rates will be higher than it has been in Q4. So that's something that I'm not sure people always think about but one sort of broad way to look at it as an example is we granted about $47 million in cash concessions in 2020. We only amortized about $16 million of those. So there is still another $31 million of concessions that will amortize through 2021. So that will continue as Tim mentioned his talking points to impact the growth rates as we move forward over the next several months. So that provides some additional color on the headwind. It's recurring. It's part of our full year guidance for overhead costs which includes a significant component which is investment in building out our digital capabilities and other strategic initiatives and so it's the capability that we've been adding and continue to add to our business and is therefore occurring throughout the course of the year. So it's something that you can kind of think about as continuing on. I think the first shot at that and  negative, but I think the factors that we would like to monitor our first what you mentioned in terms of  basically reopening their offices and clung people back to work and mix-use environment. That is obviously a key driver here. As I mentioned earlier we are quite not expecting 100% to return but certainly a very high percentage are very likely to return. The second component is what I mentioned in my prepared remarks is for the reopening of these major urban universities that really do grow in knowledge but the international too but do occupy apartments in some of these major urban centers and it's not just the student by the  staff, faculty, etc. etc. So we think of New York and San Francisco and markets like that that's pretty significant phenomena and then ultimately what's going to follow that is more business activity where there was corporate demand things of that sort for such that you can make 1% to 2% of the market. So the combination of those factors will really sort of drive demand what we will likely see is people lease apartment a little before they need to be here on campus or back at work or going to some consulting assignment etc. And so the timing which that is something I think we probably all be I think our view at this point based on what's happening with the pandemic and vaccination etc. is that it's probably sometime may be in the summer when you might see that happen depending on how the vaccination of the population occurs over the next few months here. So we could see employers want people back in the summer maybe fall when people are returning to school and stuff. So I think those are the key questions the timing of which is just be determined for to have a material impact on 2021 results however, given the lease expiration that we have from quarter to quarter you really would need to see that happen probably in the late spring to early summer to have any kind of meaningful impact on 2021 compared to what occurs in the fall where we only have maybe 20% to 30% of release expirations remaining you would see the list in 2022. Yes John that's a good question and I think if you look at basically how the quarter unfolded and not just in Northern California but across some of the more impacted markets whether it's ones you referenced or a New York City or Redmond Washington state as an example is we've certainly seen rents decline as we've built occupancy and now they've sort of leveled off and the question kind of rolling forward is or do they just sort of bounce along the bottom here as we basically try to kind of hold occupancy where it is, we feel like for the most part across the portfolio we're pretty close to where we think market occupancies are and so rents should get better. The question is how much as the rest of the market sort of does what it does as you pointed out I think there's some of the other fears are going to be higher in occupancy some are lower trying to catch up but I think just given what we've seen the belief is that we probably just for the next couple quarters are going to kind of be bouncing around a little bit. I wouldn't say that we're expecting a sharp uptick, I wouldn't say that but should we expect some marginal improvement I think that's reasonable to assume given where the rents were to get the occupancy that we needed. Now we're trying to sort of stabilize a little bit so we should be able to compete without as much inventory available and therefore the rents won't need to be as soft I guess is the way I described that. Every pocket's a little bit different that was the way. I think you need to look at it in terms of what's happening. Is there new supplies or not new supply things like that do impact these sub-markets in potentially a meaningful way depending on what's going on there. Yes. I mean I think what I can probably describe to is if you look at the leases that we signed kind of what the pace has been in terms of concession. So Q3, the average concession per lease signed was 1100 bucks. When you look at Q4, the average was 1315 but it did take down as we move through the quarter. So as an example October was 1450 a lease. November was 1400 December was 1190 and then they were down just under 1000 a lease in January. So the trend has been our balance in terms of the impact of concessions. In terms of the accounting event just one comment to reiterate what I mentioned earlier and Kevin is going to address it more clearly as well is we granted $47 million in cash concessions in 2020 but we did only amortize $16 million of them in 2020. So it's still $31 million in the deferred concessions in the book that will be amortized through 2021 and then in addition to that whatever concessions cash concessions we grant in 2021 will also prevents amortization. So hopefully that gives you some sense of sort of the headwind as we move in 2021 from the concessions that were granted that deferred 2020. I hope that answers your specific question. If you have a follow-up. Austin this is Sean. Good question. Kind of from strategy point over the 2-3 months as I mentioned in response to the couple of questions ago we think as we look across sub-urban market and urban market that we are in the range of consider market occupancy based on multiple data points that are available out there. We produce  various other sort of like that and so we have got the ability triangulate into where we think market occupancy is that we are comfortable sort of operating around market occupancy to slightly above the 100 to 200 basis point. Anything beyond that and you're probably give it up too much rate to hold that higher occupancy. So while occupancy may drift up a little bit over the next couple of months here it wouldn't expected to spike materially somewhat of what we have seen in last four months. So for us it will be more about maintaining marginal improvements and physical occupancy and really trying to make sure we find where we can hope those rent and see sequential improvement in effective rents at that occupancy. That's going forward for us in the sense that there is a pivot where we head in terms of macro environment that will certainly influence our strategy but that is the strategy as we see it today. Yes. No. Also good question. And one thing to be clear about is if any kind of our credit standards have become more stringent during the pandemic given the various regulatory orders that are out there particularly the eviction moratoria where we have deep reach down further in the rental pool is more from an income perspective and obviously rents are down. So people can qualify for apartments that maybe they couldn't qualify for last year when you go to New York City or San Francisco and the rents are down 25% but in terms of maybe where you might be going with this is their ability to pay in the future as a few rebounds and are trying to push through rent increases and while income levels are down, rents are down more than that. So actual rent income ratios have come in a little bit last few quarters which just tells us that there is more ability to absorb rent increases on the other side of the pandemic. We see a rebound and one thing to remember as it relates to concessions is well we have to amortize concession for GAAP purposes we don't amortize the concessions for the individual residents. So they may receive a month free as an example upfront but the next month they are striking a check for the full amount of the lease rent. So any renewal that we provide to them at some point in time that at least expires will typically be based off the lease rent as opposed to the base rent. So people are where they can afford what they're writing a check for as opposed to the effectiveness rent. Yes. So if you look at it on a rent change basis as opposed to the blended values that we were talking about basically we had effective rounds that were down 112 but if you look at release rents they were down about 7%. That's correct yes. Yes. Incomes are down less than the reduction of rental rates. Yes. No. It's a good question in terms of the bargain hunters. I guess in the current environment sort of everybody's looking for a deal but as I mentioned in response to the last question and people are well qualified with good incomes that are coming in. So it's I would say that we're now looking for people that really can't afford what we're doing and so they're really trying to drive for a deep discount to make comfort for them. In terms of the question about net new demand coming in from sort of other geographies that's a good question. I don't have that right off the top of my head but I would say for the most part what we're seeing is that given the entire market in many cases has improved in occupancy that there is net new demand coming into these markets as opposed to just a recirculating of the existing demand that's already in place that would allow that to happen. So I don't have specific detail for you in terms of how much of a demand in New York City and San Francisco market occupancy to come up there has to be net new demand. No I mean it's the same phenomena, I mean the urban markets in Boston are still very challenged. It's quite choppy not quite as bad as New York City or San Francisco but the urban markets are driving most of it and there and there are some sort of infill pockets, I mentioned your assembly row asset Newton Chestnut Hill pockets like that that are sort of the inner ring suburbs are also a little bit weaker. Some of them are more distant suburban towns with good school districts and things like that are performing better. Yes. That's a god question I think to the comment I have made John earlier, it's quite a little too early to tell in terms of calling it a bottom but we are pleased with the fact that during what is typically a sesonally lower period where we had turnover up 15% year-over-year that we have been able to slowly pull back on concessions and see slightly better blended rents sort of that effective basis for now four months basically, three-four months that gives us a sense that we're kind of pricing in the right neighborhood and that was building occupancy. So we don't need to build as much occupancy as we were attempting to do in the last three or four months. Therefore we believe we should be able to do better in terms of absolute effective rents moving forward. To your point though it does what happens in each market as we get to the spring leasing season is yet to be seen. So I think we're kind of bouncing around the bottom now and the question is will we continue to see those sequential improvements now that we're at that occupancy platform that we want to be at that is a function of just through supply and demand in these markets and what happens. So I think it's probably a little too early to call in terms of the specific question that you have whether I should read in this that this is at the bottom and it's going to bounce back I'm not sure we're prepared to say that just yet. Rich Sean here. That's obviously one of the things that they hear is to whether this is going to be either a V-shaped or -shaped in terms of recovery and that's ultimately its job, it's what's going to help propel total household formation and the deconsolidation of households that may have consolidated over the last year and while the employment rate is looking pretty good obviously the labor participation rates are pretty low. So it's going to take some really decent economic growth I think to really, I think some yes, suburbans are going to be back a lot quicker, could be a lot quicker than 3 to 5 years as we've seen above. I think the question here is really about urban and some of the really tech intensive suburban submarkets like Mountain View or  Park as we're talking about before and that's going to take some economic growth I think. As I think you may see sort of a quick V-shape maybe for the suburban markets and the urban markets, maybe may not be back to those rents for another event three four years. It's a lot of point that you are making. It's so I think suburban rents could be back, back to where they were in a year. They were only down 4%. It doesn't take a lot of growth to get that 4% back in those markets. And so we're focused we're kind of activating that lever and markets where we think as I said in my prepared comments where I think the risk adjusted return is make sense right now. Yes. Yes Brent it's Sean. I can fix that with that one and matter, as Tim jump in but it's probably a little too early to tell right now. I would say I mean certainly ridership has fallen dramatically through the pandemic and all the major transit systems and as a result in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that one of the locations within our suburban footprint that has been most impacted is sort of transit oriented developments just because people don't need it as much. Whether that results in permanent cuts versus just the temporary protections and capacities that we've seen has yet to play out and I suspect that there probably wouldn't be decisions made around permanent cuts until we get beyond the pandemic and people see what ridership sort of normalizes that. So I think it's probably too early to call on that at this point but certainly if there are transit-oriented developments that are out there that are the residents are heavily relying upon transit system and capacity is cut dramatically this would be a negative impact on those assets. It's probably just too early to tell what that might be. Yes. On the eviction moratoria there is sort of various  related about eviction, related to late fees, running fees and things like that. So it's not just the federal level that we have to  and even local in some cases. So one example you may have noticed that California  through June. So and there is Washington state and various other places CBC order as well federal overwrite. There is quite a bit of  I would say in terms of what you can do at state level.  at this point is that we will probably see most of the whole through mid year very likely depending on how things unfold with vaccination of the population and the economy continuing to recover that is sort of how we view at this point but there's no question that it could be extended beyond that where in some cases if things are going well people let expire sooner. So that will influence our ability to big people. We are continuing other efforts as it relates to collections that we will continue but at this point what we basically feel like it's going to happen is that bad debt that we saw the last three quarters of 2020 will likely continue with that face a little bit of a nice present January but it wasn't quite as bad but the expectation is look more like last three quarters of 2020. Yes Dennis, this is Sean. Good question. Happy to comment on that and hear others Ken as well as well but as it relates to output trend we are expecting deliveries in 2021 to come down about 6% to 7% compared to 2020 and represent about 1.8% of stock. All the regions are expected to be down except for the New York, New Jersey region first where the decline in deliveries and sort of New York area is going to be offset by what we're seeing in northern New Jersey particularly Jersey City increases by about 3500 to 4000 units, even though balance kind of New York City is down maybe 2200. So in terms of trade area is an increase there and then we expected to be relatively flat in Northern California. In terms of urban specific yes we did see a little bit of benefit certainly coming in as I mentioned, New York City, urban Boston a very modest increase in the district. So not terribly different. And San Francisco is basically flat. So no material change there and other market I guess it would LA where  is going to be down about 1500 units. So in general the supply picture in the urban environment with exception to San Francisco and DC will be better in 2021 than it was in 2020 with all things being equal it certainly help support a recovery at this point in time."

[Operator Instructions]\n Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference. \nJason Reilley: Thank you, Abby, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. \n Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There's a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.\n As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.\n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim? \nTimothy Naughton: Yes. Thanks, Jason. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Sean, Matt and I will provide comments on the slides that we posted last night, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterward.\n Our comments will focus on providing a summary of Q3 results, an update on operations and some perspective on the transaction market and our financial position.\n Maybe just a few comments before turning to the deck. Several of the trends unique to this downturn and pandemic that we discussed last quarter played out in our performance in Q3. The appeal of urban living is, for the time being, diminished due to health concerns of living in dense environments; the shutdowns effect on retail, entertainment and cultural venues that have long been the draw for urban centers; and a civil unrest that occurred in many of our cities over the summer and early fall.\n Work from home flexibility has been extended through year-end by many, if not most employers, particularly those heavily weighted to knowledge-based jobs like many businesses in our coastal markets. We've experienced a significant reduction in student and corporate demand as remote learning modalities are being deployed at many urban universities and business travel has dropped off substantially. And finally, historically low interest rates are stimulating demand for existing and new home purchases, particularly for young age cohorts where homeownership rates have begun to climb.\n All these factors have resulted in an unprecedented reduction in apartment demand, particularly in urban centers, beyond what we typically experience in an economic downturn. And while we believe the reduction in demand is mostly temporary in nature, we also believe that it won't be restored until we substantially resolve the public health crisis from the pandemic. A meaningful recovery in our business will not occur until employers believe that they could safely bring their workers back to the workplace. Until then, business leaders are likely to err on the side of caution before reopening their workplaces, which is ultimately what will need to happen before many of their employees return to apartment living.\n I suppose if there's any silver lining in any of this, it's that our nation's struggle to respond effectively to this pandemic should ultimately lead to improvements in our response to future public health crises, much like we saw in the aftermath of 9/11 and the great financial crisis, when our national response led to building a more resilient system to address the threat of terrorism and financial market dislocation, respectively. We hope then that in the future, our nation and our cities will be better prepared to deal with the public health crisis in a more resilient and less disruptive way. But for now, we need to play the hand we've been dealt, and we'll endeavor to provide as much transparency and disclosure as to the actions that we're taking in response and their ultimate impact on the business.\n So with that, let's turn to results for the quarter, starting on Slide 4. Q3 certainly proved to be a challenging quarter. Core FFO growth was down by 12%, driven by same-store revenue decline of just over 6%. On a sequential basis, from Q2, same-store revenue was down 2.2% or about half the sequential decline we saw in Q2 as bad debt in Q3 leveled off relative to Q2 after the big increase we saw in Q2 during the early months of the pandemic.\n In terms of capital allocation for the year, through the end of Q3, we've raised $1.7 billion through new debt issuance and dispositions and repurchased about 140 million of shares. We started only one development so far this year, and that was through a joint venture and opportunity zone in the Arts District of L.A., where we own just 25% of the venture. Importantly, our liquidity, balance sheet and credit metrics remain in great shape as we manage through the current downturn.\n Turning to Slide 5. Like we saw in Q2, the decline in year-over-year same-store revenue in Q3 was primarily attributable to a loss of occupancy and uncollectible lease revenue or bad debt. These 2 factors drove about 80% of the drop in same-store revenue in Q3. Over the next 2 to 3 quarters, we expect to see continued declines in same-store revenue, but increasingly, the decline will be driven by pressure on rental rates as we saw effective rental rates fall by almost 6% this past quarter. These declines will have a more pronounced impact on revenue over the next few quarters as those leases begin to roll through the portfolio.\n And as Sean will share in his remarks, the decline in effective rental rates had been greatest in high cost in urban markets like San Francisco, New York and San Jose.\n And with that, I'll turn it over to Sean, who will discuss operations and portfolio performance in more detail. Sean? \nSean Breslin: All right. Thanks, Tim. Turning to Slide 6. We experienced a year-over-year increase in prospect visits to our communities each month of the quarter. In total, visit volume was up about 20% year-over-year during Q3, which led to a roughly 10% increase in net lease volume. As you can see from Chart 2 on Slide 6, the most significant increase in net lease volume occurred in September, which is up about 35% year-over-year. And as of yesterday, traffic and leasing volume for October was up roughly 25% and 20%, respectively.\n Moving to Slide 7. For the first time in more than 4 years, resident notices to vacate our communities increased by a meaningful amount on a year-over-year basis. During Q3, notices increased by roughly 17%, primarily as a result of the spike in lease terminations in urban submarkets, which is depicted by the hash bars on Chart 1 on Slide 7 and a topic I'll touch on in a minute.\n Our leasing volume exceeded the pace of notices, however, starting in August and has continued through October. As a result, if you turn to Slide 8, you can see that beginning in September, move-ins exceeded move-outs and physical occupancy has increased from the low point at 93.1% in September to 93.5% for October and stands at 93.9% today.\n Moving to Slide 9. Our suburban portfolio continues to perform substantially better than our urban assets. Charts 1 and 2 at the top of Slide 9 reflect notices to vacate our communities and lease terminations by submarket type. Notices to vacate our urban communities increased by roughly 40% during the quarter, driven by an approximately 70% increase in lease terminations, and led to a 340 basis point decline in physical occupancy from Q2 to 90.2% and double-digit decline in rent change. For our suburban portfolio, the increase in notices to vacate was more modest, supporting better physical occupancy and rent change.\n The performance of our urban portfolio has been impacted by a variety of factors, including those mentioned by Tim in his prepared remarks. I'd highlight the combination of extended work-from-home policies and the civil unrest that occurred during the summer months, which impacted the quality of urban environments, is key factors driving residents to break leases during Q3 and leave urban centers for housing options and other geographies.\n Shifting to Slide 10 to address regional performance. Increased turnover in Northern California, the Mid-Atlantic and New York/New Jersey impacted physical occupancy more than in other regions. In the New York/New Jersey region, the increase in turnover was primarily a function of elevated turnover in New York City, which is 87% on an annualized basis during the quarter. For the Mid-Atlantic, we experienced increased turnover in the District of Columbia and other urban or quasi-urban submarkets like the Rosslyn, Ballston and Tysons Corner submarkets in Northern Virginia.\n In Northern California, annualized turnover during Q3 was 85%, driven by elevated turnover across all 3 markets, San Francisco, San Jose and the East Bay, but was most pronounced in San Francisco and in Mountain View where Google is headquartered.\n On a positive note, turnover was relatively flat in New England, which is a testament to our primarily suburban Boston portfolio and was down in both Pacific Northwest and Southern California. Physical occupancy in all 3 regions exceeded the portfolio average.\n And moving lastly to Slide 11. Same-store like-term lease rent change was down 3.3%, and effective rent change was down 5.8%. Metro New York/New Jersey and Northern California are 2 of the regions I identified on the last slide with elevated turnover and, therefore, available inventory to lease produced the weakest rent change during the quarter. Rent change in New England held up the best, again, supported by our suburban Boston portfolio, which, in many cases, offers differentiated products, including larger unit sizes to those departing urban environments.\n So with that, I'll turn it over to Matt to address our development portfolio. \nMatthew Birenbaum: All right. Great. Thanks, Sean. \n Turning to Slide 12. We are starting to see a remarkable recovery in the transaction market. Ultra-low interest rates have started to bring buyers back into the investment sales market for properties that can support reasonable levels of debt service, primarily suburban assets where operating results have been less impacted by the pandemic.\n To take advantage of this shift in buyer sentiment, we increased our disposition plan over the summer and brought several communities to market in the past 2 months. As of today, 6 of these communities are currently under contract or letter of intent at very attractive pricing with cap rates averaging 4.4%. This compares to 4 communities that we sold earlier in the year at an average cap rate of 4.7%, putting us on track to complete nearly $700 million in dispositions for the year.\n Turning to our development portfolio. Slide 13 shows the rents we are achieving at the 9 communities currently in lease-up. For the past several years, we have shifted our development focus to more suburban locations, and we're starting to see some of the benefits of this strategy now as our lease-up rents are only about $45 per month below our initial underwriting, allowing for continued value creation on these assets as they are completed and stabilized.\n We have highlighted 3 of our lower-density northeastern communities on the slide, which feature rental townhomes and which are showing a nice increase in rents compared to pro forma. This product, which features larger floor plans, private garages and direct entry with no common corridors, is particularly appealing in the current environment and serves as a good substitute for single-family rentals, which are enjoying very strong fundamentals.\n On Slide 14, we show the future earnings potential of our development  [ portfolio ]. At current projected rents and yields, we expect to generate nearly $140 million in annual stabilized NOI with only $14 million of that reflected in our Q3 results. And with more than 90% of the capital needed to complete those assets already funded, these developments should contribute significant incremental cash flow over the next several years.\n And with that, I'll turn it back to Tim for some closing remarks. \nTimothy Naughton: Well, thanks, Matt. Turning to the last slide, Slide 15. It was another challenging quarter, driven by the suddenness and continued strength of the pandemic. Weak same-store performance is being driven mostly by our urban portfolio as Sean mentioned. Particularly in the high cost markets of San Francisco and New York Suburban communities with larger units have performed much better. While pricing pressure continues to impact rental rates, occupancy has begun to modestly improve and stabilize in the 93% to 94% range. The transaction market, as Matt mentioned, has picked up dramatically after having been frozen earlier in the year. For those assets being taken to market, values are generally holding up at levels close to pre-COVID valuations.\n We continue to be cautious in deploying new capital, particularly for new development where economics are challenging and construction costs have not abated in any material way.\n And lastly, the balance sheet is very well positioned and is much stronger than prior downturns, which should give us plenty of financial flexibility to address the challenges posed by the current downturn.\n And so with that, Abby, we'd be -- we'd like to open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Nick Joseph with Citi. \nNicholas Joseph: Maybe just on the transaction market. You mentioned kind of the difference of urban versus suburban, but that kind of blended transaction just values are pretty similar to pre-COVID. Can you bifurcate that between the 2, both in terms of buyer interest as well as values for urban versus suburban of what you're seeing today? \nMatthew Birenbaum: Nick, this is Matt. I wish that I could, but the reality of it is that there's very, very little kind of urban high-rise assets that are in the market right now. And kind of that makes sense when you think about where the occupancies are, where the rent changes on those assets, as Sean laid out in his remarks. So the assets that are trading, both that we're trading and that we're seeing others trade in the market, tend to be more assets that can support strong debt service coverage wherever the buyers can take advantage of the rates -- incredibly low rates. And those tend to be more of the suburban assets, more maybe $100 million or less in general asset size, although not universally.\n As you mentioned, on those assets, what we're seeing is the values are pretty consistent with where they were pre-COVID. In some cases, the cap rates are down, the NOIs are down a little, but the value is pretty much, some are a little higher, some are a little lower. And the bid on those has been incredibly strong. There's a lot of capital that was raised. If you went to NMHC in January this year, there were a lot more people saying they were going to be buyers than sellers. So there was a lot of money on the sidelines, and that money was frustrated in the first half of the year with very little transactions to shoot at. So you're seeing a little bit of a pent-up demand there. But again, that's all focused really on the assets that are being brought to market. And I'm not aware of hardly any kind of downtown urban core markets -- assets being brought to market in this environment. So the value on those assets is really anybody's guess. \nNicholas Joseph: And then just in terms of your own appetite for sales, beyond the $440 million that you cite here, kind of what's behind that? And then if you can tie that to the share repurchase program and expectations going forward. \nKevin O'Shea: Well, yes, Nick, this is Kevin. Maybe I'll begin with the share repurchase. There's obviously a lot of number of uses that we fund with asset sale proceeds as we always do, including development spend under way. But in terms of the share buyback, as you saw, we were active in that program in the second quarter. Really, the fundamental thesis behind the share repurchase program hasn't changed. We expect to be active on it in the third quarter. We believe there's an attractive opportunity to take advantage of the disconnect between private and public market values for investors like ourselves who can see things through to the other side of the pandemic. We have the balance sheet strength and liquidity to pursue a modest share buyback that's executed in a measured way, which we believe we did in the second quarter and we intend to do so going forward, and one that's funded with primarily with asset sales and sized and managed in a manner that preserves our strong credit profile.\n So all those things were true last quarter. They remain true this quarter. And so looking ahead, we would continue to plan on a measured buyback, funded primarily with asset sales with an eye on preserving our financial strength and flexibility. So we have plenty of capacity to sell assets over time and don't feel -- we don't believe that's going to be a constraint for us.\n I don't know, Tim, if you want to add anything. \nTimothy Naughton: No. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore. \nRichard Hightower: In terms of the move-outs that took place during the third quarter and predominantly within the urban portfolio, can you give us a sense if you track this sort of thing, where they're moving to in terms of forwarding addresses? Because we've heard commentary on intracity moves, let's say, where it's more bargain hunting than anything. But are you seeing a structural shift outside the city from your urban -- previously urban inhabitants going elsewhere? \nSean Breslin: Yes. Rich, this is Sean. A very good question. And we do track that just based on forwarding addresses. I'd say there's probably 2 or 3 things I'd highlight as it relates to -- when you look at the data, what sort of stands out, and really, I'd say 3 points. First is we classify the big move for a resident is that they're moving more than 150 miles somewhere. And in that category, New York City, this percentage of move-outs, Q3 of '19, that was about 17% of the population, that increased to about 30% of the population in Q3. In San Francisco, Q3 last year was about 23%. It moved up to about 27% this year. And then the 2 other categories I'd highlight, a regional move, which we define as between 50 and 150 miles away from your departing location. In New York City, that moved from 6% of move-outs up to about 20% and in San Francisco from 7% to 10%.\n And then probably the last one I'd highlight is what we consider a market move, which is between -- greater than 10 but less than 50 miles. And the one that really stood out as a meaningful increase was Boston, primarily urban Boston, where it increased from basically 10% to 20%, so about double.\n One thing you have to keep in mind in some of these things where a local move is obviously less than 10 miles that didn't go through it, but 10 miles can be -- when you think about some of these urban environments, 10 miles does feel like a long way. So someone leaving San Francisco, 10 miles could be going down into the peninsula or places like that. But in terms of sort of the larger move, that's the data that stood out in Q3. \nRichard Hightower: Okay. Those are helpful stats. And then just maybe a quick housekeeping question. But for the -- on the asset sales side, the properties that are in the market or under contract, do you expect those to close by year-end? Or what's the timing there? \nMatthew Birenbaum: This is Matt. I think most of them will close by year-end. It's possible 1 or 2 might slip into January, but we would expect most of those proceeds to come in by the end of the year. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Alua Askarbek with Bank of America. \nAlua Noyan Askarbek: Just going back to move-outs and focusing specifically on the Bay Area, which are the highest in Northern California. But kind of where do things stand today? And are you starting to see the move-outs moderating as we head into the winter months? And do you work with residents offers to like suburban market options to keep them within network? \nSean Breslin: Yes. Alua, your questions broke up a little bit in terms of residents departing San Francisco, I think you said, and whether we're seeing that accelerate or decelerate? Was that the first part of your question? \nAlua Noyan Askarbek: Yes. I was just wondering if like move-outs are starting to moderate as we head into the winter months? \nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean as you can see on the chart regarding the move-in/move-outs that we posted up there, we're starting to see volume ease as we move into the fourth quarter in October specifically. That is relatively typical in terms of seasonal patterns. But in terms of whether that's sustainable or not, it will depend on a lot of different factors and many of which Tim mentioned in his prepared remarks, so it's probably too early to conclude that it's a definitive downtrend, other than seasonally, that would normally be the case.\n And then I think the second part of your question was around transfers and whether we help facilitate that for residents, and we do. And as it relates to transfer activity, transfers were up about roughly 1/3 year-over-year. So we are seeing increased activity both within the same community and to another community that might within -- be within a reasonable distance of the community they're departing. So definitely an increase in activity there, but it's not a meaningful percentage of total move-outs, if you want to think about it that way. \nAlua Noyan Askarbek: Got it. And then just one other question. So some peers have started to get creative in the urban markets by transforming empty apartments into work-from-home spaces or building in desks into various mix in the apartments themselves to attract renters. Have you guys done anything different to attract renters in your urban markets? Have renters been asking for different amenities like this? \nSean Breslin: Yes. And a good question. We're exploring a lot of different things that we've done a fair bit as it relates to some people who are looking for, in this environment, a short-term stay in a different geography. It may not just be in the urban environment. It could be a suburban environment where they have left the urban environment, but they are not sure when they may have to return to work in that urban environment. And therefore, they'd like to rent a furnished apartment in a suburban location that's not their sort of normal home location. So we're doing a little bit of that.\n And then certainly, as it relates to amenities, we're trying to facilitate food delivery and things of that sort as best we can, given the -- obviously, the constraints to the building from a physical standpoint, trying to facilitate as best we can. So for that, our customers that are home in urban environment, trying to make sure that they have access to the amenities that they would normally enjoy just in a different way. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley. \nRichard Hill: I wanted to come back to some of the October updates that you had put in your presentation and you discussed in your prepared remarks. It looked like there was some pretty healthy improvement in occupancy. So the question I'm trying to maybe understand a little bit better is, do you think rents have come down enough in your markets whereby demand is starting to come back up, and you're going to start to see less bad, call it, leasing spreads going forward? So it's really a question of velocity here going forward. And do you think that you're starting to see some stabilization in that demand? \nSean Breslin: Yes. Rich, good question. A few thoughts, and then others can join in. I mean I'd say, obviously, recent trends, particularly September and October, were favorable in terms of demand absorbing some of the inventory we had. Obviously, we had more available inventory given the turnover and the lease breaks that I mentioned, particularly in the urban environments, which did put some additional pressure on pricing. But it really is sort of a macro question as it relates to, particularly in the urban environment, people coming back into this environment because they feel comfortable about it. They need to go to school. They have to be back in the office. All those macro factors really drive that ultimate decision as to whether to return to that environment, and price is more just what am I going to choose within that environment. And as long as you're competitive, you should get your fair share of the market overall. But I think the macro factors are really the things that will tilt it to either kind of stabilize and be more positive going forward or deteriorate. Those are really the key drivers here, and I think that's yet to be told that full story until we move into it a little bit further here towards year-end. \nTimothy Naughton: Yes. Sean, maybe I'd just add to that a little bit. I think what we're seeing a little bit is what we would normally see in a downturn, which is sort of the housing market is dynamic and kind of resetting its level, if you will. So we've lost about 300 basis points stock. We'd say we've had to reach down a little bit, if you will, into the rental pool. And as part of that, you got to adjust pricing in order to sort of attract your sort of fair share, if you will, of the pool of renters.\n I think, ultimately, in terms of whether it stabilizes, it's just -- it's going to be a question, I think, of the macro environment, as Sean mentioned, but also just what's happening on the public health front. I mean as we said, it's really impacting urban centers, in particular, in a very unique way. To the extent we get a vaccine or a therapeutic that starts to give employers confidence enough to bring employees back into the workplace, they're going to start coming back into the -- into these urban centers in terms of their living arrangement, and that's going to create some net new demand for us and help stabilize it. To the extent this thinking needs to get protracted, the vaccines just don't get approved or don't appear to be as effective as we hope or don't have the penetration, then this will obviously continue to be a bit more protracted. But I think that could really help sort of stabilize, if not improve, the outlook for -- particularly for the urban centers. \nRichard Hill: Yes. And so just so I understand, are you -- is -- are you suggesting that the improvement in October that was noted is more seasonal? Or would you -- or are there other factors that are driving that? \nTimothy Naughton: I think a lot of it is price driven, honestly. Rents have continued to come down sequentially, and we've gotten to the point at which we've been able to attract sort of our fair share of the market in the 93% to 94% range in terms of occupancy. So I think that's what's driving it initially. As to whether it stabilizes, I think it's a function of some of the things that Sean mentioned and I mentioned. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Rick Skidmore with Goldman Sachs. \nRichard Skidmore: Just thinking about the development pipeline -- the future development pipeline, both of new starts, how are you thinking about that as -- I know you talked about not doing any new starts yet other than the one JV. But how are you thinking about it as you look forward and then also as you think about mix, both from a geographic mix and, I guess, urban/suburban? \nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes, this is Matt. I guess I can take that. I don't know, Tim, you may want to add some as well. Yes. It's really a combination of, I'd say, both bottom up in terms of did the deals still pencil in terms of the value creation and are we seeing an attractive cost basis as well as top down, just what are our other options for our capital availability, as Kevin was talking about. So we might start a deal or 2 this quarter. The deals that are more likely to start sooner are going to be the -- some of these suburban northeastern deals where even from my prepared remarks, you saw some of those lease-ups are actually beating their pro formas pretty significantly.\n So some of those locations are benefiting from some of the outmigration from some of the urban submarkets. And those are markets that just tend to be much lower beta in the first place. They tend to be less volatile in terms of rents. They haven't seen the same run-up in hard costs over the last 10 years or 5 years, certainly. So maybe there's a little bit less giveback on hard costs in some of those markets. So that's probably where we're more likely in the short term to start. We are still looking to grow in our expansion market, so that's another place that we don't have anything. We're going to start there in the next quarter. But at some point next year, we may have some deals to start there.\n And then the other piece of it is just what's going to happen with hard costs. And we have not seen hard costs come down. They've maybe flattened out in some of our markets. Lumber is still sky high, although it's starting to come down some. And whether the reaction to this downturn, if you go back 2 cycles ago, the recession there after the great financial crisis, hard costs did come down quite a bit. But prior cycles, it was more that they kind of flatlined for a while and inflation surpassed them. So they kind of fell on a real basis but not a nominal basis. And I don't know that -- we're still waiting to see how that plays out in each of our regional markets. \nTimothy Naughton: Yes, Matt, I agree with all that. Maybe just to kind of step back a little bit in terms of volume. We were probably running at about $1.4 billion kind of mid-cycle last year. We'd already sort of downsized it to the $800 million, $900 million over the last 3 years or so, call it, '17 to '19. We could start anywhere between 0 and probably $1.5 billion next year, depending upon the factors that Matt mentioned, just the visibility around the rental market and construction markets and then certainly as it relates to the capital markets as well and other options that we might have with our capital, including repurchase of shares.\n So it's a mix of all those factors, and it's ultimately -- our views on those are going to kind of form ultimately how we -- how much capital we decide to deploy, somewhere between 0 and $1.5 billion. And so it's probably over the next 12 to 15 months. \nOperator: We will take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street. \nJohn Pawlowski: Sean, just one question for me. Could you share economic occupancy in October for Northern California and Washington Metro? Just curious those 2 markets, how pricing power is trending and how it could trend into the winter. \nSean Breslin: Yes. John, you broke out a little bit. You said occupancy in Northern California in October? \nTimothy Naughton: Economics. \nSean Breslin: Yes. I think it's physical occupancy. Yes, physical occupancy, I can tell you. Sorry, say it again. \nJohn Pawlowski: Yes. Physical occupancy is fine if that's all you have in Northern California and Washington, DC. \nSean Breslin: Yes. So in Northern California overall, I believe we're running today -- I believe, today, running around 92%, which is pulled down by the -- really the lower occupancy that we're experiencing in the 90%, 91% range in San Francisco and pockets of San Jose. How we define San Jose, which is primarily Mountain View and Central San Jose pulling down those numbers. So those are the 2 areas where physical occupancy is weakest, I would say. And then as it relates to Washington, DC, the district itself, occupancy, I believe, is around 91% today, physical again. \nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And based on current trends today, do you expect stabilization or improvement in those markets or continued slide? \nSean Breslin: I'd say based on recent trends, I would say they stabilized a little bit in terms of occupancy and have started to trend up, consistent with the same-store portfolio pattern that I described earlier in my prepared remarks. How quickly they come back is just a function of the velocity that we see in terms of notices, which is primarily a function of lease breaks recently, and then on the demand side in terms of the velocity of leasing that comes through. But as I look forward over the next 6 weeks or so based on availability and such, I would expect both of those to drift up some. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. \nSumit Sharma: This is Sumit Sharma here in for Nick. Maybe if you could give us a quick update. \nSean Breslin: We can't hear you, if you could try to speak up a little bit. Juan, is that you? I can't -- we can't hear you -- or Nick. \nSumit Sharma: So sorry. This is Sumit in for Nick, speakerphone problem. So maybe if you could give us a quick update on the sales pipeline at Park Loggia. I think you guys sold about 59 out of the 172 condos on -- understanding -- interested in understanding if you're seeing any uptick in the NYC sales market or the rental market weakness is sort of filtering in there as well? \nMatthew Birenbaum: Sure. This is Matt. I can give you an update. So as of today, we have 65 units that have closed. Again, there's 172 units total in the building. We closed 65, that's $207 million in sales price or about $3.2 million per unit. We also have 9 units under contract today, and we have another 7 contracts out for signature. So we have another 16 -- 15, 16 deals that are pending, many of which would close in the fourth quarter.\n I guess I would say the last couple of months, traffic has been pretty good. Interest has been pretty steady. We're running about 3 new deals a month, which would put us at probably the top or among the top 2 or 3 performing condo buildings in all of Manhattan. So there is a lot more supply than there was kind of when we opened the building for sales, but we're still continuing to get well more than our fair share. So I'd say the sales activity has been pretty steady since kind of the initial lockdowns were lifted in midsummer, and we're continuing to get pretty good traction. \nSumit Sharma: Great. And just a more longer-term question, I guess. With the pandemic and everything, how has it sort of changed your development plans? In terms of -- outside of the pipeline today, what should we be thinking of when we think about your development plans? When you shift towards suburban to urban or even the unit mix, does that shift towards 2 or 3 bedrooms or more in line with your classical kind of the unit mix? \nTimothy Naughton: Yes. I'll try to speak to that. Again, you're breaking up a little bit. But in terms of -- long term, in terms of development, it's an important capability, and it's a distinguishing competitive advantage that we've had in the public markets. As markets stabilize and start to strengthen, we think the development will be economic again. And I think we've said many times in the past that we're relatively agnostic between urban and suburban. We're trying to go where we think fundamentals are the best at any point in time and where there's greater value.\n And having said that, for all the reasons we've been discussing, we pivoted -- we had already started pivoting maybe 3 or 4 years ago to suburban in part because there was just better value, and we've started to see the suburbs start to grow as the leading edge of millennials were approaching sort of the time of their lives where they're maybe buying homes or starting to move -- double back to the suburbs. So we're just seeing more economic activity. That's only been obviously exacerbated by the pandemic. So I suspect suburban demand would continue to outpace urban for a little bit.\n We did talk about sort of product mix on the last call. I do think there's -- particularly with the work-from-home flexibility that it is going to translate into some unit mix and program changes, an extra bedroom that can double as an office, providing dedicated workspaces within the units. Our survey data suggests that a majority of the residents still would prefer to work within their unit, but they're also -- about 20%, 25% are very interested in a co-working space as well. Pretty much everything we've touched, either redevelopment or new development over the last 2 or 3 years, has a significant co-working space. So the types of spaces are likely to continue to change, more sort of dedicated versus just kind of open table format but giving people an opportunity to either meet or have more sort of safer spaces or confined spaces. I think we expect we'll see that.\n So those are some of the changes we think are likely to come as a result of either the work-from-home flexibility that we think it's a real -- it was already a trend. It's only going to be greater kind of going forward. Our portfolio really needs to respond to that. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. \nJuan Sanabria: I'm here with John Kim. Just had a couple of questions. First, just on the pricing that you noted in October, was there a change strategically, either dropping the rent or increasing concessions in October versus the previous months in the third quarter just to stimulate that improvement in the occupancy? \nSean Breslin: Yes. Juan, this is Sean. Yes, fair point. As I noted in my prepared remarks, obviously, we had additional inventory become available as a result of the increase in turnover that occurred during this quarter, particularly in July and August, in those urban environments, as I mentioned. And you can see that, I think it was on the second slide where we showed notice to vacate and lease breaks. And obviously, that put additional pressure on pricing. So that -- for example in -- kind of on all leases signed in the third quarter. If you look at July and August, as an example, in urban environments across all leases, the average concession was between half a month to 3/4 of a month. As we moved into September and then in October, getting beyond Q3, that increased to about a month on all leases signed. \n So certainly, price response, as it relates to the additional availability that came through. Could we have leased some of that faster? Probably, yes, if we had been even substantially more aggressive as it relates to price. But when you have that kind of inventory delivered to you quickly because there are lease breaks as opposed to having 30 to 60 days advance notice, you would have had to discount that price pretty heavily to try and absorb the incremental inventory that we receive much more quickly. So our strategy was to absorb the inventory at a reasonable pace but not put out a fire sale, so to speak, to absorb it very, very fast, if that makes sense. \nJuan Sanabria: Yes, good. And then I was just curious on the relative pricing between some of your urban core and sort of transit -- close to suburban assets. And kind of are we getting closer to parity to maybe where you could see a flip-flop between some of the people in the suburban market switching back to the urban given the relative pricing and the proximity to work and significant time commuting for whenever we do return to the offices? \nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean, good question. I'm happy to comment on that and others can jump in. But if you think about the markets we're talking about, New York City, as an example, think about the rent levels in New York City as opposed to kind of moving into the Westchester, Long Island or Northern and Central Jersey, it's a pretty big trade. Even though rents have come down quite a bit in New York City, it's still a big trade. So I think it's really more a function of the macro factors that we were talking about earlier in terms of people's either desire or need to be in those urban environments as it relates to either being in the office because they're required to be in the office, they need to be in the office, returning to school at some of these urban universities or just feeling comfortable in those environments that we've moved into a place where they feel better about retail establishments, restaurants, et cetera, and part of that will be driven by the health care situation and whether that crisis is resolved in a meaningful way. So I think those are the bigger issues as opposed to just purely price. \nTimothy Naughton: I just said -- I mean -- and today, they're just -- they're not having to commute. So obviously, they've tried to take advantage of lowering their rent. I guess I would say we do expect them to come back when they're forced to come back to market. I mean you sort of have to just ask yourself the question, was your life sort of better before COVID or after COVID, and all the things that make urban living great sort of pre-COVID. Once we get on the other side of this, they're still going to be there. These are great mixed-use environments. Particularly the markets that we're in. They are dynamic environments. It's certainly more proximate to jobs. There's been a lot invested in infrastructure in these. It's environmentally more sustainable to people that care about that, I guess.\n But I think I'd say the one caveat is this work-from-home flexibility, I think, at the margin will cause some people to maybe stay in the suburbs. If they only have to commute, call it, 2 or 3 days a week versus 5 days a week. They may be able to tolerate that where they wouldn't 4 or 5. So I'd say kind of at the margin, you may not expect to see urban demand as robust as it was pre-COVID. But I think when you layer on the pricing changes that we've seen, there's going to be plenty of people coming back to the urban centers. \nJuan Sanabria: [ That you ] noted in the New York MSA? \nTimothy Naughton: I'm sorry. Did you say including the New York MSA? \nJuan Sanabria: No. I'm just thinking, is Northern California different from New York in terms of the relative rent differential in Downtown San Francisco versus Oakland or the South Bay? \nTimothy Naughton: Pretty big deltas. \nSean Breslin: Yes. Those rent spreads are pretty big between the pockets of the East Bay or even moving down into the peninsula or lower peninsula as compared to being in the city of San Francisco. It's a pretty big spread. I mean I think it really is more around the quality of the lifestyle and the reasons you want to be in the urban environment, I mentioned, just not necessarily being able to stay and you don't have to be in the office. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC. \nRichard Anderson: So when I was thinking initially about the environment, I thought AvalonBay would be in a better spot than it's turned out to be because of the lion's share of your portfolio is in the suburbs. I didn't think people would move from New York to Nebraska maybe as much as they had and more New York to Edgewater, New Jersey or something. But I understand transfers are up a little bit, but I also understand that's a relatively small piece of the turnover puzzle. How would you respond to the idea that when people -- when we do get some sort of resolution here that people want to step back into these urban worlds and not maybe go all the way into Manhattan but someplace around it and thereby putting AvalonBay in an interesting spot to sort of tease people back into these urban centers without having to go full in. Do you have a sense about how permanent these moves away from you have happened and how much flexibility people have to come back as soon as they feel comfortable to do so? \nTimothy Naughton: Yes. Rich, I think it's a really interesting question. I would say even going back before sort of pre-COVID, there was already -- I mean we were already a believer sort of in the infill kind of urban-light, sort of mixed-use lifestyle environments. We think sort of post-COVID, that's still a great opportunity. Maybe it's even a stronger opportunity when you sort of add affordability in the mix, when you can maybe be in an infill suburb for a couple of bucks less a foot than being downtown and then you couple that with maybe decent transit and only have to hop in the train 2 or 3 days a week versus 5 days a week.\n So I think kind of that infill suburb is really extremely well positioned. I think it had been anyway. But like many things, as we've talked about COVID, it just seems to be accelerating kind of these trends that were already occurring before. But even as I mentioned on the last question, it doesn't make -- urban living is still very attractive. But when you layer into demographics, affordability and work-from-home flexibility, that does make -- that does change the calculus a little bit for that marginal renter. \nRichard Anderson: Okay. And second, unrelated to the first, but you talked a little bit about how your future development activity might be informed by this environment and how it may change. How does that apply to your fledgling businesses in Denver and South Florida? Do you think those markets are performing perhaps better or feeling more resilient and maybe they become a bigger piece of the pie chart now in the aftermath because of all of this? Or does that not change relatively speaking? \nMatthew Birenbaum: Rich, it's Matt. So those markets right now are doing better than most of our legacy markets. I think some of that's a function of their lower-cost markets, their markets where initially, anyway, there was less of a shutdown. So that's probably part of it. And the assets we have in those markets seem to be more suburban as well, at least that's definitely true of our Denver portfolio.\n So when we went into those markets, we said our goal was to get them to be about 5% each of our portfolio, which would be about $1.5 to $2 billion each. We're only -- not even quite halfway there yet. So we are looking to be aggressive there. We'll continue to look to be aggressive there. Over time, could that migrate up to more than 5%? I mean it could. But I think, again, like Tim was saying, to the extent what we're seeing is that the kind of COVID response is accelerating a lot of the trends that we saw pre-COVID, and those were the same trends that have led us to those markets in the first place. \nTimothy Naughton: Yes. Rich, maybe just to add to that. I agree with Matt's -- what Matt was saying. I think we've said on prior calls, too. It might lead us to go into new markets as well that are likely to have some of the spillover benefit from -- whether it's New York or the California markets but also are kind of heavily indexed to knowledge-based jobs as big tech and knowledge-based industries continue to kind of diversify their workforces across the map. We want to be kind of where their workers are. And if there are going to be places like Denver and Southeast Florida, we think strategically, those are the places we need to be and our allocation is going to need to respond to that. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. \nAustin Wurschmidt: I was wondering if you guys can walk through your effective rent growth month-to-month in the third quarter as well as provide October? And do you think now that you're through the peak leasing season, you could see rates improve due to fewer expirations? Are you more apt to keep rents closer to maybe September and October levels and continue to try and grow occupancy? \nSean Breslin: Yes. Austin, this is Sean. Good question. In terms of walking you through the rent change in the quarter, basically, we move from sort of mid-3s up to mid-8s in terms of the reduction in rent change as you move through each month of the quarter. And then October, right now on a blended basis, is down about 10%. And in terms of the broader question as it relates to stabilization, I mean the only thing I'd say is that, particularly in the suburban environment, concessions have kind of leveled off in the past couple of months here. We've had good volume. So we haven't necessarily had to kind of dig deeper into the concession bag to generate that velocity. And I'd say we're reasonably comfortable with the velocity we're seeing today, which is what I expressed in my prepared remarks that you saw on the slide. \n So to the extent that we continue to see good velocity in pricing, we wouldn't have to dig deeper into that concession bag to the extent things fell off then we'd have to reevaluate. But based on where we think we're priced today, we feel like we're in pretty good shape. And again, I'd say on the suburban side, [ I think it ] is a little bit better than urban. So I'd say it will take a little while longer here to see how it plays out in these urban environments, if that's going to be the right kind of pricing level to continue to attract demand at the pace that we need it. \nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. No, that's very helpful. And then earlier to your comments going on where fundamentals are best as it relates to new investment activity, does any of the trends you've seen since you decided to enter into the expansion markets change your target allocation of those markets, either higher or lower, as you kind of look forward over the next several years? \nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes, this is Matt. No, I mean I think as we were talking on one of the prior questions, we like those markets. We're looking to grow in those markets. Like I said, our objective is to get to about 5% in each. Some of that is driven by just the size of those markets relative to the size of ours. And as Tim mentioned, there may be additional markets that we add into the mix here at some point that would get that kind of total allocation to other markets like that above that 10% over time. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. \nAlexander Goldfarb: So 2 questions. Tim, just going back to development. We had talked about this on the last call and you had said that you guys were adamant with your current development program and the team that you have in place, no changes. But in some of your answers earlier on the call, you talked about starts, obviously, this year being much down. Next year could have a wide range, 0 to $1 billion, I think you said. So as you think about where you would be on that front with development, what do you think the impact would be on the P&L? Like would we start to see some of these capitalized costs end up as expenses on the P&L as you try to keep your team in place? or do you think that there would be further changes afoot, especially if you can't do the level of development in the suburban markets that would necessitate -- that would keep sort of the level constant where it is today? \nTimothy Naughton: Yes. Alex, I think sort of simple answer is too early to know, to be honest. I think as I mentioned on the prior call, we have actually cut back our development capacity over the last 2 or 3 years as we've gone from about $1.4 billion to about $800 million. I'd say the group is scaled to do around $1 billion -- $800 million to $1 billion a year. It can probably flex up or down a little bit from that, depending upon the needs.\n When you talk about expensing versus capitalizing, it starts to get into a lot of other things that are probably worth maybe another call. But if you look at the past downturn, we suspended development for 4 or 5 quarters typically. So again, if this is a downturn in length and it looks somewhat like those, I don't think we're talking about what -- I don't think there's a concern about the things you're talking about. To the extent we're looking at a downturn where it just doesn't make sense to start a new development for 3 years, we're going to have to rightsize the group or expense some of those costs. So -- but I think it's premature to kind of know kind of where that's likely to fall out. \nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. The 4- to 5-quarter pause actually is a helpful reference. So thank you on that, Tim. The next would be -- so if you -- maybe for Kevin, just thinking about the operational, whether it's at the property level, G&A or on the balance sheet, where do you think are some cost saves or efficiencies that you guys could peak out that would help mitigate the revenue drops for -- as we look forward into next year? \nKevin O'Shea: Well, I mean maybe just to put some context, Alex, this is Kevin, I think we experienced year-over-year NOI decline $38 million, $39 million this past quarter. If you add the quarterly property management costs, overhead costs and G&A, they're about that number. So proportionately, our overhead costs represent a small part of the puzzle. And in terms of how we -- relative to the overall business and the revenue structure and so forth. So it's not a particularly acute issue, I would submit. In terms of how we can manage it, we manage it throughout the cycles. There are potentially some opportunities -- one of the biggest opportunities simply is just a fair bit of overhead costs or incentive costs, and those are going to naturally correct here this year. So there's a little bit of a self-correcting piece. And then in terms of kind of property management overhead, Sean, did you want to add something? \nSean Breslin: Yes. Alex, it's Sean. One thing, I think, that's fair to address is we were already on a path to create more operating efficiencies throughout the portfolio based on some of the things we talked about. I think it was one of the calls last year as it relates to automation, digitalization, various things like that, the great use of data, centralizing different things, whether it's leasing, renewals and such. And we're still on that path. And if anything, I would say it's accelerated certainly as a result of what happened through the pandemic as it relates to the operating model. And we were talking about somewhere in the order of magnitude of approaching $20 million to $30 million of operational savings through those various initiatives. And we're still plowing forward on that. And probably, we'll be investing more in some of those technology initiatives over the next couple of years to help offset what we're seeing at least at the property level P&L. \nTimothy Naughton: Yes. Alex, just to add, finally -- this is Tim, Alex. Maybe just to add, finally, in terms of G&A, as Kevin was mentioning, it's a pretty efficient business model. I mean you're talking about G&A costs are maybe 15 to 20 basis points of total asset value. If you compare that -- I mean, so as a business, it's pretty G&A efficient. I think compared to other business models, particularly on the private side, it's efficient again. So this is -- there aren't a lot of opportunities on the G&A side. Some of it is self-correcting through the incentive system, as Kevin mentioned. As performance weakens, incentives pay is less. But it's -- there's not a lot of extra bodies to look to. And G&A is -- it's 85%, 90% bodies, when you get down to it. \nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes. Tim, that's exactly the point I was after. And I was thinking at the property level, the bulk of the expenses are insurance, real estate taxes and payroll, and those categories would seem like they'd only go up. So it seems like the expense savings are sort of on the margin. It doesn't sound like there's anything big picture. It sounds like it's on the margin, but a lot of the expenses seem -- like are sort of set. Is that a fair takeaway? \nTimothy Naughton: Yes. I would say on the payroll side at the -- on the property level, that's where the opportunity is. Those are some of the activities that we think we can automate or centralize, get the benefit of some scale and the benefit of some automation as well where there could be real savings in terms of number of bodies. Not as clear on the overhead side, G&A side, when you may have a group of 2 people within a particular function that's working across a 300-unit -- a 300-community portfolio. So... \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Zach Silverberg with Mizuho. \nZachary Silverberg: Just a couple of quick ones. Can you talk about the profile of the residents entering the portfolio today in some of your more challenged submarkets like New York and Boston, where concessions appear more prevalent. I'm wondering if the income and credit profiles are any different and if there's any concern over future rent payments maybe a year from now. \nSean Breslin: Yes. Zach, good question. We haven't really changed our credit standards other than to be probably even more diligent as it relates to detecting fraud. Particularly in certain markets, I would say, like L.A. tends to be one that comes to mind. But we've not relaxed our credit standards as it relates to it, and we are still qualifying people in diligent manner so that as we look to the other side of this, lease rents aren't changing materially, that we can really have customers that can afford renewal rent increases as you move into -- pick a time frame that you're comfortable with, late 2021 or whatever it may be. So is there risk? There's always risk. But we definitely have not relaxed the standards. If anything, they are a little more stringent as it relates to the fraud detection. \nZachary Silverberg: Got you. And I guess piggybacking on an earlier question about coworking and communities and with flu season around the quarter, are you guys taking any preventative sanitary measures to combat the spread within the communities, given the potential uptick with flu season around the corner? \nSean Breslin: Yes. We've done a lot as it relates to kind of promoting a healthy environment. If you look at our operating expense table, we've noted that we've spent a couple of million bucks already this year as it relates to PPE and then beyond that for cleaning and disinfectants and various other things. We have a reservation system where people have to reserve amenity time within a gym or a chill space, whatever it may be. And so we're doing a fair bit to promote healthy environment.\n And for the most part, I think we're getting very good feedback through our Net Promoter Score comments around people appreciating our efforts. There's certainly some frustration that they can't just walk into the gym whenever they want. But it's very understanding as it relates to the need for a professional protocol to limit any impact at the community. And so far, knock on wood, we've been relatively lucky in terms of what we've seen at the community. So we feel good about what we're doing and continue to look for ways to promote that healthy environment. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Dennis McGill with Zelman. \nDennis McGill: A question is on Slide 9. As we look at that split between suburban and urban, I think it's easy to understand the pressure on the urban environment and the change in living conditions and so forth. When you analyze your suburban portfolio, though, it looks like rents there are down maybe 3%, 4% based on the chart. You are seeing move-outs up and vacate notices up as well. Where are those tenants going? If you were to sort of quantify or speculate the weakness in the suburban market, what do you think the leading factors are there? And what are the causes of turnover that you're seeing and the weakness in pricing? \nSean Breslin: Yes. Good question. I mean on the suburban side, you did peg it right, rents are down, call it, roughly 3% or so. I would say it's a variety of factors, really depending on the market. I'll give you a couple of examples. So we would consider various pockets of San Jose, as an example, including Mountain View, Central San Jose to some degree [indiscernible] Northeast San Jose at suburban. But I can tell you just based on the current protocol for companies like Apple and Google and others, there is not a need for those residents to be in that location. As a result, we've seen pressure from turnover in some of those pockets where the demand has just fallen off, obviously, not as much as what we've experienced in San Francisco. But because of those policies, there's pressure on demand there. And some of those pockets, particularly Central San Jose, Mountain View and a little bit in Northeast San Jose, there is supply. \n So we're seeing a compression there in terms of what's [indiscernible] at the higher end of the price pyramid coming down to compete with other assets in the existing inventory of sort of A minus to B-type assets, which are representative of what we have in those markets. So that's the kind of pressure you see in that type of environment. That's similar to what you might see in certain pockets in Seattle, like in Redmond.\n And then there's other pockets in the Northeast, say, Boston is holding up relatively well. Long Island is holding up relatively well, but you still do have -- we are in the midst of a recession, and people are making different choices to some degree as it relates to a living environment. Some people are moving into those environments from densely populated urban environments, but others are making different decisions as it relates to staying there or moving elsewhere. So demand overall, we're seeing just household contraction. So that will impact suburban environment, just not nearly as much as what we've seen in urban environments. So that's kind of the macro view. And Tim, do you want... \nTimothy Naughton: And part of that is you're seeing, particularly younger age cohorts moving back home. So the number -- percentage of under 35 moving back home, particularly under 25 [ continues to hit ] sort of historical highs. So you get sort of normal consolidation you get with any downturn. Probably what we haven't seen yet is it doubling up. If anything, people are trying to get away from their roommates if they're both trying to work from home in the same space. So -- but we're definitely seeing people move back home and camping out in the basement or just where they have more room to [ fill out work ]. We mentioned earlier sort of the parents' homes are more fully occupied, self-storage is more fully occupied, and apartments are a little less occupied. So that seems to be part of some of the trends that we're seeing. \nDennis McGill: That's helpful perspective. Actually, that was going to be a second question, Tim, if maybe continuing on that. If you think about the demographics of those early terminations or vacates, is that skewing more to the younger cohort that can be more mobile versus the families? Or are you seeing it fairly distributed across your tenant base? \nSean Breslin: Yes. No, that's a fair point. I mean if you look at sort of occupancy and related lease breaks, there's definitely more pressure in the studio floor plans. Urban environment studios during Q3, I think, the average occupancy was 87%, 88%, as an example. So people less -- more flexible moving home to mom and dad, for sure. \nOperator: And with no additional questions, I would like to turn the call back to Tim Naughton for any additional or closing remarks. \nTimothy Naughton: Thank you, Abby. I know everyone's busy, a lot of calls today. But thanks, again, for joining, and we'll see you in the virtual world, I suppose, maybe at NAREIT in November. Take care. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matthew Birenbaum",
            "content": "All right. Great. Thanks, Sean. \n Turning to Slide 12. We are starting to see a remarkable recovery in the transaction market. Ultra-low interest rates have started to bring buyers back into the investment sales market for properties that can support reasonable levels of debt service, primarily suburban assets where operating results have been less impacted by the pandemic.\n To take advantage of this shift in buyer sentiment, we increased our disposition plan over the summer and brought several communities to market in the past 2 months. As of today, 6 of these communities are currently under contract or letter of intent at very attractive pricing with cap rates averaging 4.4%. This compares to 4 communities that we sold earlier in the year at an average cap rate of 4.7%, putting us on track to complete nearly $700 million in dispositions for the year.\n Turning to our development portfolio. Slide 13 shows the rents we are achieving at the 9 communities currently in lease-up. For the past several years, we have shifted our development focus to more suburban locations, and we're starting to see some of the benefits of this strategy now as our lease-up rents are only about $45 per month below our initial underwriting, allowing for continued value creation on these assets as they are completed and stabilized.\n We have highlighted 3 of our lower-density northeastern communities on the slide, which feature rental townhomes and which are showing a nice increase in rents compared to pro forma. This product, which features larger floor plans, private garages and direct entry with no common corridors, is particularly appealing in the current environment and serves as a good substitute for single-family rentals, which are enjoying very strong fundamentals.\n On Slide 14, we show the future earnings potential of our development  [ portfolio ]. At current projected rents and yields, we expect to generate nearly $140 million in annual stabilized NOI with only $14 million of that reflected in our Q3 results. And with more than 90% of the capital needed to complete those assets already funded, these developments should contribute significant incremental cash flow over the next several years.\n And with that, I'll turn it back to Tim for some closing remarks. Nick, this is Matt. I wish that I could, but the reality of it is that there's very, very little kind of urban high-rise assets that are in the market right now. And kind of that makes sense when you think about where the occupancies are, where the rent changes on those assets, as Sean laid out in his remarks. So the assets that are trading, both that we're trading and that we're seeing others trade in the market, tend to be more assets that can support strong debt service coverage wherever the buyers can take advantage of the rates -- incredibly low rates. And those tend to be more of the suburban assets, more maybe $100 million or less in general asset size, although not universally.\n As you mentioned, on those assets, what we're seeing is the values are pretty consistent with where they were pre-COVID. In some cases, the cap rates are down, the NOIs are down a little, but the value is pretty much, some are a little higher, some are a little lower. And the bid on those has been incredibly strong. There's a lot of capital that was raised. If you went to NMHC in January this year, there were a lot more people saying they were going to be buyers than sellers. So there was a lot of money on the sidelines, and that money was frustrated in the first half of the year with very little transactions to shoot at. So you're seeing a little bit of a pent-up demand there. But again, that's all focused really on the assets that are being brought to market. And I'm not aware of hardly any kind of downtown urban core markets -- assets being brought to market in this environment. So the value on those assets is really anybody's guess. This is Matt. I think most of them will close by year-end. It's possible 1 or 2 might slip into January, but we would expect most of those proceeds to come in by the end of the year. Yes, this is Matt. I guess I can take that. I don't know, Tim, you may want to add some as well. Yes. It's really a combination of, I'd say, both bottom up in terms of did the deals still pencil in terms of the value creation and are we seeing an attractive cost basis as well as top down, just what are our other options for our capital availability, as Kevin was talking about. So we might start a deal or 2 this quarter. The deals that are more likely to start sooner are going to be the -- some of these suburban northeastern deals where even from my prepared remarks, you saw some of those lease-ups are actually beating their pro formas pretty significantly.\n So some of those locations are benefiting from some of the outmigration from some of the urban submarkets. And those are markets that just tend to be much lower beta in the first place. They tend to be less volatile in terms of rents. They haven't seen the same run-up in hard costs over the last 10 years or 5 years, certainly. So maybe there's a little bit less giveback on hard costs in some of those markets. So that's probably where we're more likely in the short term to start. We are still looking to grow in our expansion market, so that's another place that we don't have anything. We're going to start there in the next quarter. But at some point next year, we may have some deals to start there.\n And then the other piece of it is just what's going to happen with hard costs. And we have not seen hard costs come down. They've maybe flattened out in some of our markets. Lumber is still sky high, although it's starting to come down some. And whether the reaction to this downturn, if you go back 2 cycles ago, the recession there after the great financial crisis, hard costs did come down quite a bit. But prior cycles, it was more that they kind of flatlined for a while and inflation surpassed them. So they kind of fell on a real basis but not a nominal basis. And I don't know that -- we're still waiting to see how that plays out in each of our regional markets. Sure. This is Matt. I can give you an update. So as of today, we have 65 units that have closed. Again, there's 172 units total in the building. We closed 65, that's $207 million in sales price or about $3.2 million per unit. We also have 9 units under contract today, and we have another 7 contracts out for signature. So we have another 16 -- 15, 16 deals that are pending, many of which would close in the fourth quarter.\n I guess I would say the last couple of months, traffic has been pretty good. Interest has been pretty steady. We're running about 3 new deals a month, which would put us at probably the top or among the top 2 or 3 performing condo buildings in all of Manhattan. So there is a lot more supply than there was kind of when we opened the building for sales, but we're still continuing to get well more than our fair share. So I'd say the sales activity has been pretty steady since kind of the initial lockdowns were lifted in midsummer, and we're continuing to get pretty good traction. Rich, it's Matt. So those markets right now are doing better than most of our legacy markets. I think some of that's a function of their lower-cost markets, their markets where initially, anyway, there was less of a shutdown. So that's probably part of it. And the assets we have in those markets seem to be more suburban as well, at least that's definitely true of our Denver portfolio.\n So when we went into those markets, we said our goal was to get them to be about 5% each of our portfolio, which would be about $1.5 to $2 billion each. We're only -- not even quite halfway there yet. So we are looking to be aggressive there. We'll continue to look to be aggressive there. Over time, could that migrate up to more than 5%? I mean it could. But I think, again, like Tim was saying, to the extent what we're seeing is that the kind of COVID response is accelerating a lot of the trends that we saw pre-COVID, and those were the same trends that have led us to those markets in the first place. Yes, this is Matt. No, I mean I think as we were talking on one of the prior questions, we like those markets. We're looking to grow in those markets. Like I said, our objective is to get to about 5% in each. Some of that is driven by just the size of those markets relative to the size of ours. And as Tim mentioned, there may be additional markets that we add into the mix here at some point that would get that kind of total allocation to other markets like that above that 10% over time."

            "name": "Timothy Naughton",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Jason. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Sean, Matt and I will provide comments on the slides that we posted last night, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterward.\n Our comments will focus on providing a summary of Q3 results, an update on operations and some perspective on the transaction market and our financial position.\n Maybe just a few comments before turning to the deck. Several of the trends unique to this downturn and pandemic that we discussed last quarter played out in our performance in Q3. The appeal of urban living is, for the time being, diminished due to health concerns of living in dense environments; the shutdowns effect on retail, entertainment and cultural venues that have long been the draw for urban centers; and a civil unrest that occurred in many of our cities over the summer and early fall.\n Work from home flexibility has been extended through year-end by many, if not most employers, particularly those heavily weighted to knowledge-based jobs like many businesses in our coastal markets. We've experienced a significant reduction in student and corporate demand as remote learning modalities are being deployed at many urban universities and business travel has dropped off substantially. And finally, historically low interest rates are stimulating demand for existing and new home purchases, particularly for young age cohorts where homeownership rates have begun to climb.\n All these factors have resulted in an unprecedented reduction in apartment demand, particularly in urban centers, beyond what we typically experience in an economic downturn. And while we believe the reduction in demand is mostly temporary in nature, we also believe that it won't be restored until we substantially resolve the public health crisis from the pandemic. A meaningful recovery in our business will not occur until employers believe that they could safely bring their workers back to the workplace. Until then, business leaders are likely to err on the side of caution before reopening their workplaces, which is ultimately what will need to happen before many of their employees return to apartment living.\n I suppose if there's any silver lining in any of this, it's that our nation's struggle to respond effectively to this pandemic should ultimately lead to improvements in our response to future public health crises, much like we saw in the aftermath of 9/11 and the great financial crisis, when our national response led to building a more resilient system to address the threat of terrorism and financial market dislocation, respectively. We hope then that in the future, our nation and our cities will be better prepared to deal with the public health crisis in a more resilient and less disruptive way. But for now, we need to play the hand we've been dealt, and we'll endeavor to provide as much transparency and disclosure as to the actions that we're taking in response and their ultimate impact on the business.\n So with that, let's turn to results for the quarter, starting on Slide 4. Q3 certainly proved to be a challenging quarter. Core FFO growth was down by 12%, driven by same-store revenue decline of just over 6%. On a sequential basis, from Q2, same-store revenue was down 2.2% or about half the sequential decline we saw in Q2 as bad debt in Q3 leveled off relative to Q2 after the big increase we saw in Q2 during the early months of the pandemic.\n In terms of capital allocation for the year, through the end of Q3, we've raised $1.7 billion through new debt issuance and dispositions and repurchased about 140 million of shares. We started only one development so far this year, and that was through a joint venture and opportunity zone in the Arts District of L.A., where we own just 25% of the venture. Importantly, our liquidity, balance sheet and credit metrics remain in great shape as we manage through the current downturn.\n Turning to Slide 5. Like we saw in Q2, the decline in year-over-year same-store revenue in Q3 was primarily attributable to a loss of occupancy and uncollectible lease revenue or bad debt. These 2 factors drove about 80% of the drop in same-store revenue in Q3. Over the next 2 to 3 quarters, we expect to see continued declines in same-store revenue, but increasingly, the decline will be driven by pressure on rental rates as we saw effective rental rates fall by almost 6% this past quarter. These declines will have a more pronounced impact on revenue over the next few quarters as those leases begin to roll through the portfolio.\n And as Sean will share in his remarks, the decline in effective rental rates had been greatest in high cost in urban markets like San Francisco, New York and San Jose.\n And with that, I'll turn it over to Sean, who will discuss operations and portfolio performance in more detail. Sean? Well, thanks, Matt. Turning to the last slide, Slide 15. It was another challenging quarter, driven by the suddenness and continued strength of the pandemic. Weak same-store performance is being driven mostly by our urban portfolio as Sean mentioned. Particularly in the high cost markets of San Francisco and New York Suburban communities with larger units have performed much better. While pricing pressure continues to impact rental rates, occupancy has begun to modestly improve and stabilize in the 93% to 94% range. The transaction market, as Matt mentioned, has picked up dramatically after having been frozen earlier in the year. For those assets being taken to market, values are generally holding up at levels close to pre-COVID valuations.\n We continue to be cautious in deploying new capital, particularly for new development where economics are challenging and construction costs have not abated in any material way.\n And lastly, the balance sheet is very well positioned and is much stronger than prior downturns, which should give us plenty of financial flexibility to address the challenges posed by the current downturn.\n And so with that, Abby, we'd be -- we'd like to open the call for questions. No. Yes. Sean, maybe I'd just add to that a little bit. I think what we're seeing a little bit is what we would normally see in a downturn, which is sort of the housing market is dynamic and kind of resetting its level, if you will. So we've lost about 300 basis points stock. We'd say we've had to reach down a little bit, if you will, into the rental pool. And as part of that, you got to adjust pricing in order to sort of attract your sort of fair share, if you will, of the pool of renters.\n I think, ultimately, in terms of whether it stabilizes, it's just -- it's going to be a question, I think, of the macro environment, as Sean mentioned, but also just what's happening on the public health front. I mean as we said, it's really impacting urban centers, in particular, in a very unique way. To the extent we get a vaccine or a therapeutic that starts to give employers confidence enough to bring employees back into the workplace, they're going to start coming back into the -- into these urban centers in terms of their living arrangement, and that's going to create some net new demand for us and help stabilize it. To the extent this thinking needs to get protracted, the vaccines just don't get approved or don't appear to be as effective as we hope or don't have the penetration, then this will obviously continue to be a bit more protracted. But I think that could really help sort of stabilize, if not improve, the outlook for -- particularly for the urban centers. I think a lot of it is price driven, honestly. Rents have continued to come down sequentially, and we've gotten to the point at which we've been able to attract sort of our fair share of the market in the 93% to 94% range in terms of occupancy. So I think that's what's driving it initially. As to whether it stabilizes, I think it's a function of some of the things that Sean mentioned and I mentioned. Yes, Matt, I agree with all that. Maybe just to kind of step back a little bit in terms of volume. We were probably running at about $1.4 billion kind of mid-cycle last year. We'd already sort of downsized it to the $800 million, $900 million over the last 3 years or so, call it, '17 to '19. We could start anywhere between 0 and probably $1.5 billion next year, depending upon the factors that Matt mentioned, just the visibility around the rental market and construction markets and then certainly as it relates to the capital markets as well and other options that we might have with our capital, including repurchase of shares.\n So it's a mix of all those factors, and it's ultimately -- our views on those are going to kind of form ultimately how we -- how much capital we decide to deploy, somewhere between 0 and $1.5 billion. And so it's probably over the next 12 to 15 months. Economics. Yes. I'll try to speak to that. Again, you're breaking up a little bit. But in terms of -- long term, in terms of development, it's an important capability, and it's a distinguishing competitive advantage that we've had in the public markets. As markets stabilize and start to strengthen, we think the development will be economic again. And I think we've said many times in the past that we're relatively agnostic between urban and suburban. We're trying to go where we think fundamentals are the best at any point in time and where there's greater value.\n And having said that, for all the reasons we've been discussing, we pivoted -- we had already started pivoting maybe 3 or 4 years ago to suburban in part because there was just better value, and we've started to see the suburbs start to grow as the leading edge of millennials were approaching sort of the time of their lives where they're maybe buying homes or starting to move -- double back to the suburbs. So we're just seeing more economic activity. That's only been obviously exacerbated by the pandemic. So I suspect suburban demand would continue to outpace urban for a little bit.\n We did talk about sort of product mix on the last call. I do think there's -- particularly with the work-from-home flexibility that it is going to translate into some unit mix and program changes, an extra bedroom that can double as an office, providing dedicated workspaces within the units. Our survey data suggests that a majority of the residents still would prefer to work within their unit, but they're also -- about 20%, 25% are very interested in a co-working space as well. Pretty much everything we've touched, either redevelopment or new development over the last 2 or 3 years, has a significant co-working space. So the types of spaces are likely to continue to change, more sort of dedicated versus just kind of open table format but giving people an opportunity to either meet or have more sort of safer spaces or confined spaces. I think we expect we'll see that.\n So those are some of the changes we think are likely to come as a result of either the work-from-home flexibility that we think it's a real -- it was already a trend. It's only going to be greater kind of going forward. Our portfolio really needs to respond to that. I just said -- I mean -- and today, they're just -- they're not having to commute. So obviously, they've tried to take advantage of lowering their rent. I guess I would say we do expect them to come back when they're forced to come back to market. I mean you sort of have to just ask yourself the question, was your life sort of better before COVID or after COVID, and all the things that make urban living great sort of pre-COVID. Once we get on the other side of this, they're still going to be there. These are great mixed-use environments. Particularly the markets that we're in. They are dynamic environments. It's certainly more proximate to jobs. There's been a lot invested in infrastructure in these. It's environmentally more sustainable to people that care about that, I guess.\n But I think I'd say the one caveat is this work-from-home flexibility, I think, at the margin will cause some people to maybe stay in the suburbs. If they only have to commute, call it, 2 or 3 days a week versus 5 days a week. They may be able to tolerate that where they wouldn't 4 or 5. So I'd say kind of at the margin, you may not expect to see urban demand as robust as it was pre-COVID. But I think when you layer on the pricing changes that we've seen, there's going to be plenty of people coming back to the urban centers. I'm sorry. Did you say including the New York MSA? Pretty big deltas. Yes. Rich, I think it's a really interesting question. I would say even going back before sort of pre-COVID, there was already -- I mean we were already a believer sort of in the infill kind of urban-light, sort of mixed-use lifestyle environments. We think sort of post-COVID, that's still a great opportunity. Maybe it's even a stronger opportunity when you sort of add affordability in the mix, when you can maybe be in an infill suburb for a couple of bucks less a foot than being downtown and then you couple that with maybe decent transit and only have to hop in the train 2 or 3 days a week versus 5 days a week.\n So I think kind of that infill suburb is really extremely well positioned. I think it had been anyway. But like many things, as we've talked about COVID, it just seems to be accelerating kind of these trends that were already occurring before. But even as I mentioned on the last question, it doesn't make -- urban living is still very attractive. But when you layer into demographics, affordability and work-from-home flexibility, that does make -- that does change the calculus a little bit for that marginal renter. Yes. Rich, maybe just to add to that. I agree with Matt's -- what Matt was saying. I think we've said on prior calls, too. It might lead us to go into new markets as well that are likely to have some of the spillover benefit from -- whether it's New York or the California markets but also are kind of heavily indexed to knowledge-based jobs as big tech and knowledge-based industries continue to kind of diversify their workforces across the map. We want to be kind of where their workers are. And if there are going to be places like Denver and Southeast Florida, we think strategically, those are the places we need to be and our allocation is going to need to respond to that. Yes. Alex, I think sort of simple answer is too early to know, to be honest. I think as I mentioned on the prior call, we have actually cut back our development capacity over the last 2 or 3 years as we've gone from about $1.4 billion to about $800 million. I'd say the group is scaled to do around $1 billion -- $800 million to $1 billion a year. It can probably flex up or down a little bit from that, depending upon the needs.\n When you talk about expensing versus capitalizing, it starts to get into a lot of other things that are probably worth maybe another call. But if you look at the past downturn, we suspended development for 4 or 5 quarters typically. So again, if this is a downturn in length and it looks somewhat like those, I don't think we're talking about what -- I don't think there's a concern about the things you're talking about. To the extent we're looking at a downturn where it just doesn't make sense to start a new development for 3 years, we're going to have to rightsize the group or expense some of those costs. So -- but I think it's premature to kind of know kind of where that's likely to fall out. Yes. Alex, just to add, finally -- this is Tim, Alex. Maybe just to add, finally, in terms of G&A, as Kevin was mentioning, it's a pretty efficient business model. I mean you're talking about G&A costs are maybe 15 to 20 basis points of total asset value. If you compare that -- I mean, so as a business, it's pretty G&A efficient. I think compared to other business models, particularly on the private side, it's efficient again. So this is -- there aren't a lot of opportunities on the G&A side. Some of it is self-correcting through the incentive system, as Kevin mentioned. As performance weakens, incentives pay is less. But it's -- there's not a lot of extra bodies to look to. And G&A is -- it's 85%, 90% bodies, when you get down to it. Yes. I would say on the payroll side at the -- on the property level, that's where the opportunity is. Those are some of the activities that we think we can automate or centralize, get the benefit of some scale and the benefit of some automation as well where there could be real savings in terms of number of bodies. Not as clear on the overhead side, G&A side, when you may have a group of 2 people within a particular function that's working across a 300-unit -- a 300-community portfolio. So... And part of that is you're seeing, particularly younger age cohorts moving back home. So the number -- percentage of under 35 moving back home, particularly under 25 [ continues to hit ] sort of historical highs. So you get sort of normal consolidation you get with any downturn. Probably what we haven't seen yet is it doubling up. If anything, people are trying to get away from their roommates if they're both trying to work from home in the same space. So -- but we're definitely seeing people move back home and camping out in the basement or just where they have more room to [ fill out work ]. We mentioned earlier sort of the parents' homes are more fully occupied, self-storage is more fully occupied, and apartments are a little less occupied. So that seems to be part of some of the trends that we're seeing. Thank you, Abby. I know everyone's busy, a lot of calls today. But thanks, again, for joining, and we'll see you in the virtual world, I suppose, maybe at NAREIT in November. Take care."

            "name": "Kevin O'Shea",
            "content": "Well, yes, Nick, this is Kevin. Maybe I'll begin with the share repurchase. There's obviously a lot of number of uses that we fund with asset sale proceeds as we always do, including development spend under way. But in terms of the share buyback, as you saw, we were active in that program in the second quarter. Really, the fundamental thesis behind the share repurchase program hasn't changed. We expect to be active on it in the third quarter. We believe there's an attractive opportunity to take advantage of the disconnect between private and public market values for investors like ourselves who can see things through to the other side of the pandemic. We have the balance sheet strength and liquidity to pursue a modest share buyback that's executed in a measured way, which we believe we did in the second quarter and we intend to do so going forward, and one that's funded with primarily with asset sales and sized and managed in a manner that preserves our strong credit profile.\n So all those things were true last quarter. They remain true this quarter. And so looking ahead, we would continue to plan on a measured buyback, funded primarily with asset sales with an eye on preserving our financial strength and flexibility. So we have plenty of capacity to sell assets over time and don't feel -- we don't believe that's going to be a constraint for us.\n I don't know, Tim, if you want to add anything. Well, I mean maybe just to put some context, Alex, this is Kevin, I think we experienced year-over-year NOI decline $38 million, $39 million this past quarter. If you add the quarterly property management costs, overhead costs and G&A, they're about that number. So proportionately, our overhead costs represent a small part of the puzzle. And in terms of how we -- relative to the overall business and the revenue structure and so forth. So it's not a particularly acute issue, I would submit. In terms of how we can manage it, we manage it throughout the cycles. There are potentially some opportunities -- one of the biggest opportunities simply is just a fair bit of overhead costs or incentive costs, and those are going to naturally correct here this year. So there's a little bit of a self-correcting piece. And then in terms of kind of property management overhead, Sean, did you want to add something?"

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Tim. Turning to Slide 6. We experienced a year-over-year increase in prospect visits to our communities each month of the quarter. In total, visit volume was up about 20% year-over-year during Q3, which led to a roughly 10% increase in net lease volume. As you can see from Chart 2 on Slide 6, the most significant increase in net lease volume occurred in September, which is up about 35% year-over-year. And as of yesterday, traffic and leasing volume for October was up roughly 25% and 20%, respectively.\n Moving to Slide 7. For the first time in more than 4 years, resident notices to vacate our communities increased by a meaningful amount on a year-over-year basis. During Q3, notices increased by roughly 17%, primarily as a result of the spike in lease terminations in urban submarkets, which is depicted by the hash bars on Chart 1 on Slide 7 and a topic I'll touch on in a minute.\n Our leasing volume exceeded the pace of notices, however, starting in August and has continued through October. As a result, if you turn to Slide 8, you can see that beginning in September, move-ins exceeded move-outs and physical occupancy has increased from the low point at 93.1% in September to 93.5% for October and stands at 93.9% today.\n Moving to Slide 9. Our suburban portfolio continues to perform substantially better than our urban assets. Charts 1 and 2 at the top of Slide 9 reflect notices to vacate our communities and lease terminations by submarket type. Notices to vacate our urban communities increased by roughly 40% during the quarter, driven by an approximately 70% increase in lease terminations, and led to a 340 basis point decline in physical occupancy from Q2 to 90.2% and double-digit decline in rent change. For our suburban portfolio, the increase in notices to vacate was more modest, supporting better physical occupancy and rent change.\n The performance of our urban portfolio has been impacted by a variety of factors, including those mentioned by Tim in his prepared remarks. I'd highlight the combination of extended work-from-home policies and the civil unrest that occurred during the summer months, which impacted the quality of urban environments, is key factors driving residents to break leases during Q3 and leave urban centers for housing options and other geographies.\n Shifting to Slide 10 to address regional performance. Increased turnover in Northern California, the Mid-Atlantic and New York/New Jersey impacted physical occupancy more than in other regions. In the New York/New Jersey region, the increase in turnover was primarily a function of elevated turnover in New York City, which is 87% on an annualized basis during the quarter. For the Mid-Atlantic, we experienced increased turnover in the District of Columbia and other urban or quasi-urban submarkets like the Rosslyn, Ballston and Tysons Corner submarkets in Northern Virginia.\n In Northern California, annualized turnover during Q3 was 85%, driven by elevated turnover across all 3 markets, San Francisco, San Jose and the East Bay, but was most pronounced in San Francisco and in Mountain View where Google is headquartered.\n On a positive note, turnover was relatively flat in New England, which is a testament to our primarily suburban Boston portfolio and was down in both Pacific Northwest and Southern California. Physical occupancy in all 3 regions exceeded the portfolio average.\n And moving lastly to Slide 11. Same-store like-term lease rent change was down 3.3%, and effective rent change was down 5.8%. Metro New York/New Jersey and Northern California are 2 of the regions I identified on the last slide with elevated turnover and, therefore, available inventory to lease produced the weakest rent change during the quarter. Rent change in New England held up the best, again, supported by our suburban Boston portfolio, which, in many cases, offers differentiated products, including larger unit sizes to those departing urban environments.\n So with that, I'll turn it over to Matt to address our development portfolio. Yes. Rich, this is Sean. A very good question. And we do track that just based on forwarding addresses. I'd say there's probably 2 or 3 things I'd highlight as it relates to -- when you look at the data, what sort of stands out, and really, I'd say 3 points. First is we classify the big move for a resident is that they're moving more than 150 miles somewhere. And in that category, New York City, this percentage of move-outs, Q3 of '19, that was about 17% of the population, that increased to about 30% of the population in Q3. In San Francisco, Q3 last year was about 23%. It moved up to about 27% this year. And then the 2 other categories I'd highlight, a regional move, which we define as between 50 and 150 miles away from your departing location. In New York City, that moved from 6% of move-outs up to about 20% and in San Francisco from 7% to 10%.\n And then probably the last one I'd highlight is what we consider a market move, which is between -- greater than 10 but less than 50 miles. And the one that really stood out as a meaningful increase was Boston, primarily urban Boston, where it increased from basically 10% to 20%, so about double.\n One thing you have to keep in mind in some of these things where a local move is obviously less than 10 miles that didn't go through it, but 10 miles can be -- when you think about some of these urban environments, 10 miles does feel like a long way. So someone leaving San Francisco, 10 miles could be going down into the peninsula or places like that. But in terms of sort of the larger move, that's the data that stood out in Q3. Yes. Alua, your questions broke up a little bit in terms of residents departing San Francisco, I think you said, and whether we're seeing that accelerate or decelerate? Was that the first part of your question? Yes. I mean as you can see on the chart regarding the move-in/move-outs that we posted up there, we're starting to see volume ease as we move into the fourth quarter in October specifically. That is relatively typical in terms of seasonal patterns. But in terms of whether that's sustainable or not, it will depend on a lot of different factors and many of which Tim mentioned in his prepared remarks, so it's probably too early to conclude that it's a definitive downtrend, other than seasonally, that would normally be the case.\n And then I think the second part of your question was around transfers and whether we help facilitate that for residents, and we do. And as it relates to transfer activity, transfers were up about roughly 1/3 year-over-year. So we are seeing increased activity both within the same community and to another community that might within -- be within a reasonable distance of the community they're departing. So definitely an increase in activity there, but it's not a meaningful percentage of total move-outs, if you want to think about it that way. Yes. And a good question. We're exploring a lot of different things that we've done a fair bit as it relates to some people who are looking for, in this environment, a short-term stay in a different geography. It may not just be in the urban environment. It could be a suburban environment where they have left the urban environment, but they are not sure when they may have to return to work in that urban environment. And therefore, they'd like to rent a furnished apartment in a suburban location that's not their sort of normal home location. So we're doing a little bit of that.\n And then certainly, as it relates to amenities, we're trying to facilitate food delivery and things of that sort as best we can, given the -- obviously, the constraints to the building from a physical standpoint, trying to facilitate as best we can. So for that, our customers that are home in urban environment, trying to make sure that they have access to the amenities that they would normally enjoy just in a different way. Yes. Rich, good question. A few thoughts, and then others can join in. I mean I'd say, obviously, recent trends, particularly September and October, were favorable in terms of demand absorbing some of the inventory we had. Obviously, we had more available inventory given the turnover and the lease breaks that I mentioned, particularly in the urban environments, which did put some additional pressure on pricing. But it really is sort of a macro question as it relates to, particularly in the urban environment, people coming back into this environment because they feel comfortable about it. They need to go to school. They have to be back in the office. All those macro factors really drive that ultimate decision as to whether to return to that environment, and price is more just what am I going to choose within that environment. And as long as you're competitive, you should get your fair share of the market overall. But I think the macro factors are really the things that will tilt it to either kind of stabilize and be more positive going forward or deteriorate. Those are really the key drivers here, and I think that's yet to be told that full story until we move into it a little bit further here towards year-end. Yes. John, you broke out a little bit. You said occupancy in Northern California in October? Yes. I think it's physical occupancy. Yes, physical occupancy, I can tell you. Sorry, say it again. Yes. So in Northern California overall, I believe we're running today -- I believe, today, running around 92%, which is pulled down by the -- really the lower occupancy that we're experiencing in the 90%, 91% range in San Francisco and pockets of San Jose. How we define San Jose, which is primarily Mountain View and Central San Jose pulling down those numbers. So those are the 2 areas where physical occupancy is weakest, I would say. And then as it relates to Washington, DC, the district itself, occupancy, I believe, is around 91% today, physical again. I'd say based on recent trends, I would say they stabilized a little bit in terms of occupancy and have started to trend up, consistent with the same-store portfolio pattern that I described earlier in my prepared remarks. How quickly they come back is just a function of the velocity that we see in terms of notices, which is primarily a function of lease breaks recently, and then on the demand side in terms of the velocity of leasing that comes through. But as I look forward over the next 6 weeks or so based on availability and such, I would expect both of those to drift up some. We can't hear you, if you could try to speak up a little bit. Juan, is that you? I can't -- we can't hear you -- or Nick. Yes. Juan, this is Sean. Yes, fair point. As I noted in my prepared remarks, obviously, we had additional inventory become available as a result of the increase in turnover that occurred during this quarter, particularly in July and August, in those urban environments, as I mentioned. And you can see that, I think it was on the second slide where we showed notice to vacate and lease breaks. And obviously, that put additional pressure on pricing. So that -- for example in -- kind of on all leases signed in the third quarter. If you look at July and August, as an example, in urban environments across all leases, the average concession was between half a month to 3/4 of a month. As we moved into September and then in October, getting beyond Q3, that increased to about a month on all leases signed. \n So certainly, price response, as it relates to the additional availability that came through. Could we have leased some of that faster? Probably, yes, if we had been even substantially more aggressive as it relates to price. But when you have that kind of inventory delivered to you quickly because there are lease breaks as opposed to having 30 to 60 days advance notice, you would have had to discount that price pretty heavily to try and absorb the incremental inventory that we receive much more quickly. So our strategy was to absorb the inventory at a reasonable pace but not put out a fire sale, so to speak, to absorb it very, very fast, if that makes sense. Yes. I mean, good question. I'm happy to comment on that and others can jump in. But if you think about the markets we're talking about, New York City, as an example, think about the rent levels in New York City as opposed to kind of moving into the Westchester, Long Island or Northern and Central Jersey, it's a pretty big trade. Even though rents have come down quite a bit in New York City, it's still a big trade. So I think it's really more a function of the macro factors that we were talking about earlier in terms of people's either desire or need to be in those urban environments as it relates to either being in the office because they're required to be in the office, they need to be in the office, returning to school at some of these urban universities or just feeling comfortable in those environments that we've moved into a place where they feel better about retail establishments, restaurants, et cetera, and part of that will be driven by the health care situation and whether that crisis is resolved in a meaningful way. So I think those are the bigger issues as opposed to just purely price. Yes. Those rent spreads are pretty big between the pockets of the East Bay or even moving down into the peninsula or lower peninsula as compared to being in the city of San Francisco. It's a pretty big spread. I mean I think it really is more around the quality of the lifestyle and the reasons you want to be in the urban environment, I mentioned, just not necessarily being able to stay and you don't have to be in the office. Yes. Austin, this is Sean. Good question. In terms of walking you through the rent change in the quarter, basically, we move from sort of mid-3s up to mid-8s in terms of the reduction in rent change as you move through each month of the quarter. And then October, right now on a blended basis, is down about 10%. And in terms of the broader question as it relates to stabilization, I mean the only thing I'd say is that, particularly in the suburban environment, concessions have kind of leveled off in the past couple of months here. We've had good volume. So we haven't necessarily had to kind of dig deeper into the concession bag to generate that velocity. And I'd say we're reasonably comfortable with the velocity we're seeing today, which is what I expressed in my prepared remarks that you saw on the slide. \n So to the extent that we continue to see good velocity in pricing, we wouldn't have to dig deeper into that concession bag to the extent things fell off then we'd have to reevaluate. But based on where we think we're priced today, we feel like we're in pretty good shape. And again, I'd say on the suburban side, [ I think it ] is a little bit better than urban. So I'd say it will take a little while longer here to see how it plays out in these urban environments, if that's going to be the right kind of pricing level to continue to attract demand at the pace that we need it. Yes. Alex, it's Sean. One thing, I think, that's fair to address is we were already on a path to create more operating efficiencies throughout the portfolio based on some of the things we talked about. I think it was one of the calls last year as it relates to automation, digitalization, various things like that, the great use of data, centralizing different things, whether it's leasing, renewals and such. And we're still on that path. And if anything, I would say it's accelerated certainly as a result of what happened through the pandemic as it relates to the operating model. And we were talking about somewhere in the order of magnitude of approaching $20 million to $30 million of operational savings through those various initiatives. And we're still plowing forward on that. And probably, we'll be investing more in some of those technology initiatives over the next couple of years to help offset what we're seeing at least at the property level P&L. Yes. Zach, good question. We haven't really changed our credit standards other than to be probably even more diligent as it relates to detecting fraud. Particularly in certain markets, I would say, like L.A. tends to be one that comes to mind. But we've not relaxed our credit standards as it relates to it, and we are still qualifying people in diligent manner so that as we look to the other side of this, lease rents aren't changing materially, that we can really have customers that can afford renewal rent increases as you move into -- pick a time frame that you're comfortable with, late 2021 or whatever it may be. So is there risk? There's always risk. But we definitely have not relaxed the standards. If anything, they are a little more stringent as it relates to the fraud detection. Yes. We've done a lot as it relates to kind of promoting a healthy environment. If you look at our operating expense table, we've noted that we've spent a couple of million bucks already this year as it relates to PPE and then beyond that for cleaning and disinfectants and various other things. We have a reservation system where people have to reserve amenity time within a gym or a chill space, whatever it may be. And so we're doing a fair bit to promote healthy environment.\n And for the most part, I think we're getting very good feedback through our Net Promoter Score comments around people appreciating our efforts. There's certainly some frustration that they can't just walk into the gym whenever they want. But it's very understanding as it relates to the need for a professional protocol to limit any impact at the community. And so far, knock on wood, we've been relatively lucky in terms of what we've seen at the community. So we feel good about what we're doing and continue to look for ways to promote that healthy environment. Yes. Good question. I mean on the suburban side, you did peg it right, rents are down, call it, roughly 3% or so. I would say it's a variety of factors, really depending on the market. I'll give you a couple of examples. So we would consider various pockets of San Jose, as an example, including Mountain View, Central San Jose to some degree [indiscernible] Northeast San Jose at suburban. But I can tell you just based on the current protocol for companies like Apple and Google and others, there is not a need for those residents to be in that location. As a result, we've seen pressure from turnover in some of those pockets where the demand has just fallen off, obviously, not as much as what we've experienced in San Francisco. But because of those policies, there's pressure on demand there. And some of those pockets, particularly Central San Jose, Mountain View and a little bit in Northeast San Jose, there is supply. \n So we're seeing a compression there in terms of what's [indiscernible] at the higher end of the price pyramid coming down to compete with other assets in the existing inventory of sort of A minus to B-type assets, which are representative of what we have in those markets. So that's the kind of pressure you see in that type of environment. That's similar to what you might see in certain pockets in Seattle, like in Redmond.\n And then there's other pockets in the Northeast, say, Boston is holding up relatively well. Long Island is holding up relatively well, but you still do have -- we are in the midst of a recession, and people are making different choices to some degree as it relates to a living environment. Some people are moving into those environments from densely populated urban environments, but others are making different decisions as it relates to staying there or moving elsewhere. So demand overall, we're seeing just household contraction. So that will impact suburban environment, just not nearly as much as what we've seen in urban environments. So that's kind of the macro view. And Tim, do you want... Yes. No, that's a fair point. I mean if you look at sort of occupancy and related lease breaks, there's definitely more pressure in the studio floor plans. Urban environment studios during Q3, I think, the average occupancy was 87%, 88%, as an example. So people less -- more flexible moving home to mom and dad, for sure."

Your host for today's conference is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Matt, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There's a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?\nTimothy Naughton: Thanks, Jason, and welcome to the Q2 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Sean, Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. Our comments will focus on providing a summary of Q2 results, an update on operations and some perspective on development in the balance sheet now that we've entered an economic recession. But before getting started on the deck, I thought I would offer a few general comments about the environment we are currently facing. To say things have changed over the last 4 months is certainly an understatement. We are in the middle of the largest global health care crisis in a century. The economic downturn is the most severe we've seen since the Great Depression and on the heels of the longest expansion on record. And social unrest is at a level we haven't experienced since Vietnam and the civil rights movement over 50 years ago. It's been said, but these are indeed unprecedented times. And these events aren't just having an unprecedented impact on economic activity but also on income and wealth distribution across industries in the broader population. For those companies and workers leveraged to the virtual economy, they're actually doing quite well, and some are even thriving. For those companies and workers that operate in the real economy of bricks-and-mortar like AVB, we're certainly feeling the normal effects and then some of the downturn. And then for those companies and workers in the travel, leisure and entertainment sectors, among others, they are basically in shutdown mode. These sectors as well as others will undoubtedly need to be restructured over the next few years. Many companies will not survive, and their employees, if evenly temporarily furloughed for now, will join the ranks of the permanently unemployed over the next several quarters. And unfortunately, those impacted by these events or most impacted by these events are those in lower-paying service jobs and minority populations. As a result, this downturn carries not just the normal economic risk of prior recessions but also profound health, social and political risk that are likely to shape the length and shape -- shape the length and of the economic recovery. So while this was a sudden and quick downturn, the timing and shape of the recovery is hard to project. And that presents a unique challenge in managing our business and communicating our expectations to you, our shareholders. Having said that, we'll do our best to be as transparent and direct as possible as we all try to understand and engage how the current environment will play out in our business in the months and quarters ahead. Right now, let's turn to the results for the quarter, starting in -- on Slide 4. As expected, Q2 was a challenging quarter. Core FFO growth was down almost 2% driven by a same-store revenue decline of almost 3%, or 2.2% if retail is excluded. And on a sequential basis, from Q1, same-store revenue was down 4.5%, or 3.9% excluding retail. We had no development completions or new development starts this quarter. And we've had no starts so far year-to-date. And lastly, we raised over $700 million in capital this quarter at an average initial cost of 2.8%, with most of that coming from a $600 million long 10-year bond deal at a rate of around 2.5%. As Kevin will share in his remarks, our liquidity, balance sheet and credit metrics are very well positioned heading into this downturn. Turning to Slide 5. I wanted to drill down a bit more on the decline in same-store residential revenues this past quarter. As this slide demonstrates, the decline was primarily attributable to a loss of occupancy and uncollectible lease revenue or bad debt. Economic occupancy was down 120 basis points, while bad debt was 200 bps higher than normal. Higher-than-normal bad debt is likely to continue, given the breadth and depth of the downturn, coupled with eviction moratorium in many of the markets in which we operate. We also experienced higher concessions in the quarter and lower other income as we waived various fees this past quarter for our residents, including late payments, common area amenity and credit card convenience fees. Average lease rate for our same-store portfolio in Q2 was actually up 1.8% over Q2 of 2019, reflecting embedded rent growth on leases entered into in 2019 through Q1 of this year. Turning to Slide 6. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, this downturn poses a unique risk relative to other recessions. In addition to the household contraction and consolidation that occurs due to job losses in any downturn, the pandemic is driving other trends that are impacting rental demand. These include work-from-home flexibility that is shifting some renter demand from higher cost and urban/infill markets. Many renters are relocating, perhaps only temporarily, to lower-cost markets or submarkets, leisure areas or even back home with their parents. Second, record-low mortgage rates and the desire for space is accelerating demand for single-family homes. Many homebuilders reported strong orders in sales this past quarter, particularly towards the back half of the quarter. And homeownership rate is on the rise. And lastly, we're seeing reduced demand from 2 important segments of renters, corporate and students, as most temporary corporate assignments have been canceled, while higher education is adopting remote learning models and limiting on-campus activities for the fall. These factors will likely weigh on performance until the public health crisis has abated. On the other hand, they will also likely contribute to a more robust recovery once employees begin to return to the workplace. With that, I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss operations and portfolio performance in more detail. Sean?\nSean Breslin: All right. Thanks, Tim. Turning to Slide 7. The factors Tim highlighted on the previous slide impacted leasing volume throughout the quarter, which is down roughly 10% year-over-year. Turnover for the quarter fell about 5%. So the volume of resident notices to leave our communities exceeded leasing velocity, most materially in May when we experienced about a 25% increase in lease breaks for a variety of reasons, including corporate apartment operators shutting down operations in certain markets. As a result, move-outs exceeded move-ins for the quarter. As of yesterday, net lease volume for July is roughly on pace with the volume of notices to vacate our communities, which should help stabilize occupancy as we move into August. Moving to Slide 8. We experienced a 120 basis point decline in physical occupancy from April to June, with most of it occurring in May as a result of the lease break volume I mentioned a few moments ago. Chart 2 on Slide 8 depicts both lease and effective rent change for the quarter. As detailed in our earnings release, blended lease rent change was down 40 basis points in Q2, while effective rent change was down 3.1%. Rent change for July has improved slightly from June, but the nature of the health crisis and economic environment will dictate the ongoing demand for rental housing and our pricing power as we move through the balance of the year. Turning to Slide 9. You can see the regional distribution of both lease and effective rent change for Q2. Northern and Southern California were the most challenging regions for a variety of reasons, while the Pacific Northwest performed the best. Moving to Slide 10 to look at performance metrics by submarket type. Urban submarkets deteriorated more materially during Q2 as compared to suburban submarkets. From an occupancy standpoint, urban submarkets declined by 270 basis points from April to June, while suburban submarkets fell by only 50 basis points. And from a rent change perspective, urban submarkets trailed suburban by roughly 200 basis points. While the weakness in urban environments is pretty broad-based across our portfolio, it's most pronounced in San Francisco, Boston and parts of L.A. Unfortunately, demand in urban submarkets is suffering from a variety of factors, several of which Tim mentioned in his prepared remarks, including a desire for more affordable price points, extended work-from-home policies across corporate America, a lack of short-term and corporate demand, uncertainty regarding on-campus learning at urban universities and a general concern about population density. Shifting to Slide 11 to discuss our development portfolio. Construction delays at the beginning of the pandemic weighed on both deliveries and occupancies during the second quarter. As noted in Chart 1 on Slide 12, deliveries and occupancies for the first half of the year fell short of our expectations by roughly 450 and 650 units, respectively, which translated into an NOI shortfall of approximately $2 million. Fortunately, following some initial shutdowns at about 1/3 of our construction sites for a short period of time, all of our jobs are currently under way, albeit with a slower pace of deliveries expected across certain assets. I will now turn it over to Kevin to further address development starts, funding and the balance sheet. Kevin?\nKevin O'Shea: Thanks, Sean. Turning to Slide 12. In response to the current environment, we have chosen not to start any new construction projects so far this year despite having initially guided in the beginning of the year to about $900 million in new construction starts for 2020. Looking ahead, we expect lower construction costs will benefit many of our future planned starts. And we are prepared to wait for this expected correction on hard costs before breaking ground so that we can lock in a lower basis on these investments. Although real-time construction cost data are difficult to come by, initial indications suggest we are beginning to see a softer labor market and a reduction in overall construction activity makes their way into subcontractor pricing. As for development that is currently under construction, as you can see on Slide 13, we are in a remarkably strong position from a financial point of view. Development under construction is already 95% match funded with long-term capital, which not only mitigates the financial risk of development, but also means that we have locked in the investment spread profit on these developments by having matched the long-term expected returns on the projects with equity and debt price when we were starting these projects. Finally, as shown on Slide 14, we continue to enjoy an exceptionally strong financial position today. This is particularly evident when comparing our key credit metrics today to those from the fourth quarter of 2008 when we entered the last recession. Specifically, since late 2008, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has improved to 4.9x from 6.5x. Our interest coverage ratio has increased to 6.9x from 4.5x. Our unencumbered NOI percentage has increased to 94% from 77%. And our credit rating has improved to A3, A- from Baa1 to BBB+. This strong balance sheet position provides us with great flexibility to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may emerge as this downturn unfolds. And with that, I will turn it back to Tim.\nTimothy Naughton: All right. Thanks, Kevin. Just turning to the last slide and offering a few summary comments. Q2 was a challenging quarter driven by the suddenness of the pandemic and the depth of the downturn. So far, the impact on same-store performance has been driven by lower occupancy and elevated bad debt. Contributions from NOI and new development lease-ups were less than expected due to construction delays and weaker absorption. We have curtailed new developments dramatically and have not started any new communities so far this year. Despite the strength in the for-sale market, we do expect construction costs to fall over the next few quarters. And we'll incorporate that into our capital allocation plans. And then lastly, the balance sheet is very well positioned in both an absolute since -- and relative to prior downturns, which as Kevin said, just gives us plenty of financial flexibility to address challenges or opportunities as they arise. And so with that, Matt, we'll open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNicholas Joseph: Appreciate the color and the rationale behind pausing new starts. Just curious how long do you think the delay will be until you actually start to do projects again. And then what signals are you looking at before actually making that decision to proceed?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Hey, Nick. This is Matt. Yes. I mean it is -- we have deals that could start. And we are -- we do have a fairly high degree of conviction that hard costs should start to correct here. So that's -- the main thing we're looking at is kind of where our hard cost is trending, what the subcontractor bid coverage look like. There may be one deal that we would start here that's kind of got some exceptional circumstances that's actually in an opportunity zone. And we're looking at starting with some third-party joint venture capital, which is, as you know, is very unusual for us. But for -- kind of for wholly owned balance-sheet-funded starts, that's really what we're watching. It's kind of interplay between potential reduction in hard costs and, frankly, reductions in NOIs on the other side and kind of looking at what the total basis looks like, what costs look like relative to their long-term trend line and what rents and NOIs look like relative to their long-term trend line as well.\nTimothy Naughton: Yes, Nick. It's hard to know exactly. If you looked at last cycle, we've lost about 4 or 5 quarters. Part of my introductory comments around what this economic downturn might look like, it's maybe different from others that we've seen where others may have been sort of -- maybe drifted a bit more into the recession. This was quite sudden. And others were maybe in a quicker bounce back. We think this could be a more drawn-out bounce back and likely to be more and more -- you've heard certainly the Nike Swoosh with more people -- more and more, you're hearing sort of the K-shaped recovery, where it's going to be very uneven depending upon even demographic and the population. So just given the public health and economic aspect of this one, it's hard to know for sure. But as we showed on that one slide, we're just starting to see construction costs correcting. Last cycle, they correct on the order of 15%, maybe a little bit more. And it's -- we're probably going to need to see the kind of double-digit corrections before we start to have a little bit more faith that we're buying deals out of the basis that we'll look good sort of next cycle.\nNicholas Joseph: I think you announced the $500 million share repurchase program. How do you think about actually executing on that? And where does it currently stack up in terms of the use of proceeds maybe relative to development or any other kind of acquisitions or redevelopment, kind of other options that you have for that capital?\nKevin O'Shea: Yes. Hey, Nick. This is Kevin. I'll jump in here, and Tim may want to add a couple of comments. And you're right, as we -- as you saw in the earnings release, we did announce a share repurchase program of $500 million. And really, the genesis behind that is we believe our stock is, as you alluded to, trading at a compelling value, both absolutely and relative to our other investments, including development. And because we have the balance sheet strength and liquidity to pursue a program, we intend to do so. Though as we indicated in our earnings release, we're likely to fund that on a long-term basis with asset sales and potentially some incremental debt, but we do intend to proceed. And probably we'll do so initially on a measured basis until we have clarity on those sources. But I think at this point, that's probably our most attractive investment that we have today.\nTimothy Naughton: Yes -- no. I -- maybe to just add a little bit, Kevin, I agree. I think you had 2 things working. It's the best -- it's the most attractive investment, and you've got the disparity between what equity's costing and what -- certainly what debt's costing as being supported artificially by the Fed right now as we know. And our belief is while there's not a lot of visibility on asset pricing, we're -- we feel pretty strongly that asset prices haven't corrected near what equity prices have corrected. We've seen in the order of 30% on the equity, and probably -- we think probably less than 10% on asset sales. So that informs our conviction as well in terms of what the alternatives are in terms of capital sources.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rich Hightower with Evercore.\nRichard Hightower: So I'm on the second chart on Page 8, just on the blended like-term rent change chart. And just help us understand some of the details there across new and renewals and what you're seeing currently, urban and suburban and maybe some of the weaker markets you mentioned, Boston, San Fran and L.A. Just help us understand some of the -- what goes into the mix there.\nSean Breslin: Yes, Rich. It's Sean. Happy to walk you through it a little bit. I mean as we noted on an effective basis, blended rent change was down about 3% for the quarter. If you look at it on a lease basis, it was down only about 40 basis points. And certainly, based on what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing the greatest weakness in Northern and Southern California. And if you double-click through those regions, probably the softest spots are San Francisco and throughout L.A., particularly in some of the entertainment-oriented economies around L.A., so think about Hollywood, West Hollywood, Burbank, San Fernando Valley, et cetera. And then the other markets, we're basically anywhere from sort of 0 to minus 2%. And across the other markets, the softest spots are probably in New York City and throughout the urban submarkets within Boston. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, generally, across the portfolio, what we're seeing in the urban submarkets is rent change is trailing suburban by about a couple of hundred basis points. And as you probably noted in the chart, our economic occupancy and physical occupancy are both trailing what we're seeing in the suburban submarkets as well. So certainly, a tougher place to be as it relates to both rent change and occupancy in those environments. And as it relates to kind of where things are today, if you look at it in the context of July, effective rent change is down about 3.5%, a little bit better than June. And lease rent change is down about 2%. And in both cases, renewals do remain positive right now, sort of in the 50 to 70 basis point range, slightly lower than what we experienced in Q2 but still positive in July at this point.\nRichard Hightower: Okay. Sean, that's helpful. And then just thinking maybe a little more broadly, in some of the bullets highlighted in the prepared comments about the work-from-home shift and the fact that suburban is outperforming urban. And I would also assume, with respect to home purchases, I mean, given the price points in Avalon's markets, maybe you're a little more insulated from that effect than the average apartment landlord out there. So at what point does that sort of mix start to help Avalon in the sense of having a highly concentrated suburban portfolio? When do you think we'll really see that show up in the numbers there as a net positive, you think?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Rich. It's Sean. I can provide a couple of comments, and then Tim can chime in. I mean it's really a function of how some of those factors evolve over the next few months here. I mean urban submarkets, we've mentioned several of the factors that are sort of driving it. So I think what I mentioned in my prepared remarks is sort of the nature of the health crisis, and the economic environment will dictate when people start to come back to the urban submarkets and at least some in a more material way. And on the suburban side, it's really a function of sort of portfolio mix. And in some places, it certainly is very helpful. There are some submarkets where, even though it's suburban, it's a little bit painful right now. I'll pick one specifically, like Mountain View in Northern California, where Alphabet is headquartered. Given their extended work-from-home policies, it tends to be a weaker submarket even though it's technically considered suburban. So I'm not sure there's a one-size-fits-all answer here as it relates to that. At least, that's my general thoughts at this point in time. But Tim, do you have anything you want to add?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. I just -- maybe just -- I've mentioned suburban had been outperforming urban before -- prior to the pandemic. And we had been seeing a trend, both on the demand [Technical Difficulty] next year, urban supply to outpace suburban by a fair amount in our markets, but also on the demand side, which, last cycle, supply and demand was stronger in the urban submarkets. This cycle, it's probably going to be the opposite, where both -- when you get beyond sort of '21, '22, where you're likely to see stronger demand in some of the suburban submarkets and more supply. And that's partly because millennials are coming of age, there's more economic activity starting to occur in the suburbs, and part of it's affordability. So as you see more economic activity, that ought to drive more rental -- renter demand in the suburbs as well. But -- and we already started to see that trend a little bit before the pandemic, but it's just a longer secular trend that we expect that will continue over the next few years.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.\nJohn Pawlowski: Sean, I want to go back to your comment about you see signs of stability in at least occupancy heading into August. Does that comment hold for the current pockets of weakness that you alluded to, L.A., Boston, San Fran?\nSean Breslin: In the short run, John, yes. And we are starting to see some student demand come back in some of these urban submarkets based on announcements that have been made to date as it relates to the hybrid learning environments, both on-campus and distance learning, and just anecdotally, getting a lot of feedback from some of the student population that they had enough time at home. And even if they only could be on campus a couple of days a week, they want their apartment back. So whether that holds or not, obviously, it's a function of the health crisis and the decisions that are made across the university systems. But in general, I would say we are seeing it relatively sort of stabilize a little bit. That being said, between now and year-end, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the health crisis and the economic environment will dictate whether things kind of shift up or down in terms of demand as we move forward here.\nJohn Pawlowski: Makes sense. And then the 200 basis point drag from bad debt in the quarter on the residential portfolio with the opening remarks or something to that effect that it remains elevated. Is that a reasonable betting line just the trajectory over these coming months? Or will it get meaningfully worse or meaningfully better? I guess I don't understand -- I don't know how to completely think through markets like in L.A., where this eviction moratorium keeps getting kicked down the road. So just curious, comments around the trajectory of bad debt from here will be helpful.\nSean Breslin: Yes, John. I'm happy to comment, and then Kevin or Tim can chime in as well. I mean at this point in time, it's obviously difficult to predict, given the nature of -- we already have mentioned the health crisis, the macroeconomic environment. Obviously, there have been federal support for people to date in terms of being able to sort of subsidize their incomes, which I think came through this morning in terms of personal income growth. So I think assuming it's a relatively static environment through year-end, you probably expect those sort of collection rates to hold within reason. But to the extent there is significant shift in any one of those variables in a meaningful way, obviously, that could pick it up or down as a result. But I think those are the primary variables we will all be monitoring to try and determine whether we think it's going to tick up and/or down. So...\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeffrey Spector: I just want to go back to some of the big-picture comments, Tim, that you've discussed so far, including some of the comments during the Q&A. And I very much appreciate how difficult it is to figure out the medium to long term. As you're thinking, again your comments about the lower-cost options elsewhere, Southeast, increasing homeownership, I mean can you talk a little bit more how this is impacting, let's say, Avalon's medium- to long-term strategic plans, whether that includes new markets? I guess can you share some thoughts on that?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. Sure, Jeff. I think we've spoken to this in the past. As many have said, I mean, I think the pandemic is -- they're -- these trends aren't necessarily new. They're -- a lot of them are being accelerated. And you can certainly think about sort of big tech and employers in places like New York and California. They're already diversifying their workforces in other markets whether it's Amazon in D.C. or having bases in Austin or Denver. And so we want to be leveraged really to the innovation and knowledge economy. And so that means kind of going where those workers are going. And to the extent jobs -- employers continue to chase jobs, rather jobs -- sort of the job is chasing the employee rather than the employee is chasing the job, then we want to be in those markets. That was one of the reasons we got into Denver and Southeast Florida. I would say one of the things that -- you look at the -- just a fiscal situation of some of the blue states, obviously, are being exacerbated as well. And so I think that probably informs our thinking also and just the overall affordability driving -- in driving some of the populations as some of these markets, we want to be in those sort of spillover markets. We think what's happening is good for the innovation economy. So I don't think it's bad necessarily for San Jose and San Francisco and Boston but recognize that some of the -- some of those benefits are going to spill over to some other sort of secondary innovation markets as well. And those would be good markets for us to be in. And so we look to do a few things. One is to kind of reallocate or recycle capital -- some capital in New York certainly, and probably in the future, some out of California to both expansion -- our existing expansion markets as well as markets like D.C., Seattle and Boston and then also potentially some new markets that we're not into today.\nJeffrey Spector: And is that -- and I appreciate the comments. I mean I guess, the -- your thoughts on work-from-home and the permanency of work-from-home, does that impact the decision process at all? Or do you feel like that it's just a temporary adjustment right now, but maybe it will be more going forward but not to the extent that some in the media are portraying or some on The Street are portraying?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. Yes, it's hard to know. And I know that the office guys get that question a lot. I can sort of speak from our own experiences. We would expect we would have more work-from-home activity kind of going forward. But there are certain jobs where there -- that are more kind of individual contributors where they can be efficient working away from the office space, but that is not close to the majority of the jobs in this company or most companies. And so we view it as kind of more of a marginal effect that gives people a little bit more flexibility about where to live if they want to work from home. And secondly, they're probably not that focused on career growth. They're probably not going to manage a lot of people working from home at least over the next few years in my view. So I would say, does it really affect our view in terms of where we want to be? Probably less so than the fact that big employers like the Googles and Apples of the world are already diversifying their workforces in other markets with satellite operations there. So whether it's a satellite operation or people working from home, they're likely to get out to some of the same markets, I would think.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRichard Hill: I wanted to follow along those lines of bigger-picture questions and go back to some of your prepared remarks. Specifically, about homeownership, we've seen some similar trends with homeownership, particularly under the age of 35 cohort. Do you think those are just near term given the decline that we've seen in interest rates? Or do you think there's a more secular shift that's going on there?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes, Rich, I can speak to you, and others may have a view. I think part of it may be -- if you just looked at the composition of the millennials, it's a little bit as a -- that they have gone through the pipe. So there's a lot more of those that are under 35 in that 30 to 35 cohort than there were 5 years ago. So they're starting to enter into those kind of prime homeownership. Yes, so I think a lot of this is being stimulated by demographics and really being accelerated by what we're seeing in terms of interest rates. We're not seeing it yet with our residents. Reasons for move actually went down to purchase homes. But homeownership is going up nationally, and it has an impact on the overall renter pool that affects all of us as landlords at some level. We may be a little -- we think we're probably less at the sort of the epicenter of it. It's probably mostly coming from single-family rental and other demographics and other markets. But it does have an overall -- it does have an impact on a broader sort of renter pool, if you will.\nRichard Hill: Got it. That's helpful. I've been a little bit surprised there hasn't been more focus this earnings season on the election coming up in a couple of months and potentially a rent regulation depending upon what parties have power. I'm wondering if that is something that you're focused on. Obviously, the Biden plan has housing as a big focus, and affordability on the other side of COVID-19 is obviously more challenged. How are you thinking about that maybe over the medium to long term?\nTimothy Naughton: Richard, it factors in. I mean most of the regulatory risks we face is really at the local and state level, not as much at the national level. I think we'd would probably be a little bit more concerned if there was another nominee that was a Democratic nominee at the national level. But our markets have always been more regulated than other markets. We are in blue states. It's always -- it's part of what's been the appeal of our markets is sort of the barriers to entries created some supply constraints on new housing, which has helped elevate rents and rent growth over time. I think the issue that you're starting to touch on is the key one, which is when it starts to leak into the price controls and rent control, that becomes the issue for us and the type of rent control. Certainly, in New York and parts of California, you have vacancy we control. That's usually pretty manageable in terms of as an owner of apartments. Where you have -- when you lose and you have to control pricing on vacant as they become available, that's the kind of rent control as an industry we have to absolutely avoid and it is -- it will be awful for the housing markets if that occurs. So that's something we're going to continue to watch, we're going to continue to fight as an industry because it's -- one, it's not good for us as landlords for sure, but it's not good for the housing market long term. And it's not a way to solve any housing crisis at any local level. It's politically expedient, but it's -- from a policy standpoint, it's absolutely poor policy.\nRichard Hill: Understood. And then one more question, if I may. In the past, you've done a really good job thinking about how your development and your land development is really under option and you don't have to move forward with it. So I'm wondering, as you survey the landscape post-COVID-19, are there any land that you have under option and maybe high barrier or blue states that you might want to not move forward with? And you had mentioned Florida, I think, earlier in your remarks. Are there any other markets where you prefer to maybe focus on the development going forward versus some of the markets that you're in right now?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. Hey, Richard. It's Matt. As it relates to our current development rights pipeline, you're right, we only own 2 of those 28 deals, our land owned that we bought from a third party. So we give a lot of optionality. And it's really deal by deal. There may be deals in there that are not going to work without some type of restructuring. There are other deals that probably will work. And there are some deals where we may say the land is a good price, and we may close on the land and carry it for a while and wait for hard costs to come down. So it's a little bit of all of the above. It doesn't really factor into the geographic mix. It's really bottom-up in terms of where we're finding the best opportunities. And so we have a couple of development rights in some of our expansion markets, including 2 in Denver and one in Florida, that are working their way through the system. We have development rights in our legacy markets as well. I don't think we've seen any particular trend yet in terms of kind of an impact to the land market or development economics more so in one market than another, other than where you're seeing, obviously, rents taking the biggest hit so far.\nOperator: Next question will come from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.\nWesley Golladay: Another development question for you. I was wondering if you could frame up how the development pipeline that is active is positioned relative to the headwinds you cite on Slide 6. And then I'm basically trying to get a sense of the potential volatility around your 5.7% projected development yields.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Hey, I'm sorry. Is that about the development under way or the development rights on the future starts?\nWesley Golladay: No -- yes. Sorry, the active pipeline. I mean I believe you guys pivoted a few years ago to more of a suburban footprint, but I don't know if they technically qualify, in your view, as more of the infill that you cite as a headwind on Page 6.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. I mean when you look at the 2.4 billion in development under way, you can kind of look at it in terms of -- you're right, the current yield is at 5.7%. Those deals are still -- there's only 5 of those 19, where we've actually done enough leasing that we mark the rents to market yet. And on those 5, actually, the rents are slightly ahead of pro forma by about $30. So now the yields are a little bit behind because there's been some cost overruns on a couple of deals. Generally speaking, so 5 of the 19 are more or less mark-to-market. The other 14, you could handicap them. A lot of them are in markets that have seen less downward rent pressure so far. It is a predominantly suburban portfolio. In fact, looking at it, I think the only deal in that, that we would consider urban other than Hollywood, which is under construction, would be the one deal in downtown Baltimore right now. And yes...\nWesley Golladay: And then what about with the work-from-home trend? Are you noticing any demand for your larger units, people looking for maybe another room for an office or maybe rooms with a view?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Wes, this is Sean. I mean we've been digging into that, and at least based on sort of early returns, I would say it appears as though suburban direct-entry product, which often is a townhome, is doing a little bit better in the current environment. And the data is a little bit mixed. But overall, that appears to be a positive trend for us in terms of that product type across the portfolio.\nMatthew Birenbaum: And I would say, just to add to that, this is Matt, that when you look at our development, as an industry, the average unit size has been trending down really for the last cycle, probably came down 10%. What we've seen, at least in the last year or 2, our development starts, the average unit size has started to move the other direction. A lot of that has been our shift to more suburban assets. But also, even before the pandemic, we were starting to see, just with demographics heading where they were, greater demand for 3-bedroom units, which we didn't use to -- hardly build at all, now almost every project we build has at least about 3 bedrooms in it. And more of the kind of 1-bedroom den and 2-bedroom loft, we're definitely building more of that product than we were 5 years ago.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nSumit Sharma: This is Sumit Sharma in for Nick. A question about your bad debt expense. And I just want to be clear. Maybe you've stated this earlier, so I apologize in advance. But of the 2.7% of uncollectible rent, I guess how much was part of the bad debt provision or reserve? Some of your peers have talked about reserves of the tune of around 200 basis points or so. And just getting a sense of how much went into reserves, how much is deferred, how much is write-offs and cash bad debts.\nKevin O'Shea: Sumit, this is Kevin O'Shea. I'm not -- I'm having difficulty hearing you, but maybe just to give you an overview of what we did with respect to bad debt, and then you can ask questions to the extent that I'm not responding to some of your questions. So first of all, our policy is to reserve delinquent base residential rent for 3 months and other delinquent items after 2 months. For residential revenue, we typically take a reserve of about 50 basis points of residential revenue. And we did so in Q2 in our same-store portfolio. In addition, in Q2, we took a further reserve of about 200 basis points or $10.7 million, including for residents who didn't pay anything during the quarter. That resulted in a total reserve for the same-store residential revenue portfolio of about 250 basis points or $13.6 million. So of course, we continue the collection, our effort -- our collection efforts, and we're certainly encouraged by recent collection trends, which show collections against unpaid April and May rents improving to about 97.5% from about 93%, 94% at month end. So that's the story in residential revenue. Is that helpful? Is that responsive?\nSumit Sharma: Yes. No, that's great. And apologies for the bad sound quality. Another question, following up a different kind of area. I'm just wondering, in terms of the concession activity, you actually provided a lot of information on urban versus suburban. Trying to understand where -- what kind of unit types are being -- are seeing the biggest concessions, 2 bedrooms, 3 bedrooms. I think a few moments ago, someone was talking about developments and how it's changing with the unit mix. I'm just wondering, from a concession standpoint, where you're seeing the biggest drop in rent or where you have to give the largest amount of concession.\nSean Breslin: Yes, this is Sean. I'll give you some general thoughts on that. So first, as you might imagine, from what we described in our prepared remarks, concessions are generally greater in urban environments as compared to suburban environments. So let's start with that. Within urban environments, we tend to see fewer concessions on the more affordable price points, which tend to be the studios and 1-bedrooms in those submarkets as compared to the larger units. Initially, we thought there might be sort of steadier demand for larger units and people looking to work from home with extra space. But I think the affordability issue sort of weighed on that a little bit, and we've seen better performance out of the studios and smaller 1-bedrooms. And then the suburban environment, I wouldn't say there is a common theme as it relates to unit type. It's really submarket-driven and the nature of the demographic within that environment. We've got very high-quality towns in suburban Boston with great schools, and 2 and 3 bedrooms are -- have solid demand and ones not quite as much. And if you revert to some submarkets in L.A., the more affordable price points in studios and 1-bedrooms are in better shape as compared to the larger 2- and 3-bedroom units given the shutdown of some of the entertainment studios and such. So it's not a common theme as much as it relates to the suburban unit type as much as the specific suburban geography.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates.\nAlex Kalmus: Looking into bad debt and delinquencies, have you guys run an analysis on your resident base to see what age, income or profession this is mostly centered on?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Alex, this is Sean. We have to run some data on that. And I think what I would tell you is it's more industry-specific than it is typical demographic make-up in terms of gender, age, things of that sort. It tends to be self-employed, sort of freelance workers, content producers, folks like that, that have been impacted most materially. And then some of our East communities, some of the service-based sectors that have been impacted as well, whether it's foodservice, hotels, things of that sort, some of the occupations that Tim alluded to earlier in his opening remarks. So it really is more occupation-driven than anything else.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. And just to touch upon the Park Loggia sales, how was the selling on that this quarter? And I noticed the average unit price was a little higher. So I'm assuming some of the higher units got sold. Was there any discount to February levels that you needed to offer to enhance the sale process?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. Hi, Alex. This is Matt. So the closings that we saw in the second quarter were almost completely deals that have been under contract earlier than that. Not entirely, there were a few deals we did in the second quarter that were quick closes, including, I think, one of the penthouse units which -- so the average price that's settled in any given time period is really more a function of just what units happen to settle based on scheduled settlements and so on. So you can't draw a lot of conclusions, I don't think, from that. We have 54 units closed right now. We have another 12 under contract. When you add that together, it adds up to a little bit more than 200 million. We have -- there certainly is negotiation, and there's probably more negotiation at the higher price points. And that was a trend even before the crisis hit. So we have not really taken a different approach to pricing post-COVID. There just hasn't been enough traffic and transaction velocity in the market to really even justify it. I'm not sure that if we were to drop prices, we would see a significant change in the volume. And we were offering a very compelling value, we believe, before, and it's still a pretty compelling value. And that was validated by the pretty strong sales pace we had before everything shut down in early March. So there is more supply coming. And I would say that there is a little bit more negotiation at the higher price points, but we expected that. So relative to our expectations, nothing's really changed with our pricing yet.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So two questions. The first one is do you guys have an idea of how many residents are living in your apartments who are paying rent but aren't actually there? So they've moved away, but they're still paying rent.\nSean Breslin: Yes. Alex, this is Sean. That's a tough number to come up with. So the blunt answer is no, we don't. Unless they voluntarily come to us and say, \"Hey, I'm going to be gone for x period of time. Can you do something for me?\" That is not necessarily a tracking mechanism for that, that would give you any sense of -- any real sense of accuracy there.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. So as your apartment managers are seeing, I guess, maybe mail not being picked up or what have you, there's not a way to sort of track and understand if those people plan on coming back or they're going to exit whenever their term ends?\nSean Breslin: Not necessarily. I mean people have mail picked up. I mean you think about buildings that are 500 units and they have 1,000 people in them, it's really hard to get a sense for that unless there is something specific related to a mail hold that we're aware of or a package delivery. But I wouldn't say you could count on that as a representative sample that would give you an accurate estimate.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then, Kevin, on the development program, you guys were planning on doing meaningful starts this year. You haven't. At what point -- as you deliver but you don't replace the deliveries, at what point do the capital -- the current capitalized costs start to burn off and that starts to -- those expenses start to accrete to the income statement? Like where -- how far would the delays have to go, meaning before we would see the expenses start to appear on the income statement because they could no longer be capitalized?\nTimothy Naughton: Hey, Alex. This is Tim. Maybe I'll jump in, and Kevin may have something to offer. I mean certainly, if we have people working in development or construction that are not actively working on a job, whether it's one that's under construction or one that's going through the planning process, they get expensed. They go to the income statement. They don't get capitalized. I think you still need to -- while we haven't started anything year-to-date, we still have over $2 billion under construction and $4 billion under the process. So we're still managing a $6 billion pipeline. Now we are trying to rightsize it. If you look at this quarter, it's about 10% lower than the last 4-quarter average of total capitalized overhead. And it's been trending down as we've seen -- we've had some recent departures and retirements over the last 6 to 12 months of some senior folks as we try to really start to sort of rightsize it for the sort of the next cycle and where we're currently at. The other thing to remember, well, you probably don't know this, but roughly about half of that group's comp is incentive-based. So if they're not doing things or if they're not doing as much production, there's a sort of automatic adjusted factors in the overhead piece as well. But our objective is really just to be really -- is to be well positioned and rightsized kind of for the early part of the next cycle to be able to flex up if we need to as the opportunities arise if you -- so capitalized overhead this quarter is about $11 million. About $6.5 million of that is development. About $3.5 million is construction. And about a little over $1 million of it's redevelopment. If you annualize that, you get about $25 million in development, about $12 million maybe construction. That is a level that supports kind of in the -- I think we would talk about $800 million to $900 million range, sort of plus or minus. And that's what we're still geared for. So to the extent we decide over the next 3 or 4 years, it doesn't make sense to be doing that kind of volume. Obviously, head counts will need to be adjusted. But we suspect, over the next couple of years, we're going to be in a position to sort of ramp up that group. We want to make sure we've got the leadership and the right personnel in place. And they're still managing as we go into this recession about $6 billion worth of a total pipeline, which is probably only about 25% off of kind of where its peak level, probably in the $7.5 billion to $8 billion range.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rob Stevenson with Janney.\nRobert Stevenson: What's the positive impact that you typically see in terms of traffic- and leasing-wise in the May, June, July time period from the influx of new college graduates renting for the first time in your core markets in a normal year? And what have you seen thus far this year? It seems like very few college grads in your core markets have actually rented apartments this year versus a normal year given how early COVID hit and so that might be a big driver.\nSean Breslin: Yes, Rob, Sean. Good question. A couple of thoughts on that, not necessarily specific data since it's a little hard to capture. But in our particular case, I mean we don't have a lot of student-oriented assets. They're pretty select across certain markets, particularly in the urban environments, I would say. But your broader question really probably relates to the percentage of the market that is really made up of the student population that sort of brings the occupancy up in the entire market. That's something, to be honest, we've been trying to get our arms around that. Not quite there yet in terms of what that represents in each one of those submarkets. But there are certain submarkets, like we have a property here in the district that's pretty tied to ABU that when they announced their plans to have a hybrid learning model, we did 80 leases in 1 week. So there are submarket stuff like that, that are highly dependent upon it. But I think the broader question is one we're still trying to answer, which is sort of collectively what the demand is. From the student population is one segment, and then from the short-term and corporate rental market is the other segment. We think the short-term corporate piece is probably in the 2% to 3% range. And we're trying to understand that in terms of the student population, particularly as universities may shift their on-campus housing options to the extent that they're trying to sort of de-densify some of those communities. So it's a little bit of a moving target. It's probably hard to answer right at this exact moment. But certainly, the peak time for that demand is, as you described, as we're moving through the pre-leasing season, that you're going to see sort of basically April through June, like you might see on some of the student housing rates. And you want to be pre-leased in those buildings in the 90%-plus range as you get towards the end of July and before they show up in August. So we're on track for that at some of the buildings, but there are places in and around urban Boston, Berkeley, places like that, where they are falling short because of the uncertainty around the ultimate learning model.\nRobert Stevenson: Well, I mean, beyond the student stuff, I mean, I was really focused on the 21-, 22-year-olds that just graduated, that have a job with, let's say, an investment bank, a tech company, a consulting firm or whatever, that you normally get in New York, San Francisco, Boston, et cetera, renting for the first time, where they're bringing in an offer letter to you and they're leasing off of that. I mean that influx of students -- of former students, but now people entering the workforce for the first time, I mean, how significant is that typically in these big sort of gateway cities?\nSean Breslin: Yes. And that's a -- it's probably a tough one to answer other than the stuff that's related to people that are coming in for a specific kind of program, like a training program or some other kind of corporate program, I guess, 2% to 3% of the market [Technical Difficulty] our markets. What you're really talking about is just ongoing demand as people are graduating from universities, moving into the rental market. That's a little tougher to quantify overall at this point in time.\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. No, Rob, that is part of -- I cited earlier in my remarks about the typical household contraction and consolidation that you see in a downturn. That is part of it, which you're describing to me. Kids that can't get jobs when they get out of college, they stay at home or they go into a house with 6 guys, and there are 6 people instead of getting their own apartment. So you'll see -- in past recessions, you've seen occupancies fall by a couple of hundred basis points. You may still be seeing a little bit of new supply. So it's not unusual to see contraction of household demand on the order of a million, 2 million housing units across the country in a normal downturn. And a big portion of that is, I think, exactly what you're focusing on.\nRobert Stevenson: Okay. And then lastly for me, what are you guys seeing today versus at the beginning of the year in terms of construction costs, both hard and soft? I mean how meaningful has been the delta? And where is the greatest amount of slack today? And is there any of these buckets that are -- that you're seeing more cost pressures either up or down on now given what's happening in single-family or what's happening elsewhere or the falling off of new construction in other sectors?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. Hey, Rob. This is Matt. It's -- we are starting to see it, but it is early. So where we started to see it first is really in some of the smaller-contract CapEx work. So if you think about it, those are the types of jobs that are short in duration. So if you're a subcontractor that's doing a facade restoration project for us or some concrete repair work, that might be a 2- or 3-month or 6-month job. And if they finish one up, they don't necessarily have stuff to replace it. So we are starting to see it there. And in some markets, we've seen mid-single-digit buyout savings on that work, which isn't all that meaningful. But given where we've been coming from, where we've just been seeing construction costs growing much faster than inflation for the last 4 or 5 years, it is a significant change. On the new construction, it's probably still too early in almost all markets because everything is under way, and there's a lot under way. It's going to have to get finished first. So again, where you're going to see it first is going to be in early trades, earthwork, pipework, demolition, maybe a little bit concrete. And then regionally, it's going to vary as well. So what we've heard others say is maybe we're starting to see a little bit in South Florida because a big part of what drives that is also -- there's no wood frame construction there for one thing. It's all concrete because of the hurricane codes. And there's a lot of cruise ship restoration work. And hospitality work is not happening. That's been canceled. So the sub base there has more excess capacity. It hasn't really worked its way into most of our markets yet. Some commodities are down. Lumber is up. Lumber is up quite a bit right now. So -- and that's probably in response to what's going on in the single-family market and just home renovation market. So there are some cross-currents there, but it generally takes a while. Construction pricing is a lagging indicator. And it's going to take a while for it to work its way through the system in our view.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRichard Anderson: So Tim, you mentioned, or maybe somebody else, but in kind of the suddenness of what happened, made a lot of decisions for you, particularly as it relates to development postponement. If memory serves, in the '08, '09 time frame, you did have a sizable write-off related to your development pipeline. And if I'm wrong about that, I apologize, but I'm going on memory. I'm curious, though, as you fast-forward to 12 years later today, is there anything about what happened then that you took from a lesson learned and is sort of allowing you to sort of walk the tight rope here without having any sort of disruption like that? I'm just wondering how that experience during the great financial crisis has manifested itself at how you look today. I know you mentioned the difference in balance sheet in your prepared remarks, but I'm just wondering just in terms of how you approach the business, particularly on the development side.\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. Hey, Rich, Tim. I would say it's largely been in land. And when you say we had -- like we wrote off or had impairments on the order of about $80 million total, and a good portion of that was in land. And I would just say relative to the size of the development rights pipeline, we've had deals where profits have been larger than that in terms of value we created. So I -- we weren't -- I mean the homebuilders are -- were taking impairments into billions. We took a -- I think we took an impairment of -- on the order of $60 million. This time were just on our land. And so we've been really very disciplined about maintaining optionality. And some of the -- as Matt was talking earlier, some of the deals may not make. And we may have sellers that are unwilling to restructure to the extent restructuring sort of could close the gap. And we could have some future write-offs, I suspect, but it's really out of the pursuit cost, which is pretty cheap capital relative to the size of the pipeline that we control. So I would say the biggest issue is just -- we just don't have land inventory of any significance this cycle compared to the last one.\nKevin O'Shea: And the only thing I would add to that, this is Kevin, Rich, is just, obviously, we've discussed many times in recent years, one key lesson we took from that downturn was to be a whole lot more match funded with respect to the development under way in terms of having the long-term capital in place. And so you see that lesson being applied here in a very visible way with respect to the $2.5 billion we have under way right now, with 95% already match funded. So that obviously leaves us a lot more foot forward this time around to pursue opportunities that may pop up.\nRichard Anderson: Great. And then secondly, a lot of talk in this call about suburbs beating the urban core. You guys are, I think, pardon me if I'm wrong on this one, I think you're 60 -- 2/3 suburban, 1/3 urban, and perhaps, you're still an expensive option in those suburbs. But do you think that, that sort of breakout could ultimately help you out long term here as this sort of situation settles and that people maybe don't go all the way back in, but they come back close enough where it benefits you in your suburban portfolio?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. Again, Rich, I think I was talking earlier, there already was a trend. We already were sort of started to tilt the portfolio suburban. And if you look kind of about our history, probably where we created the most value, at least in the development pipeline, is kind of that suburban infill. And I think as millennials get a little bit older, you see more economic activity in suburbs. I think the kind of this kind of urban-light kind of lifestyle, mixed-use kind of infill/suburban areas is probably -- provides -- offers one of the more attractive opportunities that's less dense than an urban environment, also has -- generally is more affordable than what we delivered in our urban areas. So we were already kind of moving in that direction. And maybe this just pushes us a little bit harder. But -- so I think the demand factors that were already in place are just -- are probably just being magnified by what's happened here in the last few months.\nOperator: And with that, I would now like to turn the call back over to Tim Naughton for closing remarks.\nTimothy Naughton: Okay. Well, great. Thank you, Matt. I know all of you have a number of calls you need to be on today. So I just want to thank you for being with us, and enjoy the rest of your time. I look forward to talking to you soon.\nOperator: Once again, that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matthew Birenbaum",
            "content": "Hey, Nick. This is Matt. Yes. I mean it is -- we have deals that could start. And we are -- we do have a fairly high degree of conviction that hard costs should start to correct here. So that's -- the main thing we're looking at is kind of where our hard cost is trending, what the subcontractor bid coverage look like. There may be one deal that we would start here that's kind of got some exceptional circumstances that's actually in an opportunity zone. And we're looking at starting with some third-party joint venture capital, which is, as you know, is very unusual for us. But for -- kind of for wholly owned balance-sheet-funded starts, that's really what we're watching. It's kind of interplay between potential reduction in hard costs and, frankly, reductions in NOIs on the other side and kind of looking at what the total basis looks like, what costs look like relative to their long-term trend line and what rents and NOIs look like relative to their long-term trend line as well. Yes. Hey, Richard. It's Matt. As it relates to our current development rights pipeline, you're right, we only own 2 of those 28 deals, our land owned that we bought from a third party. So we give a lot of optionality. And it's really deal by deal. There may be deals in there that are not going to work without some type of restructuring. There are other deals that probably will work. And there are some deals where we may say the land is a good price, and we may close on the land and carry it for a while and wait for hard costs to come down. So it's a little bit of all of the above. It doesn't really factor into the geographic mix. It's really bottom-up in terms of where we're finding the best opportunities. And so we have a couple of development rights in some of our expansion markets, including 2 in Denver and one in Florida, that are working their way through the system. We have development rights in our legacy markets as well. I don't think we've seen any particular trend yet in terms of kind of an impact to the land market or development economics more so in one market than another, other than where you're seeing, obviously, rents taking the biggest hit so far. Hey, I'm sorry. Is that about the development under way or the development rights on the future starts? Yes. I mean when you look at the 2.4 billion in development under way, you can kind of look at it in terms of -- you're right, the current yield is at 5.7%. Those deals are still -- there's only 5 of those 19, where we've actually done enough leasing that we mark the rents to market yet. And on those 5, actually, the rents are slightly ahead of pro forma by about $30. So now the yields are a little bit behind because there's been some cost overruns on a couple of deals. Generally speaking, so 5 of the 19 are more or less mark-to-market. The other 14, you could handicap them. A lot of them are in markets that have seen less downward rent pressure so far. It is a predominantly suburban portfolio. In fact, looking at it, I think the only deal in that, that we would consider urban other than Hollywood, which is under construction, would be the one deal in downtown Baltimore right now. And yes... And I would say, just to add to that, this is Matt, that when you look at our development, as an industry, the average unit size has been trending down really for the last cycle, probably came down 10%. What we've seen, at least in the last year or 2, our development starts, the average unit size has started to move the other direction. A lot of that has been our shift to more suburban assets. But also, even before the pandemic, we were starting to see, just with demographics heading where they were, greater demand for 3-bedroom units, which we didn't use to -- hardly build at all, now almost every project we build has at least about 3 bedrooms in it. And more of the kind of 1-bedroom den and 2-bedroom loft, we're definitely building more of that product than we were 5 years ago. Yes. Hi, Alex. This is Matt. So the closings that we saw in the second quarter were almost completely deals that have been under contract earlier than that. Not entirely, there were a few deals we did in the second quarter that were quick closes, including, I think, one of the penthouse units which -- so the average price that's settled in any given time period is really more a function of just what units happen to settle based on scheduled settlements and so on. So you can't draw a lot of conclusions, I don't think, from that. We have 54 units closed right now. We have another 12 under contract. When you add that together, it adds up to a little bit more than 200 million. We have -- there certainly is negotiation, and there's probably more negotiation at the higher price points. And that was a trend even before the crisis hit. So we have not really taken a different approach to pricing post-COVID. There just hasn't been enough traffic and transaction velocity in the market to really even justify it. I'm not sure that if we were to drop prices, we would see a significant change in the volume. And we were offering a very compelling value, we believe, before, and it's still a pretty compelling value. And that was validated by the pretty strong sales pace we had before everything shut down in early March. So there is more supply coming. And I would say that there is a little bit more negotiation at the higher price points, but we expected that. So relative to our expectations, nothing's really changed with our pricing yet. Yes. Hey, Rob. This is Matt. It's -- we are starting to see it, but it is early. So where we started to see it first is really in some of the smaller-contract CapEx work. So if you think about it, those are the types of jobs that are short in duration. So if you're a subcontractor that's doing a facade restoration project for us or some concrete repair work, that might be a 2- or 3-month or 6-month job. And if they finish one up, they don't necessarily have stuff to replace it. So we are starting to see it there. And in some markets, we've seen mid-single-digit buyout savings on that work, which isn't all that meaningful. But given where we've been coming from, where we've just been seeing construction costs growing much faster than inflation for the last 4 or 5 years, it is a significant change. On the new construction, it's probably still too early in almost all markets because everything is under way, and there's a lot under way. It's going to have to get finished first. So again, where you're going to see it first is going to be in early trades, earthwork, pipework, demolition, maybe a little bit concrete. And then regionally, it's going to vary as well. So what we've heard others say is maybe we're starting to see a little bit in South Florida because a big part of what drives that is also -- there's no wood frame construction there for one thing. It's all concrete because of the hurricane codes. And there's a lot of cruise ship restoration work. And hospitality work is not happening. That's been canceled. So the sub base there has more excess capacity. It hasn't really worked its way into most of our markets yet. Some commodities are down. Lumber is up. Lumber is up quite a bit right now. So -- and that's probably in response to what's going on in the single-family market and just home renovation market. So there are some cross-currents there, but it generally takes a while. Construction pricing is a lagging indicator. And it's going to take a while for it to work its way through the system in our view."

            "name": "Timothy Naughton",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason, and welcome to the Q2 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin and Matt Birenbaum. Sean, Kevin and I will provide commentary on the slides that we posted last night, and then all of us will be available for Q&A afterwards. Our comments will focus on providing a summary of Q2 results, an update on operations and some perspective on development in the balance sheet now that we've entered an economic recession. But before getting started on the deck, I thought I would offer a few general comments about the environment we are currently facing. To say things have changed over the last 4 months is certainly an understatement. We are in the middle of the largest global health care crisis in a century. The economic downturn is the most severe we've seen since the Great Depression and on the heels of the longest expansion on record. And social unrest is at a level we haven't experienced since Vietnam and the civil rights movement over 50 years ago. It's been said, but these are indeed unprecedented times. And these events aren't just having an unprecedented impact on economic activity but also on income and wealth distribution across industries in the broader population. For those companies and workers leveraged to the virtual economy, they're actually doing quite well, and some are even thriving. For those companies and workers that operate in the real economy of bricks-and-mortar like AVB, we're certainly feeling the normal effects and then some of the downturn. And then for those companies and workers in the travel, leisure and entertainment sectors, among others, they are basically in shutdown mode. These sectors as well as others will undoubtedly need to be restructured over the next few years. Many companies will not survive, and their employees, if evenly temporarily furloughed for now, will join the ranks of the permanently unemployed over the next several quarters. And unfortunately, those impacted by these events or most impacted by these events are those in lower-paying service jobs and minority populations. As a result, this downturn carries not just the normal economic risk of prior recessions but also profound health, social and political risk that are likely to shape the length and shape -- shape the length and of the economic recovery. So while this was a sudden and quick downturn, the timing and shape of the recovery is hard to project. And that presents a unique challenge in managing our business and communicating our expectations to you, our shareholders. Having said that, we'll do our best to be as transparent and direct as possible as we all try to understand and engage how the current environment will play out in our business in the months and quarters ahead. Right now, let's turn to the results for the quarter, starting in -- on Slide 4. As expected, Q2 was a challenging quarter. Core FFO growth was down almost 2% driven by a same-store revenue decline of almost 3%, or 2.2% if retail is excluded. And on a sequential basis, from Q1, same-store revenue was down 4.5%, or 3.9% excluding retail. We had no development completions or new development starts this quarter. And we've had no starts so far year-to-date. And lastly, we raised over $700 million in capital this quarter at an average initial cost of 2.8%, with most of that coming from a $600 million long 10-year bond deal at a rate of around 2.5%. As Kevin will share in his remarks, our liquidity, balance sheet and credit metrics are very well positioned heading into this downturn. Turning to Slide 5. I wanted to drill down a bit more on the decline in same-store residential revenues this past quarter. As this slide demonstrates, the decline was primarily attributable to a loss of occupancy and uncollectible lease revenue or bad debt. Economic occupancy was down 120 basis points, while bad debt was 200 bps higher than normal. Higher-than-normal bad debt is likely to continue, given the breadth and depth of the downturn, coupled with eviction moratorium in many of the markets in which we operate. We also experienced higher concessions in the quarter and lower other income as we waived various fees this past quarter for our residents, including late payments, common area amenity and credit card convenience fees. Average lease rate for our same-store portfolio in Q2 was actually up 1.8% over Q2 of 2019, reflecting embedded rent growth on leases entered into in 2019 through Q1 of this year. Turning to Slide 6. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, this downturn poses a unique risk relative to other recessions. In addition to the household contraction and consolidation that occurs due to job losses in any downturn, the pandemic is driving other trends that are impacting rental demand. These include work-from-home flexibility that is shifting some renter demand from higher cost and urban/infill markets. Many renters are relocating, perhaps only temporarily, to lower-cost markets or submarkets, leisure areas or even back home with their parents. Second, record-low mortgage rates and the desire for space is accelerating demand for single-family homes. Many homebuilders reported strong orders in sales this past quarter, particularly towards the back half of the quarter. And homeownership rate is on the rise. And lastly, we're seeing reduced demand from 2 important segments of renters, corporate and students, as most temporary corporate assignments have been canceled, while higher education is adopting remote learning models and limiting on-campus activities for the fall. These factors will likely weigh on performance until the public health crisis has abated. On the other hand, they will also likely contribute to a more robust recovery once employees begin to return to the workplace. With that, I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss operations and portfolio performance in more detail. Sean? All right. Thanks, Kevin. Just turning to the last slide and offering a few summary comments. Q2 was a challenging quarter driven by the suddenness of the pandemic and the depth of the downturn. So far, the impact on same-store performance has been driven by lower occupancy and elevated bad debt. Contributions from NOI and new development lease-ups were less than expected due to construction delays and weaker absorption. We have curtailed new developments dramatically and have not started any new communities so far this year. Despite the strength in the for-sale market, we do expect construction costs to fall over the next few quarters. And we'll incorporate that into our capital allocation plans. And then lastly, the balance sheet is very well positioned in both an absolute since -- and relative to prior downturns, which as Kevin said, just gives us plenty of financial flexibility to address challenges or opportunities as they arise. And so with that, Matt, we'll open the call for questions. Yes, Nick. It's hard to know exactly. If you looked at last cycle, we've lost about 4 or 5 quarters. Part of my introductory comments around what this economic downturn might look like, it's maybe different from others that we've seen where others may have been sort of -- maybe drifted a bit more into the recession. This was quite sudden. And others were maybe in a quicker bounce back. We think this could be a more drawn-out bounce back and likely to be more and more -- you've heard certainly the Nike Swoosh with more people -- more and more, you're hearing sort of the K-shaped recovery, where it's going to be very uneven depending upon even demographic and the population. So just given the public health and economic aspect of this one, it's hard to know for sure. But as we showed on that one slide, we're just starting to see construction costs correcting. Last cycle, they correct on the order of 15%, maybe a little bit more. And it's -- we're probably going to need to see the kind of double-digit corrections before we start to have a little bit more faith that we're buying deals out of the basis that we'll look good sort of next cycle. Yes -- no. I -- maybe to just add a little bit, Kevin, I agree. I think you had 2 things working. It's the best -- it's the most attractive investment, and you've got the disparity between what equity's costing and what -- certainly what debt's costing as being supported artificially by the Fed right now as we know. And our belief is while there's not a lot of visibility on asset pricing, we're -- we feel pretty strongly that asset prices haven't corrected near what equity prices have corrected. We've seen in the order of 30% on the equity, and probably -- we think probably less than 10% on asset sales. So that informs our conviction as well in terms of what the alternatives are in terms of capital sources. Yes. I just -- maybe just -- I've mentioned suburban had been outperforming urban before -- prior to the pandemic. And we had been seeing a trend, both on the demand [Technical Difficulty] next year, urban supply to outpace suburban by a fair amount in our markets, but also on the demand side, which, last cycle, supply and demand was stronger in the urban submarkets. This cycle, it's probably going to be the opposite, where both -- when you get beyond sort of '21, '22, where you're likely to see stronger demand in some of the suburban submarkets and more supply. And that's partly because millennials are coming of age, there's more economic activity starting to occur in the suburbs, and part of it's affordability. So as you see more economic activity, that ought to drive more rental -- renter demand in the suburbs as well. But -- and we already started to see that trend a little bit before the pandemic, but it's just a longer secular trend that we expect that will continue over the next few years. Yes. Sure, Jeff. I think we've spoken to this in the past. As many have said, I mean, I think the pandemic is -- they're -- these trends aren't necessarily new. They're -- a lot of them are being accelerated. And you can certainly think about sort of big tech and employers in places like New York and California. They're already diversifying their workforces in other markets whether it's Amazon in D.C. or having bases in Austin or Denver. And so we want to be leveraged really to the innovation and knowledge economy. And so that means kind of going where those workers are going. And to the extent jobs -- employers continue to chase jobs, rather jobs -- sort of the job is chasing the employee rather than the employee is chasing the job, then we want to be in those markets. That was one of the reasons we got into Denver and Southeast Florida. I would say one of the things that -- you look at the -- just a fiscal situation of some of the blue states, obviously, are being exacerbated as well. And so I think that probably informs our thinking also and just the overall affordability driving -- in driving some of the populations as some of these markets, we want to be in those sort of spillover markets. We think what's happening is good for the innovation economy. So I don't think it's bad necessarily for San Jose and San Francisco and Boston but recognize that some of the -- some of those benefits are going to spill over to some other sort of secondary innovation markets as well. And those would be good markets for us to be in. And so we look to do a few things. One is to kind of reallocate or recycle capital -- some capital in New York certainly, and probably in the future, some out of California to both expansion -- our existing expansion markets as well as markets like D.C., Seattle and Boston and then also potentially some new markets that we're not into today. Yes. Yes, it's hard to know. And I know that the office guys get that question a lot. I can sort of speak from our own experiences. We would expect we would have more work-from-home activity kind of going forward. But there are certain jobs where there -- that are more kind of individual contributors where they can be efficient working away from the office space, but that is not close to the majority of the jobs in this company or most companies. And so we view it as kind of more of a marginal effect that gives people a little bit more flexibility about where to live if they want to work from home. And secondly, they're probably not that focused on career growth. They're probably not going to manage a lot of people working from home at least over the next few years in my view. So I would say, does it really affect our view in terms of where we want to be? Probably less so than the fact that big employers like the Googles and Apples of the world are already diversifying their workforces in other markets with satellite operations there. So whether it's a satellite operation or people working from home, they're likely to get out to some of the same markets, I would think. Yes, Rich, I can speak to you, and others may have a view. I think part of it may be -- if you just looked at the composition of the millennials, it's a little bit as a -- that they have gone through the pipe. So there's a lot more of those that are under 35 in that 30 to 35 cohort than there were 5 years ago. So they're starting to enter into those kind of prime homeownership. Yes, so I think a lot of this is being stimulated by demographics and really being accelerated by what we're seeing in terms of interest rates. We're not seeing it yet with our residents. Reasons for move actually went down to purchase homes. But homeownership is going up nationally, and it has an impact on the overall renter pool that affects all of us as landlords at some level. We may be a little -- we think we're probably less at the sort of the epicenter of it. It's probably mostly coming from single-family rental and other demographics and other markets. But it does have an overall -- it does have an impact on a broader sort of renter pool, if you will. Richard, it factors in. I mean most of the regulatory risks we face is really at the local and state level, not as much at the national level. I think we'd would probably be a little bit more concerned if there was another nominee that was a Democratic nominee at the national level. But our markets have always been more regulated than other markets. We are in blue states. It's always -- it's part of what's been the appeal of our markets is sort of the barriers to entries created some supply constraints on new housing, which has helped elevate rents and rent growth over time. I think the issue that you're starting to touch on is the key one, which is when it starts to leak into the price controls and rent control, that becomes the issue for us and the type of rent control. Certainly, in New York and parts of California, you have vacancy we control. That's usually pretty manageable in terms of as an owner of apartments. Where you have -- when you lose and you have to control pricing on vacant as they become available, that's the kind of rent control as an industry we have to absolutely avoid and it is -- it will be awful for the housing markets if that occurs. So that's something we're going to continue to watch, we're going to continue to fight as an industry because it's -- one, it's not good for us as landlords for sure, but it's not good for the housing market long term. And it's not a way to solve any housing crisis at any local level. It's politically expedient, but it's -- from a policy standpoint, it's absolutely poor policy. Hey, Alex. This is Tim. Maybe I'll jump in, and Kevin may have something to offer. I mean certainly, if we have people working in development or construction that are not actively working on a job, whether it's one that's under construction or one that's going through the planning process, they get expensed. They go to the income statement. They don't get capitalized. I think you still need to -- while we haven't started anything year-to-date, we still have over $2 billion under construction and $4 billion under the process. So we're still managing a $6 billion pipeline. Now we are trying to rightsize it. If you look at this quarter, it's about 10% lower than the last 4-quarter average of total capitalized overhead. And it's been trending down as we've seen -- we've had some recent departures and retirements over the last 6 to 12 months of some senior folks as we try to really start to sort of rightsize it for the sort of the next cycle and where we're currently at. The other thing to remember, well, you probably don't know this, but roughly about half of that group's comp is incentive-based. So if they're not doing things or if they're not doing as much production, there's a sort of automatic adjusted factors in the overhead piece as well. But our objective is really just to be really -- is to be well positioned and rightsized kind of for the early part of the next cycle to be able to flex up if we need to as the opportunities arise if you -- so capitalized overhead this quarter is about $11 million. About $6.5 million of that is development. About $3.5 million is construction. And about a little over $1 million of it's redevelopment. If you annualize that, you get about $25 million in development, about $12 million maybe construction. That is a level that supports kind of in the -- I think we would talk about $800 million to $900 million range, sort of plus or minus. And that's what we're still geared for. So to the extent we decide over the next 3 or 4 years, it doesn't make sense to be doing that kind of volume. Obviously, head counts will need to be adjusted. But we suspect, over the next couple of years, we're going to be in a position to sort of ramp up that group. We want to make sure we've got the leadership and the right personnel in place. And they're still managing as we go into this recession about $6 billion worth of a total pipeline, which is probably only about 25% off of kind of where its peak level, probably in the $7.5 billion to $8 billion range. Yes. No, Rob, that is part of -- I cited earlier in my remarks about the typical household contraction and consolidation that you see in a downturn. That is part of it, which you're describing to me. Kids that can't get jobs when they get out of college, they stay at home or they go into a house with 6 guys, and there are 6 people instead of getting their own apartment. So you'll see -- in past recessions, you've seen occupancies fall by a couple of hundred basis points. You may still be seeing a little bit of new supply. So it's not unusual to see contraction of household demand on the order of a million, 2 million housing units across the country in a normal downturn. And a big portion of that is, I think, exactly what you're focusing on. Yes. Hey, Rich, Tim. I would say it's largely been in land. And when you say we had -- like we wrote off or had impairments on the order of about $80 million total, and a good portion of that was in land. And I would just say relative to the size of the development rights pipeline, we've had deals where profits have been larger than that in terms of value we created. So I -- we weren't -- I mean the homebuilders are -- were taking impairments into billions. We took a -- I think we took an impairment of -- on the order of $60 million. This time were just on our land. And so we've been really very disciplined about maintaining optionality. And some of the -- as Matt was talking earlier, some of the deals may not make. And we may have sellers that are unwilling to restructure to the extent restructuring sort of could close the gap. And we could have some future write-offs, I suspect, but it's really out of the pursuit cost, which is pretty cheap capital relative to the size of the pipeline that we control. So I would say the biggest issue is just -- we just don't have land inventory of any significance this cycle compared to the last one. Yes. Again, Rich, I think I was talking earlier, there already was a trend. We already were sort of started to tilt the portfolio suburban. And if you look kind of about our history, probably where we created the most value, at least in the development pipeline, is kind of that suburban infill. And I think as millennials get a little bit older, you see more economic activity in suburbs. I think the kind of this kind of urban-light kind of lifestyle, mixed-use kind of infill/suburban areas is probably -- provides -- offers one of the more attractive opportunities that's less dense than an urban environment, also has -- generally is more affordable than what we delivered in our urban areas. So we were already kind of moving in that direction. And maybe this just pushes us a little bit harder. But -- so I think the demand factors that were already in place are just -- are probably just being magnified by what's happened here in the last few months. Okay. Well, great. Thank you, Matt. I know all of you have a number of calls you need to be on today. So I just want to thank you for being with us, and enjoy the rest of your time. I look forward to talking to you soon."

            "name": "Kevin O'Shea",
            "content": "Thanks, Sean. Turning to Slide 12. In response to the current environment, we have chosen not to start any new construction projects so far this year despite having initially guided in the beginning of the year to about $900 million in new construction starts for 2020. Looking ahead, we expect lower construction costs will benefit many of our future planned starts. And we are prepared to wait for this expected correction on hard costs before breaking ground so that we can lock in a lower basis on these investments. Although real-time construction cost data are difficult to come by, initial indications suggest we are beginning to see a softer labor market and a reduction in overall construction activity makes their way into subcontractor pricing. As for development that is currently under construction, as you can see on Slide 13, we are in a remarkably strong position from a financial point of view. Development under construction is already 95% match funded with long-term capital, which not only mitigates the financial risk of development, but also means that we have locked in the investment spread profit on these developments by having matched the long-term expected returns on the projects with equity and debt price when we were starting these projects. Finally, as shown on Slide 14, we continue to enjoy an exceptionally strong financial position today. This is particularly evident when comparing our key credit metrics today to those from the fourth quarter of 2008 when we entered the last recession. Specifically, since late 2008, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio has improved to 4.9x from 6.5x. Our interest coverage ratio has increased to 6.9x from 4.5x. Our unencumbered NOI percentage has increased to 94% from 77%. And our credit rating has improved to A3, A- from Baa1 to BBB+. This strong balance sheet position provides us with great flexibility to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may emerge as this downturn unfolds. And with that, I will turn it back to Tim. Yes. Hey, Nick. This is Kevin. I'll jump in here, and Tim may want to add a couple of comments. And you're right, as we -- as you saw in the earnings release, we did announce a share repurchase program of $500 million. And really, the genesis behind that is we believe our stock is, as you alluded to, trading at a compelling value, both absolutely and relative to our other investments, including development. And because we have the balance sheet strength and liquidity to pursue a program, we intend to do so. Though as we indicated in our earnings release, we're likely to fund that on a long-term basis with asset sales and potentially some incremental debt, but we do intend to proceed. And probably we'll do so initially on a measured basis until we have clarity on those sources. But I think at this point, that's probably our most attractive investment that we have today. Sumit, this is Kevin O'Shea. I'm not -- I'm having difficulty hearing you, but maybe just to give you an overview of what we did with respect to bad debt, and then you can ask questions to the extent that I'm not responding to some of your questions. So first of all, our policy is to reserve delinquent base residential rent for 3 months and other delinquent items after 2 months. For residential revenue, we typically take a reserve of about 50 basis points of residential revenue. And we did so in Q2 in our same-store portfolio. In addition, in Q2, we took a further reserve of about 200 basis points or $10.7 million, including for residents who didn't pay anything during the quarter. That resulted in a total reserve for the same-store residential revenue portfolio of about 250 basis points or $13.6 million. So of course, we continue the collection, our effort -- our collection efforts, and we're certainly encouraged by recent collection trends, which show collections against unpaid April and May rents improving to about 97.5% from about 93%, 94% at month end. So that's the story in residential revenue. Is that helpful? Is that responsive? And the only thing I would add to that, this is Kevin, Rich, is just, obviously, we've discussed many times in recent years, one key lesson we took from that downturn was to be a whole lot more match funded with respect to the development under way in terms of having the long-term capital in place. And so you see that lesson being applied here in a very visible way with respect to the $2.5 billion we have under way right now, with 95% already match funded. So that obviously leaves us a lot more foot forward this time around to pursue opportunities that may pop up."

            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Tim. Turning to Slide 7. The factors Tim highlighted on the previous slide impacted leasing volume throughout the quarter, which is down roughly 10% year-over-year. Turnover for the quarter fell about 5%. So the volume of resident notices to leave our communities exceeded leasing velocity, most materially in May when we experienced about a 25% increase in lease breaks for a variety of reasons, including corporate apartment operators shutting down operations in certain markets. As a result, move-outs exceeded move-ins for the quarter. As of yesterday, net lease volume for July is roughly on pace with the volume of notices to vacate our communities, which should help stabilize occupancy as we move into August. Moving to Slide 8. We experienced a 120 basis point decline in physical occupancy from April to June, with most of it occurring in May as a result of the lease break volume I mentioned a few moments ago. Chart 2 on Slide 8 depicts both lease and effective rent change for the quarter. As detailed in our earnings release, blended lease rent change was down 40 basis points in Q2, while effective rent change was down 3.1%. Rent change for July has improved slightly from June, but the nature of the health crisis and economic environment will dictate the ongoing demand for rental housing and our pricing power as we move through the balance of the year. Turning to Slide 9. You can see the regional distribution of both lease and effective rent change for Q2. Northern and Southern California were the most challenging regions for a variety of reasons, while the Pacific Northwest performed the best. Moving to Slide 10 to look at performance metrics by submarket type. Urban submarkets deteriorated more materially during Q2 as compared to suburban submarkets. From an occupancy standpoint, urban submarkets declined by 270 basis points from April to June, while suburban submarkets fell by only 50 basis points. And from a rent change perspective, urban submarkets trailed suburban by roughly 200 basis points. While the weakness in urban environments is pretty broad-based across our portfolio, it's most pronounced in San Francisco, Boston and parts of L.A. Unfortunately, demand in urban submarkets is suffering from a variety of factors, several of which Tim mentioned in his prepared remarks, including a desire for more affordable price points, extended work-from-home policies across corporate America, a lack of short-term and corporate demand, uncertainty regarding on-campus learning at urban universities and a general concern about population density. Shifting to Slide 11 to discuss our development portfolio. Construction delays at the beginning of the pandemic weighed on both deliveries and occupancies during the second quarter. As noted in Chart 1 on Slide 12, deliveries and occupancies for the first half of the year fell short of our expectations by roughly 450 and 650 units, respectively, which translated into an NOI shortfall of approximately $2 million. Fortunately, following some initial shutdowns at about 1/3 of our construction sites for a short period of time, all of our jobs are currently under way, albeit with a slower pace of deliveries expected across certain assets. I will now turn it over to Kevin to further address development starts, funding and the balance sheet. Kevin? Yes, Rich. It's Sean. Happy to walk you through it a little bit. I mean as we noted on an effective basis, blended rent change was down about 3% for the quarter. If you look at it on a lease basis, it was down only about 40 basis points. And certainly, based on what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing the greatest weakness in Northern and Southern California. And if you double-click through those regions, probably the softest spots are San Francisco and throughout L.A., particularly in some of the entertainment-oriented economies around L.A., so think about Hollywood, West Hollywood, Burbank, San Fernando Valley, et cetera. And then the other markets, we're basically anywhere from sort of 0 to minus 2%. And across the other markets, the softest spots are probably in New York City and throughout the urban submarkets within Boston. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, generally, across the portfolio, what we're seeing in the urban submarkets is rent change is trailing suburban by about a couple of hundred basis points. And as you probably noted in the chart, our economic occupancy and physical occupancy are both trailing what we're seeing in the suburban submarkets as well. So certainly, a tougher place to be as it relates to both rent change and occupancy in those environments. And as it relates to kind of where things are today, if you look at it in the context of July, effective rent change is down about 3.5%, a little bit better than June. And lease rent change is down about 2%. And in both cases, renewals do remain positive right now, sort of in the 50 to 70 basis point range, slightly lower than what we experienced in Q2 but still positive in July at this point. Yes, Rich. It's Sean. I can provide a couple of comments, and then Tim can chime in. I mean it's really a function of how some of those factors evolve over the next few months here. I mean urban submarkets, we've mentioned several of the factors that are sort of driving it. So I think what I mentioned in my prepared remarks is sort of the nature of the health crisis, and the economic environment will dictate when people start to come back to the urban submarkets and at least some in a more material way. And on the suburban side, it's really a function of sort of portfolio mix. And in some places, it certainly is very helpful. There are some submarkets where, even though it's suburban, it's a little bit painful right now. I'll pick one specifically, like Mountain View in Northern California, where Alphabet is headquartered. Given their extended work-from-home policies, it tends to be a weaker submarket even though it's technically considered suburban. So I'm not sure there's a one-size-fits-all answer here as it relates to that. At least, that's my general thoughts at this point in time. But Tim, do you have anything you want to add? In the short run, John, yes. And we are starting to see some student demand come back in some of these urban submarkets based on announcements that have been made to date as it relates to the hybrid learning environments, both on-campus and distance learning, and just anecdotally, getting a lot of feedback from some of the student population that they had enough time at home. And even if they only could be on campus a couple of days a week, they want their apartment back. So whether that holds or not, obviously, it's a function of the health crisis and the decisions that are made across the university systems. But in general, I would say we are seeing it relatively sort of stabilize a little bit. That being said, between now and year-end, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the health crisis and the economic environment will dictate whether things kind of shift up or down in terms of demand as we move forward here. Yes, John. I'm happy to comment, and then Kevin or Tim can chime in as well. I mean at this point in time, it's obviously difficult to predict, given the nature of -- we already have mentioned the health crisis, the macroeconomic environment. Obviously, there have been federal support for people to date in terms of being able to sort of subsidize their incomes, which I think came through this morning in terms of personal income growth. So I think assuming it's a relatively static environment through year-end, you probably expect those sort of collection rates to hold within reason. But to the extent there is significant shift in any one of those variables in a meaningful way, obviously, that could pick it up or down as a result. But I think those are the primary variables we will all be monitoring to try and determine whether we think it's going to tick up and/or down. So... Yes. Wes, this is Sean. I mean we've been digging into that, and at least based on sort of early returns, I would say it appears as though suburban direct-entry product, which often is a townhome, is doing a little bit better in the current environment. And the data is a little bit mixed. But overall, that appears to be a positive trend for us in terms of that product type across the portfolio. Yes, this is Sean. I'll give you some general thoughts on that. So first, as you might imagine, from what we described in our prepared remarks, concessions are generally greater in urban environments as compared to suburban environments. So let's start with that. Within urban environments, we tend to see fewer concessions on the more affordable price points, which tend to be the studios and 1-bedrooms in those submarkets as compared to the larger units. Initially, we thought there might be sort of steadier demand for larger units and people looking to work from home with extra space. But I think the affordability issue sort of weighed on that a little bit, and we've seen better performance out of the studios and smaller 1-bedrooms. And then the suburban environment, I wouldn't say there is a common theme as it relates to unit type. It's really submarket-driven and the nature of the demographic within that environment. We've got very high-quality towns in suburban Boston with great schools, and 2 and 3 bedrooms are -- have solid demand and ones not quite as much. And if you revert to some submarkets in L.A., the more affordable price points in studios and 1-bedrooms are in better shape as compared to the larger 2- and 3-bedroom units given the shutdown of some of the entertainment studios and such. So it's not a common theme as much as it relates to the suburban unit type as much as the specific suburban geography. Yes. Alex, this is Sean. We have to run some data on that. And I think what I would tell you is it's more industry-specific than it is typical demographic make-up in terms of gender, age, things of that sort. It tends to be self-employed, sort of freelance workers, content producers, folks like that, that have been impacted most materially. And then some of our East communities, some of the service-based sectors that have been impacted as well, whether it's foodservice, hotels, things of that sort, some of the occupations that Tim alluded to earlier in his opening remarks. So it really is more occupation-driven than anything else. Yes. Alex, this is Sean. That's a tough number to come up with. So the blunt answer is no, we don't. Unless they voluntarily come to us and say, \"Hey, I'm going to be gone for x period of time. Can you do something for me?\" That is not necessarily a tracking mechanism for that, that would give you any sense of -- any real sense of accuracy there. Not necessarily. I mean people have mail picked up. I mean you think about buildings that are 500 units and they have 1,000 people in them, it's really hard to get a sense for that unless there is something specific related to a mail hold that we're aware of or a package delivery. But I wouldn't say you could count on that as a representative sample that would give you an accurate estimate. Yes, Rob, Sean. Good question. A couple of thoughts on that, not necessarily specific data since it's a little hard to capture. But in our particular case, I mean we don't have a lot of student-oriented assets. They're pretty select across certain markets, particularly in the urban environments, I would say. But your broader question really probably relates to the percentage of the market that is really made up of the student population that sort of brings the occupancy up in the entire market. That's something, to be honest, we've been trying to get our arms around that. Not quite there yet in terms of what that represents in each one of those submarkets. But there are certain submarkets, like we have a property here in the district that's pretty tied to ABU that when they announced their plans to have a hybrid learning model, we did 80 leases in 1 week. So there are submarket stuff like that, that are highly dependent upon it. But I think the broader question is one we're still trying to answer, which is sort of collectively what the demand is. From the student population is one segment, and then from the short-term and corporate rental market is the other segment. We think the short-term corporate piece is probably in the 2% to 3% range. And we're trying to understand that in terms of the student population, particularly as universities may shift their on-campus housing options to the extent that they're trying to sort of de-densify some of those communities. So it's a little bit of a moving target. It's probably hard to answer right at this exact moment. But certainly, the peak time for that demand is, as you described, as we're moving through the pre-leasing season, that you're going to see sort of basically April through June, like you might see on some of the student housing rates. And you want to be pre-leased in those buildings in the 90%-plus range as you get towards the end of July and before they show up in August. So we're on track for that at some of the buildings, but there are places in and around urban Boston, Berkeley, places like that, where they are falling short because of the uncertainty around the ultimate learning model. Yes. And that's a -- it's probably a tough one to answer other than the stuff that's related to people that are coming in for a specific kind of program, like a training program or some other kind of corporate program, I guess, 2% to 3% of the market [Technical Difficulty] our markets. What you're really talking about is just ongoing demand as people are graduating from universities, moving into the rental market. That's a little tougher to quantify overall at this point in time."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your host for today's conference is Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Riley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Kathy, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during the discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. There's a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks. Tim?\nTim Naughton: Yes, thanks, Jason. And welcome back to Q1 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, and Matt Birenbaum. I will provide a brief commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And all of us will be available to Q&A afterwards. Our comments today will focus on providing a summary of Q1 results. An update on operations so far this year, including through April, an overview of development activity and the status of construction sites. And lastly, highlighting our liquidity position. Before getting started, I just like to acknowledge that the last seven or eight weeks have been far from normal for any of us on this call, or any of our more than 3,000 associates in AvalonBay. Given our market footprint in large coastal metro areas in the US, we've certainly been impacted by this pandemic, professional and personal level. Many of us have had to learn to adjust to a different work environment at home while managing new and shifting family dynamics at the same time. But even more of our associates have been asked to leave the comfort and safety of their homes, most every day to provide housing and service for the more than 100,000 residents that call one of our communities home. What we do is fundamentally essential, and we are grateful and inspired by our team's amazing dedication and thank them for the commitment they demonstrate every day and service to our customers. I'll start the results of the quarter starting on Slide 4. It was a solid quarter. Highlights include core FFO growth of almost 4% driven by healthy internal growth with same-store revenue and NOI growth coming in at 3.1% and 3.0%, respectively. All of our major regions except Metro New York, New Jersey, of course, the same-store revenue growth of 3% or more in Q1. In Q1, we completed the three development communities totaling $215 million at an average initial yield of 6.4%. Continue to track record of creating significant value through this platform over the cycle. Given the current economic situation, we have not started any new development or acquired any new community so far this year. And lastly, we raised over $900 million in capital this past quarter at an average initial cost of 2.9%, with most of that coming from a $700 million 10-year bond deal at 2.3% completed in February, a record low reoffer rate for a 10-year bond issuance in US REIT history. And with that, I'll turn it over to Sean who will discuss portfolio operations including what we've seen so far and in April and now in May. Sean.\nSean Breslin: All right, thanks, Tim. Turning to Slide 5, the impact of COVID-19 and the various shelter in place orders had a material impact on leasing velocity in March as noted in Chart 1, with year-over-year volume down roughly 40% from March 2019. In April, however, as a result of our teams becoming more proficient with virtual and no contact tours, prospective residents becoming more comfortable venturing out to tour apartment homes and the various incentives we offer to increase conversion rates, we've seen velocity rebounded, it was only modestly below 2019 levels. It's similar to the volume of notices to vacate for the month. Unfortunately, the reduction in leasing volume in March coincided with our normal seasonal increase in the volume of notices to move out from our communities. As noted in Chart 2, this resulted in fewer move-ins and move-outs during the month of April. Taking collectively and as depicted on Slide 6, availability increased and occupancy suffered. As indicated in Charts 1 and 2 on Slide 6, availability was trending well below 2019 levels throughout most of the first quarter. That spiked in the second half of March, when leasing velocity fell materially. 30-day availability peaked at roughly 50 basis points greater than last year, during the third week of March, but has ticked back down a bit over the past six weeks or so. The impact of reduced leasing volume in March ultimately impacted physical occupancy as well as noted in Chart 3, with April down roughly 75 basis points from March and 50 basis points from last year to 95.3%. In Chart 4, you could see the impact of the recent environment on April rent change, which ended the month at essentially zero. This diagram reflects our efforts to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on residents by offering a no rent increase lease renewal option to undecided folks, and our response to the weakening environment, which included offering incentives to increase prospective resident conversion rates, which did in fact increase from about 23% of March to 34% in April. Turning to Slide 7, we collected about 96% of what we would have typically collected in an average month from our customers, which is noted in Chart 1. And if you look at the collection rates by segment, the rate for our market rate customers was the highest, with our corporate housing or short term rental customers, which only represent 3% of build residential revenue, the lowest. In terms of May collections, over the past few days, we're trending at about 94.5% of normal levels or about 150 basis points behind April, but it's early in the month. There are differences in how the calendar lays out with deferrals being on a Friday in May versus a Wednesday in April, and other nuances that influence daily payment volume. Moving to Slide 8, the collection rate for our highest income customers has been the best, which isn't too surprising given the impact of the pandemic on the various service-related businesses throughout our markets. In terms of regional collection rates, the tech lead Pacific Northwest and California regions have been the strongest and Southern California the weakest. Unfortunately, the impact of the pandemic on entertainment and tourism businesses in Southern California has been pretty severe. Most of the studios and other businesses producing content have been shut down for several weeks now. And all the major tourism-related sites, including Disneyland, Universal Studios, and many other venues are closed. Without operational overview, I'll turn it over to Matt who will address construction and development. Matt?\nMatt Birenbaum: All right. Great. Thanks, Sean. To provide an update on how the pandemic is impacting our construction operations, Slide 9 shows our 19 development communities across our eight regions. We started to experience slowdowns in the second half of March in Northern California and Seattle as regional shelter in place, orders were announced and availability of both labor and sections started to be impacted. By early April, the Northeast saw similar impacts, as such in April across all 19 projects. Our average daily manpower was reduced by an average of roughly 50% with wide variations as reflected on the slide. Projects indicated in green have seen relatively little impact, while those in yellow have been proceeding at a significantly reduced pace, and those in red are temporarily shut down except for basic life safety and asset preservation activity. Residential Construction is considered an essential activity in many jurisdictions. And just in the last week or so, we started to see a listing of some of the more extreme restrictions. And the four projects in Seattle in the Bay Area just recently moved from red to yellow. We have been working diligently to adjust our on-site health and safety practices to ensure appropriate social distancing among our subcontractor trade partners, add daily health checks and onsite wash stations and move our supervisory staff to staggered shifts as part of our ongoing response. These 19 development communities represent a projected total capital cost of $2.4 billion, which is our lowest volume of development underway since 2013. As shown on Slide 10, we shifted to a more cautious stance as far back as 2017. And our development stocks over the past few years have average shift $800 million, a little more than half of our mid-cycle run rate of $1.4 billion per year. This puts us in a strong position as we navigate the shift from expansion to recession. Slide 11 shows a breakdown of our future development rights. We've been managing this pipeline of future growth opportunities to provide us with maximum flexibility at relatively modest cost and control over $4 billion of next cycle development projects with a total investment of just $120 million. The development rights pipeline includes 28 different projects, with more than 20% of the projected capital in flexible public-private partnership deals, and another 20% in an -- in asset densification opportunities, where we are pursuing entitlements to add additional apartment homes at existing stabilized communities. Both of these types of opportunities offer flexibility to align timing with favorable conditions in the construction and capital markets. Kevin will now provide some comments on our liquidity and balance sheet.\nKevin O'Shea: Thanks, Matt. Moving to Slide 12, as shown in the next two slides, we ended this recession very well prepared from a financial perspective with a healthier liquidity position, modest near term maturities and a well-positioned balance sheet. Turning first to liquidity As you can see on Slide 12, liquidity at quarter-end, totaled $1.8 billion, for our credit facility and cash on hand. This compares to the $900 million in remaining expenditures and development underway over the next several years, of which about $400 million is expected to be spent over the remainder of 2020. As a result, at quarter end, our $1.8 billion in liquidity exceeds remaining spend on development in 2020 by roughly $1.4 billion and our liquidity exceeds total remaining spend on development over the next several years, by nearly $1 billion. Turning next to our debt maturities. On Slide 13, we show our debt maturities over the next 10 years and our key credit metrics. For debt maturities, we have only $70 million of debt maturing in late 2020 and only $330 million dollars in debt maturing in 2021, for a total of $400 million in debt maturities over the next seven quarters. Plus looking at over the balance of 2020, and incorporating both development spend and debt maturities, our quarter and liquidity of $1.8 billion exceeds remaining debt maturities and spend on development over the rest of 2020 by $1.3 billion. In addition, our liquidity exceeds all of our main development spending over the next several years. And all of our debt maturities through 2021 are $500 million. So you can see from this, that we enjoy healthy liquidity relative to our open commitments through 2021. In addition, we also enjoy considerable incremental liquidity from cash flow from operations and excessive dividends, as well as from our ability to source attractively priced debt capital from the unsecured and secured debt markets, to the extent the asset and equity markets remain unattractively priced. In this regard, at quarter end our net debt to core EBITDA of 4.6 times is below our target range of five times to six times leaving us meaningful capacity to absorb leverage increases as we proceed through these challenging times. And unencumbered NOI with at or near an all-time high of 93%, reflecting a large, unencumbered pool of assets that we could tap if necessary for additional secured debt capital. With that, I'll turn it back to Tim.\nTim Naughton: Great. Thanks, Kevin. Just wrapping up and turning now to Slide 14. So, overall, Q1 was a very good quarter, with results a bit better than we had expected. Despite the slowdown, we began to experience in the second half of March and April, we felt much of the impact of the shutdown, certainly, although we were able to still coalesce most of what was built for the month with only 6% uncollected by month-end, which is about 400 basis points lower than normal. Progress at many of our construction sites were impacted by the pandemic. We expect that orders by some of the state and local governments temporarily halt inspections and construction will result in the delay and delivery options scheduled in several communities, which in turn will push some of the lease-up NOI projected for 2020 into next year. Most sites that have been impacted are currently in the process of either reopening or slowly returning to full manpower, as most states are now permitting new construction as an essential service as Matt had mentioned. Our shadow pipeline of $4 billion in development rights, which is controlled mostly through options or represent densification opportunities at existing communities offers good flexibility in terms of timing future starts well supported by market conditions. And lastly, as Kevin just mentioned, we're in great shape financially. We have ample liquidity to fund existing investment commitments, modest level of debt maturing over the next several quarters, and strong access at attractive pricing to the debt markets. So with that, Kathy, we're ready to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Nicholas Joseph from Citi.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. Hope you guys are doing well. Just first, maybe on construction on the delays that you've seen and also being seen really across the space. So just wondering how that impacts expected supply in 2020? And on average, how long you think individual projects will be delayed in terms of deliveries?\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure, Nick, this is Matt. In terms of what happens to total delivery in 2020, obviously, I think it's too early to tell. What we found the last couple of years, even before the pandemic was that deliveries wound up being 10% to 15%, below what we had thought at the beginning of the year just due to flavor constraints, inspection constraints, and so on and so certainly, I would expect more deliveries to be down by more than that relative to what maybe third party reports were at the beginning of the year. But it really depends obviously, on how things play out over the next couple of months. As it relates to our pipelines, so far, what we've seen is, and what's reflected on our supplemental, five projects, we've delayed initial occupancy by a couple of months, call it, and these projects we -- as of right now, we think probably the final completion is going to be delayed by about a quarter. So that's maybe a third of our 19 that are actively underway right now. Some of the others are either in areas that have been less impacted or early enough in their process that they haven't been materially slowed down. Obviously, that could change, but kind of that's the way you see it as of right now.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then just -- states and different cities start to reopen, how are you thinking about kind of repositioning your amenities space to allow for social distancing? And then maybe medium and longer term for the developments on the progress or any kind of future developments, how do you think about changes to different amenity space, given maybe potential bigger picture trends, such as work from home or anything else?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Nick, this is Sean. I'll take that one, the third and others can jump in if they like. But in terms of the existing amenity space, yes, we do have a team that is taking a look at what the occupancy standards are for different types of spaces. Not only in our communities, but at our offices as well. And what kind of limitations that will place on the occupancy limits that were in place before the pandemic, so they're going to see that reduced pretty materially, but it depends on the type of space. Depending on what they're talking about, fitted center equipment with space two feet apart, we may have to go back and redistribute the equipment to have more spacing as an example. Chill spaces where there were, what's called soft seating that was side by side with tables around, that may have to be a space where we just reduce the number of items in there, in terms of chairs and same thing in terms of our swimming pool. So, there's a fair amount of work underway to sort of, redensify the various spaces that our communities to make sure they comply with the proper social distancing protocols, and it's just going to take some time to work through each one. And then in terms of the longer term trend, it's probably a little too early to tell now but certainly there was a trend, see more people working from home, whether they were telecommuting, or whether they were just sort of independent contractors working from home, that are producing content or -- and sort of contracting business and things of that sort for different types of industries. Entertainment, in particular, comes to mind for a place like LA, so that trend likely continue. I think it's probably a reasonable conclusion from what we see. But to what degree, it's probably too early to tell at this point.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you.\nTim Naughton: Yes.\nOperator: And we'll take your next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore.\nRich Hightower: Good afternoon, guys. Hope all is well. So I wanted to get your reaction to one of your competitor's comments yesterday, regarding a little bit more underperformance in garden style communities versus high rises, due to the collections Are you seeing the same in your portfolio or do you have any comments along those lines?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Rich. It's Sean. I can share a few thoughts on that just -- we've looked at collection rates in maybe a few different ways. Certainly, we talked about it by segmenting in terms of what was presented on the slides in my prepared remarks. But in terms of some other metrics that we look at and have been following, first is sort of price point, As versus Bs. As are running about 100 basis points higher than Bs at this point in time. And that may look suburban, urban. What we're generally seeing across most of the markets is, suburbans are performing by about 25 basis points or so. So a little bit, but not terribly material. Probably the one exception is New York where the urban environment collection rate better than the suburbs, given the impact we've seen in Westchester. It's been pretty material in terms of the pandemic. And then in terms of high rise versus garden and mid-rise, high rise is slightly better, but there's not a lot of high rise products to benchmark against to be honest. And most of that for our portfolio is going to be in New York, a little bit in D.C. It's just not a big sample size, so I probably wouldn't draw too many conclusions about the product type differences.\nRich Hightower: Okay, so maybe a little bit of differentiation there in terms of what you're seeing versus maybe I guess elsewhere in re-planned. Okay, that's helpful color. And then I guess just as you think about foot traffic and demand patterns picking up now that we're into May and things have kind of come off the bottom, are you seeing any differentiation between suburban and urban within the portfolio along those lines?\nSean Breslin: Not material at this point. It's more market driven, I'd say, where you've got -- certainly the hot spots are a little more sensitive to the rebound and we're seeing people wanting to still continue with more of the virtual tours as opposed to self-guided, as opposed to maybe like the Mid-Atlantic, where people seem to be more comfortable given the state of the environment, either with self-guided tours, for the most part at this point, and not as many virtual tours. So I think it's really a market based on [ph] as opposed to maybe price point at this point or location, as you pointed out, urban versus suburban.\nRich Hightower: Okay, great. Thank you\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. \nAlua Askarbek: Hi, everyone. This is actually Alua Askarbek for Jeff Spector. Thank you for taking the questions today. So I was just wondering if you guys could give some more color on the condo sales going on right now. So I think you went one more under contract in Q4 '19 on the call. And so, I was just wondering -- I assume all of those were the ones that were closed so far. And are there any new projects underway? Is the market as expected or are you expecting to take a lot of price cuts or are you just holding out [ph]?\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure. This is Matt. I think some people couldn't hear the question. It was about Columbus Circle condos sales and recent progress. So as of today, we have 41 units closed and have generated 1$29 million. That's an average price of $3.15 million per condo. We have 22 others under contract with binding deposits. That represents another $70 million of proceeds. It's actually slightly higher priced, $3.17 million, $3.18 million per unit. The sales activity -- the new contract track activity was pretty strong in January and February. In fact, if you go back to our first quarter call, we had 54 contracts at that time. So we've actually added nine since then, about $40 million in incremental sales since the first quarter call. And really all that came in February in the first half of March because once the stay-at-home orders came into place, we went to 100% virtual tours in mid-March with our sales agents there, and traffic did slow dramatically in the back half of March and the early half of April. I will say in the last just two weeks or three weeks, traffic has picked back up. And although they're virtual tours, traffic is back up to over 30 per week, which is a pretty strong number and comparable to where it was kind of before things stopped in mid-March. But until people can actually get in and physically see the product, which we hope they'll be able to do within the next month or so, we won't really know how that traffic might convert to additional contracts. Pricing has been consistent. We haven't really seen a difference in terms of the pricing levels, either asking or what we're achieving, for the last 10, or 15, 20 contracts in the early contracts. It's a -- there's a lot of different price points in the building, depending on what line and what floor. And so, it's not exactly apples to apples. But so far, we haven't seen any impact there yet. But again, until we really get people back into the building and start seeing some additional new contract activity, which hopefully will happen soon, we'll have a better sense.\nAlua Askarbek: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street Advisors.\nJohn Pawlowski: Hey, thanks. Sean, as you guys roll out concessions in different markets, which markets are responding better, in terms of traffic coming in and the rollout specials? And which few markets just aren't responding no matter how generous [indiscernible] become?\nSean Breslin: I mean, the general response has been pretty healthy across most of the markets. I mean, I guess I'd have to tell you that based on what you probably have heard from others and are -- just pointing out some of the weakness in L.A., probably taking slightly more concessions on average in the L.A. market as compared to others to get those conversion rates to sort of reasonable levels. But in terms of the rebound, for the most part, I would say that it's been pretty steady with some limited exceptions, and the exceptions really more relate to hotspots, and obviously, specifically in and around New York, where people are still pretty hesitant, given the environment, to be out shopping for apartments, people are doing virtual tours, and the concessions are reasonable, but not as much as what was required in L.A. to get people to spur to action to give us -- given what was happening in that market environment, which was already weak, as you may recall, at the beginning the year. And the pandemic certainly only made it that much more difficult in terms of people who are qualified being able to come out and shop for an apartment and be able to afford to rent an apartment, given what was happening with all the studios being closed. And a lot of people that produce content in Southern California, with their shops being closed. So that's probably the one market where it's been a little more challenging.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then last one for me, just a question about D.C. and the defensiveness of that market. Obviously, a winner on a relative basis during the GFC. In your mind, the price point of your portfolio in the D.C. metro and the employer base, now that it's shifted, is D.C. different this time, or would you still put it up there against any other market the next 12 months, 24 months, just in terms of rent growth and occupancy trends?\nSean Breslin: I think based on what we know as of now, and just thinking about the composition of the workforce, I think D.C. should hold up relatively well. If you think about the nature of the pandemic and how things have started, and the impact on joblessness to date for the most part, as opposed to kind of a trickle down, it's really a trickle up type thing where a lot of the job loss is heavily concentrated at those lower level service jobs. You're talking about food service or bars, restaurants, hotel workers, things of that sort. It may trickle up some. And in certain geographies, where people are paid well, again, like L.A., to produce content, maybe disproportionate impact. But D.C., highly educated population, a lot of professional services, defense, et cetera. But expected to hold up relatively well. And we've seen that thus far, even though it's only been sort of six weeks at this point in terms of what's happening. But others may have different thoughts to add.\nTim Naughton: No, I agree. I mean, between the knowledge base, knowledge nature of the economy, the federal government, state local governments are going to be pinched and are beginning to see cutbacks there. But not as much in areas of the federal government. I think it's just saying that -- I think D.C. was hurt a little bit initially just because our of exposure to hospitality. You have obviously both Hilton and Marriott here, which had massive furloughs kind of early on in the pandemic. But I think I think over time, Sean is right. I would expect it to stand up pretty well relative to the rest of the world, John.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I was curious if you were to negotiate a new contract today on a construction project, what do you think hard cost would be versus pre-COVID-19?\nMatt Birenbaum: Good question, Austin. It's Matt. We certainly think the direction is headed down. I think as you see here in this very moment, I'm not sure that you would see that yet. And several of our projects, we have decided to defer. One of the reasons we deferred some of our potential 2020 starts is because we think that there will be a better buying opportunity in, I don't know, three quarters, four quarters maybe. So I think it takes a while to work its way through the system, and probably we'll see it first in some of the early trades were -- like concrete or site -- or paving where deals aren't starting. Those folks will start to see they have excess capacity and probably start to cut the pricing first. They'll probably take longer before it gets to some of the finished trades where there's funding stuff underway and that's need to be finished, and if anything, may take longer than finished over the next four quarters to six quarters. So one of the advantages we have is because 90% plus of our construction, we are our own general contractor. We can kind of time that and play that strategically a little more than if we were using a third-party general contractor, which is the way a lot of the private side of the business works. So still too early to tell. We'll see what happens. In the last downturn, it was down maybe 15%. And that was an extreme correction. But time will tell. I think Tim wanted to add something.\nTim Naughton: Yes, Austin. I just would say, I think going into this, obviously, we've seen a lot of pressure on construction costs. We've probably been seeing 6% to 8% increases for the last three years. So it was probably already well roughed terrain, and that provides us with a bit more conviction that we're likely to see a correction. And certainly in terms of wages, commodities, materials, profits of subcontractors, those should all come down, putting downward pressure on pricing. Offsetting that somewhat, we would expect a little bit general conditions just given changing protocol, social distancing, things like that. And perhaps, productivity being a little bit strained, offset again by -- as subcontractors start to reduce their workforce, they're left often with their most productive crews, and you oftentimes get cost benefits from that, as you come out of a downturn in the early part of an expansion. So overall, we do expect cost to come down. They're going to need to just to make sense of the economics, given NOIs are flat, on their way down and account for costs, if anything, are up since the beginning of the pandemic. Looking for sort of a bargain in the equity markets, obviously.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That's really helpful. I mean, you guys had previously expected to start $900 million. That I think you alluded to. Some of those projects you delayed purposefully would be potential for cost to come in. What percent of that $900 million of cost is fully baked at this point? \nTim Naughton: I would say none of it. I mean are you talking about the cost or the start commitment? We haven't committed to starting anything with year.\nAustin Wurschmidt: The cost on some of our projects.\nTim Naughton: The only cost that would be baked would be where we bought the land already. I think two of those nine -- and we did buy two parcels of land in the first quarter deals that could have been or could be 2020 starts. So we spent $38 million on those two deals so far. A little bit of the soft cost is baked, but we haven't bought any of the construction on any of those jobs.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Okay. Understood. Thank you. And then last one for me, Kevin, maybe to pull you in here a bit. The balance sheet's certainly in great shape. But if you don't start any or only a small subset of that $900 million, where do you expect leverage to finish the year?\nKevin O'Shea: Yes. I mean, Austin, we're probably going to have to throw out a more fulsome update on what we expect our capital plan to be for 2020 when we have our mid-year call and provide -- have clear visibility on a whole range of things, including not only NOI, but also investment activity and capital markets activity. We're standing right now at remarkably low leverage level of net debt to EBITDA at 4.6 times versus the target range of five to six times and that's intentional. We very much drove that leverage number down over the last few years to give us more scope and more capacity as we might have to put it through a downturn and so we find ourselves in the spot we had hoped we would be, which provides us an awful lot of flexibility to respond the opportunities that may present themselves here in the coming months, as well as capacity to take on Dennis levy the full true incremental development spent. But as I pointed out in my opening remarks regarding abundant liquidity here relative to our open commitments here in the near term and from a capital plant standpoint, although we went through valiance. When we provide our guidance, our initial expectation was to raise external capital of $1.4 billion. We've already raised $900 million of that so through the year and raise two-thirds of what we initially hoped to raise. We may not need to raise as much as all that but I think the bottom line answer to your question is why we haven't upgraded our guidance. I think our capital needs going forward are pretty modest and so you can probably looking at the balance sheet in terms of absolute debt levels where it is. It's probably not going to change a whole lot from here based on what we know today.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That's helpful. I guess I was getting it. It seems like it could be lower to the extent you get some leaps up and you don't have the incremental spend but we'll wait and see what you have to say in 2Q. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Sumit [ph] in for Nick. Thank you for taking the question. Just following up on the development discussion. You mentioned as a footnote that you've lowered the yields on your development. I'm just wondering if you could give a little more color as to what kind of introduction you're looking at for near term or development or developments in research versus a stock that's going out in 2021, 2022?\nMatt Birenbaum: Sorry, can you repeat the question? This is Matt. The question was about the yield shown on the development?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. You footnoted yield as slightly reduced saying that you brought down the yield or you brought down assumptions for development nearing completion [indiscernible]. So just trying to get a sense of what's the split in the yield reduction particularly for developments that are more near term in 2020?\nMatt Birenbaum: As a general rule, our practice has been that when a deal gets more than 20% leased then we kind of remark the rents to market to reflect the experience that we're actually having. Until that time, we tend to carry the rents at what we initially underwrote. So we've talked for years about the fact that we don't trend rents and that's what we mean by that. In this particular release, we only have the three deals that are completed and in that case, those rents reflect the actual rent roll in place. Those are all more than 90% leased but is on the schedule. Then there's three other communities where we have enough leasing done that we've reflected the most current rents there on the chart there on Attachment 8. The other 16 assets, we haven't done enough leasing yet so those are still the original pro forma rents. That's consistent with what our practice has always been. I guess we did add a note just to make clear that we have not endeavored to update those because of any changes in the environment related to the pandemic. We're still carrying in some grants that were in the initial pro forma. When we get leasing activity, we will adjust them accordingly. So it's really not any change from our current practice. I think it was just an additional disclosure to make sure I understood that. It's a more volatile environment than it's been. Sean, do you want to talk to how they're currently leased?\nSean Breslin: Yes, just to add one thing on that as Matt indicated. Just for the first quarter, there were six assets in lease. If you look across the rents for those six assets, four of them were producing rents at that time average for the quarter that were above the original proforma. One was equivalent to our original proforma and one deal in northern Seattle was modestly below our original proforma. But you blend all that together rents at that point in time were roughly 3% above proforma were at $80 or so but there were some cost changes on those deals. So the net reduction in yield really was only about 10 basis points to a weighted average of 5.9 so really immaterial in the context of the whole basket.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you so much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Guinee with Stifel.\nJohn Guinee: Great, John Guinee here. Two quick questions. One is, has this situation given you any thoughts on speeding up or slowing down into other markets such as South Florida and Denver? Then second, if there is a slowdown in development stats in 2020, how would that affect G&A and interest costs in 2021 as you need to -- you can no longer capitalized people and development interest expense?\nTim Naughton: John, this Tim Naughton. Maybe take the first and Kevin if you want to take the second piece of it or not. With respect to our market footprint, as we talked about in the past, we had to potentially diversify a bit of our exposure to the larger cost markets into other knowledge economy type markets part of what drove entry into Denver and to Southeast Florida for sure. There have been other markets that have been on screen as well. We've been pretty active in terms of our investment in both those markets, both in terms of acquisitions and in the development and also funding third party developers. We've tried to really activate all the levers, if you will, with respect to those markets. So we really haven't been held back by desire to get in those markets. It's a function as much of opportunity as anything. We'd expect that to continue. That will make you tend to trim from some markets and recycle some capital or they tend to make sense to the balance sheet, invest capital in those markets so we can do that as well. But right now, it's more to debt and asset recycling. So I don't think anything's changed there. We'll continue to evaluate other markets that we think could make sense for us in the long term that we think are over indexed to the innovation economy and therefore we think we'll outperform over a long period of time from a demand standpoint. I think your second question had to do with G&A around development. I can maybe start that and Kevin if you want to come in. We're always going to try to right-size the development organization to what we need and the opportunities for the next two, three years. To the extent we delay deals this year, it means we're probably going to have more stacking up in 2021 or 2022. So part of it is to make sure that you're properly positioned not just for what you have to do for the next six months but really for the platform over the next three or four years. To the extent, this becomes a very protracted recession but that changes the calculus obviously. That's not how we're viewing the environment today. We are viewing this as kind of a slow build up from a sharp downturn. If we do see a meaningful contraction and construction costs to the balance of 2020 then you start to see some recovery in 2021. You start to see 2022, 2023 could be a really good time to be delivering the product which would argue for heightened starts in 2020. We want to make sure we've got the right type development and construction organization really over the next three or four years, not just over the next six months and not much has changed in terms of our view that it needs to change material. In part because we'd already brought it down from as Matt had mentioned around $1.4 billion to roughly $800 million sort of late cycle. It's already sized for late-cycle downturn type dynamics. Kevin?\nKevin O'Shea: You'll need to cover things and as a result of some of those that decline and start bawling. We did have some recent staff reductions in our cap odds groups last year and so when we put our budget together for this year, we did expect capitalized overhead for 2020 to be a bit below what it was in 2019. If you look at what happened the first quarter catalog overhead did sequentially increase a little bit in the first quarter due to a few one-time items such as increased benefits and payroll costs but for full year 2020 we would expect that that catalog overhead runway would decline in the back half of the year somewhat based on what we know today.\nJohn Guinee: Great, thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Alex Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlex Goldfarb: Good afternoon. Just two questions from me. One, in the beliefs about the impact of locked fees $1.4 million per month, can you just talk about your expectations? I'm assuming the eviction moratorium market, obviously, they're no late fees. Then you based on wherever you don't have amenities open, you aren't charging amenities so how should we think about this $1.4 million a month? Is that something you should be thinking about for the next few months or is your view that within whatever maybe by mid-summer, a bunch of communities will fully be open where this number won't be as big as it is right now?\nSean Breslin: Alex, this is Sean. Just to use some perspective of about 80% of that $1.4 million was in way of commentary amenity fees because our amenities are closed. So our expectation is you're going to see a slow build of that line item over the next few months. As the states begin to reopen, we resize our occupancy limits as I was describing earlier in response to a question and then it will slowly rebuild. We don't expect it to snap back I guess I would say, just because the pace of opening is going to be different by jurisdiction based on the local market environment, but that's the majority of it that should fully rebuild. The rest of it was small stuff related to some late fees and credit card convenience fees and things of that sort.\nAlex Goldfarb: Okay. Then on your line of credit, you guys had drawn the $750 million and then you quickly paid -- you just paid back the $535 million. It sounds like you have about $150 million or so rough numbers on condo sales. It's pretty quick that you guys pulled down and then paid it back so what shifted in your thinking? Was it more that hey, we weren't sure if banks were going to fund or we weren't sure if the Fed was going to be there or was it just once you guys delayed a bunch of projects, suddenly you realize that you didn't need all that money at once?\nKevin O'Shea: Hey, Alex, this is Kevin. We drew a portion of our line of credit, basically so that $750 million out of $1.75 billion in mid-March. We really did it on a precautionary basis not because of anything in our business, not because of our development activities, not because we had any particular use. We didn't have commercial paper. There was really nothing related to AvalonBay that caused us to draw that $750 million. Instead, it was really just a reaction to the initial stage of the pandemic and its impact on the capital markets and before the Fed had fully stepped in to stabilize the markets. So it was really done on a precautionary basis to ensure that we had greater control over the capital. That would give us incremental abundant time and room to maneuver through what we thought would be a choppy set of months ahead of us.\nTim Naughton: Maybe just to straighten that out. Once the Fed came in, obviously, the bond markets became very constructive and we had thought as split [indiscernible] the bond market if we needed to, so that was the reason that ultimately we just paid back.\nAlex Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. First question, this whole thing started to take effect at the beginning of what would be considered the heavy leasing season for multifamily. My first guess was perhaps that was a good thing but then I thought about it, maybe it was a bad thing because there was more activity and tenants maybe had an arrow in their quiver to negotiate. So what do you think? Not that we could have changed it but do you think the industry or yourself was negatively impacted by the timing or how do you think that played out from a cadence standpoint?\nTim Naughton: Rich, you know, it's hard to now, I mean, you know what that would say when you're in the complacencies [ph], it only gets most of our rent growth for the year -- you have both the benefit of a better market pricing and more leasing velocity so your rent roll is increasing. You kind of earn it all kind of in that March to July timeframe and obviously that's a challenge right now. We have a lot of things in our control, we haven't gotten any of them.\nRich Anderson: Yes, I mean, come on, can you guys do anything right? The second question is perhaps a more realistic and longer term. So you guys are, are thought of as sort of visionaries and I don't know if you're different, you know, product types and price points came out of the Great Recession, but let's pretend for the sake of this question that it did. Do you feel like that there's an evolution to multifamily as a consequence of all this, maybe more comparable with the work from home environment, maybe more of a build out of internal office space or technology enhancements or laser printers or whatever might people be needing right now that they don't have because they're working from home? Is that something that you think or maybe there's another alternative about how a multifamily will evolve out of this? Do you do you have any idea it's or have you thought about it at all about what the change -- the basic fundamentals of the industry might look like five years from now?\nTim Naughton: In terms of the math there, I think that's going to continue to be driven by the nature of the households. And there's been such great growth in single person households. That's literally what drives demand for our business. It's -- most of our households are singles and professional couples, very, very few children. You know it -- but the terms of kind of the product and the service, you know, I do think you probably see some of this either work from home type. There's already a trend that's already -- I think that Sean alluded to in some of his remarks. I think there's a good basis for expecting that. That might accelerate a bit. We had already started putting co-working, you know, lounges and spaces with meeting rooms in all of our -- all of our communities, and they are making it feel perfect now. Just a little bit -- bit more space, but they're pretty good size to begin with. And if you think about it, from a resident standpoint, they might prefer that environment to Starbucks, which is a much more controlled environment. They're going to sort of work from, they're going to work from some place other than other than -- other than the office. I think -- I think there's been a movement towards a much bigger, grander fitness centers, I think you're going to continue to see that. People are going to have more faith and comfort in working out in a community with their peers and, you know, maybe a large, you know, large club with a bunch of high schoolers who are cleaning up equipment, and things like that. And then, within the unit, you know, another trend that had already started, I think it might accelerate, it's just more flexible, open unit spaces, lifting where the nature of the space can change during the course of the day based on kind of where you are in your day, where kitchen, dining spaces convert to office spaces. My office space is an apartment community right across the street. And I noticed a number of people that sort of set up their desks right up against the window. I don't think that's where it was, to be honest, to spend good part of their -- good part of their day there now. So I think people start to think about that in terms of -- in terms of unit design, that, you know, folks may be using the space more during the day than they have -- than they have historically. And then, certainly just the need for, you know, broadband and, high speed and reliability, there, anything that we can do to kind of support that. And I guess lastly, I just mentioned kind of, kind of the Smart Home initiative, which you know, a lot of folks are pursuing now, but I think one of the most intriguing aspects of that is the remote entry, being able to allow goods and services to sort of flow freely throughout, throughout community rather than having to be handled by somebody in the front desk or in a central office that people can get -- can get access right up to the unit and potentially right end of the unit to the extent that the, you know, resident has to step away. So, I think you'll see, you know, all those things that were trends anyway, you know, perhaps just accelerated result of this.\nRich Anderson: Really good color. Thanks, Tim. Appreciate it.\nTim Naughton: Sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Hardik Goel with Zelman.\nHardik Goel: Hey, sorry, guys. Can you hear me?\nTim Naughton: Yes, go ahead.\nHardik Goel: Thank you. I was just wondering if I look into it development pipeline, I know Matt talked about how [indiscernible] update them when there's 100% -- but if you look at the development pipeline that's going to deliver 2021, late 2021 or mid-2021 and beyond. How do you feel about the underwritten yield on those? I know there's a lot of uncertainty but what kind of buffer is there? Where you would still underwrite it today?\nMatt Birenbaum: Hey, Hardik, it's Matt. You know, the deals that are delivering in 2021 -- first deliveries in 2021 are deals that generally were started in the last year if call it, you know, because otherwise they'd be delivering sooner than that. So on those deals, you know, I guess we'll just we'll see what happens right. I think it's fundamentally it's going to depend on what happens in market rents. We'll have them analyzed, you know, they -- some of those deals were higher yielding deals in first place just because of the geography of where they were. So, you know that, in theory, I guess gives you a little more room. But I don't think, and there's a few that are early enough that we might actually realize a little bit of construction costs -- and as I mentioned, we are, in some cases shifting from trying to get as quickly as possible to slow it down a little bit to take advantage of, hopefully, what could be a better market to buy construction services in a few quarters. But, yes, I mean, you know, the risk there is the same as the risk in the stabilized portfolio. You know, it's just the risk of what happens to you know, market rents between now and then.\nHardik Goel: I guess I'll just add to that. I think we're going to first recognize those deals are capitalized and in a different capital environment. So you got to figure, you know, with both cost of capital as well as -- as well as the underlying fundamentals, but as you saw Sean's remarks, rents in April were pretty flat on a year-over-year basis, I think there's a basis for believing that they should continue to come down. We've lost 20% of our workforce, and even if three quarters of that comes back as states start to open up, we're still looking at 8% unemployment, and you know, likely see, you know, flat there may be slightly negative household growth, while we're still delivering some new supplies. So that's going to take its toll in the near term on. And as I mentioned before, I think, you know, it's ultimately it's, you know, we could see a pretty -- pretty strong, you know, late 2021 and 2022 delivery. People who start doing what we're doing, which is blank start, and you start to have, you know, a dearth of deliveries at a time and maybe economies starting to really regain its footing.\nKevin O'Shea: No, just kind of one other thing Hardik. As you think about sort of development, how it flows through our earnings from a business model standpoint and compare it perhaps to the last downturn. As you know, we've emphasized [indiscernible] funded we are with respect to long term capital being sourced to fund the development underway. And really at Q1, we were about over 80% match funded with long term capital against the development that's underway. So that's an important point. Tim touched on in his antics but I really do think that's -- as you think about AvalonBay and how we might perform here in the coming years, it's an important distinction to draw in terms of how we are positioned from a balance sheet and funding point of view and a built in accretion point of view with respect to development, relative to say the last downturn we had a lot more -- much more in the way of open and unfunded development commitments. At time when 12 years ago developments were coming in at 5%or 6% yield and funding with that cost around 6%. Today is very different. We'll see whether the yields really shape out to be. But we know you know, debt cost for us on a 10-year basis today are probably somewhere in the 2% range. So, and we don't really need much of that at all. And we're already over 80% match-funded and the development underway. So we really are in terrific shape from that standpoint, that sort of benefit from, you know, painting profit growth on the 80% or so that we've already paid for this underway. And to this extent, we have to source incremental capital and use debt to do so; that's likely to be an additional source of accretion.\nHardik Goel: That's just from my standpoint, guys. I have no problem with the balance sheet, I'd never have. I find it confusing when people are, you know, kind of begging you for that. And it's resulted in you guys holding $750 million on your balance sheet. It's kind of crazy to me. There's no issues with the balance sheet at all. You guys have been doing this for two decades and people still get nervous about this, but I was thinking more about the IRRs. And Matt and Tim, all you guys have talked about you know the 9% to 12% range through the cycle. To get 9% on assets started during the last downturn, maybe 12% in your best assets. What I'm trying to understand is on an IRR basis, obviously these things will lease up more slowly if they're coming on in a stressed environment. What is the IRR on the developments that are, you know, kind of 2021 and beyond? Is that a 9% number, 10% number, what does that number look like?\nKevin O'Shea: Yes, we have shared with you in the past, at least what, you know, last couple cycles where we had, yes, when we started deals kind of late in the cycle and delivered into a downturn. Those were -- at one point you can't run out 10-15 yards, they are what was in fields that you start at the beginning cycle or in the downturn at least up at the early stages like -- I think we saw ranges from -- it narrows over time, as you turn out the time horizon from 10 years. But over 10 years, right, but I think we were so clear on our cost of capital [indiscernible]; I think on the low end, it was around 8.5%. On the high end it was 13.5% range. So, you know, I would say, you know, it's going to be, you know, something feels better, that weren't -- that were sort of time -- the worst that started with construction costs peaky and delivering in the depressed environment. I think there could still be high single digit kind of hang around; and have deals that we start in 2021 and 2022, it could be much better than that.\nHardik Goel: Got it. Thank you. Some great color.\nKevin O'Shea: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho\nHaendel St. Juste: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick couple of for me here. Just going back to April [indiscernible]. I guess, collections show the market rate collections, I've seen some of this is income and claims related but I get more surprised it's even more meaningful lag in the corporate apartments business or can you just to help us to identify or help us understand what are the key reasons [indiscernible] rent collection? And what's supposed to lead that?\nTim Naughton: Okay, you were a little muffled on some of it, but I heard the collection rate in the quadrant. And yes, it is more. I mean, the way I think about it is these are the kind of corporate profit home providers. It's not a corporation per se that are the end users here, but sort of intermediary that are, you know, essentially, that has a sales team that have reached agreements with various corporations or have a booking site essentially, that's the marketplace. And then, they are leasing units from us and many other -- of our peers and others. And those there, you know, think of it I guess I'll call it sort of like an extended stay hotel almost where the bookings basically dried up pretty quickly. And somehow some longer term states from people who were there on consulting assignments for three or four months, they'll bleed out a little bit longer. And there are others who really were running more short term, 30 days. And their demand evaporated more quickly. So, yes, we're working through the process with them just as we work with other residents in terms of referrals and plans and things like that. But you know, that's why the collection rate was quite a bit lower than what we'd see from our market rate apartments, which is generally higher quality residents, good household incomes, as indicated in my prepared remarks about the slide to be addressed.\nHaendel St. Juste: That's helpful. Thank you. So just wanted to be clear, but ultimately, who is on the hook to the right, is it the individual or the corporate sponsor?\nTim Naughton: The intermediary is technically our credit. That's who we're dealing with. But their ability to pay certainly is based on what occupancy rates they have across their portfolio and to the extent they're 75% occupied with good corporate clients. That's what they can pretty much pay. Not many of these companies have, but none of them really have a really strong balance sheet to be able to handle, you know, three or four months without payments or 25% to 50% occupancy. So the nature of the pandemic and how long it lasts and the impact on travel [indiscernible] the next few months.\nHaendel St. Juste: So, can you also -- what percentage of the tours you've been conducting this year in April or early May have been virtual? And how the conversion rate on those virtual tours compares to more traditional tours historically, and are you finding that -- you did talk a bit more incentives to get the virtual tours to sign officially?\nTim Naughton: Yes, good question. You know, I don't have that right in front of me in terms of the composition of it, but I mean, I would say that virtual tours, you know, for our business, you know, are not nearly as effective as self-guided tours or escorted tours. But given the nature of the pandemic, it was actually nice to see a rebound activity in April, people are getting more comfortable with commercial to work. As you know, online through our website, or in some cases, we had community consultants that would basically do FaceTime through individual units. And then some of that was really at the discretion of the customer where they didn't want to come through with someone. They were fine doing it virtually. So, I think it's evolving but certainly reflects the nature of the business and where it's going in the future in our view, and the technology investments that we're making, and we're already making that we may accelerate as it relates to technology and support. A lot of the sort of no contact type activity between our staff and our customers and our prospective customers. And that includes various things on the tour side and move in. We see the packages and even on the maintenance side, where we're doing diagnostic call via FaceTime and other via -- other tools to try and diagnose issues for customers being able to sort of self-serve and self-help, in many cases, before actually someone to go to a unit. So I think this will just accelerate some of the things that we've already counter-putting as far as overall platform that will lead to more efficiencies in the future.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Thank you for that.\nOperator: There is showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Tim Naughton for any additional or closing remarks.\nTim Naughton: Thank you, Kathy. In fact, all of you being with us today. I know that you've got a lot -- a lot of calls to cover. And normally I'd say I look forward to seeing -- it may read, but I don't think that's going to happen. But hopefully we'll talk to somebody during that -- during that week and maybe even see on a Zoom call. So take care and stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes, thanks, Jason. And welcome back to Q1 call. With me today are Kevin O'Shea, Sean Breslin, and Matt Birenbaum. I will provide a brief commentary on the slides that we posted last night. And all of us will be available to Q&A afterwards. Our comments today will focus on providing a summary of Q1 results. An update on operations so far this year, including through April, an overview of development activity and the status of construction sites. And lastly, highlighting our liquidity position. Before getting started, I just like to acknowledge that the last seven or eight weeks have been far from normal for any of us on this call, or any of our more than 3,000 associates in AvalonBay. Given our market footprint in large coastal metro areas in the US, we've certainly been impacted by this pandemic, professional and personal level. Many of us have had to learn to adjust to a different work environment at home while managing new and shifting family dynamics at the same time. But even more of our associates have been asked to leave the comfort and safety of their homes, most every day to provide housing and service for the more than 100,000 residents that call one of our communities home. What we do is fundamentally essential, and we are grateful and inspired by our team's amazing dedication and thank them for the commitment they demonstrate every day and service to our customers. I'll start the results of the quarter starting on Slide 4. It was a solid quarter. Highlights include core FFO growth of almost 4% driven by healthy internal growth with same-store revenue and NOI growth coming in at 3.1% and 3.0%, respectively. All of our major regions except Metro New York, New Jersey, of course, the same-store revenue growth of 3% or more in Q1. In Q1, we completed the three development communities totaling $215 million at an average initial yield of 6.4%. Continue to track record of creating significant value through this platform over the cycle. Given the current economic situation, we have not started any new development or acquired any new community so far this year. And lastly, we raised over $900 million in capital this past quarter at an average initial cost of 2.9%, with most of that coming from a $700 million 10-year bond deal at 2.3% completed in February, a record low reoffer rate for a 10-year bond issuance in US REIT history. And with that, I'll turn it over to Sean who will discuss portfolio operations including what we've seen so far and in April and now in May. Sean. Great. Thanks, Kevin. Just wrapping up and turning now to Slide 14. So, overall, Q1 was a very good quarter, with results a bit better than we had expected. Despite the slowdown, we began to experience in the second half of March and April, we felt much of the impact of the shutdown, certainly, although we were able to still coalesce most of what was built for the month with only 6% uncollected by month-end, which is about 400 basis points lower than normal. Progress at many of our construction sites were impacted by the pandemic. We expect that orders by some of the state and local governments temporarily halt inspections and construction will result in the delay and delivery options scheduled in several communities, which in turn will push some of the lease-up NOI projected for 2020 into next year. Most sites that have been impacted are currently in the process of either reopening or slowly returning to full manpower, as most states are now permitting new construction as an essential service as Matt had mentioned. Our shadow pipeline of $4 billion in development rights, which is controlled mostly through options or represent densification opportunities at existing communities offers good flexibility in terms of timing future starts well supported by market conditions. And lastly, as Kevin just mentioned, we're in great shape financially. We have ample liquidity to fund existing investment commitments, modest level of debt maturing over the next several quarters, and strong access at attractive pricing to the debt markets. So with that, Kathy, we're ready to open up the call for questions. Yes. No, I agree. I mean, between the knowledge base, knowledge nature of the economy, the federal government, state local governments are going to be pinched and are beginning to see cutbacks there. But not as much in areas of the federal government. I think it's just saying that -- I think D.C. was hurt a little bit initially just because our of exposure to hospitality. You have obviously both Hilton and Marriott here, which had massive furloughs kind of early on in the pandemic. But I think I think over time, Sean is right. I would expect it to stand up pretty well relative to the rest of the world, John. Yes, Austin. I just would say, I think going into this, obviously, we've seen a lot of pressure on construction costs. We've probably been seeing 6% to 8% increases for the last three years. So it was probably already well roughed terrain, and that provides us with a bit more conviction that we're likely to see a correction. And certainly in terms of wages, commodities, materials, profits of subcontractors, those should all come down, putting downward pressure on pricing. Offsetting that somewhat, we would expect a little bit general conditions just given changing protocol, social distancing, things like that. And perhaps, productivity being a little bit strained, offset again by -- as subcontractors start to reduce their workforce, they're left often with their most productive crews, and you oftentimes get cost benefits from that, as you come out of a downturn in the early part of an expansion. So overall, we do expect cost to come down. They're going to need to just to make sense of the economics, given NOIs are flat, on their way down and account for costs, if anything, are up since the beginning of the pandemic. Looking for sort of a bargain in the equity markets, obviously. I would say none of it. I mean are you talking about the cost or the start commitment? We haven't committed to starting anything with year. The only cost that would be baked would be where we bought the land already. I think two of those nine -- and we did buy two parcels of land in the first quarter deals that could have been or could be 2020 starts. So we spent $38 million on those two deals so far. A little bit of the soft cost is baked, but we haven't bought any of the construction on any of those jobs. John, this Tim Naughton. Maybe take the first and Kevin if you want to take the second piece of it or not. With respect to our market footprint, as we talked about in the past, we had to potentially diversify a bit of our exposure to the larger cost markets into other knowledge economy type markets part of what drove entry into Denver and to Southeast Florida for sure. There have been other markets that have been on screen as well. We've been pretty active in terms of our investment in both those markets, both in terms of acquisitions and in the development and also funding third party developers. We've tried to really activate all the levers, if you will, with respect to those markets. So we really haven't been held back by desire to get in those markets. It's a function as much of opportunity as anything. We'd expect that to continue. That will make you tend to trim from some markets and recycle some capital or they tend to make sense to the balance sheet, invest capital in those markets so we can do that as well. But right now, it's more to debt and asset recycling. So I don't think anything's changed there. We'll continue to evaluate other markets that we think could make sense for us in the long term that we think are over indexed to the innovation economy and therefore we think we'll outperform over a long period of time from a demand standpoint. I think your second question had to do with G&A around development. I can maybe start that and Kevin if you want to come in. We're always going to try to right-size the development organization to what we need and the opportunities for the next two, three years. To the extent we delay deals this year, it means we're probably going to have more stacking up in 2021 or 2022. So part of it is to make sure that you're properly positioned not just for what you have to do for the next six months but really for the platform over the next three or four years. To the extent, this becomes a very protracted recession but that changes the calculus obviously. That's not how we're viewing the environment today. We are viewing this as kind of a slow build up from a sharp downturn. If we do see a meaningful contraction and construction costs to the balance of 2020 then you start to see some recovery in 2021. You start to see 2022, 2023 could be a really good time to be delivering the product which would argue for heightened starts in 2020. We want to make sure we've got the right type development and construction organization really over the next three or four years, not just over the next six months and not much has changed in terms of our view that it needs to change material. In part because we'd already brought it down from as Matt had mentioned around $1.4 billion to roughly $800 million sort of late cycle. It's already sized for late-cycle downturn type dynamics. Kevin? Maybe just to straighten that out. Once the Fed came in, obviously, the bond markets became very constructive and we had thought as split [indiscernible] the bond market if we needed to, so that was the reason that ultimately we just paid back. Rich, you know, it's hard to now, I mean, you know what that would say when you're in the complacencies [ph], it only gets most of our rent growth for the year -- you have both the benefit of a better market pricing and more leasing velocity so your rent roll is increasing. You kind of earn it all kind of in that March to July timeframe and obviously that's a challenge right now. We have a lot of things in our control, we haven't gotten any of them. In terms of the math there, I think that's going to continue to be driven by the nature of the households. And there's been such great growth in single person households. That's literally what drives demand for our business. It's -- most of our households are singles and professional couples, very, very few children. You know it -- but the terms of kind of the product and the service, you know, I do think you probably see some of this either work from home type. There's already a trend that's already -- I think that Sean alluded to in some of his remarks. I think there's a good basis for expecting that. That might accelerate a bit. We had already started putting co-working, you know, lounges and spaces with meeting rooms in all of our -- all of our communities, and they are making it feel perfect now. Just a little bit -- bit more space, but they're pretty good size to begin with. And if you think about it, from a resident standpoint, they might prefer that environment to Starbucks, which is a much more controlled environment. They're going to sort of work from, they're going to work from some place other than other than -- other than the office. I think -- I think there's been a movement towards a much bigger, grander fitness centers, I think you're going to continue to see that. People are going to have more faith and comfort in working out in a community with their peers and, you know, maybe a large, you know, large club with a bunch of high schoolers who are cleaning up equipment, and things like that. And then, within the unit, you know, another trend that had already started, I think it might accelerate, it's just more flexible, open unit spaces, lifting where the nature of the space can change during the course of the day based on kind of where you are in your day, where kitchen, dining spaces convert to office spaces. My office space is an apartment community right across the street. And I noticed a number of people that sort of set up their desks right up against the window. I don't think that's where it was, to be honest, to spend good part of their -- good part of their day there now. So I think people start to think about that in terms of -- in terms of unit design, that, you know, folks may be using the space more during the day than they have -- than they have historically. And then, certainly just the need for, you know, broadband and, high speed and reliability, there, anything that we can do to kind of support that. And I guess lastly, I just mentioned kind of, kind of the Smart Home initiative, which you know, a lot of folks are pursuing now, but I think one of the most intriguing aspects of that is the remote entry, being able to allow goods and services to sort of flow freely throughout, throughout community rather than having to be handled by somebody in the front desk or in a central office that people can get -- can get access right up to the unit and potentially right end of the unit to the extent that the, you know, resident has to step away. So, I think you'll see, you know, all those things that were trends anyway, you know, perhaps just accelerated result of this. Sure. Yes, go ahead. Okay, you were a little muffled on some of it, but I heard the collection rate in the quadrant. And yes, it is more. I mean, the way I think about it is these are the kind of corporate profit home providers. It's not a corporation per se that are the end users here, but sort of intermediary that are, you know, essentially, that has a sales team that have reached agreements with various corporations or have a booking site essentially, that's the marketplace.

            "content": "All right. Great. Thanks, Sean. To provide an update on how the pandemic is impacting our construction operations, Slide 9 shows our 19 development communities across our eight regions. We started to experience slowdowns in the second half of March in Northern California and Seattle as regional shelter in place, orders were announced and availability of both labor and sections started to be impacted. By early April, the Northeast saw similar impacts, as such in April across all 19 projects. Our average daily manpower was reduced by an average of roughly 50% with wide variations as reflected on the slide. Projects indicated in green have seen relatively little impact, while those in yellow have been proceeding at a significantly reduced pace, and those in red are temporarily shut down except for basic life safety and asset preservation activity. Residential Construction is considered an essential activity in many jurisdictions. And just in the last week or so, we started to see a listing of some of the more extreme restrictions. And the four projects in Seattle in the Bay Area just recently moved from red to yellow. We have been working diligently to adjust our on-site health and safety practices to ensure appropriate social distancing among our subcontractor trade partners, add daily health checks and onsite wash stations and move our supervisory staff to staggered shifts as part of our ongoing response. These 19 development communities represent a projected total capital cost of $2.4 billion, which is our lowest volume of development underway since 2013. As shown on Slide 10, we shifted to a more cautious stance as far back as 2017. And our development stocks over the past few years have average shift $800 million, a little more than half of our mid-cycle run rate of $1.4 billion per year. This puts us in a strong position as we navigate the shift from expansion to recession. Slide 11 shows a breakdown of our future development rights. We've been managing this pipeline of future growth opportunities to provide us with maximum flexibility at relatively modest cost and control over $4 billion of next cycle development projects with a total investment of just $120 million. The development rights pipeline includes 28 different projects, with more than 20% of the projected capital in flexible public-private partnership deals, and another 20% in an -- in asset densification opportunities, where we are pursuing entitlements to add additional apartment homes at existing stabilized communities. Both of these types of opportunities offer flexibility to align timing with favorable conditions in the construction and capital markets. Kevin will now provide some comments on our liquidity and balance sheet. Sure, Nick, this is Matt. In terms of what happens to total delivery in 2020, obviously, I think it's too early to tell. What we found the last couple of years, even before the pandemic was that deliveries wound up being 10% to 15%, below what we had thought at the beginning of the year just due to flavor constraints, inspection constraints, and so on and so certainly, I would expect more deliveries to be down by more than that relative to what maybe third party reports were at the beginning of the year. But it really depends obviously, on how things play out over the next couple of months. As it relates to our pipelines, so far, what we've seen is, and what's reflected on our supplemental, five projects, we've delayed initial occupancy by a couple of months, call it, and these projects we -- as of right now, we think probably the final completion is going to be delayed by about a quarter. So that's maybe a third of our 19 that are actively underway right now. Some of the others are either in areas that have been less impacted or early enough in their process that they haven't been materially slowed down. Obviously, that could change, but kind of that's the way you see it as of right now. Sure. This is Matt. I think some people couldn't hear the question. It was about Columbus Circle condos sales and recent progress. So as of today, we have 41 units closed and have generated 1$29 million. That's an average price of $3.15 million per condo. We have 22 others under contract with binding deposits. That represents another $70 million of proceeds. It's actually slightly higher priced, $3.17 million, $3.18 million per unit. The sales activity -- the new contract track activity was pretty strong in January and February. In fact, if you go back to our first quarter call, we had 54 contracts at that time. So we've actually added nine since then, about $40 million in incremental sales since the first quarter call. And really all that came in February in the first half of March because once the stay-at-home orders came into place, we went to 100% virtual tours in mid-March with our sales agents there, and traffic did slow dramatically in the back half of March and the early half of April. I will say in the last just two weeks or three weeks, traffic has picked back up. And although they're virtual tours, traffic is back up to over 30 per week, which is a pretty strong number and comparable to where it was kind of before things stopped in mid-March. But until people can actually get in and physically see the product, which we hope they'll be able to do within the next month or so, we won't really know how that traffic might convert to additional contracts. Pricing has been consistent. We haven't really seen a difference in terms of the pricing levels, either asking or what we're achieving, for the last 10, or 15, 20 contracts in the early contracts. It's a -- there's a lot of different price points in the building, depending on what line and what floor. And so, it's not exactly apples to apples. But so far, we haven't seen any impact there yet. But again, until we really get people back into the building and start seeing some additional new contract activity, which hopefully will happen soon, we'll have a better sense. Good question, Austin. It's Matt. We certainly think the direction is headed down. I think as you see here in this very moment, I'm not sure that you would see that yet. And several of our projects, we have decided to defer. One of the reasons we deferred some of our potential 2020 starts is because we think that there will be a better buying opportunity in, I don't know, three quarters, four quarters maybe. So I think it takes a while to work its way through the system, and probably we'll see it first in some of the early trades were -- like concrete or site -- or paving where deals aren't starting. Those folks will start to see they have excess capacity and probably start to cut the pricing first. They'll probably take longer before it gets to some of the finished trades where there's funding stuff underway and that's need to be finished, and if anything, may take longer than finished over the next four quarters to six quarters. So one of the advantages we have is because 90% plus of our construction, we are our own general contractor. We can kind of time that and play that strategically a little more than if we were using a third-party general contractor, which is the way a lot of the private side of the business works. So still too early to tell. We'll see what happens. In the last downturn, it was down maybe 15%. And that was an extreme correction. But time will tell. I think Tim wanted to add something. Sorry, can you repeat the question? This is Matt. The question was about the yield shown on the development? As a general rule, our practice has been that when a deal gets more than 20% leased then we kind of remark the rents to market to reflect the experience that we're actually having. Until that time, we tend to carry the rents at what we initially underwrote. So we've talked for years about the fact that we don't trend rents and that's what we mean by that. In this particular release, we only have the three deals that are completed and in that case, those rents reflect the actual rent roll in place. Those are all more than 90% leased but is on the schedule. Then there's three other communities where we have enough leasing done that we've reflected the most current rents there on the chart there on Attachment 8. The other 16 assets, we haven't done enough leasing yet so those are still the original pro forma rents. That's consistent with what our practice has always been. I guess we did add a note just to make clear that we have not endeavored to update those because of any changes in the environment related to the pandemic. We're still carrying in some grants that were in the initial pro forma. When we get leasing activity, we will adjust them accordingly. So it's really not any change from our current practice. I think it was just an additional disclosure to make sure I understood that. It's a more volatile environment than it's been. Sean, do you want to talk to how they're currently leased? Hey, Hardik, it's Matt. You know, the deals that are delivering in 2021 -- first deliveries in 2021 are deals that generally were started in the last year if call it, you know, because otherwise they'd be delivering sooner than that. So on those deals, you know, I guess we'll just we'll see what happens right. I think it's fundamentally it's going to depend on what happens in market rents. We'll have them analyzed, you know, they -- some of those deals were higher yielding deals in first place just because of the geography of where they were. So, you know that, in theory, I guess gives you a little more room. But I don't think, and there's a few that are early enough that we might actually realize a little bit of construction costs -- and as I mentioned, we are, in some cases shifting from trying to get as quickly as possible to slow it down a little bit to take advantage of, hopefully, what could be a better market to buy construction services in a few quarters. But, yes, I mean, you know, the risk there is the same as the risk in the stabilized portfolio. You know, it's just the risk of what happens to you know, market rents between now and then."

Moving to Slide 12, as shown in the next two slides, we ended this recession very well prepared from a financial perspective with a healthier liquidity position, modest near term maturities and a well-positioned balance sheet. Turning first to liquidity As you can see on Slide 12, liquidity at quarter-end, totaled $1.8 billion, for our credit facility and cash on hand. This compares to the $900 million in remaining expenditures and development underway over the next several years, of which about $400 million is expected to be spent over the remainder of 2020. As a result, at quarter end, our $1.8 billion in liquidity exceeds remaining spend on development in 2020 by roughly $1.4 billion and our liquidity exceeds total remaining spend on development over the next several years, by nearly $1 billion. Turning next to our debt maturities. On Slide 13, we show our debt maturities over the next 10 years and our key credit metrics. For debt maturities, we have only $70 million of debt maturing in late 2020 and only $330 million dollars in debt maturing in 2021, for a total of $400 million in debt maturities over the next seven quarters. Plus looking at over the balance of 2020, and incorporating both development spend and debt maturities, our quarter and liquidity of $1.8 billion exceeds remaining debt maturities and spend on development over the rest of 2020 by $1.3 billion. In addition, our liquidity exceeds all of our main development spending over the next several years. And all of our debt maturities through 2021 are $500 million. So you can see from this, that we enjoy healthy liquidity relative to our open commitments through 2021. In addition, we also enjoy considerable incremental liquidity from cash flow from operations and excessive dividends, as well as from our ability to source attractively priced debt capital from the unsecured and secured debt markets, to the extent the asset and equity markets remain unattractively priced. In this regard, at quarter end our net debt to core EBITDA of 4.6 times is below our target range of five times to six times leaving us meaningful capacity to absorb leverage increases as we proceed through these challenging times. And unencumbered NOI with at or near an all-time high of 93%, reflecting a large, unencumbered pool of assets that we could tap if necessary for additional secured debt capital. With that, I'll turn it back to Tim. Yes. I mean, Austin, we're probably going to have to throw out a more fulsome update on what we expect our capital plan to be for 2020 when we have our mid-year call and provide -- have clear visibility on a whole range of things, including not only NOI, but also investment activity and capital markets activity. We're standing right now at remarkably low leverage level of net debt to EBITDA at 4.6 times versus the target range of five to six times and that's intentional. We very much drove that leverage number down over the last few years to give us more scope and more capacity as we might have to put it through a downturn and so we find ourselves in the spot we had hoped we would be, which provides us an awful lot of flexibility to respond the opportunities that may present themselves here in the coming months, as well as capacity to take on Dennis levy the full true incremental development spent. But as I pointed out in my opening remarks regarding abundant liquidity here relative to our open commitments here in the near term and from a capital plant standpoint, although we went through valiance. When we provide our guidance, our initial expectation was to raise external capital of $1.4 billion. We've already raised $900 million of that so through the year and raise two-thirds of what we initially hoped to raise. We may not need to raise as much as all that but I think the bottom line answer to your question is why we haven't upgraded our guidance. I think our capital needs going forward are pretty modest and so you can probably looking at the balance sheet in terms of absolute debt levels where it is. It's probably not going to change a whole lot from here based on what we know today. You'll need to cover things and as a result of some of those that decline and start bawling. We did have some recent staff reductions in our cap odds groups last year and so when we put our budget together for this year, we did expect capitalized overhead for 2020 to be a bit below what it was in 2019. If you look at what happened the first quarter catalog overhead did sequentially increase a little bit in the first quarter due to a few one-time items such as increased benefits and payroll costs but for full year 2020 we would expect that that catalog overhead runway would decline in the back half of the year somewhat based on what we know today. Hey, Alex, this is Kevin. We drew a portion of our line of credit, basically so that $750 million out of $1.75 billion in mid-March. We really did it on a precautionary basis not because of anything in our business, not because of our development activities, not because we had any particular use. We didn't have commercial paper. There was really nothing related to AvalonBay that caused us to draw that $750 million. Instead, it was really just a reaction to the initial stage of the pandemic and its impact on the capital markets and before the Fed had fully stepped in to stabilize the markets. So it was really done on a precautionary basis to ensure that we had greater control over the capital. That would give us incremental abundant time and room to maneuver through what we thought would be a choppy set of months ahead of us. No, just kind of one other thing Hardik. As you think about sort of development, how it flows through our earnings from a business model standpoint and compare it perhaps to the last downturn. As you know, we've emphasized [indiscernible] funded we are with respect to long term capital being sourced to fund the development underway. And really at Q1, we were about over 80% match funded with long term capital against the development that's underway. So that's an important point. Tim touched on in his antics but I really do think that's -- as you think about AvalonBay and how we might perform here in the coming years, it's an important distinction to draw in terms of how we are positioned from a balance sheet and funding point of view and a built in accretion point of view with respect to development, relative to say the last downturn we had a lot more -- much more in the way of open and unfunded development commitments. At time when 12 years ago developments were coming in at 5%or 6% yield and funding with that cost around 6%. Today is very different. We'll see whether the yields really shape out to be. But we know you know, debt cost for us on a 10-year basis today are probably somewhere in the 2% range. So, and we don't really need much of that at all. And we're already over 80% match-funded and the development underway. So we really are in terrific shape from that standpoint, that sort of benefit from, you know, painting profit growth on the 80% or so that we've already paid for this underway. And to this extent, we have to source incremental capital and use debt to do so; that's likely to be an additional source of accretion. Yes, we have shared with you in the past, at least what, you know, last couple cycles where we had, yes, when we started deals kind of late in the cycle and delivered into a downturn. Those were -- at one point you can't run out 10-15 yards, they are what was in fields that you start at the beginning cycle or in the downturn at least up at the early stages like -- I think we saw ranges from -- it narrows over time, as you turn out the time horizon from 10 years. But over 10 years, right, but I think we were so clear on our cost of capital [indiscernible]; I think on the low end, it was around 8.5%. On the high end it was 13.5% range. So, you know, I would say, you know, it's going to be, you know, something feels better, that weren't -- that were sort of time -- the worst that started with construction costs peaky and delivering in the depressed environment. I think there could still be high single digit kind of hang around; and have deals that we start in 2021 and 2022, it could be much better than that. Thank you."

            "content": "All right, thanks, Tim. Turning to Slide 5, the impact of COVID-19 and the various shelter in place orders had a material impact on leasing velocity in March as noted in Chart 1, with year-over-year volume down roughly 40% from March 2019. In April, however, as a result of our teams becoming more proficient with virtual and no contact tours, prospective residents becoming more comfortable venturing out to tour apartment homes and the various incentives we offer to increase conversion rates, we've seen velocity rebounded, it was only modestly below 2019 levels. It's similar to the volume of notices to vacate for the month. Unfortunately, the reduction in leasing volume in March coincided with our normal seasonal increase in the volume of notices to move out from our communities. As noted in Chart 2, this resulted in fewer move-ins and move-outs during the month of April. Taking collectively and as depicted on Slide 6, availability increased and occupancy suffered. As indicated in Charts 1 and 2 on Slide 6, availability was trending well below 2019 levels throughout most of the first quarter. That spiked in the second half of March, when leasing velocity fell materially. 30-day availability peaked at roughly 50 basis points greater than last year, during the third week of March, but has ticked back down a bit over the past six weeks or so. The impact of reduced leasing volume in March ultimately impacted physical occupancy as well as noted in Chart 3, with April down roughly 75 basis points from March and 50 basis points from last year to 95.3%. In Chart 4, you could see the impact of the recent environment on April rent change, which ended the month at essentially zero. This diagram reflects our efforts to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on residents by offering a no rent increase lease renewal option to undecided folks, and our response to the weakening environment, which included offering incentives to increase prospective resident conversion rates, which did in fact increase from about 23% of March to 34% in April. Turning to Slide 7, we collected about 96% of what we would have typically collected in an average month from our customers, which is noted in Chart 1. And if you look at the collection rates by segment, the rate for our market rate customers was the highest, with our corporate housing or short term rental customers, which only represent 3% of build residential revenue, the lowest. In terms of May collections, over the past few days, we're trending at about 94.5% of normal levels or about 150 basis points behind April, but it's early in the month. There are differences in how the calendar lays out with deferrals being on a Friday in May versus a Wednesday in April, and other nuances that influence daily payment volume. Moving to Slide 8, the collection rate for our highest income customers has been the best, which isn't too surprising given the impact of the pandemic on the various service-related businesses throughout our markets. In terms of regional collection rates, the tech lead Pacific Northwest and California regions have been the strongest and Southern California the weakest. Unfortunately, the impact of the pandemic on entertainment and tourism businesses in Southern California has been pretty severe. Most of the studios and other businesses producing content have been shut down for several weeks now. And all the major tourism-related sites, including Disneyland, Universal Studios, and many other venues are closed. Without operational overview, I'll turn it over to Matt who will address construction and development. Matt? Yes, Nick, this is Sean. I'll take that one, the third and others can jump in if they like. But in terms of the existing amenity space, yes, we do have a team that is taking a look at what the occupancy standards are for different types of spaces. Not only in our communities, but at our offices as well. And what kind of limitations that will place on the occupancy limits that were in place before the pandemic, so they're going to see that reduced pretty materially, but it depends on the type of space. Depending on what they're talking about, fitted center equipment with space two feet apart, we may have to go back and redistribute the equipment to have more spacing as an example. Chill spaces where there were, what's called soft seating that was side by side with tables around, that may have to be a space where we just reduce the number of items in there, in terms of chairs and same thing in terms of our swimming pool. So, there's a fair amount of work underway to sort of, redensify the various spaces that our communities to make sure they comply with the proper social distancing protocols, and it's just going to take some time to work through each one. And then in terms of the longer term trend, it's probably a little too early to tell now but certainly there was a trend, see more people working from home, whether they were telecommuting, or whether they were just sort of independent contractors working from home, that are producing content or -- and sort of contracting business and things of that sort for different types of industries. Entertainment, in particular, comes to mind for a place like LA, so that trend likely continue. I think it's probably a reasonable conclusion from what we see. But to what degree, it's probably too early to tell at this point. Yes, Rich. It's Sean. I can share a few thoughts on that just -- we've looked at collection rates in maybe a few different ways. Certainly, we talked about it by segmenting in terms of what was presented on the slides in my prepared remarks. But in terms of some other metrics that we look at and have been following, first is sort of price point, As versus Bs. As are running about 100 basis points higher than Bs at this point in time. And that may look suburban, urban. What we're generally seeing across most of the markets is, suburbans are performing by about 25 basis points or so. So a little bit, but not terribly material. Probably the one exception is New York where the urban environment collection rate better than the suburbs, given the impact we've seen in Westchester. It's been pretty material in terms of the pandemic. And then in terms of high rise versus garden and mid-rise, high rise is slightly better, but there's not a lot of high rise products to benchmark against to be honest. And most of that for our portfolio is going to be in New York, a little bit in D.C. It's just not a big sample size, so I probably wouldn't draw too many conclusions about the product type differences. Not material at this point. It's more market driven, I'd say, where you've got -- certainly the hot spots are a little more sensitive to the rebound and we're seeing people wanting to still continue with more of the virtual tours as opposed to self-guided, as opposed to maybe like the Mid-Atlantic, where people seem to be more comfortable given the state of the environment, either with self-guided tours, for the most part at this point, and not as many virtual tours. So I think it's really a market based on [ph] as opposed to maybe price point at this point or location, as you pointed out, urban versus suburban. I mean, the general response has been pretty healthy across most of the markets. I mean, I guess I'd have to tell you that based on what you probably have heard from others and are -- just pointing out some of the weakness in L.A., probably taking slightly more concessions on average in the L.A. market as compared to others to get those conversion rates to sort of reasonable levels. But in terms of the rebound, for the most part, I would say that it's been pretty steady with some limited exceptions, and the exceptions really more relate to hotspots, and obviously, specifically in and around New York, where people are still pretty hesitant, given the environment, to be out shopping for apartments, people are doing virtual tours, and the concessions are reasonable, but not as much as what was required in L.A. to get people to spur to action to give us -- given what was happening in that market environment, which was already weak, as you may recall, at the beginning the year. And the pandemic certainly only made it that much more difficult in terms of people who are qualified being able to come out and shop for an apartment and be able to afford to rent an apartment, given what was happening with all the studios being closed. And a lot of people that produce content in Southern California, with their shops being closed. So that's probably the one market where it's been a little more challenging. I think based on what we know as of now, and just thinking about the composition of the workforce, I think D.C. should hold up relatively well. If you think about the nature of the pandemic and how things have started, and the impact on joblessness to date for the most part, as opposed to kind of a trickle down, it's really a trickle up type thing where a lot of the job loss is heavily concentrated at those lower level service jobs. You're talking about food service or bars, restaurants, hotel workers, things of that sort. It may trickle up some. And in certain geographies, where people are paid well, again, like L.A., to produce content, maybe disproportionate impact. But D.C., highly educated population, a lot of professional services, defense, et cetera. But expected to hold up relatively well. And we've seen that thus far, even though it's only been sort of six weeks at this point in terms of what's happening. But others may have different thoughts to add. Yes, just to add one thing on that as Matt indicated. Just for the first quarter, there were six assets in lease. If you look across the rents for those six assets, four of them were producing rents at that time average for the quarter that were above the original proforma. One was equivalent to our original proforma and one deal in northern Seattle was modestly below our original proforma. But you blend all that together rents at that point in time were roughly 3% above proforma were at $80 or so but there were some cost changes on those deals. So the net reduction in yield really was only about 10 basis points to a weighted average of 5.9 so really immaterial in the context of the whole basket. Alex, this is Sean. Just to use some perspective of about 80% of that $1.4 million was in way of commentary amenity fees because our amenities are closed. So our expectation is you're going to see a slow build of that line item over the next few months. As the states begin to reopen, we resize our occupancy limits as I was describing earlier in response to a question and then it will slowly rebuild. We don't expect it to snap back I guess I would say, just because the pace of opening is going to be different by jurisdiction based on the local market environment, but that's the majority of it that should fully rebuild. The rest of it was small stuff related to some late fees and credit card convenience fees and things of that sort."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your host for today\u2019s conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Aleena, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon\u2019s press release as well as in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today\u2019s discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings and we encourage you to refer to that information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ben Schall, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Ben?\nBen Schall: Thank you, Jason. And thank you, to everyone for joining us on the call today and for your engagement. Kevin, Matt, Sean and I will provide some initial commentary and then we will open the session up for questions. I want to start by thanking the AVB associate base, 3,000 strong, for all their contributions throughout 2021. Thanks to your commitment, we produce strong business results and embarked on our next phase of growth by ramping up our development and investment activity all while navigating the challenges presented by the pandemic. Thank you especially to everyone working on site at our communities and construction projects and to our human resource teams for all you do to support each other, serve prospects and residents and build for our future. Turning to the presentation, Slide 4 provides the summary of our success and strong finish to 2021. On the operating side in the fourth quarter, we delivered a 12.4% increase in core FFO and a 4.7% increase in same store revenue. On a cash basis, same store revenue increased 8.3%. This momentum continues in the New Year as we build on our strong operating foundation with healthy occupancy levels, low resident turnover and strong embedded revenue growth. We also successfully ramped our investment activity in 2021 with almost $2 billion of new development starts and acquisitions and with the bulk of this capital funded by dispositions and incremental debt financing at an historically low cost of capital. In an otherwise low yielding environment, our development capabilities allow us to generate significant value and meaningful incremental NOI growth on top of the internal growth generated by our operating portfolio. As shown on Slide 5, we completed $1.1 billion of projects in 2021 with an expected $65 million of new NOI upon stabilization. At a development yield of 6% and with a 230 basis point spread to an estimated market cap rate of 3.7%, these communities have created $650 million in value. That\u2019s a very robust 60% value creation margin. As Matt will describe further, we expect to start an additional $1 billion to $1.250 billion of development projects this year at projected yields of 5.5% to 6.0% and we control a growing development rights pipeline which will set the stage for continued accretion and value creation from our development platform for many years to come. As we continue to invest and grow, we\u2019re also optimizing the earnings growth and long term value of our existing portfolio. A large component of this optimization is the selling of older assets with slower growth profiles and redeploying that capital into more expansion markets. During 2021, as highlighted on Slide 6, this led to our acquisition of $725 million of assets with an average age of three years at a 3.8% cap rate and a disposition of $865 million of assets with an average age of 26 years at a 3.7% cap rate. The bulk of our acquisitions were and will continue to be in our expansion markets which over time across Southeast Florida, Denver, Austin, Dallas, Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham, we see as having the potential to grow to become 20% to 25% of our portfolio through a combination of development and acquisitions. These expansion market share many of the same characteristics as our established markets including concentrations of knowledge based workers and strong housing fundamentals. They also provide portfolio diversification and increased exposure to longer term population shifts. So, most of our portfolio and new development capital in the long terms will be in our established markets where we have a high quality portfolio of assets situated in regions that we believe will continue to thrive as vibrant centers of innovation, education, technology, and with strong job and income profiles. And in regions where we continue to leverage our long tenure with some of the strongest operating and development teams in the multifamily industry. Turning to Slide 7, we continue to make significant investments in technology and innovation as we evolve our operating platform in order to provide enhanced value to prospects and residents while achieving operating efficiencies and driving new sources of revenue. We generated approximately $10 million of incremental NOI from our initiatives already deployed and about 1/3rd of the way to delivering our target of 200 basis points of margin improvement or $40 million to $50 million of NOI to the bottom line. Finally, I want to emphasize our continuing investment in our people and our leadership in ESG. Starting with ESG, our goal is to keep AvalonBay on the forefront as a leader in sustainability and corporate responsibility, an area of increasing importance for our residents, associates and investors. As an output of this corporate leadership, we\u2019ve been recognized by various [NSEs] as ESG leaders as shown on Slide 8 including the NAREIT Leader in the Light Award as the top rank multifamily REIT for ESG leadership. And most importantly, we continue to invest in our people and our culture. AvalonBay is an amazing place because of its people and we\u2019re extremely focused on fostering an inclusive and diverse culture that attracts, retains, and provides growth opportunities to our people. We\u2019re excited for the year ahead, are fortunate to have a deeply dedicated team of associates and we enter the year with our foot forward and in growth mode. With that, I\u2019ll turn it to Sean to talk further about our operating results and tailwinds heading into 2022.\nSean Breslin: Alright, thanks Ben. I\u2019ve thought I\u2019d share a few slides on recent portfolio rent trends both overall and across different markets and sub-markets. Starting on Slide 9, 2021 was a pretty unique year. In the first half of the year, we experienced not only a significant recovery in our business, with the average move-in rent grew fast enough to exceed pre-COVID peak rent levels by mid-year. And in second half of the year, the combination of lower turnover which was down 20% year-over-year, 11% below pre-COVID levels and the lowest we\u2019ve seen in 10 years along with a healthy demand resulted in rents defined seasonal norms by growing into September and then flattening through year end. Historically, we\u2019d see rental rates peak in July and August and then decline in the low single digit percentage range through year end as represented by the dash line for 2019. For the calendar year 2021, the portfolio average move-in rent grew by 23% and at year end exceeded 2019 levels by about 9%. Moving to Slide 10, improved performance has been broad based with every region experienced a significant increase in average move-in rent over the past year. Average move-in rent in New England increased by 30% during 2021, the highest of our established regions at end of the year about 10% above pre-COVID levels. Improved performance in Boston has been supported by healthy job growth across various industries most notably Biotech and reduced apartment deliveries in both urban and suburban sub markets. In addition, for a region that is typically more seasonal given the weather patterns, it\u2019s quite unusual to see rents flatten out in the last quarter of the year versus decline. That\u2019s the sign of a pretty strong market. In Southern California, the average move-in rent grew by 23% during 2021 and at year end it was 21% above 2019 levels, the highest of our established regions. Performance has been supported by solid job growth particularly in the content producing sector of the economy in LA, the lowest level of new multifamily supply of any of our regions at 1.1% of stock and a very tight single family market.  At the other end of the spectrum, Northern California continue to lag the portfolio due to major tech employers delaying their return to the office impacted the reopening of other businesses and agile quality of life in the region. While the average move-in rent increased by 15% during 2021, at year end it was so roughly 7% below pre-COVID levels. For the region has lagged in the recovery, we could see a very meaningful increase in moving rents in 2022 when a greater percentage of the workforce particularly the tech segments that have experienced very robust wage increases in the past couple of years, go back to the office. We got a line at New York, New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions all delivered a 20% to 25% increase in average move-in rent during 2021. The mid-Atlantic ended the year with rents favor about 5% above 2019 levels. For Pacific Northwest and New York/New Jersey regions, we\u2019re trending a roughly 10% ahead of 2019 levels. Turning to Slide 11 to address suburban and urban performance trends, the average move-in rent for our suburban portfolio increased by roughly 20% during 2021 and was approximately 13% of 2019 levels at year end. And our urban portfolio, while the average move-in rent increased almost 30% during 2021, it was essentially at 2019 levels by the end of the year. Urban markets with rents still below 2019 levels include San Francisco at about 17% and Washington DC at roughly 3%. In contrast, rents in New York City are currently above 4% above 2019 levels. With that, utilization rates in the high teens in the San Francisco Metro area at low to mid 20% range in both New York City and Washington DC. We should continue to see a meaningful improvement in demand in our urban submarkets as a greater percentage of the workforce has called back to the office. We see an increasing size of that demand returning. In Q4, our urban portfolio experienced about a 30% increase in a share of move-ins from more than a 150 miles away as compared to pre-COVID norms. In markets like New York City and San Francisco, the share of move-ins from greater than 150 miles away increased by roughly 50% compared to historical norms. And we\u2019re along just the move-ins are incurring in our suburban portfolio as well but the increased share is more like in the 20% range. And moving to Slide 12, the improvement of rent levels has translated into strong like-term effective rent change. The average likeness of rent change in Q4, 2021 with October and November in the high 10% range followed by December at roughly 11.5%. The positive momentum continued in the January, the rent change were roughly 12.5%. Importantly we experienced a meaningful increase of rent change across six of our eight regions in January. And overall, we\u2019re starting the year from a position of strength, January occupancy averaged 96.4%, asking rents have increased 1.5% since the first of the year. And we\u2019re seeing early signs of continued low turnover in an environment with very healthy rent increases. With that operating summary, I\u2019ll turn it to Kevin to address our full outlook for 2022. Kevin?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Thanks, Sean. Turning to 2022. Apartment fundamentals in our established markets remain highly attractive. On Slide 13, we show just how strong they are by providing data on some key trends including strong job and wage growth for the professional services sector which includes our target renters. The opportunity for further gains in office utilization from today\u2019s low levels, rising single family home prices which support rental demand and a relatively stable outlook for new apartment deliveries in our markets. On Slide 14, we provide our financial outlook for 2022. For the year, we expect robust growth from both our same-store portfolio and from stabilizing development to drive nearly 16% growth in core FFO per share at the midpoint of our guidance of $9.55. In our same-store residential portfolio, we expect a continued rebound from the pandemic in our urban markets and continued economic momentum across our entire portfolio. During the midpoint of guidance, we project same-store residential revenue will increase by 8.25% based on growth in our urban portfolio in the low 10% range and growth in our suburban portfolio in the low-to-mid 7% range. We project same-store residential operating expenses were increase by 4.75% primarily due to cost pressure in a couple of categories initiated as being deployed and some one-time benefits in 2021 that are not present in 2022. As far cost pressure, we\u2019re experiencing these primarily in two areas. First, in utilities as a result of very favorable supply contracts for commodities that expired late last year. And second, in property taxes resulting from successful appeals in the prior year period and the expiration of certain pilot programs in New York which will burn off over the next few years but at the same time allow us to exit rent stabilization and achieved full market rents on most of those committees over time. Among our various initiatives, we started to deploy our bulk internet smart access offering which will create a year-over-year expense headwind of about 50 basis points in 2022. It is part of the strategy to deliver a net profit of more than $30 million when this is stabilized over the next few years. And lastly, we\u2019ve realized some one time benefits in 2021, including a payroll tax credit in Q4 returning of about a 30 basis point of headwind to OpEx growth in 2022. As a result, we expect same-store residential net operating income will increase by 10% in 2022. For development, we expect to continue to generate earnings in NAV growth from stabilizing developments and to continue investing heavily in this differentiated capability as you could see here on this slide. For our capital plan, we projected external capital sources of about $900 million from asset sales, our closure sale activity and capital markets activity. For our capital uses, we expect to deploy about $1.2 billion towards development, redevelopment, and debt maturities in 2022. Finally, in our earnings release, we\u2019ve also provided earnings guidance for Q1, to which at the midpoint we project core FFO per share of $2.20 in the first quarter or about $0.07 lower than in Q4. This sequential earnings decline is driven by several items, including OpEx increases in utilities, property taxes and payroll, including previously mentioned payroll tax credit Q4. All that increase is due to compensation adjustments and strategic initiatives and NOI decreases from net disposition activity in Q4. On Slide 15, we illustrate the components of our expected 15.6% growth in core FFO per share. Most of our growth specifically a $1.02 per share is expected to come from NOI growth and our same-store redevelopment portfolios. About a third of our earnings growth or $0.44 per share is due to NOI from investment activity which in turn is primarily from development. Partially offsetting these sources of growth is combined increase of about $0.17 per share from capital market activity and increases in overhead. On Slide 16, we show the key components driving our expected a net quarter overall increase in same-store residential revenue including our expectation for a strong increase in these rates, a favorable impact from a lower level amortized and newly granted concessions, an increase in other rental revenue and modest improvement in underlying uncollectible lease revenue which we expect will remain elevated in the first half of 2022 before slowly improving in the second half of the year. However, we are assuming a year-over-year reduction of about $18 million in a recognized rent release collections from the emergency rental assistance program which results in about a 90 basis point headwind to our projected full year residential revenue growth rate. Moving to same-store residential revenue trend across our markets on Slide 17. Our expansion markets at Denver and Southeast Florida are expected to lead the portfolio revenue growth in 2022 followed by Pacific Northwest. With the reason Sean mentioned earlier, we expect Northern California to trail the portfolio average, however it\u2019s a region with a history of outside down cycles followed by robust recoveries. So we could be favorably surprised by actual performance in Northern California that has removed through the year. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Matt to discuss our plans for our future development activity.\nMatt Birenbaum: Hi, great. Thanks, Kevin. On Slide 18, we could see that we\u2019re continuing to ramp up our development activity in response to the favorable market conditions. We had been starting roughly a billion one with new development per year, most of the prior cycle before sharply curtailing new investment activity as COVID hit in 2020. We\u2019ve been able to shift gears aggressively last year getting back to an annual start level of roughly $1.2 billion and expect similar volume this year. And this development continues to be very profitable with current development underway, underwritten too an initial stabilized yield at 6%. With cap rates in the mid three\u2019s, this puts us on track to extend the tremendous value creation margin Ben mentioned on our 2021 completions. In the pie charts on the right, you can also see how market performance and our portfolio allocation priorities are reflecting in our recent starts activity with 90% of the \u201821 and \u201822 starts in suburban location and a broad geographic mix including more than 20% in our expansion regions. As we accelerate our starts activity, our regional development teams have also been focused on back selling the development right pipeline to generate the next set of investment opportunities for 2023 and beyond. As shown on Slide 19, we have future development sites under control across all of our regions that have seen a market increase in pipeline activity in the past few quarters. The project shown on the slide here represents $2.6 billion of future starts activity over the next two to three years and excludes some of our longer term densification opportunities at existing assets which brings our total development rights pipeline to $3.3 billion at the end of 2021. And we\u2019ve been even more active so far this year with an additional $700 million approved by our investment committee just in January and more on the way including our first development right in Austin, Texas. This activity puts us on track to exceed $4 billion in development rights by the end of the first quarter. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ben.\nBen Schall: Thanks, Matt. As you heard on the call today, we\u2019re entering the New Year from a position of strength on multiple fronts and to close I want to emphasize five key themes that will guide us in 2022 as we seek to generate outsized value in earnings growth and as we continue to differentiate ourselves as one of the leading real-estate companies in the country. First, our decade long track record as a leading developer with deep market knowledge and experience across the breadth of communities and apartment styles allows us to create value by tailoring each development to best fit the needs of local area as well as continuing to meet the evolving needs of residents. It also drives meaningful incremental earnings NOI growth across cycles. Second, as we grow, we are optimizing the earnings growth and value creation potential of the existing portfolio by pruning slower growth assets and diversifying into new markets, providing an expanded domain to create value through our development, operating and strategic capabilities. Third, our operating model is set to deliver meaningful earnings growth by utilizing technology and investing in innovation, to improve operating margins and to unlock additional revenue opportunities. Fourth, we will continue to lead on ESG, an area increasingly important to municipalities as we seek development approvals to residents as they make housing decisions and to our associates as we meet our mission of creating a better way to live. And lastly, at the center of all that we do, we will continue to foster our evergreen culture and invest in our people. We look forward to our engagement with shareholders and stakeholders on these themes and others during the year. And I\u2019ll turn it to the operator to facilitate questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thank you, appreciate all the color. I guess, maybe starting on the portfolio optimization and the target of 20% to 25% in the expansion markets, what\u2019s the expected timing of actually getting there?\nBen Schall: Yes, thanks, Nick. I would continue to look at our growth in Southeast Florida and Denver as a good proxy. We\u2019ve been active in those markets over the last three to four years. We have a target reach of those markets of about 5%. And we\u2019re about halfway through. Increasingly, we\u2019ve got our people on the ground there. Our development activity continues to source additional opportunities and the hope is that we can accelerate from there in those two markets. So when you look to our next set of expansion markets, I would expect them to move on a similar type of timeframe over the coming years.\nNick Joseph: Thanks, and I guess another timing question. In terms of 200 basis points on the margin expansion opportunity, I think you mentioned your third done. When would you expect that 200 basis points to be in the run rate?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Nick, this is Sean. It is a multiyear process. It\u2019s going to take us a few years to work through everything. But we\u2019re making steady progress. I\u2019d say if you talk about over the next 36 months to 48 months, it\u2019s in the ballpark to work through all of it.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRich Hill: Good afternoon, guys. I\u2019m sorry if I missed this. But could you confirm the loss lease in the portfolio as of January?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Rich this is Sean. It\u2019s trending at 12%.\nRich Hill: And so, maybe just going back to some of the timing questions, if I heard correctly, it sounds like your leases are 23% higher than where they were this time last year give or take. But your leasing spreads are really strong, but not at 23%. Does that mean that you\u2019re not capturing all the loss to lease and some will bleed into \u201823 or how should we think about that?\nBen Schall: Yes. So just to clarify a couple of things, the 23% represent the move-in values at the end of the year as compared to the beginning of the year; not all of the leases in the portfolio being up 23%, if that makes sense. On the loss to lease side, like I said, it\u2019s 12% today is a, I think I mentioned on the last call, about a third of the portfolio, at this point in time is constrained by various things, the regulations in New York City, there\u2019s a couple of COVID overlay issues out there, etc. So it\u2019s really achievable today, if you just mark everything in the market is call it 8%. So how will that manifest its way through the portfolio will be as leases expire throughout 2022 and we\u2019re able to move people to market. So that\u2019s how things will slowly lead in. So if you\u2019re trying to understand sort of the pace of revenue growth, given that phenomenon, then we do expect revenue growth will accelerate as we move through the year because all those leases are being marked to market as they expire.\nRich Hill: That\u2019s very helpful. And so maybe just framing the debate here a little bit on your guidance range, can you maybe give us a little bit of color as to what assumptions are driving to the high end versus the low end?\nBen Schall: Yes, I mean, there\u2019s a number of different factors that play into that. So we could spend some time on obviously, Kevin talked about what we\u2019re seeing in terms of or what we expect in the way of bad debt trends being modestly positive, but then we have a drag from rent relief that he also pointed out, those two variables could swing one way or another. And we\u2019re expecting an improvement in underlying bad debt in the second half of the year. They could accelerate, which gives us a little extra juice. Rent relief could also accelerate, but could also go the other way. It\u2019s a pretty unpredictable factor. And then obviously, you have the normal things that we talked about in terms of turnover, where it occurs, is it in markets that are currently regulated that we can get people to market? How fast is market rent growth has moved through the years? So there\u2019s all those normal factors that we would expect in addition to the unusual factors in the current environment.\nRich Hill: And just you didn\u2019t mention anything about development? And I appreciate the range that you gave for NOI contributions. But is there, it was higher than what we were expecting, which is obviously a good thing, any things that you\u2019re looking for on development that would make you more bullish or bearish?\nMatt Birenbaum: Rich this is Matt. I mean, as it relates to the \u201822 earnings that\u2019s more or less the die is cast at this point; there\u2019s not going to be huge variations in that number because those are deals that are already under construction and in many cases have already started leasing. So the variability there would be around what is the actual lease up pace and rate, does it do a little better, a little worse than what we\u2019ve projected. But the bigger place where it will start to move the needle more materially in the out years would relate to starts that might happen this year.\nRich Hill: Got it. That\u2019s what I was looking for. Thank you guys. That\u2019s it.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take the next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore.\nRich Hightower: Good afternoon, guys. Just to follow up on that development question really quick. Just it\u2019s a little bit of nitpicking, but I guess the midpoint of the starts forecast for \u201822 is a little bit less than what occurred in \u201821. Is there a reason for that? Is it timing? Is it something else that we\u2019re not aware of?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes, no. Rich, it\u2019s Matt. It\u2019s just these deals are lumpy. And one deal happens to start in December versus January or February that can change the number, kind of on any particular period of time you want to take rolling four quarters or calendar year. So I would tend to look at it more kind of on a two year basis, which is why that\u2019s the way we presented the slide. You think about \u201821, \u201822 together to $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion worth of starts and again, we\u2019re looking to accelerate that and hopefully \u201823 we do even more.\nRich Hightower: And then, I appreciate the detail around the sort of the composition of the same store revenue outlook. Within that, I don\u2019t think it was mentioned, but what are you baking in for sort of your underlying market rent gross assumption within all that sort of separately from just what\u2019s baked in already and so forth?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. That\u2019s reflected in the bar that Kevin identified on the slide, Rich. If you take a look at that, that includes, it\u2019s basically the confluence of different pieces, the very first bar on the lease rates. They reflect sort of the embedded piece, how much of the loss lease you can capture as well as the effective change you might see in rents as you move through the year, so all of that is embedded in that number.\nRich Hightower: That\u2019s all in that first bar then in other words.\nMatt Birenbaum: Correct. That is correct.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks, everybody. Sean, just curious, based on what you saw in urban markets in the fourth quarter, sort of bucking seasonal trends do you expect this - have you seen it continue? Do you think it can continue into 2022? And what did you guys assume in your guidance? Did you assume that it\u2019s just more typical demand trends, just any thoughts there would be appreciated?\nSean Breslin: In the urban markets, specifically, you\u2019re talking about Austin.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes, correct. You referenced I think 50% or so upside versus what you\u2019ve seen historically in New York and San Francisco and then 30% I think.\nSean Breslin: Yes. We started to see that occur in Q2. It\u2019s really accelerated as we get into Q3 and Q4 in terms of the percentage of movements coming from more than 150 miles away. I suspect and I haven\u2019t looked at the full data for January may have slowed a little bit just given Omicron. But I think our belief is that we\u2019re going to continue to see a steady improvement in places like New York City, DC, San Francisco, as more people are brought back to the office, we don\u2019t think office utilization is going to go back to exactly where it was pre-pandemic. I don\u2019t think most people do. But if you\u2019re in the high teens to low 20% range, it may go to 70% utilization, it was still triple what it is today. So would you expect to see improvement across those markets as we move through the year, as well as some of these jobs that are suburban locations that have sort of the same thing going on we should be like a Tyson\u2019s Corner here in Northern Virginia as an example. So we do expect healthy performance out of those markets, as we move through the year, and we\u2019ve seen that begin, and the trend should continue. It was a little hard to tell, is it the exact pace. And that\u2019s why Kevin made the comment that Northern California is still expected to trail the portfolio average revenue growth. But it is a market that could surprise to the upside. We just have to wait and see.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes, and also I had a follow up.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Sorry, I was just going to add an addition to the comments that, Sean to drivers that Sean referenced, you also just have overall job growth. You look at the overall job growth relative to pre-COVID levels in our urban markets and we continue to think that there\u2019s some pretty meaningful room to run there and will serve as a decent driver.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. And Sean, you had started to hit a little bit on my follow up there. So how did you go about I guess, underwriting same-store revenue growth for Northern California? What pace did you assume or how should we think about what\u2019s currently underlying that range?\nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean, the way I would think about it is kind of three pieces could give you a rough roadmap. First is obviously what\u2019s intended, which is easy. Where leases are today in January compared to they were basically on average for 2021. And then you\u2019ve got the loss-to-lease component, which is easy to compute. And then you have what you expect in terms of market rent growth. The third piece is the one that\u2019s most uncertain. So we can see where we\u2019re moving people in today in the last quarter as an example. And so we can assume that as leases expired moving through the year, we should be able to achieve at least that level. And then we have some modest growth built in beyond that based on a slow pace in terms of the return to office. But as Kevin mentioned earlier, things could accelerate there. It\u2019s just hard to put your finger on it as to how much incremental demand will show up, when it will show up and how much it will drive performance in 2022. For the most part, you need to see a meaningful increase in that demand and in market rents in the first half of the year for future revenue in 2022. Once you get to the second half that is mainly lease expirations etc, etc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: But it should can begin to converge versus other markets, most likely towards the back half of the year given comps otherwise, and then this potential lift that you kind of spoke to from demand coming into the market, is that fair?\nSean Breslin: When you say converge, converge relative to what?\nAustin Wurschmidt: Either blended lease rates slowing in other markets due to more difficult comps, whereas Northern California and certainly lagged, as you guys highlighted and then it starts to accelerate either as others decelerate or it\u2019s catching up?\nBen Schall: Certainly there is possibility. Yes. There\u2019s a possibility, one thing you have to realize is that the leases that were signed in the first half of 2021, still had fairly decent concessions. Rents are much lower than where they are. So you\u2019re going to see pretty good, effective rent growth in that market in the first half of the year. The second half will be dictated by some of the factors that I mentioned as it relates to demand.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Certainly, very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our next question from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Good afternoon. Can you just clarify the relationship between moving rents and your effective rent growth? So periodically, if you had or hypothetically, if moving rents were 23%, above for the remainder of the year would your effective rent growth beat 23% once it plays catch up?\nBen Schall: Not necessarily for some of the factors that mentioned earlier, John. I mean, you\u2019ve got those are strictly moving rents which given turnover rates, just call it roughly 50%. There is also renewables. And there are as I mentioned earlier, when I was talking about loss to lease there are constraints on renewals, and a number of our markets. Some are normal, like the rent regs in New York. Some are sort of this COVID overlay but it impacts about a third of the portfolios. You can\u2019t effectively assume that you\u2019re going to mark everyone to current move in rent values over the next 12 months as leases expire.\nJohn Kim: So that move in rent always going to be higher than your effective rent growth. Yes, I think part of it is timing part of it is other fictional factors. But I\u2019m just wondering, did the moving rents always appear higher than the effective rent growth that you achieve?\nBen Schall: Yes. I mean, you\u2019ve got, there\u2019s a number of different factors that feed into it. I mean, you\u2019ve got a lag. So again, moving rents for as a moment in time, we\u2019re talking about December versus January being up 23%. That was for that batch of movements during that period of time. And so you got sort of the two endpoints. So there\u2019s a lag in terms of what asking rents are and then people move in is typically lag there. You\u2019ve got a lag because of renewals, but in theory to your original question, if there were no constraints and no lags, and you could mark 100% of the rent roll to market on February 1, yes, you would see a significant move in the average rent, lease rent for the portfolio.\nJohn Kim: And a question on your development starts which this year are predominantly are 90% suburban? Is this year of view where secular trends will continue suburban versus urban? Or do you see urban development picking up after this year?\nMatt Birenbaum: Hey John, it\u2019s Matt. Yes, I think last year was also our starts level was also certainly at least 80% of urban, if not 90%. So I think it\u2019ll still be awhile for us. When I look at our development rights pipeline, I expected our starts will continue to weigh pretty heavily suburban over the next couple of years. That is where we\u2019re seeing better economics in terms of obviously, rents have recovered a lot more there as Sean\u2019s data showed. And also that tends to play to our strengths, because the suburban submarkets are more supply constrained, actually, entitlements are more difficult to get there. So we like the risk return profile there. The market as a whole, I think, in our established regions, you probably will see far fewer urban starts not just from us, but in general. In our expansion regions, there\u2019s a lot of urban start activity going on, as well as Suburban.\nJohn Kim: That\u2019s fair color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: Thank you for taking my questions. So I wanted to talk about that development pipeline and in your development starts for 2022. If we kind of go back in the last cycle, you were averaging about $1.4 billion in development starts sort of through that I think 2014, \u201815, \u201816 period. How should we think about development starts with the pipeline that you have today? I mean looking out, will there be a big step function change as we think about the next couple of years?\nMatt Birenbaum: It\u2019s Matt, Chandni. I can take a shot at that. And then I don\u2019t know if Kevin may want to weigh in as well or Ben. But yes, I mean, last cycle, we did ramp it up coming out of the GFC. And then there were a couple of years there, where we were running at that level you described, I think over the course of the six or seven years, it was more like 1 billion, 2 billion but we\u2019re bigger enterprise now and costs are up. So even on an apples-to-apples basis to do that much volume in the current environment that\u2019s probably more like a $5 billion, $6 billion a year in starts. And if we can find those opportunities, and we\u2019re feeling pretty optimistic based on our current book of business and the pipeline that we\u2019re seeing we\u2019re certainly ready and prepared and we look forward to the opportunity to be able to continue to grow.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: And to add on that Chandni the other part is the tie in with our expansion markets and so part of that moves provides an expanded opportunities that there and so early on, we\u2019re growing through a combination of acquisitions, funding other developers and our own development. But that pipeline will also start to accelerate. And so you look a couple of years out, yes, we expect the overall development pipeline to continue to grow in size.\nBen Schall: Maybe the final point there Chandni as you think sort of about the our ability to fund this development activity, it sort of is somewhat tied to what\u2019s going on in the core business where we are in the cycle, what kind of EBITDA growth we have and what our capital options look like. At the moment what we\u2019ve been doing is funding our external needs through a combination of newly issued debt and disposition, activity for this year, with respect to our capital needs of about $900 million. Current plan which of course can change is that we\u2019re likely to fund that primarily through the issuance of new debt and then modestly through some net disposition activity, of course capital market conditions and our users can change. But it kind of speaks to the notion of a couple of things. Obviously, with our EBITDA rising very briskly here this year, we can utilize debt to help fund development and it\u2019s an attractive sources it is, both in its loan right and on a real basis when you think about inflation. And we can do that by issuing debt, because our EBITDA is rising quite a bit. And we can be leveraged neutral in doing so. But in a typical year, in most years, we can fund about $1 billion to $1.3 billion or so of development activity through a combination of and free cash flow, selling assets, where we can retain the capital because of our gains capacity, and then leverage neutral issuance of debt. So that\u2019s kind of in a normal environment, plus or minus what we can do. We can probably do a little bit more early in the cycle as same-store NOI gross briskly as it is now. And potentially, at some point right now our equity or equity is attractive as a source for funding development, although at the moment, we find asset sales to be more attractive. But if we\u2019re going to be doing an awful lot more than those, that kind of level of development funding, it does imply that we\u2019re going to have some level of equity market access. So that\u2019s another constraint to layer in as think about what\u2019s possible. So the three constraints we traditionally think about is, we\u2019re constrained by opportunity set. We\u2019re constrained by sort of organizational capacity, and then we\u2019re constrained by sort of what we have on the capital side. So I was speaking sort of that third bucket right there.\nChandni Luthra: That\u2019s great level of detail. Thank you for that. And for my follow up question, I know you gave out good detail on how should we think about the low end versus high end of guidance and one gets you to each side. But could you perhaps contextualize cadence through the years? And how should we think about seasonality this year given this discounts are pretty much thrown out of the window in 2021?\nSean Breslin: Yes. This is Sean. What I was indicating earlier, just based on leases that were written in early 2021, the first half of 2021, basically, kind of being substantially below where things are today, that we do expect revenue growth to accelerate as we move through the year. As we move those leases, the market certainly is the driving factor. As Kevin mentioned, when we get to the back half of the year we expect bad debt to improve. So that also leads to accelerating revenue growth as we move through the year. So as it relates to seasonality in the back half of the year, it\u2019s a little too early to tell. We are expecting getting back to more like seasonal norms when we get the back half of the year as compared to what we experienced in 2021. It may be very different by market, depending on the sort of shape of effective rent growth as you move through the year. What demand comes back and when it comes back to some of these markets that we\u2019re talking about where we\u2019ll still expecting a more full return to the office, etc. So I would say that we are expecting more like seasonal norms when we get the back half of the year, but we\u2019ll probably know better as we get through say midyear, what that might look like.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thank you for the time. Sean, just one quick word for you, the 11% same store like term effective rent change and fourth quarter, can you give us a sense what it would have been had there been no regulatory curbs?\nSean Breslin: Yes, it would have been higher. I can\u2019t give that to you outside my head, John. But I can certainly circle back. And what I would say is what I mentioned earlier is about a third of the portfolio is currently constrained and you would have seen better renewal growth. My guess is to provide a little bit of color move-in rents were 12.5% and renewals, we\u2019re at 10. You probably would have seen the renewal side look more like the move-in side, but still a little bit of a Delta just because the lag between when renewal offers are made when they\u2019re actually signed leases renew, just as our renewal offers 60 to 90 days in advance, but you would have seen maybe another 100 basis points on a blended basis if the 10 went to 12 and 50% turnover as an example if you\u2019re looking at it and kind of theoretical terms.\nJohn Pawlowski: And then Ben or Kevin, the $880 million year mark from capital sales or asset sales and capital markets activity. To peel that back what\u2019s the kind of preliminary assumption assuming your cost of capital stays where it is, and the private market pricing stays where it is? What\u2019s the preliminary assumption for asset sales within that figure?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yes. Let me start a couple a little bit. So the external funding needed at is kind of what we really need to run the business. If we weren\u2019t we\u2019re just sort of really kind of not focused on it, the trading activity. So there will be a fair bit of acquisition and dispositions just kind of on a trading basis, through the investment group that Matt oversees. From the standpoint of raising external capital, our current plan, as I mentioned a moment ago, that it\u2019s funded largely through the issuance of newly issued debt. Just given more debt rates are today, although they\u2019re up from where they were 3, 4, 6 months ago, they\u2019re still quite attractive by almost any metric, and certainly attractive relative to our investment use which in this case is development. So the $900 million or so is really primarily fund the investment activity. So it will be mostly through debt, and we\u2019ll likely be able to do so in a leverage neutral basis. There is we do expect to be a modest net seller of assets and so those net disposition proceeds will be worked into a small component of that 900 million. And again, of course, as you point out, that\u2019s where we stand today. We think all of our main capital choices unsecured debt, selling assets, and issuing equity are attractive, but we rank order those debt and asset sales are a lot more attractive than selling assets, selling equity today. So our plan at the moment kind of puts asset sales and death, but just given our rising EBITDA growth and our capacity to issue debt on the leverage neutral basis, and both on an nominal and then on a real basis for debt rates are today, our preference is probably to use a little bit more debt here right now.\nBen Schall: John, and just a little bit more color on kind of overall transaction activity acquisition and dispositions. We are expecting both of those to be up relative up some relative to 2021. And Kevin, use the term sort of trading capital. And that tends to continue to be our approach, which is the trading capital out of predominantly northeast and assets that have had pretty good runs up in value tend to be older assets, lower IRR, profiles, and then redeploy that capital into our expansion markets to capture that growth and as part of our overall portfolio allocation objectives.\nJohn Pawlowski: But just one follow up on the rank ordering of sources of capital. I know, it\u2019s a very, very modest amount. But I still don\u2019t understand why there was any equity issued, given where cap rates are right now and to your point that just the private market pricing. So how is that conversation the fourth quarter to issue equity at these levels?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yes, I mean, this is maybe, kind of hit on a few high points we can certainly talk about that and some of this gets a little bit nuanced, and so forth. Starting at the top in terms of where we rank order, pricing, asset sales are kind of number one more or less at the 100 percentile, when, in the past, we\u2019ve talked about our heat map and our way of sort of looking at spot pricing and on an absolute known historical relative basis. So asset sales are probably number one. Debt issuances, kind of behind that in to the low 90 percentile range. And then equity for us is probably more in that mid 80% range. So I think we\u2019d agree with you probably on the rank order, I think probably where we might differ is perhaps just given where I know how you\u2019re looking at things, maybe you have a slightly different view of a greater separation with respect to equity pricing versus some of the other choices. From our standpoint it\u2019s particularly in a dynamic environment like this it\u2019s hard to be dogmatically focused mechanistically on NAV, although it\u2019s a dominant factor in our analysis, because NAV can move dynamically here. In terms of what we did philosophically there is, it does make sense to infuse the balance sheet with equity issuance when we think it is attractively priced relative development. And so just because it helps preserve a higher basis set of assets that in turn over time can help support our recycling strategy to continuously fund development. And so that\u2019s one element of why when it does make sense and feel it\u2019s attractive the price. Bringing in some equity does make sense. In terms of what we did in Q4, we had a modest amount of ATM issuance in early October, before issuance window closed and then a little bit more in a forward basis in late November or early December and the reason why we\u2019re looking to do a little bit there was just given where pricing was the moment. But market volatility, as you may recall, started to work back into the market. And we just chose to step back out of the market given that dynamic as well as capital position which as you can see here [Indiscernible] of unrestricted cash on our balance sheet was in an excellent position. So those are really the thoughts we\u2019ve probably raised about $2 billion last year, and maybe about $30 million was equity. So I think that gives you a sense of where we feel equity ranks in the mix. It\u2019s attractive, but not nearly so is asset sales and so that\u2019s kind of our general thoughts. Ben anything else you want to add?\nJohn Pawlowski: That\u2019s very helpful , thank you. I\u2019ll [indiscernible].\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So 10 years ago, you guys got the big multiple as the multifamily REITs and the Sunbelt players were several rungs below you, I know that that has changed. And so this question really is on your expansion market approach. You said that increasing number of people are moving into your urban areas for more than 150 miles away. And if I\u2019m a resident, I understand trying to avoid regulation, but if I\u2019m a resident, I might want to live in those regulated markets and protect myself to some degree. So to what extent are you married to this 20% to 25% range? And if you start to see some systemic things going back in the other direction that support long term urban over Sunbelt, would you yourself, make a change yourself?\nBen Schall: Hey Rich, it\u2019s a target right and so we put that out there to help drive internal activity and drive our resource allocation, particularly on the people side. The other part I emphasize is, this is -- we\u2019re going to move into these markets and diversify our markets over time and that is very much a part of kind of our measured approach here. Acquiring our development activity, these new markets inherently paces in our investment over a period of time. So we think if we look at overall portfolio optimization, for some of the reasons that we talked about diversification, diversification away from regulation. We think it makes sense to continue to move in this fashion. But that said, our established markets that\u2019s the bulk of our activity, where we\u2019re strong believers in those, in the trajectory of those markets going forward, and they\u2019re going to continue to get the bulk of our investment, both on the development side and on the people side.\nRich Anderson: Okay, fair enough. And then, just a quick follow up, some strange labor markets in the present tense, inflation, interest rates and so on. But you\u2019re ramping up development. Is that you\u2019re making a commitment by doing so two out years 2023 and 2024? Is that the way we should be thinking about it that this is not just a 2022 story, but you are making a call also on a continuation of above average, fundamental performance in out years. Is that a fair statement?\nBen Schall: It is. Yes. It is the direction we\u2019re moving. We definitely continue to pivot into growth mode. The build of our development pipeline, a lot of that is options on land. So we add a little bit to your first question, we will continue to be able to be flexible and adapt just based on market conditions at that point in time. But we are leaning in and do want to secure additional land rights, given the economics that we\u2019re seeing today. And we start forecast going out over the next year or so.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes, everyone. I just wanted to follow up on a comment you made earlier. You mentioned that it\u2019s harder to get building permits in the suburban markets versus urban. Just curious why that is and that\u2019s a new thing or so has been historically like that?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Sure, Joshua. This is Matt. Yes, it was really referring to entitlements. And that has been the case in our legacy or established regions for a long time. If you think about it, it comes back to politics. I mean, entitlement is a political decision and many of the suburban jurisdictions, you take New York, for example. We\u2019re in New York City. We\u2019re also in Long Island, New Jersey, Westchester County. The latter three Long Island, New Jersey, Westchester County they all have a bias against multifamily housing. The housing stock is primarily single family. A lot of people are there because of the school systems and they don\u2019t want more growth. They don\u2019t want more kids in the schools and there\u2019s a back-story there as well, where they there\u2019s just a bias against renters. You compare it contrast that with New York City. And there are certainly neighborhoods where it\u2019s difficult to get entitlements but a lot of what you can build in New York City, you can actually build by right. You don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s approval, you just go straight to building permit. You don\u2019t have to go through the planning commission, you don\u2019t have to go through the neighborhood advisory council and all those other things that we\u2019re so good at, that takes so long. So generally, and that\u2019s true in most of our markets, maybe not in the city of San Francisco. But certainly in the northeast, that\u2019s been the case. And even on the West Coast and if you look at the amount of supply in our established regions, urban versus suburban, the last decade, there\u2019s been a lot more as a percentage of supply in the urban sub market. Some of that\u2019s because there\u2019s been demand there. And some of that\u2019s because it\u2019s easier to build there. So we do think that that is a structural feature of our kind of the way our political and regulatory framework exists. And that plays to our strengths. And that\u2019s always been something that\u2019s been core to one of our strategic capabilities.\nBen Schall: Yes and it really speaks to benefits from the long term investment that we\u2019re making in these development platforms. The long track record that our lead developers have when the opportunities do surface for incremental rental housing in these markets we tend to be one of those first calls given the relationships, given execution, given what we deliver in these markets. And so that\u2019s why you\u2019re continuing to see significant investment and development in these expansion markets at the types of spreads that we\u2019ve referred to.\nJoshua Dennerlein: All right. That's great. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Good afternoon and thank you, so just a few questions here. Going back to Nick Joseph\u2019s question earlier on the call about the 200 basis points in margin and just yet thinking broad picture across the company, how much of the margin savings just comes from the fact that the job markets tight, so the ability to backfill position is tougher. So you may be running with fewer let\u2019s say you\u2019re running with few, with more open positions, meaning fewer positions filled than you\u2019d otherwise like, just sort of curious?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Alex this is Sean. The vacancy on payroll, if you want to think of it that way has nothing to do with the margin expansion. There will always be vacancy on payroll regardless just because you\u2019re never really 100% occupied, if you want to think about it from that perspective from a payroll standpoint. So there will always be some constant vacancy, because the margin improvement is directly as a result of initiatives that are associated with various activities.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So what you\u2019re saying is right now, in this current labor market, you haven\u2019t seen any out, your versus your historical payroll gap, you haven\u2019t seen that grow, that you\u2019re saving more G&A/property management, whatever expense, that gap has been pretty normal, despite the tight labor?\nSean Breslin: No, I think what I\u2019m trying to separate payroll vacancy from initiative benefit, I think it was your question, and there has been some incremental vacancy both in 2021 and where we sit today, that is independent of specific digital initiatives or other initiatives that will shape the nature of our operating model going forward, that will deliver the 200 basis point of margin improvement.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay, okay that\u2019s helpful. And then the second question is, as you guys underwrite your next set of projects, how are you looking at rent growth versus construction costs, timing delays and all that fun stuff? Is your view that rent growth will continue to outpace your costs such that development yields should hold or maybe improve or are you expecting some pressure on yields?\nMatt Birenbaum: Hey Alex, it\u2019s Matt. We generally tend to underwrite everything on a current basis whether it\u2019s a deal that we\u2019re signing up now that\u2019s not going to start for two years, or it\u2019s the class three budget and we\u2019re about to start it. We look at today\u2019s rents, today\u2019s expenses, today\u2019s hard costs and we come up with kind of a spot yield. So we don\u2019t, we generally don\u2019t trend, which generally is one reason why when our developments stabilized, they tend to beat the pro forma. Our current deals are running I think 30 or 40 basis points ahead of the initial underwriting, and that\u2019s not uncommon for us. So generally, that\u2019s served us well. What I would say is that right now, like if I compare deals to 6 or 9 or 12 months ago, the rent increase at which it gets some operating leverage, meaning the NOI increase is higher than the rent increase that has covered the increase in hard costs so far. And the yields are still in the high fives on the new business, we\u2019re underwriting, which is probably where they were a year ago. There is some risk that at some point hard costs tend to lag and so they may increase more quickly than rents rent NOIs in the out years. But there\u2019s also tremendous room in the margin. Right now, the development deal, the margins Ben was talking about the spread is massive. So even if that comes in some, it\u2019s still going to be very profitable business.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Yes, good afternoon. A couple of quick ones from me if I could start first on bad debt. Just going back to the topic of I think, I heard you correctly, not including any improvement in bad debts as your baseline outlook. I guess I\u2019m curious what\u2019s the thinking there? It seems a bit conservative. Some of your peers have tried to reflect this in their baseline outlooks. And then proportionally, what percent of that is California more specifically Northern California base? Thanks.\nBen Schall: Yes Haendel as it relates to bad debt, we are expecting an improvement. But if I refer to as sort of the underlying bad debt rate excluding any benefit from rent relief, and so it\u2019s roughly about a 40 basis point improvement is what we\u2019re expecting for 2022 relative to 2021. But it is timing. The timing is not even at all through the year. We basically expect the first half of the year to look a lot like the back end of 2021. And then deceleration in bad debt as you move through the third and fourth quarter of this year, so that\u2019s how I would think about it. As it relates to composition across the markets in California, in particular, the heavy place for bad debt really is LA. There\u2019s bad debt in Northern California. It\u2019s not nearly as bad as LA. So we can certainly get the numbers specifically for Northern California. But it won\u2019t be as much of an outlier as it is in Los Angeles.\nHaendel St. Juste: I\u2019ll follow up with you guys on both sets of numbers. And then a couple quick ones on development, I guess I\u2019m curious how much of the development cost of this year in terms of what\u2019s underway and what you\u2019ll be starting? What proportion of those costs are locked in? And then on the development NOI contribution you outline for this year, I think I heard you right and I think I understand that your current outlook for that is based on current market rents. It does not have any reflection of the market rate growth or any trending it\u2019s based on today\u2019s market rents?\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure. I can take this and I can take a shot at those. As it relates to what percentage of our costs are locked in. So on the deals that have already started, the 21 starts, when we start a project, we have what we call a class three budget. So at that point, we\u2019re pretty well locked in. We don\u2019t necessarily have all of the subcontractor contracts committed yet, but we have a very high percentage of them anywhere between 60%, 70%. So I would say we\u2019re pretty well covered there. And if you look historically, we have a track record of delivering our projects on time and on budget within a point or two. So the risk is probably more on the jobs that haven\u2019t started yet, the jobs that we\u2019re planning to start in \u201822. The soft costs are pretty nailed down. The land cost is defined. The exposure there is further increases in hard costs between now and when we can get those deals permitted and bought out and how that increase might be different than what might have an NOI and so we have a little bit of exposure there. But I would have said the same thing six months ago and as I said, even through the last two, three quarters, the yields have more or less held up. And in general those deals, the deals we\u2019re looking to start this year, underwritten yields today on the un-trended numbers are in the high 5s, 5.7, 5.8. And we certainly hope they stay there. But even if they do get some cost pressure, they wind up 5.5 that\u2019s still very strong value creation. As it relates to the NOI for \u201822 on the lease up deals that is based on today\u2019s rents and the lease up budgets that were prepared our deal by deal specific I think Sean has a little more color on that.\nSean Breslin: Yes, well one thing I would add on that is most of the deals that are delivering the NOI this year have been mark-to-market, but there are three deals that are expected to start delivering in \u201822 and go on to lease up the three deals, the rents have not yet been mark-to-market. So there should be a little bit given the environment, there should be a little bit of inflation associated with those three assets when it begins to deliver.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it, very helpful, thanks. And one last one, just thinking about your development in your expansion markets. I think you mentioned 20% of this year starts will be in those markets. I guess, how do we think about that longer term? What proportion of your annual starts or spend could come from those markets? And any noticeable difference in underwritten yields between in your expansion versus established markets? Thanks.\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes it\u2019s Matt. I mean, we\u2019ll see over time certainly, if our goal is that those markets are going to be 20% to 25% of our overall portfolio, we would look for it to be at least that much of our development pipeline, but it\u2019s going to take some time. That is an activity that benefits from the local presence from the knowledge from the flywheel if you will. So I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s going to be materially different over the next year or two. The one exception to that would be, as Ben was talking about this program, in addition to doing our own development, we are looking to provide capital and fund other developers with deals that they might have, where they\u2019re ready to go and are looking for capital. We have one deal that we\u2019re going to start this year in North Carolina that fits that description, one of our deals in Florida under construction fits that description, those deals will probably be a little less profitable because we do have local sponsors. They are a little bit lower risk, a little bit lower yield, they\u2019re kind of halfway between a development and an acquisition is the way we tend to think about it. So we may see some of that pickup.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Ben, over Avalon\u2019s time in terms of market expansions and growing and I take it that you\u2019ve always pursued a very measured approach. There\u2019s always been sometimes a transaction that speeds up the process, either through swaps with other REITs or potential transactions with private partners either on a buy or sell side, given all the activity that\u2019s happening in the multifamily market, is there an opportunity today, where some of this transformation could be accelerated?\nBen Schall: Yes. Thanks, Michael. Yes, it\u2019s a possibility. But I wouldn\u2019t describe it as a priority right now. I think there we do look at some of the portfolios that are out there. They tend to be more geographically dispersed and given our focus on our core set of expansion markets and really, in its approach based on for us to create value, we want to be able to leverage our full operating teams and our development teams to create that value. We stay pretty narrow from a geographic perspective. So there could be a portfolio that fits enough of the kind of strike zone for us that we would look at. And so that that will stay on our radar, but I expect more of our activity to be similar to what you\u2019ve seen in 2021 with some expanded growth going into this year and following years.\nMichael Bilerman: And I guess in your mind today, would you be more leaning towards likely accelerating dispositions or conversely trying to find and maybe taking down more deals before you sell? I\u2019m just curious sort of where you\u2019re finding the most demand, because I would imagine, even though some of these portfolios are geographically dispersed, given the relationships you have with third party capital sources, you may be able to do something unique there as well. And I just didn\u2019t know where the bias was today, whether you want to hit the bid on the sale or whether you want to be aggressive on the buy?\nBen Schall: Yes, there is a matching component of it, I would say given the run ups that we\u2019ve seen in our existing markets and also seeing the run ups in some of the markets that were growing and we\u2019re comfortable at this point in sort of the trade capital arena what sort of matching a level of disposition activity and redeploying that capital and expansion markets for incremental growth, then as you\u2019re referring to it would mean tapping into additional disposition activity or potentially tapping into incremental equity. And right now, we sort of look out on it, like we\u2019re going to continue to and progress in a fairly measured way. And then the last piece that sort of emphasize, I mean, from an overall total investment perspective, we\u2019re continuing to invest significantly $2 billion plus this year, but a good portion of that\u2019s going into our established markets around these development opportunities. And so as we look at from a risk return perspective leveraging our existing teams and being able to unlock the next rounds of that 200 to 250 basis point spread that remains very high on our list in terms of attractiveness.\nMichael Bilerman: Right. When you think about all the land that you control either through contract or on the balance sheet, and you have a long runway to continue that growth in your established markets with very attractive returns. That wasn\u2019t a question. That was a comment. I had another just one question for you, Ben now that you\u2019ve sort of been in the seat for the last year at Avalon being in a pure multifamily platform, has your mind changed at all about sort of how you view mixed use in terms of ownership at Avalon, just drawing on your previous experiences. I am just wondering how that has evolved in your thinking, for Avalon in terms of its ownership of other pieces or maybe getting involved in more complex projects. Just sort of walk me through your mindset today on that?\nBen Schall: Yes, good question. It continues to be, I think, the conversion of retail land -- as well as suburban office land continues to be an attractive source of land inventory for us. And as we\u2019re building, building up our pipeline that\u2019s a decent amount of it. I\u2019d say today, actually, probably a little bit more of it is to defunct suburban office product that we can control, a little simpler on the execution, smaller sites and so we\u2019re finding some good opportunities there, particularly in our established markets, a little bit more broadly. In Avalon Bay of the peers has been the most successful and partnering with others and when it works, it really works well. We open a project recently in Woburn Mass, which is an even sort of the broadest of mixed use environments. But part of the attractiveness there is the ability for our residents to walk out their door and have access to the grocery store and restaurants. And so when we can find those opportunities with the right partners, it is something that we\u2019ll continue to lean into.\nMichael Bilerman: Right, I appreciate it. See you down in Florida.\nBen Schall: Sounds good.\nOperator: It appears that there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Mr. Ben Schall for any additional or closing remarks.\nBen Schall: Thank you, and thank you to everyone for joining today. We look forward to engaging further with you over the coming months.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Birenbaum",
            "content": "Hi, great. Thanks, Kevin. On Slide 18, we could see that we're continuing to ramp up our development activity in response to the favorable market conditions. We had been starting roughly a billion one with new development per year, most of the prior cycle before sharply curtailing new investment activity as COVID hit in 2020. We've been able to shift gears aggressively last year getting back to an annual start level of roughly $1.2 billion and expect similar volume this year. And this development continues to be very profitable with current development underway, underwritten too an initial stabilized yield at 6%. With cap rates in the mid three's, this puts us on track to extend the tremendous value creation margin Ben mentioned on our 2021 completions. In the pie charts on the right, you can also see how market performance and our portfolio allocation priorities are reflecting in our recent starts activity with 90% of the \u201821 and \u201822 starts in suburban location and a broad geographic mix including more than 20% in our expansion regions. As we accelerate our starts activity, our regional development teams have also been focused on back selling the development right pipeline to generate the next set of investment opportunities for 2023 and beyond. As shown on Slide 19, we have future development sites under control across all of our regions that have seen a market increase in pipeline activity in the past few quarters. The project shown on the slide here represents $2.6 billion of future starts activity over the next two to three years and excludes some of our longer term densification opportunities at existing assets which brings our total development rights pipeline to $3.3 billion at the end of 2021. And we've been even more active so far this year with an additional $700 million approved by our investment committee just in January and more on the way including our first development right in Austin, Texas. This activity puts us on track to exceed $4 billion in development rights by the end of the first quarter. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ben. Rich this is Matt. I mean, as it relates to the \u201822 earnings that's more or less the die is cast at this point; there's not going to be huge variations in that number because those are deals that are already under construction and in many cases have already started leasing. So the variability there would be around what is the actual lease up pace and rate, does it do a little better, a little worse than what we've projected. But the bigger place where it will start to move the needle more materially in the out years would relate to starts that might happen this year. Yes, no. Rich, it's Matt. It's just these deals are lumpy. And one deal happens to start in December versus January or February that can change the number, kind of on any particular period of time you want to take rolling four quarters or calendar year. So I would tend to look at it more kind of on a two year basis, which is why that's the way we presented the slide. You think about \u201821, \u201822 together to $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion worth of starts and again, we're looking to accelerate that and hopefully \u201823 we do even more. Yes. That's reflected in the bar that Kevin identified on the slide, Rich. If you take a look at that, that includes, it's basically the confluence of different pieces, the very first bar on the lease rates. They reflect sort of the embedded piece, how much of the loss lease you can capture as well as the effective change you might see in rents as you move through the year, so all of that is embedded in that number. Correct. That is correct. Hey John, it's Matt. Yes, I think last year was also our starts level was also certainly at least 80% of urban, if not 90%. So I think it'll still be awhile for us. When I look at our development rights pipeline, I expected our starts will continue to weigh pretty heavily suburban over the next couple of years. That is where we're seeing better economics in terms of obviously, rents have recovered a lot more there as Sean's data showed. And also that tends to play to our strengths, because the suburban submarkets are more supply constrained, actually, entitlements are more difficult to get there. So we like the risk return profile there. The market as a whole, I think, in our established regions, you probably will see far fewer urban starts not just from us, but in general. In our expansion regions, there's a lot of urban start activity going on, as well as Suburban. It's Matt, Chandni. I can take a shot at that. And then I don't know if Kevin may want to weigh in as well or Ben. But yes, I mean, last cycle, we did ramp it up coming out of the GFC. And then there were a couple of years there, where we were running at that level you described, I think over the course of the six or seven years, it was more like 1 billion, 2 billion but we're bigger enterprise now and costs are up. So even on an apples-to-apples basis to do that much volume in the current environment that's probably more like a $5 billion, $6 billion a year in starts. And if we can find those opportunities, and we're feeling pretty optimistic based on our current book of business and the pipeline that we're seeing we're certainly ready and prepared and we look forward to the opportunity to be able to continue to grow. Yes. Sure, Joshua. This is Matt. Yes, it was really referring to entitlements. And that has been the case in our legacy or established regions for a long time. If you think about it, it comes back to politics. I mean, entitlement is a political decision and many of the suburban jurisdictions, you take New York, for example. We're in New York City. We're also in Long Island, New Jersey, Westchester County. The latter three Long Island, New Jersey, Westchester County they all have a bias against multifamily housing. The housing stock is primarily single family. A lot of people are there because of the school systems and they don't want more growth. They don't want more kids in the schools and there's a back-story there as well, where they there's just a bias against renters. You compare it contrast that with New York City. And there are certainly neighborhoods where it's difficult to get entitlements but a lot of what you can build in New York City, you can actually build by right. You don't need anybody's approval, you just go straight to building permit. You don't have to go through the planning commission, you don't have to go through the neighborhood advisory council and all those other things that we're so good at, that takes so long. So generally, and that's true in most of our markets, maybe not in the city of San Francisco. But certainly in the northeast, that's been the case. And even on the West Coast and if you look at the amount of supply in our established regions, urban versus suburban, the last decade, there's been a lot more as a percentage of supply in the urban sub market. Some of that's because there's been demand there. And some of that's because it's easier to build there. So we do think that that is a structural feature of our kind of the way our political and regulatory framework exists. And that plays to our strengths. And that's always been something that's been core to one of our strategic capabilities. Hey Alex, it's Matt. We generally tend to underwrite everything on a current basis whether it's a deal that we're signing up now that's not going to start for two years, or it's the class three budget and we're about to start it. We look at today's rents, today's expenses, today's hard costs and we come up with kind of a spot yield. So we don't, we generally don't trend, which generally is one reason why when our developments stabilized, they tend to beat the pro forma. Our current deals are running I think 30 or 40 basis points ahead of the initial underwriting, and that's not uncommon for us. So generally, that's served us well. What I would say is that right now, like if I compare deals to 6 or 9 or 12 months ago, the rent increase at which it gets some operating leverage, meaning the NOI increase is higher than the rent increase that has covered the increase in hard costs so far. And the yields are still in the high fives on the new business, we're underwriting, which is probably where they were a year ago. There is some risk that at some point hard costs tend to lag and so they may increase more quickly than rents rent NOIs in the out years. But there's also tremendous room in the margin. Right now, the development deal, the margins Ben was talking about the spread is massive. So even if that comes in some, it's still going to be very profitable business. Sure. I can take this and I can take a shot at those. As it relates to what percentage of our costs are locked in. So on the deals that have already started, the 21 starts, when we start a project, we have what we call a class three budget. So at that point, we're pretty well locked in. We don't necessarily have all of the subcontractor contracts committed yet, but we have a very high percentage of them anywhere between 60%, 70%. So I would say we're pretty well covered there. And if you look historically, we have a track record of delivering our projects on time and on budget within a point or two. So the risk is probably more on the jobs that haven't started yet, the jobs that we're planning to start in \u201822. The soft costs are pretty nailed down. The land cost is defined. The exposure there is further increases in hard costs between now and when we can get those deals permitted and bought out and how that increase might be different than what might have an NOI and so we have a little bit of exposure there. But I would have said the same thing six months ago and as I said, even through the last two, three quarters, the yields have more or less held up. And in general those deals, the deals we're looking to start this year, underwritten yields today on the un-trended numbers are in the high 5s, 5.7, 5.8. And we certainly hope they stay there. But even if they do get some cost pressure, they wind up 5.5 that's still very strong value creation. As it relates to the NOI for \u201822 on the lease up deals that is based on today's rents and the lease up budgets that were prepared our deal by deal specific I think Sean has a little more color on that. Yes it's Matt. I mean, we'll see over time certainly, if our goal is that those markets are going to be 20% to 25% of our overall portfolio, we would look for it to be at least that much of our development pipeline, but it's going to take some time. That is an activity that benefits from the local presence from the knowledge from the flywheel if you will. So I'm not sure that it's going to be materially different over the next year or two. The one exception to that would be, as Ben was talking about this program, in addition to doing our own development, we are looking to provide capital and fund other developers with deals that they might have, where they're ready to go and are looking for capital. We have one deal that we're going to start this year in North Carolina that fits that description, one of our deals in Florida under construction fits that description, those deals will probably be a little less profitable because we do have local sponsors. They are a little bit lower risk, a little bit lower yield, they're kind of halfway between a development and an acquisition is the way we tend to think about it. So we may see some of that pickup."

            "content": "Thanks, Sean. Turning to 2022. Apartment fundamentals in our established markets remain highly attractive. On Slide 13, we show just how strong they are by providing data on some key trends including strong job and wage growth for the professional services sector which includes our target renters. The opportunity for further gains in office utilization from today's low levels, rising single family home prices which support rental demand and a relatively stable outlook for new apartment deliveries in our markets. On Slide 14, we provide our financial outlook for 2022. For the year, we expect robust growth from both our same-store portfolio and from stabilizing development to drive nearly 16% growth in core FFO per share at the midpoint of our guidance of $9.55. In our same-store residential portfolio, we expect a continued rebound from the pandemic in our urban markets and continued economic momentum across our entire portfolio. During the midpoint of guidance, we project same-store residential revenue will increase by 8.25% based on growth in our urban portfolio in the low 10% range and growth in our suburban portfolio in the low-to-mid 7% range. We project same-store residential operating expenses were increase by 4.75% primarily due to cost pressure in a couple of categories initiated as being deployed and some one-time benefits in 2021 that are not present in 2022. As far cost pressure, we're experiencing these primarily in two areas. First, in utilities as a result of very favorable supply contracts for commodities that expired late last year. And second, in property taxes resulting from successful appeals in the prior year period and the expiration of certain pilot programs in New York which will burn off over the next few years but at the same time allow us to exit rent stabilization and achieved full market rents on most of those committees over time. Among our various initiatives, we started to deploy our bulk internet smart access offering which will create a year-over-year expense headwind of about 50 basis points in 2022. It is part of the strategy to deliver a net profit of more than $30 million when this is stabilized over the next few years. And lastly, we've realized some one time benefits in 2021, including a payroll tax credit in Q4 returning of about a 30 basis point of headwind to OpEx growth in 2022. As a result, we expect same-store residential net operating income will increase by 10% in 2022. For development, we expect to continue to generate earnings in NAV growth from stabilizing developments and to continue investing heavily in this differentiated capability as you could see here on this slide. For our capital plan, we projected external capital sources of about $900 million from asset sales, our closure sale activity and capital markets activity. For our capital uses, we expect to deploy about $1.2 billion towards development, redevelopment, and debt maturities in 2022. Finally, in our earnings release, we've also provided earnings guidance for Q1, to which at the midpoint we project core FFO per share of $2.20 in the first quarter or about $0.07 lower than in Q4. This sequential earnings decline is driven by several items, including OpEx increases in utilities, property taxes and payroll, including previously mentioned payroll tax credit Q4. All that increase is due to compensation adjustments and strategic initiatives and NOI decreases from net disposition activity in Q4. On Slide 15, we illustrate the components of our expected 15.6% growth in core FFO per share. Most of our growth specifically a $1.02 per share is expected to come from NOI growth and our same-store redevelopment portfolios. About a third of our earnings growth or $0.44 per share is due to NOI from investment activity which in turn is primarily from development. Partially offsetting these sources of growth is combined increase of about $0.17 per share from capital market activity and increases in overhead. On Slide 16, we show the key components driving our expected a net quarter overall increase in same-store residential revenue including our expectation for a strong increase in these rates, a favorable impact from a lower level amortized and newly granted concessions, an increase in other rental revenue and modest improvement in underlying uncollectible lease revenue which we expect will remain elevated in the first half of 2022 before slowly improving in the second half of the year. However, we are assuming a year-over-year reduction of about $18 million in a recognized rent release collections from the emergency rental assistance program which results in about a 90 basis point headwind to our projected full year residential revenue growth rate. Moving to same-store residential revenue trend across our markets on Slide 17. Our expansion markets at Denver and Southeast Florida are expected to lead the portfolio revenue growth in 2022 followed by Pacific Northwest. With the reason Sean mentioned earlier, we expect Northern California to trail the portfolio average, however it's a region with a history of outside down cycles followed by robust recoveries. So we could be favorably surprised by actual performance in Northern California that has removed through the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt to discuss our plans for our future development activity. Sorry, I was just going to add an addition to the comments that, Sean to drivers that Sean referenced, you also just have overall job growth. You look at the overall job growth relative to pre-COVID levels in our urban markets and we continue to think that there's some pretty meaningful room to run there and will serve as a decent driver. And to add on that Chandni the other part is the tie in with our expansion markets and so part of that moves provides an expanded opportunities that there and so early on, we're growing through a combination of acquisitions, funding other developers and our own development. But that pipeline will also start to accelerate. And so you look a couple of years out, yes, we expect the overall development pipeline to continue to grow in size. Yes. Let me start a couple a little bit. So the external funding needed at is kind of what we really need to run the business. If we weren't we're just sort of really kind of not focused on it, the trading activity. So there will be a fair bit of acquisition and dispositions just kind of on a trading basis, through the investment group that Matt oversees. From the standpoint of raising external capital, our current plan, as I mentioned a moment ago, that it's funded largely through the issuance of newly issued debt. Just given more debt rates are today, although they're up from where they were 3, 4, 6 months ago, they're still quite attractive by almost any metric, and certainly attractive relative to our investment use which in this case is development. So the $900 million or so is really primarily fund the investment activity. So it will be mostly through debt, and we'll likely be able to do so in a leverage neutral basis. There is we do expect to be a modest net seller of assets and so those net disposition proceeds will be worked into a small component of that 900 million. And again, of course, as you point out, that's where we stand today. We think all of our main capital choices unsecured debt, selling assets, and issuing equity are attractive, but we rank order those debt and asset sales are a lot more attractive than selling assets, selling equity today. So our plan at the moment kind of puts asset sales and death, but just given our rising EBITDA growth and our capacity to issue debt on the leverage neutral basis, and both on an nominal and then on a real basis for debt rates are today, our preference is probably to use a little bit more debt here right now. Yes, I mean, this is maybe, kind of hit on a few high points we can certainly talk about that and some of this gets a little bit nuanced, and so forth. Starting at the top in terms of where we rank order, pricing, asset sales are kind of number one more or less at the 100 percentile, when, in the past, we've talked about our heat map and our way of sort of looking at spot pricing and on an absolute known historical relative basis. So asset sales are probably number one. Debt issuances, kind of behind that in to the low 90 percentile range. And then equity for us is probably more in that mid 80% range. So I think we'd agree with you probably on the rank order, I think probably where we might differ is perhaps just given where I know how you're looking at things, maybe you have a slightly different view of a greater separation with respect to equity pricing versus some of the other choices. From our standpoint it's particularly in a dynamic environment like this it's hard to be dogmatically focused mechanistically on NAV, although it's a dominant factor in our analysis, because NAV can move dynamically here. In terms of what we did philosophically there is, it does make sense to infuse the balance sheet with equity issuance when we think it is attractively priced relative development. And so just because it helps preserve a higher basis set of assets that in turn over time can help support our recycling strategy to continuously fund development. And so that's one element of why when it does make sense and feel it's attractive the price. Bringing in some equity does make sense. In terms of what we did in Q4, we had a modest amount of ATM issuance in early October, before issuance window closed and then a little bit more in a forward basis in late November or early December and the reason why we're looking to do a little bit there was just given where pricing was the moment. But market volatility, as you may recall, started to work back into the market. And we just chose to step back out of the market given that dynamic as well as capital position which as you can see here [Indiscernible] of unrestricted cash on our balance sheet was in an excellent position. So those are really the thoughts we've probably raised about $2 billion last year, and maybe about $30 million was equity. So I think that gives you a sense of where we feel equity ranks in the mix. It's attractive, but not nearly so is asset sales and so that's kind of our general thoughts. Ben anything else you want to add?"

            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "Alright, thanks Ben. I've thought I'd share a few slides on recent portfolio rent trends both overall and across different markets and sub-markets. Starting on Slide 9, 2021 was a pretty unique year. In the first half of the year, we experienced not only a significant recovery in our business, with the average move-in rent grew fast enough to exceed pre-COVID peak rent levels by mid-year. And in second half of the year, the combination of lower turnover which was down 20% year-over-year, 11% below pre-COVID levels and the lowest we've seen in 10 years along with a healthy demand resulted in rents defined seasonal norms by growing into September and then flattening through year end. Historically, we'd see rental rates peak in July and August and then decline in the low single digit percentage range through year end as represented by the dash line for 2019. For the calendar year 2021, the portfolio average move-in rent grew by 23% and at year end exceeded 2019 levels by about 9%. Moving to Slide 10, improved performance has been broad based with every region experienced a significant increase in average move-in rent over the past year. Average move-in rent in New England increased by 30% during 2021, the highest of our established regions at end of the year about 10% above pre-COVID levels. Improved performance in Boston has been supported by healthy job growth across various industries most notably Biotech and reduced apartment deliveries in both urban and suburban sub markets. In addition, for a region that is typically more seasonal given the weather patterns, it's quite unusual to see rents flatten out in the last quarter of the year versus decline. That's the sign of a pretty strong market. In Southern California, the average move-in rent grew by 23% during 2021 and at year end it was 21% above 2019 levels, the highest of our established regions. Performance has been supported by solid job growth particularly in the content producing sector of the economy in LA, the lowest level of new multifamily supply of any of our regions at 1.1% of stock and a very tight single family market.  At the other end of the spectrum, Northern California continue to lag the portfolio due to major tech employers delaying their return to the office impacted the reopening of other businesses and agile quality of life in the region. While the average move-in rent increased by 15% during 2021, at year end it was so roughly 7% below pre-COVID levels. For the region has lagged in the recovery, we could see a very meaningful increase in moving rents in 2022 when a greater percentage of the workforce particularly the tech segments that have experienced very robust wage increases in the past couple of years, go back to the office. We got a line at New York, New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions all delivered a 20% to 25% increase in average move-in rent during 2021. The mid-Atlantic ended the year with rents favor about 5% above 2019 levels. For Pacific Northwest and New York/New Jersey regions, we're trending a roughly 10% ahead of 2019 levels. Turning to Slide 11 to address suburban and urban performance trends, the average move-in rent for our suburban portfolio increased by roughly 20% during 2021 and was approximately 13% of 2019 levels at year end. And our urban portfolio, while the average move-in rent increased almost 30% during 2021, it was essentially at 2019 levels by the end of the year. Urban markets with rents still below 2019 levels include San Francisco at about 17% and Washington DC at roughly 3%. In contrast, rents in New York City are currently above 4% above 2019 levels. With that, utilization rates in the high teens in the San Francisco Metro area at low to mid 20% range in both New York City and Washington DC. We should continue to see a meaningful improvement in demand in our urban submarkets as a greater percentage of the workforce has called back to the office. We see an increasing size of that demand returning. In Q4, our urban portfolio experienced about a 30% increase in a share of move-ins from more than a 150 miles away as compared to pre-COVID norms. In markets like New York City and San Francisco, the share of move-ins from greater than 150 miles away increased by roughly 50% compared to historical norms. And we're along just the move-ins are incurring in our suburban portfolio as well but the increased share is more like in the 20% range. And moving to Slide 12, the improvement of rent levels has translated into strong like-term effective rent change. The average likeness of rent change in Q4, 2021 with October and November in the high 10% range followed by December at roughly 11.5%. The positive momentum continued in the January, the rent change were roughly 12.5%. Importantly we experienced a meaningful increase of rent change across six of our eight regions in January. And overall, we're starting the year from a position of strength, January occupancy averaged 96.4%, asking rents have increased 1.5% since the first of the year. And we're seeing early signs of continued low turnover in an environment with very healthy rent increases. With that operating summary, I'll turn it to Kevin to address our full outlook for 2022. Kevin? Yes, Nick, this is Sean. It is a multiyear process. It's going to take us a few years to work through everything. But we're making steady progress. I'd say if you talk about over the next 36 months to 48 months, it's in the ballpark to work through all of it. Yes, Rich this is Sean. It's trending at 12%. In the urban markets, specifically, you're talking about Austin. Yes. We started to see that occur in Q2. It's really accelerated as we get into Q3 and Q4 in terms of the percentage of movements coming from more than 150 miles away. I suspect and I haven't looked at the full data for January may have slowed a little bit just given Omicron. But I think our belief is that we're going to continue to see a steady improvement in places like New York City, DC, San Francisco, as more people are brought back to the office, we don't think office utilization is going to go back to exactly where it was pre-pandemic. I don't think most people do. But if you're in the high teens to low 20% range, it may go to 70% utilization, it was still triple what it is today. So would you expect to see improvement across those markets as we move through the year, as well as some of these jobs that are suburban locations that have sort of the same thing going on we should be like a Tyson's Corner here in Northern Virginia as an example. So we do expect healthy performance out of those markets, as we move through the year, and we've seen that begin, and the trend should continue. It was a little hard to tell, is it the exact pace. And that's why Kevin made the comment that Northern California is still expected to trail the portfolio average revenue growth. But it is a market that could surprise to the upside. We just have to wait and see. Yes. I mean, the way I would think about it is kind of three pieces could give you a rough roadmap. First is obviously what's intended, which is easy. Where leases are today in January compared to they were basically on average for 2021. And then you've got the loss-to-lease component, which is easy to compute. And then you have what you expect in terms of market rent growth. The third piece is the one that's most uncertain. So we can see where we're moving people in today in the last quarter as an example. And so we can assume that as leases expired moving through the year, we should be able to achieve at least that level. And then we have some modest growth built in beyond that based on a slow pace in terms of the return to office. But as Kevin mentioned earlier, things could accelerate there. It's just hard to put your finger on it as to how much incremental demand will show up, when it will show up and how much it will drive performance in 2022. For the most part, you need to see a meaningful increase in that demand and in market rents in the first half of the year for future revenue in 2022. Once you get to the second half that is mainly lease expirations etc, etc. When you say converge, converge relative to what? Yes. This is Sean. What I was indicating earlier, just based on leases that were written in early 2021, the first half of 2021, basically, kind of being substantially below where things are today, that we do expect revenue growth to accelerate as we move through the year. As we move those leases, the market certainly is the driving factor. As Kevin mentioned, when we get to the back half of the year we expect bad debt to improve. So that also leads to accelerating revenue growth as we move through the year. So as it relates to seasonality in the back half of the year, it's a little too early to tell. We are expecting getting back to more like seasonal norms when we get the back half of the year as compared to what we experienced in 2021. It may be very different by market, depending on the sort of shape of effective rent growth as you move through the year. What demand comes back and when it comes back to some of these markets that we're talking about where we'll still expecting a more full return to the office, etc. So I would say that we are expecting more like seasonal norms when we get the back half of the year, but we'll probably know better as we get through say midyear, what that might look like. Yes, it would have been higher. I can't give that to you outside my head, John. But I can certainly circle back. And what I would say is what I mentioned earlier is about a third of the portfolio is currently constrained and you would have seen better renewal growth. My guess is to provide a little bit of color move-in rents were 12.5% and renewals, we're at 10. You probably would have seen the renewal side look more like the move-in side, but still a little bit of a Delta just because the lag between when renewal offers are made when they're actually signed leases renew, just as our renewal offers 60 to 90 days in advance, but you would have seen maybe another 100 basis points on a blended basis if the 10 went to 12 and 50% turnover as an example if you're looking at it and kind of theoretical terms. Yes, Alex this is Sean. The vacancy on payroll, if you want to think of it that way has nothing to do with the margin expansion. There will always be vacancy on payroll regardless just because you're never really 100% occupied, if you want to think about it from that perspective from a payroll standpoint. So there will always be some constant vacancy, because the margin improvement is directly as a result of initiatives that are associated with various activities. No, I think what I'm trying to separate payroll vacancy from initiative benefit, I think it was your question, and there has been some incremental vacancy both in 2021 and where we sit today, that is independent of specific digital initiatives or other initiatives that will shape the nature of our operating model going forward, that will deliver the 200 basis point of margin improvement. Yes, well one thing I would add on that is most of the deals that are delivering the NOI this year have been mark-to-market, but there are three deals that are expected to start delivering in \u201822 and go on to lease up the three deals, the rents have not yet been mark-to-market. So there should be a little bit given the environment, there should be a little bit of inflation associated with those three assets when it begins to deliver."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Ben Schall",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. And thank you, to everyone for joining us on the call today and for your engagement. Kevin, Matt, Sean and I will provide some initial commentary and then we will open the session up for questions. I want to start by thanking the AVB associate base, 3,000 strong, for all their contributions throughout 2021. Thanks to your commitment, we produce strong business results and embarked on our next phase of growth by ramping up our development and investment activity all while navigating the challenges presented by the pandemic. Thank you especially to everyone working on site at our communities and construction projects and to our human resource teams for all you do to support each other, serve prospects and residents and build for our future. Turning to the presentation, Slide 4 provides the summary of our success and strong finish to 2021. On the operating side in the fourth quarter, we delivered a 12.4% increase in core FFO and a 4.7% increase in same store revenue. On a cash basis, same store revenue increased 8.3%. This momentum continues in the New Year as we build on our strong operating foundation with healthy occupancy levels, low resident turnover and strong embedded revenue growth. We also successfully ramped our investment activity in 2021 with almost $2 billion of new development starts and acquisitions and with the bulk of this capital funded by dispositions and incremental debt financing at an historically low cost of capital. In an otherwise low yielding environment, our development capabilities allow us to generate significant value and meaningful incremental NOI growth on top of the internal growth generated by our operating portfolio. As shown on Slide 5, we completed $1.1 billion of projects in 2021 with an expected $65 million of new NOI upon stabilization. At a development yield of 6% and with a 230 basis point spread to an estimated market cap rate of 3.7%, these communities have created $650 million in value. That's a very robust 60% value creation margin. As Matt will describe further, we expect to start an additional $1 billion to $1.250 billion of development projects this year at projected yields of 5.5% to 6.0% and we control a growing development rights pipeline which will set the stage for continued accretion and value creation from our development platform for many years to come. As we continue to invest and grow, we're also optimizing the earnings growth and long term value of our existing portfolio. A large component of this optimization is the selling of older assets with slower growth profiles and redeploying that capital into more expansion markets. During 2021, as highlighted on Slide 6, this led to our acquisition of $725 million of assets with an average age of three years at a 3.8% cap rate and a disposition of $865 million of assets with an average age of 26 years at a 3.7% cap rate. The bulk of our acquisitions were and will continue to be in our expansion markets which over time across Southeast Florida, Denver, Austin, Dallas, Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham, we see as having the potential to grow to become 20% to 25% of our portfolio through a combination of development and acquisitions. These expansion market share many of the same characteristics as our established markets including concentrations of knowledge based workers and strong housing fundamentals. They also provide portfolio diversification and increased exposure to longer term population shifts. So, most of our portfolio and new development capital in the long terms will be in our established markets where we have a high quality portfolio of assets situated in regions that we believe will continue to thrive as vibrant centers of innovation, education, technology, and with strong job and income profiles. And in regions where we continue to leverage our long tenure with some of the strongest operating and development teams in the multifamily industry. Turning to Slide 7, we continue to make significant investments in technology and innovation as we evolve our operating platform in order to provide enhanced value to prospects and residents while achieving operating efficiencies and driving new sources of revenue. We generated approximately $10 million of incremental NOI from our initiatives already deployed and about 1/3rd of the way to delivering our target of 200 basis points of margin improvement or $40 million to $50 million of NOI to the bottom line. Finally, I want to emphasize our continuing investment in our people and our leadership in ESG. Starting with ESG, our goal is to keep AvalonBay on the forefront as a leader in sustainability and corporate responsibility, an area of increasing importance for our residents, associates and investors. As an output of this corporate leadership, we've been recognized by various [NSEs] as ESG leaders as shown on Slide 8 including the NAREIT Leader in the Light Award as the top rank multifamily REIT for ESG leadership. And most importantly, we continue to invest in our people and our culture. AvalonBay is an amazing place because of its people and we're extremely focused on fostering an inclusive and diverse culture that attracts, retains, and provides growth opportunities to our people. We're excited for the year ahead, are fortunate to have a deeply dedicated team of associates and we enter the year with our foot forward and in growth mode. With that, I'll turn it to Sean to talk further about our operating results and tailwinds heading into 2022. Thanks, Matt. As you heard on the call today, we're entering the New Year from a position of strength on multiple fronts and to close I want to emphasize five key themes that will guide us in 2022 as we seek to generate outsized value in earnings growth and as we continue to differentiate ourselves as one of the leading real-estate companies in the country. First, our decade long track record as a leading developer with deep market knowledge and experience across the breadth of communities and apartment styles allows us to create value by tailoring each development to best fit the needs of local area as well as continuing to meet the evolving needs of residents. It also drives meaningful incremental earnings NOI growth across cycles. Second, as we grow, we are optimizing the earnings growth and value creation potential of the existing portfolio by pruning slower growth assets and diversifying into new markets, providing an expanded domain to create value through our development, operating and strategic capabilities. Third, our operating model is set to deliver meaningful earnings growth by utilizing technology and investing in innovation, to improve operating margins and to unlock additional revenue opportunities. Fourth, we will continue to lead on ESG, an area increasingly important to municipalities as we seek development approvals to residents as they make housing decisions and to our associates as we meet our mission of creating a better way to live. And lastly, at the center of all that we do, we will continue to foster our evergreen culture and invest in our people. We look forward to our engagement with shareholders and stakeholders on these themes and others during the year. And I'll turn it to the operator to facilitate questions. Yes, thanks, Nick. I would continue to look at our growth in Southeast Florida and Denver as a good proxy. We've been active in those markets over the last three to four years. We have a target reach of those markets of about 5%. And we're about halfway through. Increasingly, we've got our people on the ground there. Our development activity continues to source additional opportunities and the hope is that we can accelerate from there in those two markets. So when you look to our next set of expansion markets, I would expect them to move on a similar type of timeframe over the coming years. Yes. So just to clarify a couple of things, the 23% represent the move-in values at the end of the year as compared to the beginning of the year; not all of the leases in the portfolio being up 23%, if that makes sense. On the loss to lease side, like I said, it's 12% today is a, I think I mentioned on the last call, about a third of the portfolio, at this point in time is constrained by various things, the regulations in New York City, there's a couple of COVID overlay issues out there, etc. So it's really achievable today, if you just mark everything in the market is call it 8%. So how will that manifest its way through the portfolio will be as leases expire throughout 2022 and we're able to move people to market. So that's how things will slowly lead in. So if you're trying to understand sort of the pace of revenue growth, given that phenomenon, then we do expect revenue growth will accelerate as we move through the year because all those leases are being marked to market as they expire. Yes, I mean, there's a number of different factors that play into that. So we could spend some time on obviously, Kevin talked about what we're seeing in terms of or what we expect in the way of bad debt trends being modestly positive, but then we have a drag from rent relief that he also pointed out, those two variables could swing one way or another. And we're expecting an improvement in underlying bad debt in the second half of the year. They could accelerate, which gives us a little extra juice. Rent relief could also accelerate, but could also go the other way. It's a pretty unpredictable factor. And then obviously, you have the normal things that we talked about in terms of turnover, where it occurs, is it in markets that are currently regulated that we can get people to market? How fast is market rent growth has moved through the years? So there's all those normal factors that we would expect in addition to the unusual factors in the current environment. Certainly there is possibility. Yes. There's a possibility, one thing you have to realize is that the leases that were signed in the first half of 2021, still had fairly decent concessions. Rents are much lower than where they are. So you're going to see pretty good, effective rent growth in that market in the first half of the year. The second half will be dictated by some of the factors that I mentioned as it relates to demand. Not necessarily for some of the factors that mentioned earlier, John. I mean, you've got those are strictly moving rents which given turnover rates, just call it roughly 50%. There is also renewables. And there are as I mentioned earlier, when I was talking about loss to lease there are constraints on renewals, and a number of our markets. Some are normal, like the rent regs in New York. Some are sort of this COVID overlay but it impacts about a third of the portfolios. You can't effectively assume that you're going to mark everyone to current move in rent values over the next 12 months as leases expire. Yes. I mean, you've got, there's a number of different factors that feed into it. I mean, you've got a lag. So again, moving rents for as a moment in time, we're talking about December versus January being up 23%. That was for that batch of movements during that period of time. And so you got sort of the two endpoints. So there's a lag in terms of what asking rents are and then people move in is typically lag there. You've got a lag because of renewals, but in theory to your original question, if there were no constraints and no lags, and you could mark 100% of the rent roll to market on February 1, yes, you would see a significant move in the average rent, lease rent for the portfolio. Maybe the final point there Chandni as you think sort of about the our ability to fund this development activity, it sort of is somewhat tied to what's going on in the core business where we are in the cycle, what kind of EBITDA growth we have and what our capital options look like. At the moment what we've been doing is funding our external needs through a combination of newly issued debt and disposition, activity for this year, with respect to our capital needs of about $900 million. Current plan which of course can change is that we're likely to fund that primarily through the issuance of new debt and then modestly through some net disposition activity, of course capital market conditions and our users can change. But it kind of speaks to the notion of a couple of things. Obviously, with our EBITDA rising very briskly here this year, we can utilize debt to help fund development and it's an attractive sources it is, both in its loan right and on a real basis when you think about inflation. And we can do that by issuing debt, because our EBITDA is rising quite a bit. And we can be leveraged neutral in doing so. But in a typical year, in most years, we can fund about $1 billion to $1.3 billion or so of development activity through a combination of and free cash flow, selling assets, where we can retain the capital because of our gains capacity, and then leverage neutral issuance of debt. So that's kind of in a normal environment, plus or minus what we can do. We can probably do a little bit more early in the cycle as same-store NOI gross briskly as it is now. And potentially, at some point right now our equity or equity is attractive as a source for funding development, although at the moment, we find asset sales to be more attractive. But if we're going to be doing an awful lot more than those, that kind of level of development funding, it does imply that we're going to have some level of equity market access. So that's another constraint to layer in as think about what's possible. So the three constraints we traditionally think about is, we're constrained by opportunity set. We're constrained by sort of organizational capacity, and then we're constrained by sort of what we have on the capital side. So I was speaking sort of that third bucket right there. John, and just a little bit more color on kind of overall transaction activity acquisition and dispositions. We are expecting both of those to be up relative up some relative to 2021. And Kevin, use the term sort of trading capital. And that tends to continue to be our approach, which is the trading capital out of predominantly northeast and assets that have had pretty good runs up in value tend to be older assets, lower IRR, profiles, and then redeploy that capital into our expansion markets to capture that growth and as part of our overall portfolio allocation objectives. Hey Rich, it's a target right and so we put that out there to help drive internal activity and drive our resource allocation, particularly on the people side. The other part I emphasize is, this is -- we're going to move into these markets and diversify our markets over time and that is very much a part of kind of our measured approach here. Acquiring our development activity, these new markets inherently paces in our investment over a period of time. So we think if we look at overall portfolio optimization, for some of the reasons that we talked about diversification, diversification away from regulation. We think it makes sense to continue to move in this fashion. But that said, our established markets that's the bulk of our activity, where we're strong believers in those, in the trajectory of those markets going forward, and they're going to continue to get the bulk of our investment, both on the development side and on the people side. It is. Yes. It is the direction we're moving. We definitely continue to pivot into growth mode. The build of our development pipeline, a lot of that is options on land. So we add a little bit to your first question, we will continue to be able to be flexible and adapt just based on market conditions at that point in time. But we are leaning in and do want to secure additional land rights, given the economics that we're seeing today. And we start forecast going out over the next year or so. Yes and it really speaks to benefits from the long term investment that we're making in these development platforms. The long track record that our lead developers have when the opportunities do surface for incremental rental housing in these markets we tend to be one of those first calls given the relationships, given execution, given what we deliver in these markets. And so that's why you're continuing to see significant investment and development in these expansion markets at the types of spreads that we've referred to. Yes Haendel as it relates to bad debt, we are expecting an improvement. But if I refer to as sort of the underlying bad debt rate excluding any benefit from rent relief, and so it's roughly about a 40 basis point improvement is what we're expecting for 2022 relative to 2021. But it is timing. The timing is not even at all through the year. We basically expect the first half of the year to look a lot like the back end of 2021. And then deceleration in bad debt as you move through the third and fourth quarter of this year, so that's how I would think about it. As it relates to composition across the markets in California, in particular, the heavy place for bad debt really is LA. There's bad debt in Northern California. It's not nearly as bad as LA. So we can certainly get the numbers specifically for Northern California. But it won't be as much of an outlier as it is in Los Angeles. Yes. Thanks, Michael. Yes, it's a possibility. But I wouldn't describe it as a priority right now. I think there we do look at some of the portfolios that are out there. They tend to be more geographically dispersed and given our focus on our core set of expansion markets and really, in its approach based on for us to create value, we want to be able to leverage our full operating teams and our development teams to create that value. We stay pretty narrow from a geographic perspective. So there could be a portfolio that fits enough of the kind of strike zone for us that we would look at. And so that that will stay on our radar, but I expect more of our activity to be similar to what you've seen in 2021 with some expanded growth going into this year and following years. Yes, there is a matching component of it, I would say given the run ups that we've seen in our existing markets and also seeing the run ups in some of the markets that were growing and we're comfortable at this point in sort of the trade capital arena what sort of matching a level of disposition activity and redeploying that capital and expansion markets for incremental growth, then as you're referring to it would mean tapping into additional disposition activity or potentially tapping into incremental equity. And right now, we sort of look out on it, like we're going to continue to and progress in a fairly measured way. And then the last piece that sort of emphasize, I mean, from an overall total investment perspective, we're continuing to invest significantly $2 billion plus this year, but a good portion of that's going into our established markets around these development opportunities. And so as we look at from a risk return perspective leveraging our existing teams and being able to unlock the next rounds of that 200 to 250 basis point spread that remains very high on our list in terms of attractiveness. Yes, good question. It continues to be, I think, the conversion of retail land -- as well as suburban office land continues to be an attractive source of land inventory for us. And as we're building, building up our pipeline that's a decent amount of it. I'd say today, actually, probably a little bit more of it is to defunct suburban office product that we can control, a little simpler on the execution, smaller sites and so we're finding some good opportunities there, particularly in our established markets, a little bit more broadly. In Avalon Bay of the peers has been the most successful and partnering with others and when it works, it really works well. We open a project recently in Woburn Mass, which is an even sort of the broadest of mixed use environments. But part of the attractiveness there is the ability for our residents to walk out their door and have access to the grocery store and restaurants. And so when we can find those opportunities with the right partners, it is something that we'll continue to lean into. Sounds good. Thank you, and thank you to everyone for joining today. We look forward to engaging further with you over the coming months."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Kathy, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I will turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Tim?\nTim Naughton: Yes. Thanks, Jason, and welcome. Ben Schall, Kevin O'Shea, Matt Birenbaum and Sean Breslin. For our prepared comments today, Ben will provide a summary of third quarter results, an update on Q4 and full year guidance and provide some thoughts on why we believe AVB is well positioned to outperform. Sean will then elaborate on operating trends in the portfolio, where we continue to see strong momentum and healthy fundamentals that should support robust growth as we move into 2022. And then we'll conclude with an overview of development activity where development economics remain compelling and then offer a brief look at our new expansion markets, including our rationale behind our decision to enter them earlier this year. And then we'll all be available for Q&A after prepared remarks. But before turning the call over to Ben, I did want to take a minute to acknowledge that I expect that this will be my last earnings call as I plan to step down at year-end as CEO, when I'll assume the role of Executive Chairman as we had previously announced last December. I spent the last 32 years at AvalonBay and its predecessors. And over the last 20-plus years or so, I've had the opportunity to interact with many of you on this call on a regular basis. I just want to say that I appreciate your support for and engagement with the company and me over that time. And for the investors on the call, I simply want to thank you for entrusting us as a steward of your capital over the years. It's something we've never taken for granted. And I know that will continue to be the case in the future on the leadership of Ben and this executive team. I look forward to being able to touch base with many of you more directly and hopefully in a little more personal way over the next couple of months. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over and place in the very capable hands of Ben Schall and the rest of the executive team here today. Ben?\nBen Schall : Thank you, Tim. We wanted to start the call today as a team and an organization by expressing our gratitude and acknowledging Tim for his contributions to the company and the industry over the last 32 years. AvalonBay would not be the company it is today without Tim's strategic leadership, which is deeply intertwined with the company's history and evolution into one of the preeminent real estate companies in the U.S., its exceptional track record of value creation and its inclusive culture focused on continuous improvement. In addition to overseeing AvalonBay's tremendous growth and positioning us as an industry leader, Tim has also had a major influence on the evolution of the multifamily industry and the broader REIT sector during his career. And throughout all of these accomplishments and successes in what is one of Tim's most admirable attributes as a leader and a person, Tim never made it about him. His focus has always been on others, the positive impact he could have on people, the impact that AvalonBay could have in our communities and how he could lead by fostering and reinforcing our evergreen culture and strong organizational values. On behalf of all of those that have been part of AvalonBay and all of us at the company today, thank you, Tim.\nTim Naughton: Thank you, Ben.\nBen Schall : As the next section and before turning to the presentation, we wanted to emphasize upfront a number of factors that we believe position AvalonBay for outsized performance over the coming quarters and as we look towards 2022. Our operating fundamentals continue to show very strong momentum with rents now above pre-COVID levels in 5 of our 6 large coastal regions with the strongest performance in our suburban communities, which comprise over two-thirds of the portfolio. Our resident base with concentrations employed in knowledge-based industries are in high demand in today's labor market, setting the table for future rent growth as wages continue to rise. And for the segment of our resident base who would typically be seeking to purchase a home after a period of time with us, this alternative is challenging given the general lack of availability, further supporting our retention rates and demand fundamentals. We also expect our portfolio and market allocation to generate strong growth over the coming quarters. Looking back over the last 18 months, while we've experienced an unprecedented trough and then an equally unprecedented recovery, our rents today are only 7% above October 2019 levels, equating roughly to 3.5% growth per year. With an economy and growth mode, limited availability, low turnover, significant loss to lease and with one-third of our portfolio in urban areas that are recovering, but still held back by the pandemic, we expect strong operating tailwinds as we head into 2022. Our execution on our operating model initiatives also continue to pay dividends with our investments in technology and innovation, offering enhanced value to prospects and residents while also allowing us to improve operating efficiencies. Through these initiatives, we expect to improve margin by roughly 200 basis points, with $10 million of this improvement already captured and with an additional $25 million to $35 million to be captured over the next couple of years. Finally, we're also creating outsized value creation and earnings growth from our development platform with returns trending above pro forma, leading us to ramp development activity with very attractive spreads between our development yields and market cap rates. We are definitely in growth mode, which is further supported by our access to a historically low cost of capital given the strength of the capital and transaction markets, all of which sets up for a strong end of this year and meaningful growth in 2022. Turning to the presentation and starting on Slide 4. The rapid pace of recovery continued in the third quarter with core FFO coming in at $0.10 above the midpoint of our prior Q3 guidance and flat on a year-over-year basis. The outperformance relative to guidance was driven primarily by same-store revenue, which produced a 4% sequential increase in revenue on a cash basis. Our growth orientation is reflected in our ramp in development starts with just under $1 billion of starts through the end of Q3. We've also completed $1.1 billion of projects so far this year at an attractive yield of 5.9%. In addition to development, we are growing through acquisitions, and Q3 marked our first acquisitions in our new expansion markets of Texas and North Carolina totaling $275 million. And subsequent to quarter end, we closed on an additional acquisition in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for $150 million. Funding our growth with low-cost capital, primarily from asset sales and incremental debt proceeds, including a recent $700 million 10-year unsecured bond at a fixed rate of 2.05%, the lowest coupon and lowest spread in AvalonBay history and also our first green bond. Turning to Slide 5 and given these strong operating trends, we have raised our guidance for Q4 and for the full year 2021. Q4 FFO guidance has been raised to a range of $2.19 to $2.29 per share, an $0.11 increase over our previous Q4 guidance at the midpoint. This improved outlook is driven by our improved revenue expectations with residential revenue now projected to increase in Q4 by 5% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to occupancy and rate trends, the same-store revenue outlook assumes approximately $12 million of additional rent relief payments in Q4, relatively consistent with what we received during Q3. Other activity incorporated into our updated Q4 guidance includes $250 million to $300 million of dispositions from our Northeastern markets at an expected cap rate of sub 3.5% and $300 million to $350 million of acquisitions in our expansion markets, one of which is the Fort Lauderdale community and with the others under agreement. Slide 6 shows the components of rental revenue change on a year-over-year basis, residential revenue growth being driven primarily by higher occupancy and rent relief recognized during Q3 leading to a 1% increase on a GAAP basis and a 4.3% increase on a cash basis. On a sequential basis, as shown on Slide 7, the rental revenue increase was driven by our momentum on lease rates as well as the recognition of rent relief payments, leading to a residential rental revenue increase of 3.3% on a GAAP basis and 4% on a cash basis. With that positive backdrop, I'll turn it to Sean to discuss our operating performance more fully.\nSean Breslin: All right. Thanks, Ben. I thought I'd share a few slides on the portfolio rent for the quarter and into October, both at the same-store level and across different markets and submarkets. Overall, we have continued to experience a significant rebound in the business. If you look at Slide 8, like-term effective rent change turned positive in June, has accelerated materially over the last few months. It is now running at roughly 11%. If you turn to Slide 9, you can see what's supporting the improvement in our rent change, which is the growth we've experienced in average move-in rent value. Our average move-in value has grown by roughly 24% since the beginning of the year, including a 9% increase since the end of Q2 and is now about 7% above the level we achieved in the fall of 2019. Moving to Slide 10. Improved performance has been broad-based with every region experienced an increase in average move-in rent over the past quarter. As noted in the chart, the recent flattening of move-in values reflect a normal seasonal pattern although the seasonal adjustment has only been about one-third of the amount we typically see moving from the summer into the fall. Rents are now equal to or greater than 2019 levels in every region except Northern California, which has seen roughly 20% growth in move-in rents this year but still remains roughly 7% below the level we achieved in 2019. The time line for a full recovery in Northern California has been delayed in large part by major tech employers extending their return to office state into early 2022. At the other end of the spectrum, the Southern California region has experienced strong growth in movement values, supported by very healthy job growth, including significant growth in the content-producing segment of the media industry. Limited supply and a very tighter sale market. Turning to Slide 11 to address suburban and urban performance trends. The average October move-in rent for our suburban portfolio was roughly 12% above the rent we achieved in October 2019. In our urban portfolio, while demand has returned in a meaningful way and rents have recovered significantly. Move-in rents are still slightly below what we achieved in October 2019. To provide a few examples, in Boston and New York City, urban move-in rents are now 1% above what we achieved in 2019. But the District of Columbia and San Francisco are lagging with move-in rents that are 3% and 13%, respectively, below what we achieved in 2019. Given the continuing adoption of vaccine requirements and steady climate vaccination rates, we expect urban office occupancy rates will continue to rise as we move into 2022 which is one of the opportunities we expect to benefit from next year. In fact, moving to Slide 12. The macro environment should support healthy fundamentals in our markets over the next several quarters. Starting at the top left of Slide 12. While the labor market continues to improve, we're still almost 5 million jobs short of where we started. The demand for labor continues to be robust, which is putting material upward pressure on wages a key driver of rent growth. Chart 1 shows job, wage and total personal income growth for the professional services sector of the economy, which is where most of our residents are employed. As noted in the chart, we've only experienced positive year-over-year growth across all 3 categories since Q2 of this year. And as many businesses are finding as they attempt to recruit and retain professional services employees, the market has only strengthened since Q2. In Chart 2, office usage hit a trough in Q2 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. Since that time, while we've seen steady improvement, the gains have been modest. As we look forward into 2022, gains in office usage should support additional rent growth, particularly in our urban and job center suburban submarkets. And touching on Chart 3 and 4 regarding the housing market, price appreciation in the for-sale single-family market and relatively stable multifamily supply, both support a healthy near-term outlook for rental rate growth. With that favorable macro outlook as context, turning to Slide 13, we also see terrific tailwinds in our portfolio as we move into next year. Beginning in the upper left of the slide, the chart number one , we're starting from a position of strength with turnover trending lower and strong, stable occupancy, which brings with it unusually strong pricing power. Turnover has declined this year. It was down about 1,000 basis points or 15% in Q3 relative to what we would experience a normal year like 2019 and occupancy has been running above 96% for several months now, a point at which we can continue to push rents. In Chart 2, given the very healthy rent change we've experienced a month, we'll be starting 2022 with built-in revenue growth of roughly 3%. The starting point that we didn't benefit from in any year during the last cycle. The strongest starting point in the last cycle was roughly 2.25% at the beginning of 2012. In addition to the baked-in revenue growth in Chart 2, our loss to lease is currently running at roughly 14% and is depicted in Chart number 3. Providing plenty of opportunity to benefit from moving existing leases to market when they expire. Moving to the bottom of Slide 13. There are 3 other somewhat unusual tailwinds that should also benefit revenue growth as we move into 2022. In Chart 4, the amortization of concessions associated with previously signed leases which should burn off as we move through the next several quarters. In Chart 5, a reduction in bad debt, which we won't revert quickly to the pre-pandemic average but should begin to abate as the eviction moratoria expire and our legal remedies become more widely available to us. And then finally, on Chart 6, continuing receipts from the emergency rental assistance program for our same-store portfolio, we receive -- we have received $14 million from the program with $11 million of it coming in the last quarter. Since less than one quarter of the roughly $47 billion authorized by the federal government have been distributed as of September 30, we expect to receive additional funds in Q4 this year and in 2022. So with that summary, I'll turn it back to Ben to address development and our new expansion markets. Ben?\nBen Schall: Thanks, Sean. As shown on Slide 14, these strong operating trends are also translating into outperformance for our 6 development projects currently in lease-up with lease rates up $180 per unit and with projected yields up 30 basis points to 6%, driving further value and earnings. Turning to Slide 15. Our total current development portfolio is poised to deliver meaningful incremental NOI and NAV growth over the coming quarters. Specifically, these projects are projected to generate $145 million of NOI upon stabilization, of which only $26 million is in place today on an annualized basis. These communities are slated to generate $1.2 billion of net value above our costs or close to $9 per share of NAV and meaningful earnings growth. As further highlighted on Slide 16, our industry-leading development platform has created significant value throughout various cycles with consistently strong spreads between development yields and market cap rates, which today sits at a spread of roughly 210 basis points. As we look forward over the coming years, our existing development rights pipeline totals $3 billion of potential projects. Lining us up well for a strong pace of continued profitable development. Turning to Slide 17. Our 4 new expansion markets in addition to our continued growth in Southeast Florida and Denver provide us with meaningful additional growth opportunities as well as the ability to optimize our overall portfolio over time. This slide provides the high-level framework we utilize to evaluate markets and that drive portfolio allocation decisions across our existing markets and our expansion markets. At the top of the list, our focus remains on being a best-in-class developer and operator in markets that over-indexed to knowledge-based employment, which we expect to experience outsized job and wage growth. We also continue to believe that markets with a high cost of home ownership, create an attractive rent versus own backdrop for our product offering. While our expansion markets generally have lower home prices than our existing markets, the rise in home prices, particularly in certain submarkets in these areas create similar positive dynamics for future rental growth. We remain closely attuned to the regulatory environment in each of our markets with local land use restrictions, creating certain favorable barriers to new supply in our existing markets, providing opportunities for our development teams to leverage our long-standing relationships to unlock development opportunities. These coastal markets have, however, seen an increase in landlord tenant regulations, and our expansion into new markets is partially driven by our desire to diversify our regulatory exposure. And the fourth factor highlighted here, public infrastructure and cultural amenities is our proxy for the overall quality of life that large knowledge-based employers and our type of customers will continue to seek out. This thematic framework is, in turn, supported by our proprietary market research, which shapes our market and submarket capital allocation decisions as we drive long-term value. Slide 18 highlights the characteristics supporting growth in our recently announced expansion markets and what we believe positions these markets well in the long term. As we enter these markets, our focus is on creating long-term value by exporting our development and operational acumen as well as our culture to an expanded set of opportunities. And to wrap up, we believe that we are well positioned to outperform as we head into 2022, a favorable macro backdrop, including continued job and wage growth, declining affordability of for-sale housing, a full of return to offices, particularly benefiting the one-third of our portfolio in urban environments and a relatively stable supply forecast in overall AVB markets should provide a strong tailwind. Our embedded growth in of lease along with the benefit of concessions and bad debt normalizing over time should be key drivers of revenue next year. Our operating initiatives are on track to deliver significant margin expansion and serve as one of our drivers of earnings growth over the coming 2 to 3 years. Our development platform is also poised to deliver meaningful value and earnings growth with a development rights pipeline of $3 billion and with development yields substantially above stabilized cap rates and our cost of capital. Finally, our expansion markets provide a broader set of opportunities to leverage our platform for growth. We're excited for the growth opportunities ahead of us. And with that, I'll turn it to the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRich Hill: First of all, congrats on a really good quarter. It looks like you're showing some real inflection here. I wanted to maybe take a step back and think about '22 and '23 in the context of that loss to lease. Maybe you can help us frame can you get all of that loss to lease back in '22? Or is it some of it going to move back into '23? We've heard some different commentary from some of your peers. So I'm wondering how you guys think about it.\nSean Breslin: Rich, it's Sean. And good question, of course. Yes, what I would say on the loss to lease is in a normal year, so to speak, as part of what you can say is that there's probably anywhere between 15% to 20% of our portfolio that's somewhat constrained in capturing that loss to lease or the delta between the existing rents and the market rent based on the regulatory environment that's in place. And the typical examples are the rent rates in New York, in D.C., we have an asset in San Francisco, 1 in L.A., et cetera, et cetera. In the current environment, given the, call it, the COVID overlay, that total percentage of the portfolio that is somewhat encumbered at least for the short run, is probably closer to about one-third of the portfolio where there are some rent caps in place in various other jurisdictions that limit the ability to capture that. The question is when some of those additional or incremental restriction -- restrictions expire, which is TBD at this point in time. The 1 that's probably the most significant is the state of emergency cap in California, which is constraining probably, for the most part, renewals in places like San Diego and Orange County, which have experienced pretty robust growth. So the way I would think about it is you have the incremental piece that I talked about, so call it totally one-third that is probably constrained, at least in the near term, how that sort of burns off from one-third back to 15%, 20% during 2022 as a TBD. And then also just factoring in the distribution of lease expectations is the other fact that you have to consider as you kind of run through your model.\nRich Hill: I think I understand that math. And maybe this is a question for Ben. I wanted to maybe understand a little bit better how you're considering development in the past development early in the cycle has been a big driver of your growth. How are you thinking about that this time? Is it any different than past cycles?\nBen Schall : Our approach is similar, Rich. And you've seen that with our ramp of activity over the last 6 months, we definitely see it as a differentiator for us, definitely see it as a driver of alpha. Matt can maybe talk some more about our pipeline of activity but our track record and our development franchises in our existing markets, we have full confidence we'll be able to continue to unlock value. And now we have the expanded set of opportunities in the growth markets widen our total opportunity set. Matt, do you want to talk some more on the development pipeline?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Sure. Yes. Just to give a little more color on the development pipeline. So we're -- we've started close to $1 billion so far this year. We are on track to start probably another $350 million here in the fourth quarter. And when you kind of look at the breakdown of the most recent starts this year, it's a nice mix geographically, about three quarters suburban, one quarter urban and maybe 25% of our starts this year and actually in our expansion markets in Florida and Denver and then maybe a little less than one-third in the Northeast and the rest, almost half on the West Coast. As we look out to next year, we'd like to be able to start somewhere in the same range in that $1 billion to $1.5 billion range, depending on how things shape up. But as Ben mentioned in his remarks, we have a $3 billion development rights pipeline. And there's a lot working its way through the system now. We really started putting our foot back on the gas for new business development a quarter or 2 ago. And we've got probably over $1 billion worth of new development rights in addition to that $3 billion that's working its way through the system now. So we will start some in this fourth quarter, but I'm hoping that at the end of the year, the development rights pipeline will actually grow to somewhere at or north of $3.5 billion. So we have a lot of opportunity in front of us.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: First of all, congratulations, Tim. Maybe just following up on development. Curious what sort of inflationary pressures you're seeing. I guess, obviously, it's coming through on the rent side, but also I would imagine on the construction side for the new starts, how you think about looking at those yields versus cost?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Sure. Nick, it's Matt. There's definitely inflation and like you said, it helps on the rent side and it hurts on the cost side. What we've seen is the deals that we are starting this year the total development cost is probably 10% to maybe even as much in some cases, is 15% higher than where it would have been a couple of years ago. If NOIs are trending up, you do get some leverage on that. And then the third part of the equation is asset values, which, of course, have been trending up more than the 10% or 15% costs have been going up. So when you combine the higher NOI with the lower cap rates, the value creation and the spread is probably wider than it was before. The yields probably pre-COVID, our development rights pipeline yields were maybe in the low 6s. Now they're in the high 5s. If you look at the stuff we're starting this year, it's pro forma to around 7 5 8 and that's where kind of the new business we're signing up or the stuff we might start next year based on today's economics looks to be as well.\nNick Joseph: And then -- you mentioned the regulatory side of the equation when you're looking at different markets. How do you think about regulatory risk in some of these expansion markets? Obviously, it's more favorable right now than some of the coastal markets, but how do you try to handicap any changes going forward in the future there?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Nick, it's Sean. Good question. And I think when you talk about the regulatory environment, there are pros and cons to it. So if you maybe start with sort of our coastal market footprint that we've had for a long period of time. Part of the reason we have been so successful in creating value through the development pipeline is there is a very difficult regulatory environment to work your way through to actually get development entitled and delivered into those submarkets. So it's been to our benefit historically. Obviously, the more active is the jurisdictions become as it relates to landlord tenants and rent-oriented things become slightly more risky for us, of course. In terms of the expansion markets, there are not as many constraints on development, although there are places within those regions that are a little more sensitive to development and have somewhat more constraints, but in general, slightly -- were favorable in terms of development, of course. And in terms of evaluating the risk on sort of the landlord tenant side and the rent side, it is a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction assessment. For example, if you think of our legacy markets, we feel pretty good about Washington state overall, not so good about the city of Seattle. So when you go through some of these markets, for example, in Texas, you look at overall, feel pretty good generally speaking about that environment. Austin, there are some more regulatory constraints in the suburban environments as it relates to land use and the watershed and things like that. So overall, we think the regulatory environment certainly is to our benefit in those markets, but there are places where you have to still work with -- and overall, the landlord tenant, the rent control side, we think the risk is definitely lower than our legacy markets, but it's not without any risk the way I describe it.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore.\nRich Hightower: And likewise, all the best of Tim in the next phase of his tenure with AvalonBay and beyond. So I just want to follow up on Nick's question there. I guess, look, if you bake it all together in terms of your outlook for job growth, supply growth, regulatory impact 1 way or the other. I mean, if you had to sort of gauge which group of markets is going to have superior rent growth over the next 3 to 5 years, again, taking all those factors kind of in hand. Where do you sort of peg your core coastal markets versus those expansion markets in that regard?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Rich, good question. I'm not sure we're prepared to I'll call it a lead horse just yet. The way I think about it is kind of the way you described in terms of looking at job growth, supply growth, all the macro factors that we all consider. And I think what we -- the reason we're going into these markets is while we certainly see more supply growth in these markets, say, in the 3% range, if you talk about Denver Southeast Florida, they also produce a lot more jobs and have benefited from much more significant in migration as opposed to the coastal markets, which have typically benefited historically from immigration. So I think when we look through it, I mean, at the end of the day, when we look at our portfolio, we still expect a very significant portion of our portfolio to be in our sort of legacy coastal markets. But for all the reasons that Ben talked about in his prepared remarks related to where we see kind of knowledge-based workers growing. It's growing in our legacy markets. It's also growing in some of these mid-cap knowledge markets, there's more supply, for sure, but you definitely see the demand that more that consumes that. So I think the question is really the supply get maybe too much in front of that in some of these Sunbelt markets where we've seen significant growth the last 18 months? Or does that come back in the check. I think that will dictate kind of how the rent growth equation comes out across the expansion markets versus our coastal markets. But we believe in both, and they may not grow at the same pace at the same time. But over the long run, we feel good about the rent growth that we'll see across the entire footprint.\nRich Hightower: And then maybe just a different twist on the development question, but this isn't so much a question on inflation as it is, the impact of labor and supply chain constraints on the timing of new deliveries, whether we're talking AvalonBay's projects or even competitive supply? What trends are you seeing in those factors?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes Rich, it's Matt. It is -- I mean we have not yet seen a lack of availability, supply chain interfere with our ability to deliver apartments. We've had spot issues here and there where right now, we're struggling to get appliances in 1 asset, and so it might delay deliveries by a month or so. But we haven't seen it in a more widespread way, but there is that potential. I mean there are certain commodities, drywalls on an allocation right now in some markets. So I think it has impacted the for sale inventory and ability to deliver some. I think for us, it's a place where we benefit a little bit by being our own general contractor and having repeat relationships with our subcontractors. So honestly, the bigger constraint right now on getting units turned and delivered has been the local jurisdictions and their staff. A lot of these jurisdictions are still remote and they're down inspectors and you can't get people at City Hall to print out the documents you need. So I wouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff that's in the pipeline takes a little longer to deliver if a deal that you thought you might done in 8 quarters might take 9 quarters instead. So there could be a little bit of delay over time on that, and it might extend the supply some just more broadly.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Bradley Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBradley Heffern: Looking at Slide 9, it doesn't seem like you've seen some of the seasonal falloff that other coastal names have. So the same chart for other people kind of peaks in August and goes down in September and October. I'm curious if there's an underlying reason you can point to as to why that would be the case.\nBen Schall : Yes, Brad, good question. I mean, it is correct that we have seen a more modest seasonal adjustment, and we typically would experience historically. If you go back 2 or 3 years kind of pre-pandemic and kind of look at where September rents are relative to the peak rent during the summer in the various regions, which each one peaks at a slightly different time, but just call it the middle of the summer and kind of where it comes down to September relative to this year. Historically, we see about a 2.5% decline from peak to September averages. This year, it's only about 90 basis points in terms of what we've seen in terms of that softness in asking rents, which ultimately impacts move-in rents. So it's about one-thirds of what's normal. And it's pretty widespread across our markets as it relates to the seasonality being less than historical averages. It's hard to speak to the portfolio of our peers, specifically what may be impacting them. But certainly, as we look at our portfolio, we feel good about the fact that the rate of decline has been far less than historical norms. So we'll see how it plays out as we get through the end of the year. It could be just timing differences among the different companies. And it's really a submarket-by-submarket issue that you have to look at. So it's hard to decide for the others in terms of what their real conclusion is.\nBradley Heffern: And then on the OpEx guide, I was noticing that the third quarter was in line with the guide then. And then the fourth quarter OpEx guide is really quite low, but the overall guidance went up. I was curious if you could reconcile that was the original fourth quarter expectation that OpEx would be down and then there's just been pressures on top of that? Or any help there.\nBen Schall : Yes. I mean there's a number of different factors kind of driving the timing from quarter-to-quarter, which is a pretty kind of detailed road map. Why don't I ask Jason to follow up with you on that 1 offline as opposed to getting into the. I mean a lot of it is timing of different projects and when they hit what we expect turnover to be and various things like that to sort of come through leasing activity, the impact on bonus. There's a lot of different things that sort of drive that number in terms of the quarter-to-quarter cadence.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Brad, this is Kevin. Just to sort of reiterate, we do expect same-store OpEx to decline materially sequentially into the fourth quarter.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: And Tim, let me extend my congratulations to you on a glorious career and good luck on the next chapter. So this is for the team. As we kind of think about potential interest rate hike or a series of them going into 2022, how do you all think about the spread that you laid out in slides between projected stabilized yields and total cost of capital? I think you guys noted that it's about 210 bps, and it's fairly wide. How should we think about that spread in the event of a higher cost of capital?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Matt, I can start and others can chime in. I'd say, first and foremost, we try and lock in that spread by. So we're generally raising and sourcing the capital when we start jobs. So that if there is a big change to the cost of capital, you think about the development yields we're putting up relative to the capital that we funded those with. And so that's why you see -- we're generally anywhere between 70% and 80% match funded. When you look at kind of the remaining spend in our development book against our cash on hand and kind of the short-term free cash flow. So I think it probably starts there. And then beyond that, I guess you'd have to ask yourself why are rates rising? And if because it's an inflationary environment and NOIs are also rising, then hopefully, you can preserve most of that spread anyway. If rates are rising because it's an increase in real rates as opposed to nominal rates, then that does put downward pressure on the margin.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Chandni, this is Kevin. Just to maybe add to Matt's point, I mean the largest -- most relevant point with respect to the activities we're doing is what Matt outlined, which is we are substantially match-funded against our investment commitments when we start those developments. So at the moment, if you look at our current book on the way of development, we are nearly 80% match funded. But also importantly, you have to look at this on a holistic balance sheet perspective, when we are considering incremental investment opportunities in that regard, we are in terrific financial shape and have tremendous financial flex. We're soon to be substantially match funded on investment commitments that we've made from a liquidity point of view, as you can tell from our lease, we have $300 million of cash on hand and nothing drawn a $1.75 billion line of credit. And then from a leverage point of view, we're at 5 time against a targeted range for net debt-to-EBITDA of 5x to 6x and our EBITDA is rising. And so we have increasing leverage capacity as well. So when you kind of put that all together, to the extent we get into a where there's a little bit of volatility in the capital markets, we do have a lot of financial flexibility to choose our time in which we enter a market and try to choose when we source capital to those moments where it's most attractive. So Altogether, we're in terrific financial shape with respect to our existing commitments, and we have a lot of flexibility to think about how we might finance our future investment opportunities in a volatile and potentially rising rate environment.\nUnidentified Company Representative: The last piece I would add is just that the macro level, obviously, interest rates can have an impact on asset values but also be very mindful of fund flows, right, which you think about the correlation of asset values over time tend to be more correlated to asset values. And so as we look out, what we're seeing today and look out over the coming years, we expect fund flows into the real asset space and particularly in the multifamily space to remain strong.\nChandni Luthra: My second question is slightly more housekeeping in nature. Could you all provide an update on what percent of leases are receiving in concession today? And what that average concession, if at all, is looking like?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Sure. Happy to answer that. As it relates to the third quarter, about 10% of the new move-in leases that we've signed, received a concession and the average concession was about two-thirds of a month's rent for that 10% population of move-in pieces.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Sean, I'm not sure if you can glean this from your leasing data, but just curious about 1 aspect of rent or behavior. So as the impacts of the pandemic fade, are you seeing any structural shift in the propensity to have rates?\nSean Breslin: Good question, John. At the portfolio level, it has not changed materially going through COVID, but has dipped a little bit, which is something you might expect. In terms of sort of recent quarter leasing activity, -- That 1 I have to follow up with you on. I don't have that off the top of my head. But the overall percentage of the population with the third quarter, I think it was down maybe 150 basis points from historical averages. So not a material move. But it doesn't mean that it hasn't changed in certain submarkets. We have heard about that a little bit, particularly in the context of major urban cities that are home to significant university where they've tried to sort of densify the dorm, so to speak. So there's not as many roommates and pushing people out to sort of market rate housing which is helping to support demand in these markets. But the specific nuance the last couple of quarters that I have to back.\nJohn Pawlowski: No, I appreciate the details. And the last question for me is a little bit longer term in nature about what's the right -- or what's the needed capital expenditure load to operated apartment portfolio? So in the near term, you obviously have supply issues. But little bit longer-term regulatory issues, balcony inspections in California, green emissions. You go down the list. But the direct question is, do you think there's a step change coming in the capital expenditures needed to operate an apartment portfolio?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Good question. I can take some of that, and there's some ESG things that Matt can talk about that potentially out there on the horizon in the context of the regulatory environment, there are definitely some issues. I wouldn't call it really broad-based, John, that are sort of getting into how we operate buildings. There have always been issues about checking things in New York City as an example, in terms of a inspections and stuff like that. That's ongoing. The balcony issue in California has come at some expense. But mainly, it's an inspection issue. That was originally pushed by the unions. And so yes, people are spending a little bit of money on inspections, but it's not clear that there's a mandate that you have to do X, Y or Z repairs within a very short time frame. So over a longer period of time, it may move the needle a little bit. But at least based on what's out there today, as it relates to physical inspections and ongoing remediation, I wouldn't expect it to be a big driver probably the bigger issues are more on the construction side as it relates to some of the green things that may come through ESG efforts that are sort of a broader envelope of other things that are coming through in various jurisdictions.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes, John, it's Matt. I'll just add to that. I think that's right. Honestly, if you look back over the last 5 or 10 years, probably the thing that's driving up CapEx more is just that we're putting more into these buildings, the amenities are a lot more elaborate. And when it comes time to redo those, it's a little more expensive. Going forward, it's an interesting question. you could make an argument that as a regulatory load increases, it may be an advantage for institutional owners like ourselves who have better capacity to manage that and deal with it in some of the smaller private owners. So over time, it might contribute to more consolidation in our space, which is incredibly fragmented. But we certainly are trying to manage on an asset-by-asset basis and our CapEx exposure, and it's one of the things that forms our kind of asset trading strategy and the things we've been really pleased by is our ability to sell assets that are 30 years old that have definitely significantly more CapEx liability embedded in them at basically the same cap rates as buying almost brand-new assets. So that definitely informs our strategy on the margin.\nTim Naughton: John, last quarter, we spent time talking to our new concept called on right, which is targeted to a customer segment who don't believe places a lot of value, right, on those additional amenities. But there's definitely aspects there in terms of for both upfront and go-forward operating expenses, right, that provide benefits from the growth opportunity with that brand.\nOperator: We will take our next question from John Kim with BMO.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Larry Valeria Lee calling for John Kim. Just a question on dispositions, like where they were located this quarter? And then just moving forward, where are you looking at kind of term exposure?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Sure. This is Matt. I can speak to that a little bit. So we didn't actually close anything this past quarter. We've closed a number of dispositions in the second quarter. But as Ben mentioned, we have about $300 million that we expect to close here in the fourth quarter. All of that is in the Northeast, which is where we've been heavily over-indexed in terms of our disposition activity. A couple of years ago, we sold a significant chunk in New York City into a joint venture, and then we've been balancing that out the last couple of years with more dispositions in the New York suburbs. And a lot of that is just driven by our overall portfolio allocation, given that we have a pretty deep development pipeline in many of those kind of suburban New York areas as well. So as we look forward, we're going to look to continue to rotate capital out of our coastal regions into these expansion markets, and it will probably continue to be a little bit disproportionately in New York, other parts of the Northeast and maybe over time in the Mid-Atlantic and a little bit in California as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Appreciate the color. And kind of moving to Southern California, it doesn't appear to be softening seasonally kind of like your other markets are. And how sustainable do you think that this is?\nSean Breslin: That's a good question. It hasn't softened as much. We've seen a little bit of softness. It's probably hard to tell on that chart, but it has been less near the market. It's going to be less than historical norms. I mentioned there's a number of reasons that we've got out there. I mean it's been a pretty robust market in terms of job growth the last 6 months. A lot of the travel, entertainment businesses coming back online. The content producers in the media space have been on overdrive producing content. So the market has had a pretty robust recovery. So how long that is sustainable, we'll wait to see how things kind of play out next year as it relates to all the macro variables that we think about. But the outlook for Southern California is pretty healthy given very low expected volume of multifamily supply next year, the lowest of any of our coastal markets, pretty healthy job growth and a very tight for-sale market -- both for rent and for sale. So there are a number of reasons why the general outlook for Southern California is pretty good.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And my last question was around the Kanso product. Do you see more opportunities to develop this? And if so, like do you think it's going to be harder to push a brand there versus your typical product with more amenities?\nMatthew Birenbaum: This is Matt. We are certainly out there looking for opportunities to grow the Kanso brand. Again, our market research would indicate that there is a large untapped segment of customers that are looking for what Kanso offers. So I do think there's a great opportunity out there and that it's going to take us a little time to get at it, but we're very focused on it. In terms of future rent growth, I mean, I don't see any reason to think that it would -- rent growth in the Kanso product would be materially different than the submarket to which it's a part. Maybe it's a little less exposed to new supply because it's competing at a little bit lower price point. And typically, we found that the more modest price points have a little more rent growth kind of over a full cycle. So we think that it should be well positioned both for initial return and long-term growth.\nSean Breslin: Just to add on to that, maybe one other comment. Based on what we've seen at the test community, the concept community we have today, rent-to-income ratios are pretty similar to our portfolio in the Suburban Maryland market. And so if you think about -- if you get equivalent rent growth, higher margins because you don't have the same operating costs, you don't have the same, ultimately, CapEx costs as well, NOI growth could potentially be even stronger to the extent you have similar rent growth.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: There's been a lot of discussion this quarter around the embedded loss to lease across portfolios, and the benefit is you're able to capture that mark-to-market. But you guys highlighted the fact in the presentation that rents are 7% above pre-pandemic levels across the portfolio or up around 3.5% in the past couple of years. So do you think as we kind of get through to the back half of next year that pricing power could then exceed the inflationary level given some of the positive variables that you identified like the strong single-family housing market, personal income growth and then the fact that rent-to-income ratios aren't overly stretched today?\nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean the key point is there room beyond the existing loss to lease. I mean the macro environment is such that there is good pricing power. And as Ben pointed out in his prepared remarks, there's still a number of things out there from a macro standpoint that should continue to benefit rental demand in both our urban and suburban submarkets. I mean if you think about it, that 7% is kind of a blended number. But as you pointed out, in the urban submarkets, it's still trending slightly below 2019 levels. Urban occupancy rates and job center suburban occupancy rates and offices are still very low. They've been ticking up, which is great, and we're starting to see signs of that in terms of people moving back into the cities. That we were still a long ways to go in terms of a full recovery. So should there be incremental pricing power beyond what we've experienced in our portfolio, as all those macro factors have been alluded to start to come together? I think the answer is yes. Obviously, if we see some reversal, it may impact certain markets differently. So one of our expansion markets is Southeast Florida, as an example, and when you look at where the loss to lease is relative to historical norms and kind of long-term trend lines, is it well above historical norms? Yes. So we're going to be buyers there and developers there, but we're going to be careful about the bets we place. Might some of that revert back to New York? In that case, you see a little more softness there, yes. So those are the types of things that we talk about. But at a macro level, there's a reason to be optimistic, for sure.\nAustin Wurschmidt: No, that's helpful. And then, Kevin, just last quarter, you had ranked kind of the most attractive source of proceeds, and with debt and dispositions, I think we're at the top of the list. And here recently, you dusted off the continued equity program with a small issuance. Any change in the preference or ranking today and willingness to use equity as you think about growing the development pipeline over the next year?\nKevin P. O\u2019Shea: Austin, yes, so it hasn't changed tremendously. I guess probably if we had the heat map out right now and looked at things, probably asset sales would be at the top, pretty close to about the 100th percentile when you look at the historical precedent for that source of capital, particularly so for suburban asset sales. So that would still be our most attractive source of capital. But -- it would be followed pretty closely by unsecured debt, which would probably be in the mid- to high 90th percentile, call it, 95th percentile. And common equity would be not far behind, pretty much in that kind of 90th to 95th percentile, if we had -- again, if we had the heat map in front of us. So I mean, the broader message today is similar to the one that I spoke to a quarter ago, which is each of our 3 primary markets for capital asset sales, unsecured debt and common equity are attractively priced, and they're open and they're available to support funding our investment activity on an accretive basis. And so when you look at what we've raised to date, $1.4 billion, it's been primarily a mix of asset sales and unsecured debt. There has, as you noted, been a little bit of common equity issuance, but only $30 million, so call it 2% of the overall mix, give or take. And so I think where we stand today, obviously, it's a phenomenal position we're in right now from a financial flexibility standpoint, given where the balance sheet is positioned, as I mentioned a moment ago, and where pricing stands in the capital markets today. Obviously, we really can't comment about what we might do in the future for kind of the obvious reasons that the capital market conditions can change and our investment uses can as well. But certainly, we're in a position to tap all those sources accretively on a leverage-neutral basis to try to -- to drive the business forward and drive NAV and earnings growth. And with rising EBITDA, as I mentioned before, there is that -- we have an increasing capacity to issue debt to do so as well. So maybe I'll just stop there and say that it's a luxury being in a situation where we can look at all those choices, and it's a good time for us to be able to drive the business forward and be forward-facing in terms of the investment markets.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: And Tim, congrats. The leadership at AvalonBay has kind of been constant, and you're no small part of that, so good luck in the future. The first question for me is on Northern California. Your peer Essex thinks that's going to be the best growth story in their portfolio in 2022. Part of that is tech, returning their employees back to the office next year, and I know that was mentioned fairly in this call. But how impactful is that into your thought process towards Northern California for next year? I know you're not providing any 2022 color. But is it at least possible that Northern California could snap back in a way that it could be the leader in your portfolio in 2022?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Rich, good question. I think one way to think about that is the potential opportunity there just given that it is one of the markets -- or is the market that has not yet recovered to kind of pre-COVID levels. So if you look at it and judge it just by what is left to come, if you believe that all markets would revert back to their pre-COVID levels and continue to grow, that is the region that has the most to rebound, if you want to describe it that way. So to the extent you see demand come back in a way that supports that, then it certainly could be a leading market as you move into '22 and beyond. Obviously, you have to move through the lease expirations to capture the benefit, but you can certainly see a more meaningful acceleration based on where it's positioned today in terms of rents versus peak as compared to the rest of the portfolio.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Great. And then second question is on the expansion markets. It's quite clear why you're doing it, and no argument there. But as it relates to how it impacts the stock, 12 of the 15 development projects are in your kind of core gateway markets. So assuming you won't -- no matter what happens to the market, won't associate AvalonBay with the Sunbelt until you kind of have a reasonable amount of your business in those markets, relatively speaking. So with that in mind, what's the time line do you think where you can get like a 5%-ish type number in each of those expansion markets where you're at 25% or 30% of the total portfolio is outside of the core gateway markets and you really have yourself tethered to what might happen in the Sunbelt as it relates to stock performance, I should say?\nBenj Schall: Rich, this is Ben. I would guide you towards our experience in Southeast Florida and Denver as a decent proxy, right? So we've put out a target of each of those being 5%. We're at a point now with our teams on the ground with those franchises building where we are starting to see some accelerated activity, right, and increasingly our own development. So as we think about the new 4 expansion markets, probably on a similar type of process, our growth, just to orient everyone, it's acquisitions, which, obviously, you can get to the quickest. It's our own development, and we do have resources on the ground in each of these markets, spending time developing the relationships that are going to be necessary to unlock that land. And then the third vehicle is through the funding of other developers. And that's been an approach we've been utilizing in Denver and Southeast Florida. That will be -- one of our first projects in North Carolina will be of that approach. And a lever that we expect to pull sort of balance the -- getting some of that development profit, maybe not the full development profit, if we were executing our own, but working with people who have sites that are entitled and ready to go.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: And congrats, Tim. Hopefully, it means more golf in your future. And I also want to say congrats to Bill McLaughlin, your Development Head, on his retirement as well. So certainly talking about ramping up development, Bill has been responsible for a lot of that. So congrats. Two questions there. First, on the development part. You guys do not trend your rents, so that when you guys have in your development page your 5.9% yield that's based on escalated costs but rents as they are. As you guys underwrite new projects, given how rents have grown, do you expect the yields that we see in the supplemental to come up, meaning our rents outpacing the cost of construction, timing delays, et cetera, where we will start to see higher yields in the supplemental? Or we're not yet there yet?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes, Alex, it's Matt. So you're right, we -- when we start a job, it's based on today's rents and today's costs, and we basically locked in a good amount of the cost when we start the job. So we have an excellent track record of delivering on the cost side. So what you see is -- and then we don't remark the rents to market until we have 20% leased, give or take. So the rents will kind of stay where they are for the first year plus, and then we'll mark to market. And so the materials that we've shown earlier, what Ben was talking about how our rents are running $170, $180 above pro forma, that's based on those 6 jobs, which are now coming to market. So the first thing is there's jobs that are on that schedule that were started 12 or 18 months ago that have not yet been mark to market. So there should be some lift out of those. And again, that's what we're seeing on that basket that we have currently, and lease up, they're beating pro forma by 30, 40 basis points on the yield. On the deals that haven't yet started, what we're finding is that the greater rent and NOI definitely helps. The higher cost hurt, and it falls through to land value pretty darn quickly. And it's a very competitive market in terms of there's a lot of merchant builders out there. And where it all takes your yield, new business we're signing up today, reflecting today's rents is in that kind of mid- to high 5s yield that I mentioned. So where those yields settle out when you actually start the job in a year or 2, that's the bet what will grow faster from this point, kind of rents or costs. But I feel pretty good that, that kind of mid- to high 5s is probably a pretty consistent number you'll see for a while.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is, in your expansion markets, like in Dallas, I think your entry is out towards Grapevine area and, at $275 a door, would suggest pretty efficient pricing. Charlotte sounds like it's a little bit more infill at $350 or so. But based on your experience in the coastal markets and then looking at companies like Mid-America and the Sunbelt, is your Sunbelt focused more on the outer rings? Or do you think that you will target infill?\nSean Breslin: I think it's a little bit of both, Alex. I mean, ultimately, we'll have a diversified portfolio. Some of it is where we want to buy versus where we want to build. So if you look at what we've done in Denver, the assets we bought have tended to be more of the garden assets on the perimeter. And where we're developing, we have a deal in RiNo. We just started a deal in Westminster, which is kind of a second-ring suburb, but we're -- we have a deal that will start here shortly in the City of Denver. So we're trying to balance out the development which tends to be at the higher price point with -- particularly in these Sunbelt markets, where historically, over time, more of the rent growth probably has come in more of the moderate price point. So we are more focused on acquisitions that are younger assets but not necessarily kind of the downtown $350 a foot-type rent. So we like the position. The Charlotte acquisition was a little bit different just because it was an opportunity to pick up a 3-community portfolio in the South end, which is an incredibly dynamic part of Charlotte, where there's just tremendous amounts of growth, retail, employment as well as residential. But I think the Grapevine or the Flower Mound acquisition that you referenced is probably more in keeping with what we bought in Denver and what we've mostly been buying in Florida and where we're looking.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: And Tim also, it's been a pleasure. Good luck on the next phase of your career. My question here is on the technology platform and how you feel that can help you manage some of the chunkier, controllable expenses across the platform, given the inflation and costs that we're seeing across just about every aspect of life here. And maybe you can just make some comments on the benefits that you outlined. The $25 million to $30 million that you project for the next few years, what's the key driver there and some of the core assumptions?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Haendel, good question as it relates to technology and just for the inflation. And most of what we're focused on relates to, in simple terms, kind of digitizing the business and creating a more self-serve model for customers, which, just so you know, they have expressed a desire for that -- a continuing desire for that to be able to self-serve like they do with any other major brands across the country. And I would say that for the most part, the impact on the P&L will show up predominantly in payroll, probably a little bit in R&M just in terms of the efficiency of in-sourced and outsourced activity. But a lot of the things that we're doing relate to digitizing the application lease and move-in process, as an example, that a customer can self-serve and complete that entire process and move into a community without ever talking to anyone who's an AvalonBay staff member. AvalonBay staff may be available on a centralized call center or other locations regionally to be able to support that activity. But to the extent that they like to do it on a self-serve basis, they can. The same thing applies to the maintenance activity, lease renewals and then what we call the live journey, which is all the interactions that a customer has with us when they live with us. And that relates to all kinds of different things that get into the [indiscernible] about transferring apartments, adding a bed, adding a roommate, et cetera, et cetera. So most of it is focused on digitizing the business. The second piece of it is really around data science and leveraging data science that makes different types of decisions related to a number of different aspects of the business. Probably one use case to mention specifically is lease renewals. And the more we know about customer behavior and various other things will help us how to create a choice to customers and also try to optimize the renewal capture in terms of the process, but also the renewal value in terms of at what rent they renew with us and for what duration. So there's a lot of data science world that will be coming to fruition as well. But the heavy emphasis as it relates to the benefit that Ben mentioned is on the digitization of the business and the various processes that are related to customer interactions, and most of that benefit will show up via payroll.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Appreciate that. And incremental investments on that tech platform from here, or is the money effectively has been spent? Or how much more are we -- are you looking at in terms of the required investment?\nSean Breslin: Yes. So the total investment that we expect for the activities at least that we have sized up for the next 2 to 3 years is an incremental roughly $20 million to $25 million. We have incurred some costs to date, about $7 million, as it relates to our automated leasing agent and various other things that have already resulted in about an 18% reduction in the frontline sales staff at our communities, which is [indiscernible] payroll. But going forward, there's still some investment to come.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. One last one, if I could, on the rental assistant payments year-to-date. I appreciate the color you guys provided there. I'm curious what's left in that receivables bucket, what's the remaining opportunity for, say, next year, and how much has been reserved against that.\nKevin P. O\u2019Shea: Haendel, maybe I'll start, and Sean may want to jump in. In terms of the rent relief payments that we received, as you can tell in the same-store portfolio, we received $11 million in the third quarter. It's obviously a difficult line item to predict. Certainly, it's true, as Sean pointed out in his opening remarks, that nationwide, there's $47 billion that's been approved, and less than 1/4 of that has been distributed nationwide. So -- and we certainly have done an awful lot to apply for more proceeds from the various governmental agencies that are involved in that. And so to have our residents, it is hard to predict with great precision when it's going to come in for 2022, for example, but for -- and even for the fourth quarter of '21. But for purposes of guidance, what we have assumed in the fourth quarter in terms of incremental rent relief payments that we'll receive in the fourth quarter, we've assumed about $12 million in our same-store portfolio.\nSean Breslin: Yes. And I can add on to that. Certainly, Kevin can address the kind of gross versus net receivables and what the total part is. But just to provide a little color on what we've received, out of the funds we received, about 1/3 of it relates to applications that we submitted on behalf of the resident in jurisdictions where we are allowed to do so. About 2/3 of it has showed up via resident applications where we have had no knowledge of the applications submitted by the residents until we were notified by the jurisdiction that they were approved for payment and payment would be transferred to us. In terms of the percentage that we received relative to what we've applied for, again, what we can apply for independent of what the resident may have applied for, we've only received about 30% of the total pot that we have applied for. We've applied for, rough numbers, about $24 million in rent relief, and we've only received about $6.5 million or so to date. So to the extent that we recovered most of that is pretty significant opportunity to come independent of what we may receive in gross volume from either current residents who remain occupied in units but not paying or in some jurisdictions where we are allowed to recover it, payments associated with residents that have left us but left outstanding balances. So still a pot there to come. It's hard to determine exactly what may come through resident applications, again, because of the limited line of sight on those applications being submitted and processed.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Alex Kalmus with Zelman & Associates.\nAlex Kalmus: Given the 210 basis point spread between your development yields and the cap rates that are very low and that's despite the cost inflation and sourcing is very, very favorable, what's your sort of medium-term outlook on the supply notwithstanding the timing of specific markets, how that plays out? It seems like development is clearly winning out in this market, and it can create some supply down the line.\nSean Breslin: Yes. As it relates to total supply -- this is Sean. I can touch on that. In terms of our markets, our supply expectations for 2021 has come down for the beginning of the year as a result of various things, whether it's some of the supply chain issues that I've described, capacity in local jurisdictions as it relates to inspections and such, et cetera. But we expect 2021 to land at roughly about 1.7% of stock in terms of the deliveries. And based on what we can see in 2022, probably it's going to be relatively similar. There'll be a couple of regions where we expect a little bit of increased supply, and that includes the New York, New Jersey regions, some stuff in New York City that's pushed into next year, as an example. We also expect an uptick in Seattle. There's been pretty heavy volume under construction. Some of that has been delayed and pushed into 2022. Markets that will be relatively flat include probably the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast Florida, just based on supplies working its way through. And then we do expect to see a decline in supply in Boston, Northern and Southern California and Denver, just based on what we can see working its way through the construction process and the various delays. So that's the lineup as it relates to overall supply. And again, keep in mind that a heavy influence on the supply side here is in urban submarkets. And kind of looking out over the course of next year, we still expect about 100 basis point spread between percentage of stock that's delivered in urban environments as compared to suburban. Suburban came down potentially into the 1.3% or 1.4% of stock next year versus 240, 250 basis points in the urban submarkets. So there is the distinction there.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Alex, let me just add to that. It's Matt. I mean if you're talking longer term, I think what we're seeing is, to your point about the dynamic of the spread, development is a very profitable business. Supply tends to respond more quickly in the Sunbelt markets than in our coastal markets. So you've seen this year starts nationally are up. But in our markets, they're actually kind of level or a little bit down. So that is one of the factors. I -- and supply can respond more quickly in urban than in suburban submarket in our footprint because the supply -- the regulatory supply constraints are definitely more meaningful in the suburbs than in the urban areas. So across our coastal regions, what I'd say is development in the urban submarkets doesn't work today. And so you're seeing very, very little urban starts because the rents there are not above their prior peak, for the most part, as Sean had mentioned, and costs are up. So my guess is you'll see a relatively muted supply response in our urban markets once we get beyond the stuff that's currently underway, as you look out 2 or 3 years. Suburb is probably a little bit more slow in today. But I think the supply response to the favorable economics is going to be more aggressive in the Sunbelt.\nAlex Kalmus: Really appreciate the color. And earlier today, there's discussion about potential cost inflation and labor pressures driving some problems and lease-up for some developers. Does this seem like a reasonable expectation for potential opportunities to take over struggling lease-ups in the future for acquisitions?\nMatthew Birenbaum: We haven't heard that. I mean we haven't seen any lease-ups having particular issues. We've seen assets being sold during lease-up, just people trying to take advantage of the incredibly robust asset sales market. But frankly, not at discounted, to us, we're all that compelling relative to buying stabilized assets.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein : I had a question on maybe your Northern California strategy going into the fall/winter months. It seems like that, that softening starting in August was the delay in the return to office and something a lot of people pushing back to maybe January 1. Do you think we might see a turn higher as we get closer to the January 1? Kind of how are you guys thinking about that?\nSean Breslin: Joshua, just to be clear, when you say turn higher, are you talking about occupancy rents just kind of the overall fundamentals of the business or...\nJoshua Dennerlein : Yes. I guess I'm looking at Slide 10 of your presentation. So that, right, is what I would be focused on.\nSean Breslin: Yes. So I mean, as it relates to Northern Cal in general, in my earlier comments sort of reflect the view that particularly in these tech markets that are probably concentrated job centers like San Francisco and San Jose to some degree as well, of course, the return-to-office delays certainly have had an impact. We are starting to see people come back to those environments. We had an uptick in people moving to San Francisco and San Jose from more than 150 miles away in Q3 compared to not only last year, of course, but a stabilized year. So we're starting to see some movement just maybe not as much as I think we all would have anticipated post Labor Day. Delta kicked in and kind of created the issue. So is it likely that San Francisco, as an example, which probably has one of the lowest office usage rates in the country, will come back more strongly early next year as people come back to work? I think the answer is yes. The question is the pace at which that occurs and the flexibility that people are provided as it relates to work from anywhere, based on what we understand and trying to track that as best we can, most of the work-from-home policies that have been adopted, people might live maybe slightly further out or something. But they still need to be within a reasonable commuting distance of their office to be in there 2 to 3 days a week depending on the company. And therefore, given the traffic and the commuting patterns in a place like Northern California, people are -- they're going to be within the MSA that they work in as opposed to some place that's a 3-hour drive away. So we would expect it to come back. And again, the pace really will be dictated by the work-from-home policies based on what we see in vaccination trends, the vaccination requirements coming out and already seeing the uptick in people coming back to those markets. It's just a matter of degree as we move into 2022.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Tim Naughton for any closing remarks.\nTim Naughton: Yes. Thank you, Casey, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call today. I know we've been at it for a while here, and look forward to seeing or talking to you at least virtually at NAREIT here in a couple of weeks. So enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes our presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Brad, this is Kevin. Just to sort of reiterate, we do expect same-store OpEx to decline materially sequentially into the fourth quarter. Chandni, this is Kevin. Just to maybe add to Matt's point, I mean the largest -- most relevant point with respect to the activities we're doing is what Matt outlined, which is we are substantially match-funded against our investment commitments when we start those developments. So at the moment, if you look at our current book on the way of development, we are nearly 80% match funded. But also importantly, you have to look at this on a holistic balance sheet perspective, when we are considering incremental investment opportunities in that regard, we are in terrific financial shape and have tremendous financial flex. We're soon to be substantially match funded on investment commitments that we've made from a liquidity point of view, as you can tell from our lease, we have $300 million of cash on hand and nothing drawn a $1.75 billion line of credit. And then from a leverage point of view, we're at 5 time against a targeted range for net debt-to-EBITDA of 5x to 6x and our EBITDA is rising. And so we have increasing leverage capacity as well. So when you kind of put that all together, to the extent we get into a where there's a little bit of volatility in the capital markets, we do have a lot of financial flexibility to choose our time in which we enter a market and try to choose when we source capital to those moments where it's most attractive. So Altogether, we're in terrific financial shape with respect to our existing commitments, and we have a lot of flexibility to think about how we might finance our future investment opportunities in a volatile and potentially rising rate environment."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Jason, and welcome. Ben Schall, Kevin O'Shea, Matt Birenbaum and Sean Breslin. For our prepared comments today, Ben will provide a summary of third quarter results, an update on Q4 and full year guidance and provide some thoughts on why we believe AVB is well positioned to outperform. Sean will then elaborate on operating trends in the portfolio, where we continue to see strong momentum and healthy fundamentals that should support robust growth as we move into 2022. And then we'll conclude with an overview of development activity where development economics remain compelling and then offer a brief look at our new expansion markets, including our rationale behind our decision to enter them earlier this year. And then we'll all be available for Q&A after prepared remarks. But before turning the call over to Ben, I did want to take a minute to acknowledge that I expect that this will be my last earnings call as I plan to step down at year-end as CEO, when I'll assume the role of Executive Chairman as we had previously announced last December. I spent the last 32 years at AvalonBay and its predecessors. And over the last 20-plus years or so, I've had the opportunity to interact with many of you on this call on a regular basis. I just want to say that I appreciate your support for and engagement with the company and me over that time. And for the investors on the call, I simply want to thank you for entrusting us as a steward of your capital over the years. It's something we've never taken for granted. And I know that will continue to be the case in the future on the leadership of Ben and this executive team. I look forward to being able to touch base with many of you more directly and hopefully in a little more personal way over the next couple of months. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over and place in the very capable hands of Ben Schall and the rest of the executive team here today. Ben? Thank you, Ben. John, last quarter, we spent time talking to our new concept called on right, which is targeted to a customer segment who don't believe places a lot of value, right, on those additional amenities. But there's definitely aspects there in terms of for both upfront and go-forward operating expenses, right, that provide benefits from the growth opportunity with that brand. Yes. Thank you, Casey, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call today. I know we've been at it for a while here, and look forward to seeing or talking to you at least virtually at NAREIT here in a couple of weeks. So enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Matthew Birenbaum",
            "content": "Sure. Yes. Just to give a little more color on the development pipeline. So we're -- we've started close to $1 billion so far this year. We are on track to start probably another $350 million here in the fourth quarter. And when you kind of look at the breakdown of the most recent starts this year, it's a nice mix geographically, about three quarters suburban, one quarter urban and maybe 25% of our starts this year and actually in our expansion markets in Florida and Denver and then maybe a little less than one-third in the Northeast and the rest, almost half on the West Coast. As we look out to next year, we'd like to be able to start somewhere in the same range in that $1 billion to $1.5 billion range, depending on how things shape up. But as Ben mentioned in his remarks, we have a $3 billion development rights pipeline. And there's a lot working its way through the system now. We really started putting our foot back on the gas for new business development a quarter or 2 ago. And we've got probably over $1 billion worth of new development rights in addition to that $3 billion that's working its way through the system now. So we will start some in this fourth quarter, but I'm hoping that at the end of the year, the development rights pipeline will actually grow to somewhere at or north of $3.5 billion. So we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. Sure. Nick, it's Matt. There's definitely inflation and like you said, it helps on the rent side and it hurts on the cost side. What we've seen is the deals that we are starting this year the total development cost is probably 10% to maybe even as much in some cases, is 15% higher than where it would have been a couple of years ago. If NOIs are trending up, you do get some leverage on that. And then the third part of the equation is asset values, which, of course, have been trending up more than the 10% or 15% costs have been going up. So when you combine the higher NOI with the lower cap rates, the value creation and the spread is probably wider than it was before. The yields probably pre-COVID, our development rights pipeline yields were maybe in the low 6s. Now they're in the high 5s. If you look at the stuff we're starting this year, it's pro forma to around 7 5 8 and that's where kind of the new business we're signing up or the stuff we might start next year based on today's economics looks to be as well. Yes Rich, it's Matt. It is -- I mean we have not yet seen a lack of availability, supply chain interfere with our ability to deliver apartments. We've had spot issues here and there where right now, we're struggling to get appliances in 1 asset, and so it might delay deliveries by a month or so. But we haven't seen it in a more widespread way, but there is that potential. I mean there are certain commodities, drywalls on an allocation right now in some markets. So I think it has impacted the for sale inventory and ability to deliver some. I think for us, it's a place where we benefit a little bit by being our own general contractor and having repeat relationships with our subcontractors. So honestly, the bigger constraint right now on getting units turned and delivered has been the local jurisdictions and their staff. A lot of these jurisdictions are still remote and they're down inspectors and you can't get people at City Hall to print out the documents you need. So I wouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff that's in the pipeline takes a little longer to deliver if a deal that you thought you might done in 8 quarters might take 9 quarters instead. So there could be a little bit of delay over time on that, and it might extend the supply some just more broadly. Matt, I can start and others can chime in. I'd say, first and foremost, we try and lock in that spread by. So we're generally raising and sourcing the capital when we start jobs. So that if there is a big change to the cost of capital, you think about the development yields we're putting up relative to the capital that we funded those with. And so that's why you see -- we're generally anywhere between 70% and 80% match funded. When you look at kind of the remaining spend in our development book against our cash on hand and kind of the short-term free cash flow. So I think it probably starts there. And then beyond that, I guess you'd have to ask yourself why are rates rising? And if because it's an inflationary environment and NOIs are also rising, then hopefully, you can preserve most of that spread anyway. If rates are rising because it's an increase in real rates as opposed to nominal rates, then that does put downward pressure on the margin. Yes, John, it's Matt. I'll just add to that. I think that's right. Honestly, if you look back over the last 5 or 10 years, probably the thing that's driving up CapEx more is just that we're putting more into these buildings, the amenities are a lot more elaborate. And when it comes time to redo those, it's a little more expensive. Going forward, it's an interesting question. you could make an argument that as a regulatory load increases, it may be an advantage for institutional owners like ourselves who have better capacity to manage that and deal with it in some of the smaller private owners. So over time, it might contribute to more consolidation in our space, which is incredibly fragmented. But we certainly are trying to manage on an asset-by-asset basis and our CapEx exposure, and it's one of the things that forms our kind of asset trading strategy and the things we've been really pleased by is our ability to sell assets that are 30 years old that have definitely significantly more CapEx liability embedded in them at basically the same cap rates as buying almost brand-new assets. So that definitely informs our strategy on the margin. Sure. This is Matt. I can speak to that a little bit. So we didn't actually close anything this past quarter. We've closed a number of dispositions in the second quarter. But as Ben mentioned, we have about $300 million that we expect to close here in the fourth quarter. All of that is in the Northeast, which is where we've been heavily over-indexed in terms of our disposition activity. A couple of years ago, we sold a significant chunk in New York City into a joint venture, and then we've been balancing that out the last couple of years with more dispositions in the New York suburbs. And a lot of that is just driven by our overall portfolio allocation, given that we have a pretty deep development pipeline in many of those kind of suburban New York areas as well. So as we look forward, we're going to look to continue to rotate capital out of our coastal regions into these expansion markets, and it will probably continue to be a little bit disproportionately in New York, other parts of the Northeast and maybe over time in the Mid-Atlantic and a little bit in California as well. This is Matt. We are certainly out there looking for opportunities to grow the Kanso brand. Again, our market research would indicate that there is a large untapped segment of customers that are looking for what Kanso offers. So I do think there's a great opportunity out there and that it's going to take us a little time to get at it, but we're very focused on it. In terms of future rent growth, I mean, I don't see any reason to think that it would -- rent growth in the Kanso product would be materially different than the submarket to which it's a part. Maybe it's a little less exposed to new supply because it's competing at a little bit lower price point. And typically, we found that the more modest price points have a little more rent growth kind of over a full cycle. So we think that it should be well positioned both for initial return and long-term growth. Yes, Alex, it's Matt. So you're right, we -- when we start a job, it's based on today's rents and today's costs, and we basically locked in a good amount of the cost when we start the job. So we have an excellent track record of delivering on the cost side. So what you see is -- and then we don't remark the rents to market until we have 20% leased, give or take. So the rents will kind of stay where they are for the first year plus, and then we'll mark to market. And so the materials that we've shown earlier, what Ben was talking about how our rents are running $170, $180 above pro forma, that's based on those 6 jobs, which are now coming to market. So the first thing is there's jobs that are on that schedule that were started 12 or 18 months ago that have not yet been mark to market. So there should be some lift out of those. And again, that's what we're seeing on that basket that we have currently, and lease up, they're beating pro forma by 30, 40 basis points on the yield. On the deals that haven't yet started, what we're finding is that the greater rent and NOI definitely helps. The higher cost hurt, and it falls through to land value pretty darn quickly. And it's a very competitive market in terms of there's a lot of merchant builders out there. And where it all takes your yield, new business we're signing up today, reflecting today's rents is in that kind of mid- to high 5s yield that I mentioned. So where those yields settle out when you actually start the job in a year or 2, that's the bet what will grow faster from this point, kind of rents or costs. But I feel pretty good that, that kind of mid- to high 5s is probably a pretty consistent number you'll see for a while. Alex, let me just add to that. It's Matt. I mean if you're talking longer term, I think what we're seeing is, to your point about the dynamic of the spread, development is a very profitable business. Supply tends to respond more quickly in the Sunbelt markets than in our coastal markets. So you've seen this year starts nationally are up. But in our markets, they're actually kind of level or a little bit down. So that is one of the factors. I -- and supply can respond more quickly in urban than in suburban submarket in our footprint because the supply -- the regulatory supply constraints are definitely more meaningful in the suburbs than in the urban areas. So across our coastal regions, what I'd say is development in the urban submarkets doesn't work today. And so you're seeing very, very little urban starts because the rents there are not above their prior peak, for the most part, as Sean had mentioned, and costs are up. So my guess is you'll see a relatively muted supply response in our urban markets once we get beyond the stuff that's currently underway, as you look out 2 or 3 years. Suburb is probably a little bit more slow in today. But I think the supply response to the favorable economics is going to be more aggressive in the Sunbelt. We haven't heard that. I mean we haven't seen any lease-ups having particular issues. We've seen assets being sold during lease-up, just people trying to take advantage of the incredibly robust asset sales market. But frankly, not at discounted, to us, we're all that compelling relative to buying stabilized assets."

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Ben. I thought I'd share a few slides on the portfolio rent for the quarter and into October, both at the same-store level and across different markets and submarkets. Overall, we have continued to experience a significant rebound in the business. If you look at Slide 8, like-term effective rent change turned positive in June, has accelerated materially over the last few months. It is now running at roughly 11%. If you turn to Slide 9, you can see what's supporting the improvement in our rent change, which is the growth we've experienced in average move-in rent value. Our average move-in value has grown by roughly 24% since the beginning of the year, including a 9% increase since the end of Q2 and is now about 7% above the level we achieved in the fall of 2019. Moving to Slide 10. Improved performance has been broad-based with every region experienced an increase in average move-in rent over the past quarter. As noted in the chart, the recent flattening of move-in values reflect a normal seasonal pattern although the seasonal adjustment has only been about one-third of the amount we typically see moving from the summer into the fall. Rents are now equal to or greater than 2019 levels in every region except Northern California, which has seen roughly 20% growth in move-in rents this year but still remains roughly 7% below the level we achieved in 2019. The time line for a full recovery in Northern California has been delayed in large part by major tech employers extending their return to office state into early 2022. At the other end of the spectrum, the Southern California region has experienced strong growth in movement values, supported by very healthy job growth, including significant growth in the content-producing segment of the media industry. Limited supply and a very tighter sale market. Turning to Slide 11 to address suburban and urban performance trends. The average October move-in rent for our suburban portfolio was roughly 12% above the rent we achieved in October 2019. In our urban portfolio, while demand has returned in a meaningful way and rents have recovered significantly. Move-in rents are still slightly below what we achieved in October 2019. To provide a few examples, in Boston and New York City, urban move-in rents are now 1% above what we achieved in 2019. But the District of Columbia and San Francisco are lagging with move-in rents that are 3% and 13%, respectively, below what we achieved in 2019. Given the continuing adoption of vaccine requirements and steady climate vaccination rates, we expect urban office occupancy rates will continue to rise as we move into 2022 which is one of the opportunities we expect to benefit from next year. In fact, moving to Slide 12. The macro environment should support healthy fundamentals in our markets over the next several quarters. Starting at the top left of Slide 12. While the labor market continues to improve, we're still almost 5 million jobs short of where we started. The demand for labor continues to be robust, which is putting material upward pressure on wages a key driver of rent growth. Chart 1 shows job, wage and total personal income growth for the professional services sector of the economy, which is where most of our residents are employed. As noted in the chart, we've only experienced positive year-over-year growth across all 3 categories since Q2 of this year. And as many businesses are finding as they attempt to recruit and retain professional services employees, the market has only strengthened since Q2. In Chart 2, office usage hit a trough in Q2 2020 at the onset of the pandemic. Since that time, while we've seen steady improvement, the gains have been modest. As we look forward into 2022, gains in office usage should support additional rent growth, particularly in our urban and job center suburban submarkets. And touching on Chart 3 and 4 regarding the housing market, price appreciation in the for-sale single-family market and relatively stable multifamily supply, both support a healthy near-term outlook for rental rate growth. With that favorable macro outlook as context, turning to Slide 13, we also see terrific tailwinds in our portfolio as we move into next year. Beginning in the upper left of the slide, the chart number one , we're starting from a position of strength with turnover trending lower and strong, stable occupancy, which brings with it unusually strong pricing power. Turnover has declined this year. It was down about 1,000 basis points or 15% in Q3 relative to what we would experience a normal year like 2019 and occupancy has been running above 96% for several months now, a point at which we can continue to push rents. In Chart 2, given the very healthy rent change we've experienced a month, we'll be starting 2022 with built-in revenue growth of roughly 3%. The starting point that we didn't benefit from in any year during the last cycle. The strongest starting point in the last cycle was roughly 2.25% at the beginning of 2012. In addition to the baked-in revenue growth in Chart 2, our loss to lease is currently running at roughly 14% and is depicted in Chart number 3. Providing plenty of opportunity to benefit from moving existing leases to market when they expire. Moving to the bottom of Slide 13. There are 3 other somewhat unusual tailwinds that should also benefit revenue growth as we move into 2022. In Chart 4, the amortization of concessions associated with previously signed leases which should burn off as we move through the next several quarters. In Chart 5, a reduction in bad debt, which we won't revert quickly to the pre-pandemic average but should begin to abate as the eviction moratoria expire and our legal remedies become more widely available to us. And then finally, on Chart 6, continuing receipts from the emergency rental assistance program for our same-store portfolio, we receive -- we have received $14 million from the program with $11 million of it coming in the last quarter. Since less than one quarter of the roughly $47 billion authorized by the federal government have been distributed as of September 30, we expect to receive additional funds in Q4 this year and in 2022. So with that summary, I'll turn it back to Ben to address development and our new expansion markets. Ben? Rich, it's Sean. And good question, of course. Yes, what I would say on the loss to lease is in a normal year, so to speak, as part of what you can say is that there's probably anywhere between 15% to 20% of our portfolio that's somewhat constrained in capturing that loss to lease or the delta between the existing rents and the market rent based on the regulatory environment that's in place. And the typical examples are the rent rates in New York, in D.C., we have an asset in San Francisco, 1 in L.A., et cetera, et cetera. In the current environment, given the, call it, the COVID overlay, that total percentage of the portfolio that is somewhat encumbered at least for the short run, is probably closer to about one-third of the portfolio where there are some rent caps in place in various other jurisdictions that limit the ability to capture that. The question is when some of those additional or incremental restriction -- restrictions expire, which is TBD at this point in time. The 1 that's probably the most significant is the state of emergency cap in California, which is constraining probably, for the most part, renewals in places like San Diego and Orange County, which have experienced pretty robust growth. So the way I would think about it is you have the incremental piece that I talked about, so call it totally one-third that is probably constrained, at least in the near term, how that sort of burns off from one-third back to 15%, 20% during 2022 as a TBD. And then also just factoring in the distribution of lease expectations is the other fact that you have to consider as you kind of run through your model. Yes. Nick, it's Sean. Good question. And I think when you talk about the regulatory environment, there are pros and cons to it. So if you maybe start with sort of our coastal market footprint that we've had for a long period of time. Part of the reason we have been so successful in creating value through the development pipeline is there is a very difficult regulatory environment to work your way through to actually get development entitled and delivered into those submarkets. So it's been to our benefit historically. Obviously, the more active is the jurisdictions become as it relates to landlord tenants and rent-oriented things become slightly more risky for us, of course. In terms of the expansion markets, there are not as many constraints on development, although there are places within those regions that are a little more sensitive to development and have somewhat more constraints, but in general, slightly -- were favorable in terms of development, of course. And in terms of evaluating the risk on sort of the landlord tenant side and the rent side, it is a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction assessment. For example, if you think of our legacy markets, we feel pretty good about Washington state overall, not so good about the city of Seattle. So when you go through some of these markets, for example, in Texas, you look at overall, feel pretty good generally speaking about that environment. Austin, there are some more regulatory constraints in the suburban environments as it relates to land use and the watershed and things like that. So overall, we think the regulatory environment certainly is to our benefit in those markets, but there are places where you have to still work with -- and overall, the landlord tenant, the rent control side, we think the risk is definitely lower than our legacy markets, but it's not without any risk the way I describe it. Yes, Rich, good question. I'm not sure we're prepared to I'll call it a lead horse just yet. The way I think about it is kind of the way you described in terms of looking at job growth, supply growth, all the macro factors that we all consider. And I think what we -- the reason we're going into these markets is while we certainly see more supply growth in these markets, say, in the 3% range, if you talk about Denver Southeast Florida, they also produce a lot more jobs and have benefited from much more significant in migration as opposed to the coastal markets, which have typically benefited historically from immigration. So I think when we look through it, I mean, at the end of the day, when we look at our portfolio, we still expect a very significant portion of our portfolio to be in our sort of legacy coastal markets. But for all the reasons that Ben talked about in his prepared remarks related to where we see kind of knowledge-based workers growing. It's growing in our legacy markets. It's also growing in some of these mid-cap knowledge markets, there's more supply, for sure, but you definitely see the demand that more that consumes that. So I think the question is really the supply get maybe too much in front of that in some of these Sunbelt markets where we've seen significant growth the last 18 months? Or does that come back in the check. I think that will dictate kind of how the rent growth equation comes out across the expansion markets versus our coastal markets. But we believe in both, and they may not grow at the same pace at the same time. But over the long run, we feel good about the rent growth that we'll see across the entire footprint. Good question, John. At the portfolio level, it has not changed materially going through COVID, but has dipped a little bit, which is something you might expect. In terms of sort of recent quarter leasing activity, -- That 1 I have to follow up with you on. I don't have that off the top of my head. But the overall percentage of the population with the third quarter, I think it was down maybe 150 basis points from historical averages. So not a material move. But it doesn't mean that it hasn't changed in certain submarkets. We have heard about that a little bit, particularly in the context of major urban cities that are home to significant university where they've tried to sort of densify the dorm, so to speak. So there's not as many roommates and pushing people out to sort of market rate housing which is helping to support demand in these markets. But the specific nuance the last couple of quarters that I have to back. Yes. Good question. I can take some of that, and there's some ESG things that Matt can talk about that potentially out there on the horizon in the context of the regulatory environment, there are definitely some issues. I wouldn't call it really broad-based, John, that are sort of getting into how we operate buildings. There have always been issues about checking things in New York City as an example, in terms of a inspections and stuff like that. That's ongoing. The balcony issue in California has come at some expense. But mainly, it's an inspection issue. That was originally pushed by the unions. And so yes, people are spending a little bit of money on inspections, but it's not clear that there's a mandate that you have to do X, Y or Z repairs within a very short time frame. So over a longer period of time, it may move the needle a little bit. But at least based on what's out there today, as it relates to physical inspections and ongoing remediation, I wouldn't expect it to be a big driver probably the bigger issues are more on the construction side as it relates to some of the green things that may come through ESG efforts that are sort of a broader envelope of other things that are coming through in various jurisdictions. That's a good question. It hasn't softened as much. We've seen a little bit of softness. It's probably hard to tell on that chart, but it has been less near the market. It's going to be less than historical norms. I mentioned there's a number of reasons that we've got out there. I mean it's been a pretty robust market in terms of job growth the last 6 months. A lot of the travel, entertainment businesses coming back online. The content producers in the media space have been on overdrive producing content. So the market has had a pretty robust recovery. So how long that is sustainable, we'll wait to see how things kind of play out next year as it relates to all the macro variables that we think about. But the outlook for Southern California is pretty healthy given very low expected volume of multifamily supply next year, the lowest of any of our coastal markets, pretty healthy job growth and a very tight for-sale market -- both for rent and for sale. So there are a number of reasons why the general outlook for Southern California is pretty good. Just to add on to that, maybe one other comment. Based on what we've seen at the test community, the concept community we have today, rent-to-income ratios are pretty similar to our portfolio in the Suburban Maryland market. And so if you think about -- if you get equivalent rent growth, higher margins because you don't have the same operating costs, you don't have the same, ultimately, CapEx costs as well, NOI growth could potentially be even stronger to the extent you have similar rent growth. Yes. I mean the key point is there room beyond the existing loss to lease. I mean the macro environment is such that there is good pricing power. And as Ben pointed out in his prepared remarks, there's still a number of things out there from a macro standpoint that should continue to benefit rental demand in both our urban and suburban submarkets. I mean if you think about it, that 7% is kind of a blended number. But as you pointed out, in the urban submarkets, it's still trending slightly below 2019 levels. Urban occupancy rates and job center suburban occupancy rates and offices are still very low. They've been ticking up, which is great, and we're starting to see signs of that in terms of people moving back into the cities. That we were still a long ways to go in terms of a full recovery. So should there be incremental pricing power beyond what we've experienced in our portfolio, as all those macro factors have been alluded to start to come together? I think the answer is yes. Obviously, if we see some reversal, it may impact certain markets differently. So one of our expansion markets is Southeast Florida, as an example, and when you look at where the loss to lease is relative to historical norms and kind of long-term trend lines, is it well above historical norms? Yes. So we're going to be buyers there and developers there, but we're going to be careful about the bets we place. Might some of that revert back to New York? In that case, you see a little more softness there, yes. So those are the types of things that we talk about. But at a macro level, there's a reason to be optimistic, for sure. Yes, Rich, good question. I think one way to think about that is the potential opportunity there just given that it is one of the markets -- or is the market that has not yet recovered to kind of pre-COVID levels. So if you look at it and judge it just by what is left to come, if you believe that all markets would revert back to their pre-COVID levels and continue to grow, that is the region that has the most to rebound, if you want to describe it that way. So to the extent you see demand come back in a way that supports that, then it certainly could be a leading market as you move into '22 and beyond. Obviously, you have to move through the lease expirations to capture the benefit, but you can certainly see a more meaningful acceleration based on where it's positioned today in terms of rents versus peak as compared to the rest of the portfolio. I think it's a little bit of both, Alex. I mean, ultimately, we'll have a diversified portfolio. Some of it is where we want to buy versus where we want to build. So if you look at what we've done in Denver, the assets we bought have tended to be more of the garden assets on the perimeter. And where we're developing, we have a deal in RiNo. We just started a deal in Westminster, which is kind of a second-ring suburb, but we're -- we have a deal that will start here shortly in the City of Denver. So we're trying to balance out the development which tends to be at the higher price point with -- particularly in these Sunbelt markets, where historically, over time, more of the rent growth probably has come in more of the moderate price point. So we are more focused on acquisitions that are younger assets but not necessarily kind of the downtown $350 a foot-type rent. So we like the position. The Charlotte acquisition was a little bit different just because it was an opportunity to pick up a 3-community portfolio in the South end, which is an incredibly dynamic part of Charlotte, where there's just tremendous amounts of growth, retail, employment as well as residential. But I think the Grapevine or the Flower Mound acquisition that you referenced is probably more in keeping with what we bought in Denver and what we've mostly been buying in Florida and where we're looking. Yes, Haendel, good question as it relates to technology and just for the inflation. And most of what we're focused on relates to, in simple terms, kind of digitizing the business and creating a more self-serve model for customers, which, just so you know, they have expressed a desire for that -- a continuing desire for that to be able to self-serve like they do with any other major brands across the country. And I would say that for the most part, the impact on the P&L will show up predominantly in payroll, probably a little bit in R&M just in terms of the efficiency of in-sourced and outsourced activity. But a lot of the things that we're doing relate to digitizing the application lease and move-in process, as an example, that a customer can self-serve and complete that entire process and move into a community without ever talking to anyone who's an AvalonBay staff member. AvalonBay staff may be available on a centralized call center or other locations regionally to be able to support that activity. But to the extent that they like to do it on a self-serve basis, they can. The same thing applies to the maintenance activity, lease renewals and then what we call the live journey, which is all the interactions that a customer has with us when they live with us. And that relates to all kinds of different things that get into the [indiscernible] about transferring apartments, adding a bed, adding a roommate, et cetera, et cetera. So most of it is focused on digitizing the business. The second piece of it is really around data science and leveraging data science that makes different types of decisions related to a number of different aspects of the business. Probably one use case to mention specifically is lease renewals. And the more we know about customer behavior and various other things will help us how to create a choice to customers and also try to optimize the renewal capture in terms of the process, but also the renewal value in terms of at what rent they renew with us and for what duration. So there's a lot of data science world that will be coming to fruition as well. But the heavy emphasis as it relates to the benefit that Ben mentioned is on the digitization of the business and the various processes that are related to customer interactions, and most of that benefit will show up via payroll. Yes. So the total investment that we expect for the activities at least that we have sized up for the next 2 to 3 years is an incremental roughly $20 million to $25 million. We have incurred some costs to date, about $7 million, as it relates to our automated leasing agent and various other things that have already resulted in about an 18% reduction in the frontline sales staff at our communities, which is [indiscernible] payroll. But going forward, there's still some investment to come. Yes. And I can add on to that. Certainly, Kevin can address the kind of gross versus net receivables and what the total part is. But just to provide a little color on what we've received, out of the funds we received, about 1/3 of it relates to applications that we submitted on behalf of the resident in jurisdictions where we are allowed to do so. About 2/3 of it has showed up via resident applications where we have had no knowledge of the applications submitted by the residents until we were notified by the jurisdiction that they were approved for payment and payment would be transferred to us. In terms of the percentage that we received relative to what we've applied for, again, what we can apply for independent of what the resident may have applied for, we've only received about 30% of the total pot that we have applied for. We've applied for, rough numbers, about $24 million in rent relief, and we've only received about $6.5 million or so to date. So to the extent that we recovered most of that is pretty significant opportunity to come independent of what we may receive in gross volume from either current residents who remain occupied in units but not paying or in some jurisdictions where we are allowed to recover it, payments associated with residents that have left us but left outstanding balances. So still a pot there to come. It's hard to determine exactly what may come through resident applications, again, because of the limited line of sight on those applications being submitted and processed. Yes. As it relates to total supply -- this is Sean. I can touch on that. In terms of our markets, our supply expectations for 2021 has come down for the beginning of the year as a result of various things, whether it's some of the supply chain issues that I've described, capacity in local jurisdictions as it relates to inspections and such, et cetera. But we expect 2021 to land at roughly about 1.7% of stock in terms of the deliveries. And based on what we can see in 2022, probably it's going to be relatively similar. There'll be a couple of regions where we expect a little bit of increased supply, and that includes the New York, New Jersey regions, some stuff in New York City that's pushed into next year, as an example. We also expect an uptick in Seattle. There's been pretty heavy volume under construction. Some of that has been delayed and pushed into 2022. Markets that will be relatively flat include probably the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast Florida, just based on supplies working its way through. And then we do expect to see a decline in supply in Boston, Northern and Southern California and Denver, just based on what we can see working its way through the construction process and the various delays. So that's the lineup as it relates to overall supply. And again, keep in mind that a heavy influence on the supply side here is in urban submarkets. And kind of looking out over the course of next year, we still expect about 100 basis point spread between percentage of stock that's delivered in urban environments as compared to suburban. Suburban came down potentially into the 1.3% or 1.4% of stock next year versus 240, 250 basis points in the urban submarkets. So there is the distinction there. Joshua, just to be clear, when you say turn higher, are you talking about occupancy rents just kind of the overall fundamentals of the business or... Yes. So I mean, as it relates to Northern Cal in general, in my earlier comments sort of reflect the view that particularly in these tech markets that are probably concentrated job centers like San Francisco and San Jose to some degree as well, of course, the return-to-office delays certainly have had an impact. We are starting to see people come back to those environments. We had an uptick in people moving to San Francisco and San Jose from more than 150 miles away in Q3 compared to not only last year, of course, but a stabilized year. So we're starting to see some movement just maybe not as much as I think we all would have anticipated post Labor Day. Delta kicked in and kind of created the issue. So is it likely that San Francisco, as an example, which probably has one of the lowest office usage rates in the country, will come back more strongly early next year as people come back to work? I think the answer is yes. The question is the pace at which that occurs and the flexibility that people are provided as it relates to work from anywhere, based on what we understand and trying to track that as best we can, most of the work-from-home policies that have been adopted, people might live maybe slightly further out or something. But they still need to be within a reasonable commuting distance of their office to be in there 2 to 3 days a week depending on the company. And therefore, given the traffic and the commuting patterns in a place like Northern California, people are -- they're going to be within the MSA that they work in as opposed to some place that's a 3-hour drive away. So we would expect it to come back. And again, the pace really will be dictated by the work-from-home policies based on what we see in vaccination trends, the vaccination requirements coming out and already seeing the uptick in people coming back to those markets. It's just a matter of degree as we move into 2022."

            "name": "Ben Schall",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim. We wanted to start the call today as a team and an organization by expressing our gratitude and acknowledging Tim for his contributions to the company and the industry over the last 32 years. AvalonBay would not be the company it is today without Tim's strategic leadership, which is deeply intertwined with the company's history and evolution into one of the preeminent real estate companies in the U.S., its exceptional track record of value creation and its inclusive culture focused on continuous improvement. In addition to overseeing AvalonBay's tremendous growth and positioning us as an industry leader, Tim has also had a major influence on the evolution of the multifamily industry and the broader REIT sector during his career. And throughout all of these accomplishments and successes in what is one of Tim's most admirable attributes as a leader and a person, Tim never made it about him. His focus has always been on others, the positive impact he could have on people, the impact that AvalonBay could have in our communities and how he could lead by fostering and reinforcing our evergreen culture and strong organizational values. On behalf of all of those that have been part of AvalonBay and all of us at the company today, thank you, Tim. As the next section and before turning to the presentation, we wanted to emphasize upfront a number of factors that we believe position AvalonBay for outsized performance over the coming quarters and as we look towards 2022. Our operating fundamentals continue to show very strong momentum with rents now above pre-COVID levels in 5 of our 6 large coastal regions with the strongest performance in our suburban communities, which comprise over two-thirds of the portfolio. Our resident base with concentrations employed in knowledge-based industries are in high demand in today's labor market, setting the table for future rent growth as wages continue to rise. And for the segment of our resident base who would typically be seeking to purchase a home after a period of time with us, this alternative is challenging given the general lack of availability, further supporting our retention rates and demand fundamentals. We also expect our portfolio and market allocation to generate strong growth over the coming quarters. Looking back over the last 18 months, while we've experienced an unprecedented trough and then an equally unprecedented recovery, our rents today are only 7% above October 2019 levels, equating roughly to 3.5% growth per year. With an economy and growth mode, limited availability, low turnover, significant loss to lease and with one-third of our portfolio in urban areas that are recovering, but still held back by the pandemic, we expect strong operating tailwinds as we head into 2022. Our execution on our operating model initiatives also continue to pay dividends with our investments in technology and innovation, offering enhanced value to prospects and residents while also allowing us to improve operating efficiencies. Through these initiatives, we expect to improve margin by roughly 200 basis points, with $10 million of this improvement already captured and with an additional $25 million to $35 million to be captured over the next couple of years. Finally, we're also creating outsized value creation and earnings growth from our development platform with returns trending above pro forma, leading us to ramp development activity with very attractive spreads between our development yields and market cap rates. We are definitely in growth mode, which is further supported by our access to a historically low cost of capital given the strength of the capital and transaction markets, all of which sets up for a strong end of this year and meaningful growth in 2022. Turning to the presentation and starting on Slide 4. The rapid pace of recovery continued in the third quarter with core FFO coming in at $0.10 above the midpoint of our prior Q3 guidance and flat on a year-over-year basis. The outperformance relative to guidance was driven primarily by same-store revenue, which produced a 4% sequential increase in revenue on a cash basis. Our growth orientation is reflected in our ramp in development starts with just under $1 billion of starts through the end of Q3. We've also completed $1.1 billion of projects so far this year at an attractive yield of 5.9%. In addition to development, we are growing through acquisitions, and Q3 marked our first acquisitions in our new expansion markets of Texas and North Carolina totaling $275 million. And subsequent to quarter end, we closed on an additional acquisition in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for $150 million. Funding our growth with low-cost capital, primarily from asset sales and incremental debt proceeds, including a recent $700 million 10-year unsecured bond at a fixed rate of 2.05%, the lowest coupon and lowest spread in AvalonBay history and also our first green bond. Turning to Slide 5 and given these strong operating trends, we have raised our guidance for Q4 and for the full year 2021. Q4 FFO guidance has been raised to a range of $2.19 to $2.29 per share, an $0.11 increase over our previous Q4 guidance at the midpoint. This improved outlook is driven by our improved revenue expectations with residential revenue now projected to increase in Q4 by 5% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to occupancy and rate trends, the same-store revenue outlook assumes approximately $12 million of additional rent relief payments in Q4, relatively consistent with what we received during Q3. Other activity incorporated into our updated Q4 guidance includes $250 million to $300 million of dispositions from our Northeastern markets at an expected cap rate of sub 3.5% and $300 million to $350 million of acquisitions in our expansion markets, one of which is the Fort Lauderdale community and with the others under agreement. Slide 6 shows the components of rental revenue change on a year-over-year basis, residential revenue growth being driven primarily by higher occupancy and rent relief recognized during Q3 leading to a 1% increase on a GAAP basis and a 4.3% increase on a cash basis. On a sequential basis, as shown on Slide 7, the rental revenue increase was driven by our momentum on lease rates as well as the recognition of rent relief payments, leading to a residential rental revenue increase of 3.3% on a GAAP basis and 4% on a cash basis. With that positive backdrop, I'll turn it to Sean to discuss our operating performance more fully. Thanks, Sean. As shown on Slide 14, these strong operating trends are also translating into outperformance for our 6 development projects currently in lease-up with lease rates up $180 per unit and with projected yields up 30 basis points to 6%, driving further value and earnings. Turning to Slide 15. Our total current development portfolio is poised to deliver meaningful incremental NOI and NAV growth over the coming quarters. Specifically, these projects are projected to generate $145 million of NOI upon stabilization, of which only $26 million is in place today on an annualized basis. These communities are slated to generate $1.2 billion of net value above our costs or close to $9 per share of NAV and meaningful earnings growth. As further highlighted on Slide 16, our industry-leading development platform has created significant value throughout various cycles with consistently strong spreads between development yields and market cap rates, which today sits at a spread of roughly 210 basis points. As we look forward over the coming years, our existing development rights pipeline totals $3 billion of potential projects. Lining us up well for a strong pace of continued profitable development. Turning to Slide 17. Our 4 new expansion markets in addition to our continued growth in Southeast Florida and Denver provide us with meaningful additional growth opportunities as well as the ability to optimize our overall portfolio over time. This slide provides the high-level framework we utilize to evaluate markets and that drive portfolio allocation decisions across our existing markets and our expansion markets. At the top of the list, our focus remains on being a best-in-class developer and operator in markets that over-indexed to knowledge-based employment, which we expect to experience outsized job and wage growth. We also continue to believe that markets with a high cost of home ownership, create an attractive rent versus own backdrop for our product offering. While our expansion markets generally have lower home prices than our existing markets, the rise in home prices, particularly in certain submarkets in these areas create similar positive dynamics for future rental growth. We remain closely attuned to the regulatory environment in each of our markets with local land use restrictions, creating certain favorable barriers to new supply in our existing markets, providing opportunities for our development teams to leverage our long-standing relationships to unlock development opportunities. These coastal markets have, however, seen an increase in landlord tenant regulations, and our expansion into new markets is partially driven by our desire to diversify our regulatory exposure. And the fourth factor highlighted here, public infrastructure and cultural amenities is our proxy for the overall quality of life that large knowledge-based employers and our type of customers will continue to seek out. This thematic framework is, in turn, supported by our proprietary market research, which shapes our market and submarket capital allocation decisions as we drive long-term value. Slide 18 highlights the characteristics supporting growth in our recently announced expansion markets and what we believe positions these markets well in the long term. As we enter these markets, our focus is on creating long-term value by exporting our development and operational acumen as well as our culture to an expanded set of opportunities. And to wrap up, we believe that we are well positioned to outperform as we head into 2022, a favorable macro backdrop, including continued job and wage growth, declining affordability of for-sale housing, a full of return to offices, particularly benefiting the one-third of our portfolio in urban environments and a relatively stable supply forecast in overall AVB markets should provide a strong tailwind. Our embedded growth in of lease along with the benefit of concessions and bad debt normalizing over time should be key drivers of revenue next year. Our operating initiatives are on track to deliver significant margin expansion and serve as one of our drivers of earnings growth over the coming 2 to 3 years. Our development platform is also poised to deliver meaningful value and earnings growth with a development rights pipeline of $3 billion and with development yields substantially above stabilized cap rates and our cost of capital. Finally, our expansion markets provide a broader set of opportunities to leverage our platform for growth. We're excited for the growth opportunities ahead of us. And with that, I'll turn it to the operator to open the line for questions. Our approach is similar, Rich. And you've seen that with our ramp of activity over the last 6 months, we definitely see it as a differentiator for us, definitely see it as a driver of alpha. Matt can maybe talk some more about our pipeline of activity but our track record and our development franchises in our existing markets, we have full confidence we'll be able to continue to unlock value. And now we have the expanded set of opportunities in the growth markets widen our total opportunity set. Matt, do you want to talk some more on the development pipeline? Yes, Brad, good question. I mean, it is correct that we have seen a more modest seasonal adjustment, and we typically would experience historically. If you go back 2 or 3 years kind of pre-pandemic and kind of look at where September rents are relative to the peak rent during the summer in the various regions, which each one peaks at a slightly different time, but just call it the middle of the summer and kind of where it comes down to September relative to this year. Historically, we see about a 2.5% decline from peak to September averages. This year, it's only about 90 basis points in terms of what we've seen in terms of that softness in asking rents, which ultimately impacts move-in rents. So it's about one-thirds of what's normal. And it's pretty widespread across our markets as it relates to the seasonality being less than historical averages. It's hard to speak to the portfolio of our peers, specifically what may be impacting them. But certainly, as we look at our portfolio, we feel good about the fact that the rate of decline has been far less than historical norms. So we'll see how it plays out as we get through the end of the year. It could be just timing differences among the different companies. And it's really a submarket-by-submarket issue that you have to look at. So it's hard to decide for the others in terms of what their real conclusion is. Yes. I mean there's a number of different factors kind of driving the timing from quarter-to-quarter, which is a pretty kind of detailed road map. Why don't I ask Jason to follow up with you on that 1 offline as opposed to getting into the. I mean a lot of it is timing of different projects and when they hit what we expect turnover to be and various things like that to sort of come through leasing activity, the impact on bonus. There's a lot of different things that sort of drive that number in terms of the quarter-to-quarter cadence."

Following the remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, April, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tim Naughton, Chairman and CEO of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks. Tim?\nTim Naughton: Yes. Thanks, Jason and welcome to our Q2 call. With me today are Ben Schall, Kevin O'Shea, Matt Birenbaum, and Sean Breslin. For our prepared comments today, I'll start by providing some high-level comments on apartment marketing conditions and how the current operating and capital environment is shaping our actions, including our recent decision to enter new markets in North Carolina and Texas. Ben will provide a summary of second quarter results, including a detailed road map of results on a year-over-year and a sequential quarter basis. Sean will then elaborate on operating trends in the portfolio, where we've seen a robust recovery in fundamentals and performance since the first of the year. Matt will review performance in our development portfolio, including lease-up performance and an overview of our first Kanso community located in Rockville, Maryland, where we completed construction this past quarter. Kevin will then provide an overview of our outlook for Q3 and the full year. And lastly, Ben will provide some summary comments on how AVB is well positioned to deliver earnings and NAV growth as we look forward. Before turning to the deck, I thought I'd provide some perspective on what we're seeing in the markets and how it's shaping our actions in terms of operations and capital allocation. Since the first of the year, the recovery in the apartment market conditions has been dramatic. Effective move-in rents have fully recovered from the trough, up almost 20% over the last two quarters alone. And asking rents grew even faster, up over 20% since the beginning of the year and now stand at 8% above pre-pandemic peak. Concessions which were significantly elevated last year have fallen back to a modest level, closer to what we experienced pre-pandemic. As you might guess the speed and steepness of the recovery has been driven by very strong rental demand. In fact, Q2 traffic was up over 40% from last year. It continues to outpace last year despite very low levels of availability. The combination of strong traffic and low inventory propelled rental rates through Q2 and that has continued through July. While all regions and submarkets are improving and most are back to or near pre-pandemic levels, there's still a fair bit of variability across the portfolio. Specifically suburban continues to outperform urban, Class A is outperforming Class B and regionally Southern California and our expansion markets of Southeast Florida and Denver outperforming the portfolio average, while the Bay Area continues to lag the average. In addition to strong apartment markets, the capital markets are also extremely healthy and constructive for apartment investment. The transaction debt and equity markets are all wide open and are supporting strong growth in asset values, as we've seen cap rates fall below 4% across most markets and submarkets over the last few quarters. Based on the strong market sentiment, we expect capital flows to remain healthy over the foreseeable future. With this operating and capital backdrop, we have shifted to offense and have increased our planned investment activity for the year by almost $1 billion, between new development starts and acquisitions. In addition in our release, we announced our intent to enter the Raleigh and Charlotte markets in North Carolina, as well as Austin and [Technical Difficulty] markets in Texas. As we discussed over the last two to three years, we've been evaluating expansion into markets that we believe will disproportionately benefit from the growth in the knowledge economy and domestic migration, particularly in those markets that figure to see some migration from our existing legacy markets. We'll have more to share with you about our growth plans in these markets over the next couple of quarters. And lastly, as we mentioned last quarter, after completing a comprehensive midyear re-forecast, we are now providing full year outlook in addition to quarterly guidance. While risk remains in our outlook including the impact of the virus and the Delta variant, the exact timing of eventual phaseout of eviction moratoria across our markets and the receipt of any rent relief payments from state and local governments we believe we have enough clarity to provide a meaningful perspective with respect to our operating performance for the rest of the year. With that, now let me turn it over to Ben, who will discuss Q2 results. \nBen Schall: Thank you, Tim. Slide four highlights our Q2 results and activity. And while we meaningfully exceeded our guidance for Q2 with core FFO of $1.98 versus guidance at the midpoint of $1.90 per share, our year-over-year core FFO figures were down 11.2% for the quarter and 14.8% year-to-date, reflecting the disruption that we've seen in our business over the last 12 months. Notably and reflecting the strong recovery that Tim emphasized, rental revenue increased on a sequential basis turning positive for the first time since March of 2020 with a 90 basis point increase on a GAAP basis and 170 basis points on a cash basis from Q1 to Q2. As Sean will delve into in more detail, rental rates improved during each month of the quarter with continued growth in July. Our development platform also continues to create meaningful shareholder value. We completed $385 million of development in the quarter and close to $1 billion through the first half of 2021. These developments are primarily suburban and are benefiting from the renter demand and increasing rents we're experiencing across our suburban communities. For our completions in the second quarter, the initial projected stabilized yield is 6.4% providing roughly 250 basis points of spread to the sub-4% stabilized cap rates we're seeing in the asset sale market today. These completed projects along with others that are in lease-up also provide a meaningful incremental boost to earnings growth as Matt will discuss in more detail. We also started $580 million of new developments in Q2 and are on track to meet our target of $1.2 billion of new starts in 2021, which we increased last quarter from our initial target of $750 million of new starts. During the quarter we raised $540 million of capital through dispositions at an average cost of capital of 3.7%. By match funding our development activity, primarily with these disposition proceeds, we in turn are able to reduce the capital cost risk associated with the earnings and NAV accretion as we execute on our development pipeline over the coming years. Slide five breaks down the components of our rental revenue change on a year-over-year basis with lower lease rates over the last 12 months and the amortization of concessions being the largest drivers of the decline. As it relates to concessions, at the end of Q2, we had a total of $29 million of previously granted concessions still to be amortized in our same-store pool over the coming quarters. However, concession usage has declined by roughly 85% since Q4 2020 from $1,900 per move-in to just above $300 in July. Slide six provides the factors leading to our increase in rental revenue from Q1 to Q2 with a turn to the positive being driven by higher occupancy and an improvement in uncollectible lease revenue. At a portfolio level, uncollectible lease revenue remains elevated with bad debt at roughly 3% versus a more normalized 50 to 60 basis points with the expectation that we'll continue to see elevated bad debt levels until eviction moratoria are behind us. Before turning it over to Sean for further context on our operating performance, slide seven illustrates our strong momentum in the form of like-term effective rent change, which turned positive in June and now stands at 5% in July. With that, I'll turn it to Sean. \nSean Breslin: All right. Thanks Ben. I thought I'd share a few slides on portfolio rent trends both overall and across different markets and submarkets. Overall, we've seen a meaningful acceleration in the positive rent trends we spoke about during our Q1 call. On slide eight, you can see that our average move-in rent value has grown by roughly 18% since the beginning of the year including a 13% increase since just April and is now consistent with the peak rent levels we achieved in mid-2019. Moving to slide nine, improved performance has been broad-based with every region experiencing a material increase in average move-in rent over the past seven months. If you look at our July move-in specifically, rents are now equal to or greater than the 2019 peak in every region except Northern California, which remains roughly 11% below peak. The timeline for a full recovery in Northern California will in part be based on when major tech employers call people back to work. The hybrid work policies adopted by major employers will have will certainly have some impact on where tech workers want to live. Silicon Valley will very likely remain one of the world's leading innovation centers for years to come. Turning to slide 10 to address suburban and urban performance trends, the average July move-in rent for our suburban portfolio was roughly 3% above the peak we achieved in 2019. In our urban portfolio while demand has returned in a meaningful way, the average rent in these submarkets fell the most throughout 2020 and is still down about 7.5% from peak 2019 rents. As it relates to the urban portfolio, we expect performance to continue to improve as people are called back to the office, urban universities resume on-campus learning, and the quality of the environment starts to look and feel more like pre-pandemic conditions. Turning to slide 11. Our average asking rent which is representative of the published rent for available inventory has increased 24% since the beginning of the year and is currently about 8% above the mid-2019 peak. Our suburban submarkets which represent about two-thirds of portfolio revenue are leading the recovery. The average asking rent in our urban submarkets is basically back to the 2019 peak and as I mentioned previously is expected to continue to grow as those environments more fully reopen over the next few months. And moving to slide 12, this chart depicts the trajectory and spread between our average asking and move-in rents. As I mentioned a few slides ago, the average portfolio movement rent has increased roughly 18% this year, but trails the increase in average asking rent which is up 24%. The average dollar spread between the two which averaged 12% for the month of July is wider than the 4% to 5% we have seen historically and is representative of the capacity available to grow move-in rents over the next couple of quarters. Additionally, if we see a seasonal adjustment in asking rents the last few months of the year something we have not yet experienced this year there's plenty of room for asking rents to soften a bit and still grow move-in rents. With that summary, I'll turn it to Matt to address development and portfolio trading activity. Matt?\nMatt Birenbaum: All right. Great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to our current lease-up communities, you can see on slide 13 the same positive trends that we're seeing in the stabilized portfolio. We're achieving rents $155 above initial underwriting on the seven communities that are currently in lease-up which is lifting the stabilized yield on those investments to 6.1% generating substantial value creation relative to current cap rates which are at or below 4% across our footprint. This is really a remarkable turnaround in our development portfolio which just a few quarters ago had rents and yields modestly below initial underwriting and continues to demonstrate our long track record of delivering outsized risk-adjusted returns from our development and construction capabilities. One development that we wanted to highlight this quarter is shown on slide 14 which is the first completion of our latest brand Kanso located at the Twinbrook Metro station in Rockville, Maryland. Kanso was born out of customer insight research, which was telling us that there's a large underserved segment of residents that are looking for a new high-quality apartment in a transit-served or infill location, but without all the extra bells and whistles provided in typical Class A new construction. By focusing our investment on the apartment home itself and removing common area amenities that these customers do not value like pools, fitness centers and lounges, we are able to save on both upfront capital and ongoing operating and CapEx costs which in turn allow us to provide a meaningful discount on the rent as compared to a fully programmed Avalon offering at the same location. Kanso leverages technology to provide a primarily self-service experience for residents and prospects with very limited on-site staffing supported by our centralized call center and a design with low maintenance needs to deliver on the brand promise to live simply without sacrifice. We're excited the market has embraced the concept with Kanso Twinbrook leasing up successfully at a strong pace at rents above pro forma and look-forward to growing this new brand via additional development opportunity in the future. Turning to slide 15 we continue to see tremendous demand in the asset sales market and completed six wholly-owned dispositions in the second quarter at a weighted average cap rate of 3.7%. The assets sold were predominantly in the Northeast region with more than 60% of the proceeds coming out of the Greater New York area and were older than average for our portfolio with an average age of 25 years, allowing us to continue to further our portfolio allocation goals to reduce exposure to some of our legacy markets while also minimizing our CapEx profile. And by redeploying this capital into new development starts of $580 million this quarter at projected yield of 5.7% we're match funding new growth at highly accretive margins. And with that I'll turn it over to Kevin to go over our earnings guidance for the year. \nKevin O'Shea: Great. Thanks, Matt. On slide 16 we provide our financial and operating outlook for the third quarter and for full year 2021. For the third quarter using the midpoint of our guidance ranges, we expect core FFO per share of $1.96. On a sequential basis our third quarter estimate reflects a sequential decline in core FFO of $0.02 per share from the second quarter. This sequential decrease in core FFO per share is driven primarily by an increase of $0.05 per share in same-store residential revenue and a $0.03 per share increase in lease-up NOI offset by a seasonally driven increase in same-store residential operating expenses of $0.06 per share and a $0.03 per share decrease in community NOI as a result of recent disposition activity. On a year-over-year basis for our same-store portfolio using the midpoint of our ranges we expect NOI to decrease by 3% for the third quarter driven by an 80 basis point reduction in same-store residential rental revenue and a 3.5% increase in same-store residential operating expenses. For the fourth quarter our full year earnings guidance implies core FFO per share of $2.13, which would represent a $0.17 or 8.7% sequential increase from the third quarter estimate. This expected sequential increase in earnings in the fourth quarter is primarily driven by a continued increase in same-store residential rental revenue by a seasonally expected decline in same-store residential operating expenses and by further NOI growth in our lease-up portfolio. For our full year 2021 guidance, we expect core FFO per share of $8.02 at the midpoint of our range. And for our same-store residential portfolio, again using the mid-point ranges and looking at growth on a year-over-year basis, we expect NOI to decrease by 6.2% for full year 2021, driven by a 3.2% decrease in revenues and a 3.3% increase in operating expenses. Turning to our updated investment and capital plan, the combination of a strong recovery in revenue and earnings growth and attractive access to the capital markets has prompted us to pivot to offense and pursue increased development and acquisition activity as reflected in our current investment and capital plan on slide 17. For development, we now anticipate starting $1.2 billion in new projects this year, up from our original plan of $750 million, and we expect NOI for new development communities undergoing lease-up to be about $50 million this year at the midpoint an increase of $5 million from our original outlook. For capital activity, we now anticipate a busier year with total capital uses for development, redevelopment, acquisitions and debt repayments of $1.8 billion in 2021. This represents an increase of nearly $1 billion from our original outlook and is driven by increased acquisition activity for the year and an expected early repayment later this year of $450 million in unsecured debt that is scheduled to mature in September 2022. In terms of capital sourcing, our current plan contemplates meeting our capital needs through a combination of unsecured debt issuance and additional asset sales, although, the sources we ultimately tap are subject to change based on changes in capital market conditions or our actual capital uses. Turning now to slide 18 and our continuing efforts in the area of corporate responsibility or ESG, we are pleased to report that we recently released our 10th Annual Corporate Responsibility or ESG Report reflecting our long-standing commitment to this part of our business. As highlighted in the report, we see measurable progress on our science-based emission reduction targets primarily due to our investments in on-site solar generation and efforts to improve building efficiency. We're also proud of our commitments to the communities in which we do business. These funding to our non-profit partners to serve those in need during the pandemic. We continued our important national partnership with the American Red Cross focused on disaster preparedness and response and we initiated a new partnership with the National Urban League designed to engage with them on our diversity and inclusion efforts and provide support to their mission. All these efforts continue to be recognized externally with the CDP rating us in the A band and the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark or GRESB rating us number one in the multi-family sector both globally and in the United States. In addition, NAREIT awarded us their highest honor of sustainability performance. Further, our associates remain highly engaged as reflected in our engagement scores that are in the top quartile on this important metric. And finally, our customers weighed in and we are pleased to be number one in online customer reputation. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ben for his concluding remarks.\nBen Schall : Thanks Kevin. Turning to our key takeaways on slide 19, we're very encouraged by the continued improvement in our operating fundamentals and believe our portfolio is well positioned for additional growth, as reflected in the growth assumptions incorporated into our second half guidance. Near-term trends in our suburban portfolio continue to look very strong, and we are hopeful that our urban communities, which have been lagging the rest of the portfolio should benefit over the coming months with a fuller return to offices and universities. As Tim mentioned at the start, we also expect that our Class A communities will continue to outperform, as higher income residents and prospects benefit from the economic recovery and seek out high-quality living environments. As discussed, our development acumen and pipeline continue to be a differentiator for us, our projects in lease-up primarily in the suburbs are benefiting from strong renter demand and we've been able to quickly scale up our development activity at attractive yields relative to stabilized cap rates. As we look forward, we expect the breadth of our development expertise will allow us to shift capital to growing markets and evolve our product offering to meet the needs of our targeted customer segments. We also see our operating platform and our investments in innovation as a differentiator. In addition to the expense reductions and the margin opportunities we discussed last quarter, our technology-forward approach positions us to be able to create de novo offerings such as Kanso bringing together the best of our operating, innovation, brand and development expertise as we evolve our offerings and create a better way to live. As we head forward, we're excited about our new growth in Raleigh-Durham, Charlotte, Dallas and Austin in addition to our continued growth in Southeast Florida and Denver bringing us to a total of six expansion markets. We're actively negotiating on opportunities in these new expansion markets and expect to grow through acquisitions, our own development and through the funding of other developers where we own the asset upon stabilization similar to the growth strategies we've successfully utilized to grow our presence in Southeast Florida and Denver. This multi-pronged approach also allows us to invest capital over different time horizons with acquisitions of existing communities being naturally the most immediate and our own development being medium term in duration. We look forward to sharing our long-term goals and portfolio allocation objectives for these markets with investors over the coming. Finally, thank you to the entire AvalonBay organization for their commitment and leadership on ESG, where our recently issued 10th Annual Responsibility Report highlighted our continued ESG leadership position across the wider REIT sector. And with that we'll open it up for questions. [Indiscernible] [24:23].\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll hear from Nick Joseph of Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. I appreciate the comments on the new markets. How large do you expect each market to be once you get to scale, so either from a unit perspective or as a percentage of total NOI?\nBen Schall: Hey, Nick, this is Ben. I'll take that one. We're not putting out a specific target at this point. As I mentioned, it's part of what we'll discuss with investors over the coming quarters and also how that ties into our overall portfolio allocation approach. But we do see this announcement as a meaningful one. We are actively engaged with specific opportunities currently on both the acquisition side and on the development side. We've been -- just for some context, we've been growing in Southeast Florida and Denver where we've set a target of 5% for each market as a goal for our overall allocation. And our rough user the Texas and North Carolina have the potential for a similar type of allocation. Overall, we're excited for opening up these new growth opportunities in these new four markets and leveraging our skills across investments development and operations over the coming years.\nMichael Bilerman: Hey, Ben, it's Michael Bilerman speaking. It sounds like you've been pretty active in these markets sourcing is -- can you just sort of provide maybe just how much is under contract or in advanced stage? I don't know if it's like $1 billion already that you've sort of almost circled in terms of opportunities whether they be acquisitions or development, just to give us a sense of how quickly you've been able to work your way into these markets?\nMatt Birenbaum: Hey, Michael, it's Matt. I can speak to that one a little bit. I mean things are fluid until they close. So I don't want to get too specific, but yes we do have -- we're -- we do have active deals working in three of those four markets that Ben mentioned. Those three deals together probably add up to maybe half of what you're saying maybe it's $500 million not $1 billion yet at this point. But we're continuing to look for more as well. And certainly, we expect some of that activity to close here in the third quarter.\nMichael Bilerman: And then just finally, I know a couple of you have talked about the growth opportunities in those markets in terms of people coming from your existing legacy markets as well as just job growth in those markets. And so how should we think about sort of the initial funding of these? Is this going to be a dilutive exercise or you sell assets or raise equity or other forms of financing that you'll benefit from the growth going forward? Or do you think you can do this on a sort of non-dilutive basis maybe even accretive as you go forward?\nKevin O'Shea: Hey, Michael, this is Kevin. I think in terms of our pacing into these new markets, I think number one it's likely to be measured as Matt alluded to and similar to what you've seen in terms of the rollout in some of our other markets maybe a little bit more a little bit less. Obviously we'd like to be -- to make some progress on that front. But then relatedly the capital impact in terms of how we [Technical Difficulty] it's probably also likely to be measured. And so we've got -- unlike some others because we are so active in development we have that as a tool in our toolkit either to venture with partners or to eventually start doing development on our own. And to the extent we engage in those new markets in that way that obviously paces out the capital deployment and also maps it against investments that are generally pretty darn accretive to our cost of capital. So our intention would not be to do so in any dilutive way. From the standpoint of acquisitions as you know from what we've done so far, we've been leaning pretty heavily into our gains capacity by selling assets in non-core markets or non-core submarkets in our legacy footprint and then putting them into Southeast Florida and Denver and I think we'll likely continue to do that. And that's something that we think actually is marginally accretive because we're kind of moving. And as you can see from the assets that we're selling now in sub four cap rates into asset into markets with maybe similar cap rates, but hopefully a better growth profile. So I think what you've seen us do in the past is probably a good indication of what we might do in the future. And probably from a funding point of view we're willing to do so on accretive basis.\nMichael Bilerman: Got it. Thanks for that color.\nOperator: And next we'll hear from Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley.\nRich Hill: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I wanted to maybe just build off of what Michael just asked. Is there any -- do you see any opportunity for you to maybe do a bigger acquisition of our private apartment REIT in these -- or private apartment owner in these markets or maybe even a public apartment REIT? I'm obviously not trying to put anyone in play. But it seems like there's -- would might be some interesting synergies both on a G&A basis and a portfolio basis if you're really looking to make a move into these markets. Curious, if you've thought about that. And if so, what might make sense and what might not make sense about it? \nTim Naughton: Rich, this is Tim. Yes M&A is always a possibility. It's not our main strategy in terms of entering these markets. I mean I guess sort to step back we're not necessarily looking to -- as Kevin mentioned, we're looking to sort of pace our way into these markets. We're making these decisions because we see these markets as having great fundamentals over a long period of time. They have certain structural advantages. They're going to make them appealing markets over the next yes 20, 30, 40 years much like our legacy markets have been over the last 20, 30 years. So the need either through M&A or to do a highly disproportionate level of transaction activity in these markets is not what is driving us motivate and to also recognize we're learning as we get into these markets. And so, there is obviously a big risk to either do an M&A or a high level of volume in the first year or two as you start to gain market intelligence in the markets which you do have business. So very much a strategy as Kevin mentioned that we deployed -- employed at in Southeast Florida and Denver and how we look to deploy capital here as well. \nRich Hill: Very fair. I appreciate that response. I wanted to maybe come back to this concept of base effect versus earnings power for the apartment REITs. Obvious -- from our perspective the recovery is happening sooner and faster than we were anticipating and I think we were pretty constructive over the past nine months or so. But I do -- I am curious as you speak to your tenants and you think about supply versus demand, it just strikes me that occupancy is at a really healthy level. There's a tremendous amount of demand coming back. And you mentioned that all of your markets I think except Northern California were sort of back to 2019 levels. How much do you think you can push rents in this market and -- or this sort of market? And are we facing a relatively elastic demand profile, just given a tremendous amount of demand that's coming from Gen Zs and Gen Ys relative to a limited supply of housing? How do you think about that? \nSean Breslin: Yes. Rich this is Sean. I'll take a first shot at that and then anybody else could jump in. In terms of the kind of demand profile and how it plays out how long it could run that's a function of a lot of different variables that would take us quite a while to get through. But still on the demand side things have been quite robust as you noted. The trajectory of the recovery whether you look at asking rents you look at move-in values you look at occupancy all of them quite healthy even by historical standards in terms of coming out of a downturn, in terms of the speed of the recovery and the order of magnitude both have probably been a little bit surprising for everyone. When we look at where we're clearing the market today on rents we kind of put that slide in the deck. It shows where asking rents are relative to move-in values. In the near term I guess what I would say is that, demand has been quite healthy. We have not seen signs of weakening at this point whatsoever and have seen very healthy week-by-week growth in both those move-in values and asking rents. People have asked about the seasonal effect has demand been pulled forward etcetera, etcetera. We don't see signs of that yet. But what we do feel good about is that spread between move-in rents and asking rents being at 12% even if there's a little bit of seasonality that comes upon us in the fourth quarter or the variant creates some disruption and delays we're starting to see a little bit of that. There's still plenty of room in the short run to see move-in rents continue to grow and maintain the recovery. In the longer term, it's a broader question around just overall housing demand and supply which is a function of what happens with the job and income growth and various other factors associated with the demand side. And then on the supply side just overall housing production and multifamily housing production specifically. And at least on the supply side, our markets we feel pretty good about particularly for legacy markets the outlook for supply coming down over the next year or two potentially by a pretty decent amount. We'll be able to refresh our numbers by the end of this year. But we could be seeing a double-digit percentage decline across the footprint and supply as we move into 2022. It would certainly further kind of support healthy demand and rental rate growth as we move through 2022. So that's kind of the near-term and the kind of maybe medium-term outlook. And then yes, Tim or other may want to jump in in terms of the longer-term outlook. \nTim Naughton: Yes. Well maybe just tag on to what Sean was saying. Yes, Sean mentioned the supply outlook. I do think there's a combination of maybe some onetime items that are fueling demand as well as maybe some structural things that have been accelerated obviously by the pandemic. I mean you do have unprecedented federal stimulus and excess savings that have been created during this downturn that maybe help propelling some household demand at the margin. A lot of it is being fueled by the 25 to 29 cohort. And then in addition, we believe we've had a housing shortage that's been building over the last decade. And you sort of couple that with the federal stimulus and maybe a broader de-densifying of our population where you may have had roommates now get that one household and now they're two households as people want to have their own unit. We think that's probably stimulating some demand. But the other thing I think that is -- maybe is structural is just the nature of this recovery is all people talked about as being K-shaped. And that's very much our view where our renters and sensors are really kind of on the upper part of that K and are really experiencing a V-shaped recovery. And I think from our perspective, it feels like a V-shaped recovery, a very steep recovery. There are parts of the population that obviously are being left behind and not participating as much just given that they're not -- they may not -- they maybe service-oriented jobs as opposed to technology or financial services or the types of industries we tend to over index too. So, I think that maybe more structural in nature and could help propel some household formation, particularly kind of within our target segments.\nRich Hill: Thanks, guys. That\u2019s helpful. I may have some follow-up questions offline, but I\u2019ll jump back in the queue.\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Rich Hightower of Evercore.\nRich Hightower: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. I just want to go back to the movement into the four expansion markets mentioned on this earnings cycle. And maybe help us understand, obviously a lot of your peers have been in some of these markets for a long time, and so might have had a view on the different positive attributes, some of which I think were mentioned on this call. But maybe help us understand, what changed directly due to COVID in terms of your view of these markets if it's migration patterns and so forth versus what you sort of knew about these markets prior to COVID that's led to the decision to expand there?\nTim Naughton: Yeah. Rich, I would say from my perspective, COVID's not really changing our view of the markets. These markets are really formed by how we think they're going to perform over the next 20 to 30 years. Obviously, some of these Sunbelt markets have benefited during COVID as you've seen some migration from some of our legacy markets. Those markets that maybe -- some of it maybe transitory, some of it maybe permanent, but that trend was already occurring at some level in terms of domestic migration. And what we saw in all of these markets, what we saw in Southeast Florida and Denver, there's only so many expansion markets you could take on at one time. Obviously, it's a pretty big deal for us to move into Southeast Florida and Denver three years ago or so and add those to our footprint. And we've seen some success there and that's -- has probably made us more confident about how we can enter in some of these other markets as well. So, I would say, probably if COVID hadn't happened, we might have entered these markets sooner in some ways. Obviously the events over the last 16 months have recentered our focus on a lot of other priorities. But given where we are right now, we felt like we're in a position to continue to grow and whether it's through looking at new segments, whether it's looking through mixed use as we've talked about in the past or potential broader geography we're looking at and willing to pursue all of those.\nRich Hightower: Okay. That's helpful color, Tim. And then, I want to go back to a comment, I guess from the last earnings call where Matt, you helpfully broke down the development costs across hard costs, soft costs, labor, land and so forth. And I guess talking about lumber price inflation if so 90 days ago, and you actually explained that that's not really what people should be focused on. But labor expense could sort of drive the equation as we think about ultimate yield on development. And so, help us understand what movements are you seeing in labor costs in that context right now? And where do you expect that to be, let's say, over the next 12 to 24 months?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Sure Rich. We're certainly seeing -- it's definitely good to see the top ridiculous air come out of the lumber market a little bit. But you're right as we talked about really the last couple of quarters, hard cost inflation in general is driven primarily by labor and secondarily by kind of the commodities costs. And while lumber has come down, steel is up, dry wells up, some of the other things that we buy a lot of are up. And certainly there is pressure. It's hard for us. We don't have a direct line of sight into what our subcontractors are paying their workers. But we see it in the bids we're getting and we are buying a lot of activity right now. And what I would say is, what we're seeing is that the development starts that we started this quarter -- last quarter it was in the release that we're getting ready to start this quarter, probably our total capital costs are up 5% to 10% from where we thought those deals would have priced at the end of the year. So -- and that in turn has pushed our yields down a bit. I think our development yield on the $1.2 billion that we expect to start this year is about 5.7%. And a year ago or late last year, maybe that was closer to a 6%. So we have seen some downward pressure in yields. And again, obviously, as we talked about before cap rates are down that much more. So if anything the margins are just as strong and we're seeing on the transaction side that every month new records are being broken in terms of where assets are trading. So that's giving us and others confidence to continue building taking that 5% to 10% increase in our basis because the transaction market is giving it back to us and them some. And that's still on NOIs which are \u2013 we're starting to see and that's starting to work its way into our underwriting the rent lift that we were talking about. But I would say, our rental underwriting on development is still pretty conservative. So there's probably still a little bit of numerator lift to come there as well.\nRich Hightower: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Nick Yulico of Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: Hi, everyone. I guess a question on development. I was wondering in terms of the incremental development starts that you announced and even just thinking about how you're thinking about development going forward. How much is that going to be weighed towards suburban projects? I know that is a lot of the current pipeline. A little perspective there would be great?\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure. This is Matt. I'm just looking at the list now. So of the \u2013 looks like one, two, three, we got 10 development starts planned this year and one of them is urban two of them are urban. One is kind of a residential urban neighborhood in Boston and Brighton. It's a relatively small wood frame deal and the deal we just started this quarter in Merrick Park which is in Miami, but really in Coral Gables not Downtown Miami. Those are the only two that are urban. So it's still predominantly 70%, 80% suburban. And as I look at what we're likely to start next year, it's more of the same. That's where we're finding the development economics are working better. And there's still more supply coming in urban submarkets relative to suburban submarkets. Again, when you look out maybe two, three, four, years from now that equation could well change and we're mindful of that as we look at the land market and where that might be in the future. But certainly over the next year or two the starts are going to continue to be the vast majority suburban.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Great. And then just one other question is in terms of \u2013 we just look at let's say Metro New York for \u2013 Metro New York, New Jersey as your region for example and I know you don't give the development rights page anymore, but if you go back to last year that is where the bulk of your development rights are. And maybe you could just give us a feel for \u2013 because it is \u2013 it's over $2 billion that you listed as capital cost for that metro for those development rights the feel for suburban versus urban. And my other question was in terms of \u2013 in the supplemental you list the average rents right now for New York City and suburban and they're shockingly almost the same. And so I'm just wondering, if there's a concession impact there or something we should think about or have suburban rents really almost now gone to the point of New York City rents in your portfolio?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yeah. I mean, I can speak to the first part and Sean may want to speak to the second part a little bit. So as I mentioned, we're \u2013 today, we have about $3.1 billion in development rights. It looks like about 25% of that is Metro New York. So compared to when we used to have the schedule it has come down quite a bit or we've been adding more in other regions. And of that so maybe $800 million $900 million of it is in Metro New York. And of that at least two-thirds of it is in the suburbs. I think we have one urban development right on the coast in Jersey, but everything else is \u2013 a lot of that is Inland New Jersey, Long Island type of locations. In terms of the existing rents in the portfolio a very different kind of unit. I mean, our average unit size in the suburbs is \u2013 I don't know the number, but it's probably over 1,000 square feet. So the whole dollar rents may look the same but the rents per foot look pretty different. And frankly that's where we're seeing a lot of success. So we're trying to add more rental townhomes for example in New Jersey or empty nester-targeted product on Long Island. So the unit sizes and the target customers are quite different.\nSean Breslin: And Nick just in terms of additional context as we look out over our development pipeline over the next couple of years, we took our overall starts for this year up to $1.2 billion. We think over the next couple of years in that $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion type of range is achievable plus the opportunity for additional development starts in our expansion markets as we get moving heavier in that direction.\nNick Yulico: Appreciate it. Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Brad Heffern of RBC. \nBrad Heffern: Yeah. Hey, everyone. On the expansion markets, can you talk about the path towards getting to that sort of 5% number that you called out? Because obviously Southeast Florida, I think maybe 1.5%, Denver is 1%. So is that like a 10-year process that's largely development at this point? Or sort of what's the time scale?\nMatt Birenbaum: Brad, it's Matt. So I think yeah, as you're talking about Southeast Florida and Denver, I think you're probably looking at our same-store portfolio. So our current weighting is kind of by total revenue or by investment or by units is actually a little higher than those numbers, but it's not. I'd say, we're roughly halfway there. We're maybe 2%, 2.5% where we're trying to get to 5% over some period of time. So it's a combination of all of that. I mean, clearly we can move the needle more quickly with acquisitions. And so we are looking to do that. And we will \u2013 as we did in Denver Florida and in many cases in those instances we're actually trading. So we're taking dispositions from our legacy markets and redeploying that capital there. Development takes longer. So, we're \u2013 ultimately, it's going to be all of the above. It's going to be acquisitions. It's going to be development. It's going to be funding other developers. Each of those three activities is on a little bit of a different timeframe which does give us a little bit of diversification in terms of kind of the timing and the relative trade. So we kind of like that. But we certainly are staffing up in these regions. We're looking at putting people on the ground. And as we make those commitments certainly, we're expecting to be able to move at a reasonable pace. But yeah, I mean, I wouldn't expect either -- any of them to get to 5% or more of our portfolio within two or three years. It's going to probably take longer than that.\nBrad Heffern: Yeah. Okay, got it. And then, maybe for Kevin, can you talk through the sort of federal relief funds? I know you mentioned in the prepared comments that, bad debt had been kind of consistent at 3% but then, there was that sequential 0.6% benefit on uncollectible lease revenue. So was that relief funds? And just any outlook on kind of what's in the guide for receipts on that.\nKevin O'Shea: Sure Brad. Yes, it's Kevin and Sean may want to jump in here a little bit, so -- to talk about the relief programs. But just to give you a sense of what has happened so far and what is in our numbers. The current relief programs have been somewhat helpful so far, but only marginally or so. Overall, we received $5 million in rent relief payments of which approximately $4 million in rent relief payments was in the first half of the year including $2.5 million in the second quarter. For the back half of the year, we've assumed we received -- we'll receive $4 million. And that includes what we've received in July which is kind of around $1.5 million. And of that $4 million in the back half most of that will be in the third quarter. So that's how we're looking at it. Obviously, we've been involved in working with our residents and applying where we can on our own for much more but it obviously takes time. And it's a process that is inherently uncertain and for which there's not an awful lot of visibility about what we're going to receive and when. So we've been relatively modest in what we assume we will receive going forward from that opportunity.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: John Pawlowski of Green Street\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks. Just a few quick questions for me, curious on the development pipeline moving forward, how big will the Kanso product line, be as a proportion?\nMatt Birenbaum: I wish I knew John. Certainly, we like Kanso. We think that it's got a lot of potential. We don't have a lot of Kanso opportunities in our pipeline right now. Frankly, seeing how it performed helps us understand how to underwrite it, going forward. So -- and they probably will tend to be smaller deals. So one of the things we like about it actually is that it opens up some smaller sites where, it's pretty hard to make the numbers work on 100 unit or 150 unit Avalon when you think about the cost of the amenities and staffing and amortizing that over a relatively few apartments. So, it may -- hopefully, we're going to get a number of new Kanso opportunities into the pipeline. But because they're likely to be smaller, I would expect that it would be a relatively small percentage of the pipeline at least in the next year or two.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. And then, on the operations side the disclosure answers most of my questions. But Sean, could you help me understand kind of total fee income call it, full year 2019? And where we are today, given the divot? And then, when we can get back to kind of a normalized fee income absolute dollar run rate?\nSean Breslin: Yeah. Good question, John. I want to give you some qualitative answers. And then, we can follow-up off-line with detail because there's a fair amount of details associated with that. But for the most part, I would say, at this point in time, we're back to a pretty high percentage of recurring fee income, across most of the footprint with a few exceptions like, in Washington state we can't charge for much of anything, as a result of some -- you may recall some changes in New York State. We had to change some fees from upfront to monthly, that's still working its way through the system. So it's not a simple answer. But I would say that for the most part we're back to sort of what we expected on a stabilized basis with a little bit yet to come. But I can follow-up off-line with a little more detail to help you kind of roadmap it.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, all right. Thanks.\nSean Breslin: Yeah.\nOperator: Rich Anderson of SMBC\nRich Anderson: Thanks. Good afternoon. So with regard to the kind of geographic pie chart and how it's changing, I know you made some comments that COVID really hasn't influenced some of the decisions you've made. But I am curious about kind of a reversion to the mean. It's easy to see that Sunbelt is the winner right now. But when you think long-term, are you equally enthusiastic about your legacy gateway markets as you are in these new markets that you're entering? Do they kind of -- they're all different but have maybe a similar level of upside to them, when you think maybe three, four, five years out?\nTim Naughton: Hey, Rich. Tim and others might want to join. I think, the simple answer is, yes. We've -- and if it wasn't, we should be exiting those markets, right? But we're always -- and we have exited some markets. So it\u2019s not something we're not going to -- we're not going to either reduce our exposure and turn our exposure to certain markets where we think there may be more risk or a little bit less upside or potentially exit a market. We're not prepared to do that today, but we are trying to be intellectually honest in terms of what we see as not the next four or five years of opportunity, but the next 20 or 30 years, as we look at both demand and supply drivers in the business and some of it -- some of the risks that are out there, whether it be regulatory or immigration related that might affect certain markets more than others. So -- and certainly supply. I mean the markets we're talking about are -- they are less supply constrained, as we know, but they are massive job generators at the same time, particularly in some of the businesses and parts of the economy we want to be exposed to. So I would say this is more about diversification and growth, than it is about not liking what we're seeing in our current markets today.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Good. And then, second question, you mentioned the 3% bad debt. What are the assumptions that you have in the -- sort of, the various state and local headwinds, moratorium issues, about those, kind of, going away? Do you -- can you kind of peel off those that are affecting you the most? And what you think is going to happen in terms of time line?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Rich, this is Sean. It's a long answer to that one, based on the various -- moratoria and other things that are out there. What I'd say in characterizing is, that we're in the early stages of seeing the various eviction moratoria or rent caps, et cetera, et cetera, beginning to phase out. But we do think that process, for a number of different reasons, will be sort of a slow burn, if you want to call it that, over the next couple of quarters, as opposed to all of a sudden, it's kind of open game everywhere. And you're already starting to see that in terms of what's happened in various regions, whether it's Washington State, ended June 30, but there's a transitional period for 90 days. California extended through September. Local jurisdictions are prohibited from doing anything subsequent to that until March. Biden's requests obviously on the CDC side of what the government can do. So I think people are trying to find the right way to transition it. And therefore, I think, the impact of the bad debt kind of came back to normal levels, is probably a multi-quarter process to get there, as opposed to flipping a switch and it happens in one or two quarters, just based on the way things will bleed in across, not only at the state level, but at the local level as well. \nRich Anderson: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks everyone. So, you guys had hit on one of my questions with respect to kind of future new starts. It sounds like up to $1.5 billion in the current footprint and maybe some upside from the expansion markets. But just curious, what's the latest thinking on how large you're willing to grow, the total size of the development pipeline today, as I know you've moved that threshold over the years just as a percent of EV. And so, how you're thinking about that, given the various risks and opportunities?\nMatt Birenbaum: Hey, Austin, it's Matt. I guess there's a number of ways to think about it. You can think about it in terms of the size of the development rights pipeline, which typically represents three years of future start activity. You can think about it in terms of the size of development underway. In terms of the latter, we are well below, kind of -- we've talked in the past about having a target range of 10% to 15% of development underway at any given point in time, as a percentage of our total enterprise value. I think we're at 5% or 6%, right now. So if we can find the opportunities, I think, from a balance sheet point of view [Indiscernible]. So, again, as Ben mentioned, we're feeling pretty good about it over the next couple of years at any rate. In terms of the development rights pipeline, if you think even if you took 10% of TEV underway, a TEV of whatever mid-$30-billion-ish, $35 billion maybe going to $40 billion that would be $3.5 billion underway at any given point in time. I would say you probably want to have a development rights pipeline of $6 billion or so -- and $6 million or even $7 million. So we're looking to grow it.\nBen Schall: A couple of things I'd add to Matt's comments. One, obviously, depends on the opportunity set and we hit on our prepared remarks. We look at the -- our spread to where we're developing to market cap rates today and our ability to buy match funding and we think there are some pretty attractive development profits, right, that will drive activity. And then the other part, there's our own development, but then there's also our funding of other developers. And that's a method we've been using and are looking to use more fully in our expansion markets and partially from a time perspective, right, we're able to partner up with developers who have sites that are entitled and ready to go and lets us to get activation slightly sooner than if we were going and pursuing our own development right.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That's all very great color. You mentioned the match funding piece and the attractive spread versus dispositions. Clearly, we saw you use that this quarter with the new starts and level of dispos that you -- that occurred. So I'm just curious historically we have seen you use the forward ATM as well as a funding mechanism when you had kind of good light and sight on future development starts and wondering, given where the stock is and maybe some of the uncertainty that's out there today is that something that you'd look to use to lock in an attractive cost of capital today to fund maybe a potentially growing size of the overall pipeline? \nKevin O'Shea: Hey, Austin, it's Kevin. Yes I mean you asked an interesting question but it's -- unfortunately it's one that's inherently speculative. It sort of as you point out begins with uses. What do we intend to do? What's the return profile on that? And then it comes back to sources. And as you know this could potentially also be a long answer but we have three primary markets. We have unsecured debt. We have asset sales, which lately have been suburban asset sales. And common equity, which is what you're alluding to there. Today, right now, all three of those markets as Tim, alluded to in his opening remarks are attractive. And that's one of the main factors when you think about how we might gather our sources one factor is clearly, pricing. And right now all three are relatively attractive from the standpoint of funding accretive developments. Then you get into the debate about, which one is more attractive and you have a little bit of a debate there. My own view right now of things -- where things stand today is probably based on their own historical pricing metrics, I'd probably rank unsecured debt first, suburban asset sales second and then common equity third. But reason of mine can differ and circumstances matter particularly with regard to the assets you might sell and the usage you might put them to and where we are from a balance sheet point of view. Second factor is obviously, our capacity to increase leverage. And the good news is there -- with revenue and NOI growth growing and with modest leverage right now of 5.3 turns, we do have capacity to increase our leverage somewhat to support investment activity and so that allows us to tap that market if it makes sense. And the third factor is our capacity-absorbed capital gains before we had to make a special distribution. And we tend to like to lean into that capacity quite a bit lately to help buy assets in our expansion markets but also to fund development as we're doing here with that activity. So a lot of choices on the menu for us today. So I don't know that we need to decide anything right now in terms of our capital plan for, what's in front of us for the back half of the year. What we are planning to do and what I alluded to my remarks is tap the unsecured debt markets and the asset sale markets to fund, what's in front of us and sort of -- but if we get more uses beyond that which we have in front of us that's a little bit of how we think about it. And I'd say the good news is, having kind of attractive access to capital and the opportunity to deploy it accretively in development is just a wonderful situation to be in. It means we're kind of legging into a very strong part of the cycle, where we can enhance earnings growth through accretive investment activity. So -- and that's an important differentiator for AvalonBay. \nAustin Wurschmidt: That makes a lot of sense. Appreciate the thorough and thoughtful answer, Kevin.\nOperator: [indiscernible] Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Thanks everyone. Hope everyone\u2019s doing well. I was just looking at your slide deck Page 10. I thought it was pretty interesting in the suburban verse urban kind of communities the move-in rate. Any thoughts on when maybe the urban communities would get above their 2019 levels? And maybe just what's built into guidance for the rest of this year on where those could get to? \nSean Breslin: Yes. Jeff this is Sean. Good question. It's a question I'm not sure that has a completely knowable answer but I can say the factors that would relate to it. I mean the urban environments in terms of, what's dragging at this point in time its places that you might expect. So places that are below the 2019 peak for moving values are like New York City, the district, a little bit in some of the urban submarkets within Northern Virginia and then the urban submarkets in Northern California. And I think all of those are a function of various stages of reopening that they're in. And as the major employers call people back to work what does that look like in terms of when it happens? Is it around Labor Day? Is it thereafter? Is it everyone? Or is it partial? What happens with the university campuses and their housing? And one of the things that we don't know for sure in every case is some of the universities these have been packing in pretty tight. And as Tim referred to, if there's some de-densifying that occurs that should help support local demand outside the university campuses in terms of their dorm housing. And various other factors like that really will influence, what happens in these urban environments and we should have a much better sense of that as we get beyond Labor Day, I would say. I think a number of us expect pretty good demand through Labor Day. What does that look like and how much does that boost asking rents and therefore, lagging behind that would be move-in values. Those would be the factors you'd want to think about in terms of where you get back to -- when you get back to sort of those peak levels of move-in rents. In terms of what's in guidance, we have factored in continued growth across the markets consistent with what we have been seeing. And right now urban has been lagging and we do expect it to continue to lag the suburban environments, but catch up over the next few months is the way I would describe it in sort of general terms.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Super helpful. And then maybe just thinking about your strategy, obviously, kind of a weird lease-up period probably longer and more all at once than probably a lot of other leasing periods. How are you thinking about pushing rate into fall? And then is there anything you might have to adjust as far as your revenue management systems go as we get into next year, because I guess the timing of your leases is going to be changing just maybe they are more in August July than they would normally be?\nSean Breslin: Yeah, good question. A couple of different -- actually a couple of different questions in there. So first on the latter part around lease expirations, lease expirations don't -- the one piece that's different today based on the eviction moratoria and some of the rent increase caps that exist is just very little incentive for residents in some jurisdictions to actually go on to leases. So our month-to-month percentage is higher than it normally is. It's normally around 1%. It's about three times that right now around 3%. So in terms of lease expiration profile, we're not too concerned about that. And given lease breaks that occur month-to-month as we move through the year we're always resetting lease expirations as we offer new leases to make sure that stays in check. So that's just something we normally do all the time. As it relates to the first part of your question, which is more around seasonality. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we really haven't seen any seasonal softening this year that would typically occur. If you go back to normal times, rents rise pretty -- asking rents rise pretty materially from January through say mid-July, and then you start to see some seasonal adjustments and downward slope as you move through the back half of the year. We have not experienced that this year. And by all the metrics that we see in terms of lead volume, visit volume, et cetera, low availability we certainly don't see that in terms of the near-term outlook over the next 30 days or so. The question would be if you're thinking about what the risks are the delta variants and the impact on potential delays for reopening of certain companies and things like that might there be seasonality in Q4 that we're not seeing today that's a possibility. We do feel good about where we are positioned though, because again the spread between asking rents and move-in rents is about 12%. Even if those asking rents start to decelerate a little bit there's still a nice spread there to continue to grow move-in rents, even if asking rents do decelerate. So again we haven't seen that seasonal adjustment yet. But to the extent some macro factors impact it and we start to see it, we do have enough spread that we can continue to grow move-in rents.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for time.\nSean Breslin: Yeah.\nOperator: Alexander Goldfarb of Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good afternoon. One, it is pretty amazing how the development have [ph] come back so quickly. So that's wonderful to see, just really eye-popping. But along those lines, you guys now have the Avalon brand, you have AVA, you have Eaves, and now Kanso or Kanso, apologies if I mispronounced. Just some sort of an economic return basis and a development cost basis, what's the range between the four brands? And I understand the Eaves is more of the older suburban stuff, but still as part of your offering. But how do we assess the economic returns of the four different brands?\nMatt Birenbaum: Alex, it's Matt. I guess, I can speak to it a little bit in terms of development economics and others may want to speak to it in terms of the existing asset base. But I mean so you're right, Eaves, we can't build Eaves profitably. Nobody has been able to figure that out in this industry. But -- so that brings growth [ph] in acquisition through Avalon is aging into it over time, which has happened in some cases. It's really not so much about one brand necessarily being more profitable or generating higher yield than another. It's about having more -- being able to serve more customer segments in a more tailored way, so that we're optimizing the opportunity on any given submarket. It's not necessarily that AVA is going to generate a higher yield than an Avalon. In fact in certain locations where AVA is more appropriate, it might draw -- it might be a better investment decision to program that community as an AVA or as a dual brand as we've done in some cases than if it were an Avalon and vice versa. So it's really -- and we think that by doing that, we're able to first do more business, because we can -- we have a broader product line to choose from, and second optimize any individual opportunity that comes along as opposed to having the same offering that we're going to force into multiple different submarkets and locations. Kanso, we did underwrite that and look at that. And our thinking there was that there is this great underserved market of folks that want a new apartment, but don't want -- don't value all the other things that are basically being over-served by an Avalon or even by an AVA. And no one in the market is really delivering to that customer segment. And our analysis would show that between hard cost savings from programming it more lightly and operating savings by operating it more lightly in a more self-service manner as well as for longer term CapEx savings that we can get to a rent point which is 10% to 15% below what an Avalon would be in that location and get a similar yield. So there are locations where you could do both, but -- and what we're finding there at least so far with the one we've done is the discount is less than that. It's more like 5%. So we're pretty excited about that. It's still early. We'll have to see how things play out kind of post-COVID to really see where that settles in. But that's the way I think about it.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. That's helpful. And then the second thing is just sort of along the development. Just given the demands of especially suburban, but also people wanting more space for living or maybe just more housing type. As you guys see new sites, is there more of an ability to either add townhouse or add -- I'm not suggesting you guys get into single family, but add more elements that make your apartments more sort of longer living for people where you can hit sort of a different demographic that's additive, but still within the whole site plan makes all the math work?\nMatt Birenbaum : Absolutely Alex. And I'd point you to our biggest start for the quarter, which is we just started Avalon Bothell Commons Phase 1. That's a deal in Bothell, which is a very high-end infill suburban community on the east side of the lake east of Seattle. That's a 20-acre site that ultimately we're going to program with two phases. And the first phase does have I think about 370 flats and about 100 rental towns. And that's a site where a couple of years ago we might have sold a piece of that site to a for-sale developer. And instead we decided we would do the lower-density component of the product ourselves as well. The average unit size there includes even in the flats we have more flats with dense than we would have built in the past so that there's more from places as well as the town. So I think the average unit size there is about 1,070 square feet as opposed to other communities we might be developing in that last cycle that might have averaged 850 or 900 square feet per home. So that's definitely a trend we're seeing in our portfolio. \nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll next hear from Alex Kalmus of Zelman & Associates.\nAlex Kalmus: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. A question based on the eviction moratoriums and sort of the bad debt side. How many units are -- is this mostly from sustained non-payers at this point that are causing the sort of sustained bad debt expense? Or is it a little more broad based? And then secondarily, if the eviction moratoriums are lifted, what could this do to sort of the occupancy levels if hypothetically they were unleashed at one time? \nMatt Birenbaum : Yes, Alex good questions. So on the first part of your question sustained non-payers, yes, that is for the most part the answer as it relates to the bad debt. On the second question kind of I would maybe refer back to what I mentioned earlier on the various kind of the eviction moratoria that's out there. Assuming nothing happens there is federal level, there is state level actions in place, there's local level actions in place. The timing of all of those and when they are lifted will likely be different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the ability to get people out, based on the court system, how backed up it may be et cetera. As a result of those things, we believe the sort of bleed in process, as it relates to people leaving our communities either of their own choosing or through a legal process will take some time. And therefore, units coming back to the market, so to speak, is vacant units that have to be turned and then leased and occupied will probably be not just a one or two quarter process but potentially a few quarters to work our way through. Yes some people will leave early when they see sort of the light at the end of the tunnel and they need to do something. There will definitely be those people, who will hold out for the very last minute until they are really forced out and everything in between. So therefore, we do believe it will work its way through the system over a period of time. The market where it's probably most concentrated for us and many others is in Los Angeles. So that one could get a little bumpy depending on what happens in that specific jurisdiction but we still think there are residents who will choose different paths to their eventual outcome. And therefore, it may take again two or three quarters for it to work its way through the system. And based on conversations with many others I think people expect a fairly similar outcome.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Makes sense. And on the demographic side with the new tenants you have a 70 basis point bump in occupancy sequentially. Do they pretty much match the portfolios demographic base? Or are you seeing a little differences here and there depending on maybe market or the type of age or income levels? \nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Also a good question. I mean at the portfolio level; the changes have not been terribly material. If you look at the suburban portfolio as an example, incomes are pretty consistent with kind of pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Average age is basically the same. It went from high 35s to low 36 range, so not a meaningful difference. On the urban side at the portfolio level, incomes are down about 6% but average age actually went up. I mean it kind of makes sense, if you think about it because move-in values are basically back at 2019 levels, while the urban movements are still 7% to 8% below 2019. So rent-to-income ratios have remained relatively constant and we've seen incomes come up as rents have come back. So it all kind of lines up. There are some nuances by region. Incomes are up a little bit more and age as well in some of the suburban New York markets. But at the portfolio level, modest changes relative to kind of pre-pandemic 2019 levels.\nAlex Kalmus: Got it. Thank you very much for the color.\nOperator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session for today. At this time I'll turn the call back over to Tim, for any additional or closing comments.\nTim Naughton: Thank you, April. I know it's been a long call and thank you all for being on today and just hope you enjoy the rest of your summer and stay well. Thank you. \nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kevin O'Shea",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Matt. On slide 16 we provide our financial and operating outlook for the third quarter and for full year 2021. For the third quarter using the midpoint of our guidance ranges, we expect core FFO per share of $1.96. On a sequential basis our third quarter estimate reflects a sequential decline in core FFO of $0.02 per share from the second quarter. This sequential decrease in core FFO per share is driven primarily by an increase of $0.05 per share in same-store residential revenue and a $0.03 per share increase in lease-up NOI offset by a seasonally driven increase in same-store residential operating expenses of $0.06 per share and a $0.03 per share decrease in community NOI as a result of recent disposition activity. On a year-over-year basis for our same-store portfolio using the midpoint of our ranges we expect NOI to decrease by 3% for the third quarter driven by an 80 basis point reduction in same-store residential rental revenue and a 3.5% increase in same-store residential operating expenses. For the fourth quarter our full year earnings guidance implies core FFO per share of $2.13, which would represent a $0.17 or 8.7% sequential increase from the third quarter estimate. This expected sequential increase in earnings in the fourth quarter is primarily driven by a continued increase in same-store residential rental revenue by a seasonally expected decline in same-store residential operating expenses and by further NOI growth in our lease-up portfolio. For our full year 2021 guidance, we expect core FFO per share of $8.02 at the midpoint of our range. And for our same-store residential portfolio, again using the mid-point ranges and looking at growth on a year-over-year basis, we expect NOI to decrease by 6.2% for full year 2021, driven by a 3.2% decrease in revenues and a 3.3% increase in operating expenses. Turning to our updated investment and capital plan, the combination of a strong recovery in revenue and earnings growth and attractive access to the capital markets has prompted us to pivot to offense and pursue increased development and acquisition activity as reflected in our current investment and capital plan on slide 17. For development, we now anticipate starting $1.2 billion in new projects this year, up from our original plan of $750 million, and we expect NOI for new development communities undergoing lease-up to be about $50 million this year at the midpoint an increase of $5 million from our original outlook. For capital activity, we now anticipate a busier year with total capital uses for development, redevelopment, acquisitions and debt repayments of $1.8 billion in 2021. This represents an increase of nearly $1 billion from our original outlook and is driven by increased acquisition activity for the year and an expected early repayment later this year of $450 million in unsecured debt that is scheduled to mature in September 2022. In terms of capital sourcing, our current plan contemplates meeting our capital needs through a combination of unsecured debt issuance and additional asset sales, although, the sources we ultimately tap are subject to change based on changes in capital market conditions or our actual capital uses. Turning now to slide 18 and our continuing efforts in the area of corporate responsibility or ESG, we are pleased to report that we recently released our 10th Annual Corporate Responsibility or ESG Report reflecting our long-standing commitment to this part of our business. As highlighted in the report, we see measurable progress on our science-based emission reduction targets primarily due to our investments in on-site solar generation and efforts to improve building efficiency. We're also proud of our commitments to the communities in which we do business. These funding to our non-profit partners to serve those in need during the pandemic. We continued our important national partnership with the American Red Cross focused on disaster preparedness and response and we initiated a new partnership with the National Urban League designed to engage with them on our diversity and inclusion efforts and provide support to their mission. All these efforts continue to be recognized externally with the CDP rating us in the A band and the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark or GRESB rating us number one in the multi-family sector both globally and in the United States. In addition, NAREIT awarded us their highest honor of sustainability performance. Further, our associates remain highly engaged as reflected in our engagement scores that are in the top quartile on this important metric. And finally, our customers weighed in and we are pleased to be number one in online customer reputation. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ben for his concluding remarks. Hey, Michael, this is Kevin. I think in terms of our pacing into these new markets, I think number one it's likely to be measured as Matt alluded to and similar to what you've seen in terms of the rollout in some of our other markets maybe a little bit more a little bit less. Obviously we'd like to be -- to make some progress on that front. But then relatedly the capital impact in terms of how we [Technical Difficulty] it's probably also likely to be measured. And so we've got -- unlike some others because we are so active in development we have that as a tool in our toolkit either to venture with partners or to eventually start doing development on our own. And to the extent we engage in those new markets in that way that obviously paces out the capital deployment and also maps it against investments that are generally pretty darn accretive to our cost of capital. So our intention would not be to do so in any dilutive way. From the standpoint of acquisitions as you know from what we've done so far, we've been leaning pretty heavily into our gains capacity by selling assets in non-core markets or non-core submarkets in our legacy footprint and then putting them into Southeast Florida and Denver and I think we'll likely continue to do that. And that's something that we think actually is marginally accretive because we're kind of moving. And as you can see from the assets that we're selling now in sub four cap rates into asset into markets with maybe similar cap rates, but hopefully a better growth profile. So I think what you've seen us do in the past is probably a good indication of what we might do in the future. And probably from a funding point of view we're willing to do so on accretive basis. Sure Brad. Yes, it's Kevin and Sean may want to jump in here a little bit, so -- to talk about the relief programs. But just to give you a sense of what has happened so far and what is in our numbers. The current relief programs have been somewhat helpful so far, but only marginally or so. Overall, we received $5 million in rent relief payments of which approximately $4 million in rent relief payments was in the first half of the year including $2.5 million in the second quarter. For the back half of the year, we've assumed we received -- we'll receive $4 million. And that includes what we've received in July which is kind of around $1.5 million. And of that $4 million in the back half most of that will be in the third quarter. So that's how we're looking at it. Obviously, we've been involved in working with our residents and applying where we can on our own for much more but it obviously takes time. And it's a process that is inherently uncertain and for which there's not an awful lot of visibility about what we're going to receive and when. So we've been relatively modest in what we assume we will receive going forward from that opportunity. Hey, Austin, it's Kevin. Yes I mean you asked an interesting question but it's -- unfortunately it's one that's inherently speculative. It sort of as you point out begins with uses. What do we intend to do? What's the return profile on that? And then it comes back to sources. And as you know this could potentially also be a long answer but we have three primary markets. We have unsecured debt. We have asset sales, which lately have been suburban asset sales. And common equity, which is what you're alluding to there. Today, right now, all three of those markets as Tim, alluded to in his opening remarks are attractive. And that's one of the main factors when you think about how we might gather our sources one factor is clearly, pricing. And right now all three are relatively attractive from the standpoint of funding accretive developments. Then you get into the debate about, which one is more attractive and you have a little bit of a debate there. My own view right now of things -- where things stand today is probably based on their own historical pricing metrics, I'd probably rank unsecured debt first, suburban asset sales second and then common equity third. But reason of mine can differ and circumstances matter particularly with regard to the assets you might sell and the usage you might put them to and where we are from a balance sheet point of view. Second factor is obviously, our capacity to increase leverage. And the good news is there -- with revenue and NOI growth growing and with modest leverage right now of 5.3 turns, we do have capacity to increase our leverage somewhat to support investment activity and so that allows us to tap that market if it makes sense. And the third factor is our capacity-absorbed capital gains before we had to make a special distribution. And we tend to like to lean into that capacity quite a bit lately to help buy assets in our expansion markets but also to fund development as we're doing here with that activity. So a lot of choices on the menu for us today. So I don't know that we need to decide anything right now in terms of our capital plan for, what's in front of us for the back half of the year. What we are planning to do and what I alluded to my remarks is tap the unsecured debt markets and the asset sale markets to fund, what's in front of us and sort of -- but if we get more uses beyond that which we have in front of us that's a little bit of how we think about it. And I'd say the good news is, having kind of attractive access to capital and the opportunity to deploy it accretively in development is just a wonderful situation to be in. It means we're kind of legging into a very strong part of the cycle, where we can enhance earnings growth through accretive investment activity. So -- and that's an important differentiator for AvalonBay."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tim Naughton",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Jason and welcome to our Q2 call. With me today are Ben Schall, Kevin O'Shea, Matt Birenbaum, and Sean Breslin. For our prepared comments today, I'll start by providing some high-level comments on apartment marketing conditions and how the current operating and capital environment is shaping our actions, including our recent decision to enter new markets in North Carolina and Texas. Ben will provide a summary of second quarter results, including a detailed road map of results on a year-over-year and a sequential quarter basis. Sean will then elaborate on operating trends in the portfolio, where we've seen a robust recovery in fundamentals and performance since the first of the year. Matt will review performance in our development portfolio, including lease-up performance and an overview of our first Kanso community located in Rockville, Maryland, where we completed construction this past quarter. Kevin will then provide an overview of our outlook for Q3 and the full year. And lastly, Ben will provide some summary comments on how AVB is well positioned to deliver earnings and NAV growth as we look forward. Before turning to the deck, I thought I'd provide some perspective on what we're seeing in the markets and how it's shaping our actions in terms of operations and capital allocation. Since the first of the year, the recovery in the apartment market conditions has been dramatic. Effective move-in rents have fully recovered from the trough, up almost 20% over the last two quarters alone. And asking rents grew even faster, up over 20% since the beginning of the year and now stand at 8% above pre-pandemic peak. Concessions which were significantly elevated last year have fallen back to a modest level, closer to what we experienced pre-pandemic. As you might guess the speed and steepness of the recovery has been driven by very strong rental demand. In fact, Q2 traffic was up over 40% from last year. It continues to outpace last year despite very low levels of availability. The combination of strong traffic and low inventory propelled rental rates through Q2 and that has continued through July. While all regions and submarkets are improving and most are back to or near pre-pandemic levels, there's still a fair bit of variability across the portfolio. Specifically suburban continues to outperform urban, Class A is outperforming Class B and regionally Southern California and our expansion markets of Southeast Florida and Denver outperforming the portfolio average, while the Bay Area continues to lag the average. In addition to strong apartment markets, the capital markets are also extremely healthy and constructive for apartment investment. The transaction debt and equity markets are all wide open and are supporting strong growth in asset values, as we've seen cap rates fall below 4% across most markets and submarkets over the last few quarters. Based on the strong market sentiment, we expect capital flows to remain healthy over the foreseeable future. With this operating and capital backdrop, we have shifted to offense and have increased our planned investment activity for the year by almost $1 billion, between new development starts and acquisitions. In addition in our release, we announced our intent to enter the Raleigh and Charlotte markets in North Carolina, as well as Austin and [Technical Difficulty] markets in Texas. As we discussed over the last two to three years, we've been evaluating expansion into markets that we believe will disproportionately benefit from the growth in the knowledge economy and domestic migration, particularly in those markets that figure to see some migration from our existing legacy markets. We'll have more to share with you about our growth plans in these markets over the next couple of quarters. And lastly, as we mentioned last quarter, after completing a comprehensive midyear re-forecast, we are now providing full year outlook in addition to quarterly guidance. While risk remains in our outlook including the impact of the virus and the Delta variant, the exact timing of eventual phaseout of eviction moratoria across our markets and the receipt of any rent relief payments from state and local governments we believe we have enough clarity to provide a meaningful perspective with respect to our operating performance for the rest of the year. With that, now let me turn it over to Ben, who will discuss Q2 results. Rich, this is Tim. Yes M&A is always a possibility. It's not our main strategy in terms of entering these markets. I mean I guess sort to step back we're not necessarily looking to -- as Kevin mentioned, we're looking to sort of pace our way into these markets. We're making these decisions because we see these markets as having great fundamentals over a long period of time. They have certain structural advantages. They're going to make them appealing markets over the next yes 20, 30, 40 years much like our legacy markets have been over the last 20, 30 years. So the need either through M&A or to do a highly disproportionate level of transaction activity in these markets is not what is driving us motivate and to also recognize we're learning as we get into these markets. And so, there is obviously a big risk to either do an M&A or a high level of volume in the first year or two as you start to gain market intelligence in the markets which you do have business. So very much a strategy as Kevin mentioned that we deployed -- employed at in Southeast Florida and Denver and how we look to deploy capital here as well. Yes. Well maybe just tag on to what Sean was saying. Yes, Sean mentioned the supply outlook. I do think there's a combination of maybe some onetime items that are fueling demand as well as maybe some structural things that have been accelerated obviously by the pandemic. I mean you do have unprecedented federal stimulus and excess savings that have been created during this downturn that maybe help propelling some household demand at the margin. A lot of it is being fueled by the 25 to 29 cohort. And then in addition, we believe we've had a housing shortage that's been building over the last decade. And you sort of couple that with the federal stimulus and maybe a broader de-densifying of our population where you may have had roommates now get that one household and now they're two households as people want to have their own unit. We think that's probably stimulating some demand. But the other thing I think that is -- maybe is structural is just the nature of this recovery is all people talked about as being K-shaped. And that's very much our view where our renters and sensors are really kind of on the upper part of that K and are really experiencing a V-shaped recovery. And I think from our perspective, it feels like a V-shaped recovery, a very steep recovery. There are parts of the population that obviously are being left behind and not participating as much just given that they're not -- they may not -- they maybe service-oriented jobs as opposed to technology or financial services or the types of industries we tend to over index too. So, I think that maybe more structural in nature and could help propel some household formation, particularly kind of within our target segments. Yeah. Rich, I would say from my perspective, COVID's not really changing our view of the markets. These markets are really formed by how we think they're going to perform over the next 20 to 30 years. Obviously, some of these Sunbelt markets have benefited during COVID as you've seen some migration from some of our legacy markets. Those markets that maybe -- some of it maybe transitory, some of it maybe permanent, but that trend was already occurring at some level in terms of domestic migration. And what we saw in all of these markets, what we saw in Southeast Florida and Denver, there's only so many expansion markets you could take on at one time. Obviously, it's a pretty big deal for us to move into Southeast Florida and Denver three years ago or so and add those to our footprint. And we've seen some success there and that's -- has probably made us more confident about how we can enter in some of these other markets as well. So, I would say, probably if COVID hadn't happened, we might have entered these markets sooner in some ways. Obviously the events over the last 16 months have recentered our focus on a lot of other priorities. But given where we are right now, we felt like we're in a position to continue to grow and whether it's through looking at new segments, whether it's looking through mixed use as we've talked about in the past or potential broader geography we're looking at and willing to pursue all of those. Hey, Rich. Tim and others might want to join. I think, the simple answer is, yes. We've -- and if it wasn't, we should be exiting those markets, right? But we're always -- and we have exited some markets. So it's not something we're not going to -- we're not going to either reduce our exposure and turn our exposure to certain markets where we think there may be more risk or a little bit less upside or potentially exit a market. We're not prepared to do that today, but we are trying to be intellectually honest in terms of what we see as not the next four or five years of opportunity, but the next 20 or 30 years, as we look at both demand and supply drivers in the business and some of it -- some of the risks that are out there, whether it be regulatory or immigration related that might affect certain markets more than others. So -- and certainly supply. I mean the markets we're talking about are -- they are less supply constrained, as we know, but they are massive job generators at the same time, particularly in some of the businesses and parts of the economy we want to be exposed to. So I would say this is more about diversification and growth, than it is about not liking what we're seeing in our current markets today. Thank you, April. I know it's been a long call and thank you all for being on today and just hope you enjoy the rest of your summer and stay well. Thank you."

            "name": "Matt Birenbaum",
            "content": "All right. Great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to our current lease-up communities, you can see on slide 13 the same positive trends that we're seeing in the stabilized portfolio. We're achieving rents $155 above initial underwriting on the seven communities that are currently in lease-up which is lifting the stabilized yield on those investments to 6.1% generating substantial value creation relative to current cap rates which are at or below 4% across our footprint. This is really a remarkable turnaround in our development portfolio which just a few quarters ago had rents and yields modestly below initial underwriting and continues to demonstrate our long track record of delivering outsized risk-adjusted returns from our development and construction capabilities. One development that we wanted to highlight this quarter is shown on slide 14 which is the first completion of our latest brand Kanso located at the Twinbrook Metro station in Rockville, Maryland. Kanso was born out of customer insight research, which was telling us that there's a large underserved segment of residents that are looking for a new high-quality apartment in a transit-served or infill location, but without all the extra bells and whistles provided in typical Class A new construction. By focusing our investment on the apartment home itself and removing common area amenities that these customers do not value like pools, fitness centers and lounges, we are able to save on both upfront capital and ongoing operating and CapEx costs which in turn allow us to provide a meaningful discount on the rent as compared to a fully programmed Avalon offering at the same location. Kanso leverages technology to provide a primarily self-service experience for residents and prospects with very limited on-site staffing supported by our centralized call center and a design with low maintenance needs to deliver on the brand promise to live simply without sacrifice. We're excited the market has embraced the concept with Kanso Twinbrook leasing up successfully at a strong pace at rents above pro forma and look-forward to growing this new brand via additional development opportunity in the future. Turning to slide 15 we continue to see tremendous demand in the asset sales market and completed six wholly-owned dispositions in the second quarter at a weighted average cap rate of 3.7%. The assets sold were predominantly in the Northeast region with more than 60% of the proceeds coming out of the Greater New York area and were older than average for our portfolio with an average age of 25 years, allowing us to continue to further our portfolio allocation goals to reduce exposure to some of our legacy markets while also minimizing our CapEx profile. And by redeploying this capital into new development starts of $580 million this quarter at projected yield of 5.7% we're match funding new growth at highly accretive margins. And with that I'll turn it over to Kevin to go over our earnings guidance for the year. Hey, Michael, it's Matt. I can speak to that one a little bit. I mean things are fluid until they close. So I don't want to get too specific, but yes we do have -- we're -- we do have active deals working in three of those four markets that Ben mentioned. Those three deals together probably add up to maybe half of what you're saying maybe it's $500 million not $1 billion yet at this point. But we're continuing to look for more as well. And certainly, we expect some of that activity to close here in the third quarter. Yes. Sure Rich. We're certainly seeing -- it's definitely good to see the top ridiculous air come out of the lumber market a little bit. But you're right as we talked about really the last couple of quarters, hard cost inflation in general is driven primarily by labor and secondarily by kind of the commodities costs. And while lumber has come down, steel is up, dry wells up, some of the other things that we buy a lot of are up. And certainly there is pressure. It's hard for us. We don't have a direct line of sight into what our subcontractors are paying their workers. But we see it in the bids we're getting and we are buying a lot of activity right now. And what I would say is, what we're seeing is that the development starts that we started this quarter -- last quarter it was in the release that we're getting ready to start this quarter, probably our total capital costs are up 5% to 10% from where we thought those deals would have priced at the end of the year. So -- and that in turn has pushed our yields down a bit. I think our development yield on the $1.2 billion that we expect to start this year is about 5.7%. And a year ago or late last year, maybe that was closer to a 6%. So we have seen some downward pressure in yields. And again, obviously, as we talked about before cap rates are down that much more. So if anything the margins are just as strong and we're seeing on the transaction side that every month new records are being broken in terms of where assets are trading. So that's giving us and others confidence to continue building taking that 5% to 10% increase in our basis because the transaction market is giving it back to us and them some. And that's still on NOIs which are \u2013 we're starting to see and that's starting to work its way into our underwriting the rent lift that we were talking about. But I would say, our rental underwriting on development is still pretty conservative. So there's probably still a little bit of numerator lift to come there as well. Sure. This is Matt. I'm just looking at the list now. So of the \u2013 looks like one, two, three, we got 10 development starts planned this year and one of them is urban two of them are urban. One is kind of a residential urban neighborhood in Boston and Brighton. It's a relatively small wood frame deal and the deal we just started this quarter in Merrick Park which is in Miami, but really in Coral Gables not Downtown Miami. Those are the only two that are urban. So it's still predominantly 70%, 80% suburban. And as I look at what we're likely to start next year, it's more of the same. That's where we're finding the development economics are working better. And there's still more supply coming in urban submarkets relative to suburban submarkets. Again, when you look out maybe two, three, four, years from now that equation could well change and we're mindful of that as we look at the land market and where that might be in the future. But certainly over the next year or two the starts are going to continue to be the vast majority suburban. Yeah. I mean, I can speak to the first part and Sean may want to speak to the second part a little bit. So as I mentioned, we're \u2013 today, we have about $3.1 billion in development rights. It looks like about 25% of that is Metro New York. So compared to when we used to have the schedule it has come down quite a bit or we've been adding more in other regions. And of that so maybe $800 million $900 million of it is in Metro New York. And of that at least two-thirds of it is in the suburbs. I think we have one urban development right on the coast in Jersey, but everything else is \u2013 a lot of that is Inland New Jersey, Long Island type of locations. In terms of the existing rents in the portfolio a very different kind of unit. I mean, our average unit size in the suburbs is \u2013 I don't know the number, but it's probably over 1,000 square feet. So the whole dollar rents may look the same but the rents per foot look pretty different. And frankly that's where we're seeing a lot of success. So we're trying to add more rental townhomes for example in New Jersey or empty nester-targeted product on Long Island. So the unit sizes and the target customers are quite different. Brad, it's Matt. So I think yeah, as you're talking about Southeast Florida and Denver, I think you're probably looking at our same-store portfolio. So our current weighting is kind of by total revenue or by investment or by units is actually a little higher than those numbers, but it's not. I'd say, we're roughly halfway there. We're maybe 2%, 2.5% where we're trying to get to 5% over some period of time. So it's a combination of all of that. I mean, clearly we can move the needle more quickly with acquisitions. And so we are looking to do that. And we will \u2013 as we did in Denver Florida and in many cases in those instances we're actually trading. So we're taking dispositions from our legacy markets and redeploying that capital there. Development takes longer. So, we're \u2013 ultimately, it's going to be all of the above. It's going to be acquisitions. It's going to be development. It's going to be funding other developers. Each of those three activities is on a little bit of a different timeframe which does give us a little bit of diversification in terms of kind of the timing and the relative trade. So we kind of like that. But we certainly are staffing up in these regions. We're looking at putting people on the ground. And as we make those commitments certainly, we're expecting to be able to move at a reasonable pace. But yeah, I mean, I wouldn't expect either -- any of them to get to 5% or more of our portfolio within two or three years. It's going to probably take longer than that. I wish I knew John. Certainly, we like Kanso. We think that it's got a lot of potential. We don't have a lot of Kanso opportunities in our pipeline right now. Frankly, seeing how it performed helps us understand how to underwrite it, going forward. So -- and they probably will tend to be smaller deals. So one of the things we like about it actually is that it opens up some smaller sites where, it's pretty hard to make the numbers work on 100 unit or 150 unit Avalon when you think about the cost of the amenities and staffing and amortizing that over a relatively few apartments. So, it may -- hopefully, we're going to get a number of new Kanso opportunities into the pipeline. But because they're likely to be smaller, I would expect that it would be a relatively small percentage of the pipeline at least in the next year or two. Hey, Austin, it's Matt. I guess there's a number of ways to think about it. You can think about it in terms of the size of the development rights pipeline, which typically represents three years of future start activity. You can think about it in terms of the size of development underway. In terms of the latter, we are well below, kind of -- we've talked in the past about having a target range of 10% to 15% of development underway at any given point in time, as a percentage of our total enterprise value. I think we're at 5% or 6%, right now. So if we can find the opportunities, I think, from a balance sheet point of view [Indiscernible]. So, again, as Ben mentioned, we're feeling pretty good about it over the next couple of years at any rate. In terms of the development rights pipeline, if you think even if you took 10% of TEV underway, a TEV of whatever mid-$30-billion-ish, $35 billion maybe going to $40 billion that would be $3.5 billion underway at any given point in time. I would say you probably want to have a development rights pipeline of $6 billion or so -- and $6 million or even $7 million. So we're looking to grow it. Alex, it's Matt. I guess, I can speak to it a little bit in terms of development economics and others may want to speak to it in terms of the existing asset base. But I mean so you're right, Eaves, we can't build Eaves profitably. Nobody has been able to figure that out in this industry. But -- so that brings growth [ph] in acquisition through Avalon is aging into it over time, which has happened in some cases. It's really not so much about one brand necessarily being more profitable or generating higher yield than another. It's about having more -- being able to serve more customer segments in a more tailored way, so that we're optimizing the opportunity on any given submarket. It's not necessarily that AVA is going to generate a higher yield than an Avalon. In fact in certain locations where AVA is more appropriate, it might draw -- it might be a better investment decision to program that community as an AVA or as a dual brand as we've done in some cases than if it were an Avalon and vice versa. So it's really -- and we think that by doing that, we're able to first do more business, because we can -- we have a broader product line to choose from, and second optimize any individual opportunity that comes along as opposed to having the same offering that we're going to force into multiple different submarkets and locations. Kanso, we did underwrite that and look at that. And our thinking there was that there is this great underserved market of folks that want a new apartment, but don't want -- don't value all the other things that are basically being over-served by an Avalon or even by an AVA. And no one in the market is really delivering to that customer segment. And our analysis would show that between hard cost savings from programming it more lightly and operating savings by operating it more lightly in a more self-service manner as well as for longer term CapEx savings that we can get to a rent point which is 10% to 15% below what an Avalon would be in that location and get a similar yield. So there are locations where you could do both, but -- and what we're finding there at least so far with the one we've done is the discount is less than that. It's more like 5%. So we're pretty excited about that. It's still early. We'll have to see how things play out kind of post-COVID to really see where that settles in. But that's the way I think about it. Absolutely Alex. And I'd point you to our biggest start for the quarter, which is we just started Avalon Bothell Commons Phase 1. That's a deal in Bothell, which is a very high-end infill suburban community on the east side of the lake east of Seattle. That's a 20-acre site that ultimately we're going to program with two phases. And the first phase does have I think about 370 flats and about 100 rental towns. And that's a site where a couple of years ago we might have sold a piece of that site to a for-sale developer. And instead we decided we would do the lower-density component of the product ourselves as well. The average unit size there includes even in the flats we have more flats with dense than we would have built in the past so that there's more from places as well as the town. So I think the average unit size there is about 1,070 square feet as opposed to other communities we might be developing in that last cycle that might have averaged 850 or 900 square feet per home. So that's definitely a trend we're seeing in our portfolio. Yes, Alex good questions. So on the first part of your question sustained non-payers, yes, that is for the most part the answer as it relates to the bad debt. On the second question kind of I would maybe refer back to what I mentioned earlier on the various kind of the eviction moratoria that's out there. Assuming nothing happens there is federal level, there is state level actions in place, there's local level actions in place. The timing of all of those and when they are lifted will likely be different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the ability to get people out, based on the court system, how backed up it may be et cetera. As a result of those things, we believe the sort of bleed in process, as it relates to people leaving our communities either of their own choosing or through a legal process will take some time. And therefore, units coming back to the market, so to speak, is vacant units that have to be turned and then leased and occupied will probably be not just a one or two quarter process but potentially a few quarters to work our way through. Yes some people will leave early when they see sort of the light at the end of the tunnel and they need to do something. There will definitely be those people, who will hold out for the very last minute until they are really forced out and everything in between. So therefore, we do believe it will work its way through the system over a period of time. The market where it's probably most concentrated for us and many others is in Los Angeles. So that one could get a little bumpy depending on what happens in that specific jurisdiction but we still think there are residents who will choose different paths to their eventual outcome. And therefore, it may take again two or three quarters for it to work its way through the system. And based on conversations with many others I think people expect a fairly similar outcome. Yes. Also a good question. I mean at the portfolio level; the changes have not been terribly material. If you look at the suburban portfolio as an example, incomes are pretty consistent with kind of pre-pandemic levels in 2019. Average age is basically the same. It went from high 35s to low 36 range, so not a meaningful difference. On the urban side at the portfolio level, incomes are down about 6% but average age actually went up. I mean it kind of makes sense, if you think about it because move-in values are basically back at 2019 levels, while the urban movements are still 7% to 8% below 2019. So rent-to-income ratios have remained relatively constant and we've seen incomes come up as rents have come back. So it all kind of lines up. There are some nuances by region. Incomes are up a little bit more and age as well in some of the suburban New York markets. But at the portfolio level, modest changes relative to kind of pre-pandemic 2019 levels."

            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "All right. Thanks Ben. I thought I'd share a few slides on portfolio rent trends both overall and across different markets and submarkets. Overall, we've seen a meaningful acceleration in the positive rent trends we spoke about during our Q1 call. On slide eight, you can see that our average move-in rent value has grown by roughly 18% since the beginning of the year including a 13% increase since just April and is now consistent with the peak rent levels we achieved in mid-2019. Moving to slide nine, improved performance has been broad-based with every region experiencing a material increase in average move-in rent over the past seven months. If you look at our July move-in specifically, rents are now equal to or greater than the 2019 peak in every region except Northern California, which remains roughly 11% below peak. The timeline for a full recovery in Northern California will in part be based on when major tech employers call people back to work. The hybrid work policies adopted by major employers will have will certainly have some impact on where tech workers want to live. Silicon Valley will very likely remain one of the world's leading innovation centers for years to come. Turning to slide 10 to address suburban and urban performance trends, the average July move-in rent for our suburban portfolio was roughly 3% above the peak we achieved in 2019. In our urban portfolio while demand has returned in a meaningful way, the average rent in these submarkets fell the most throughout 2020 and is still down about 7.5% from peak 2019 rents. As it relates to the urban portfolio, we expect performance to continue to improve as people are called back to the office, urban universities resume on-campus learning, and the quality of the environment starts to look and feel more like pre-pandemic conditions. Turning to slide 11. Our average asking rent which is representative of the published rent for available inventory has increased 24% since the beginning of the year and is currently about 8% above the mid-2019 peak. Our suburban submarkets which represent about two-thirds of portfolio revenue are leading the recovery. The average asking rent in our urban submarkets is basically back to the 2019 peak and as I mentioned previously is expected to continue to grow as those environments more fully reopen over the next few months. And moving to slide 12, this chart depicts the trajectory and spread between our average asking and move-in rents. As I mentioned a few slides ago, the average portfolio movement rent has increased roughly 18% this year, but trails the increase in average asking rent which is up 24%. The average dollar spread between the two which averaged 12% for the month of July is wider than the 4% to 5% we have seen historically and is representative of the capacity available to grow move-in rents over the next couple of quarters. Additionally, if we see a seasonal adjustment in asking rents the last few months of the year something we have not yet experienced this year there's plenty of room for asking rents to soften a bit and still grow move-in rents. With that summary, I'll turn it to Matt to address development and portfolio trading activity. Matt? Yes. Rich this is Sean. I'll take a first shot at that and then anybody else could jump in. In terms of the kind of demand profile and how it plays out how long it could run that's a function of a lot of different variables that would take us quite a while to get through. But still on the demand side things have been quite robust as you noted. The trajectory of the recovery whether you look at asking rents you look at move-in values you look at occupancy all of them quite healthy even by historical standards in terms of coming out of a downturn, in terms of the speed of the recovery and the order of magnitude both have probably been a little bit surprising for everyone. When we look at where we're clearing the market today on rents we kind of put that slide in the deck. It shows where asking rents are relative to move-in values. In the near term I guess what I would say is that, demand has been quite healthy. We have not seen signs of weakening at this point whatsoever and have seen very healthy week-by-week growth in both those move-in values and asking rents. People have asked about the seasonal effect has demand been pulled forward etcetera, etcetera. We don't see signs of that yet. But what we do feel good about is that spread between move-in rents and asking rents being at 12% even if there's a little bit of seasonality that comes upon us in the fourth quarter or the variant creates some disruption and delays we're starting to see a little bit of that. There's still plenty of room in the short run to see move-in rents continue to grow and maintain the recovery. In the longer term, it's a broader question around just overall housing demand and supply which is a function of what happens with the job and income growth and various other factors associated with the demand side. And then on the supply side just overall housing production and multifamily housing production specifically. And at least on the supply side, our markets we feel pretty good about particularly for legacy markets the outlook for supply coming down over the next year or two potentially by a pretty decent amount. We'll be able to refresh our numbers by the end of this year. But we could be seeing a double-digit percentage decline across the footprint and supply as we move into 2022. It would certainly further kind of support healthy demand and rental rate growth as we move through 2022. So that's kind of the near-term and the kind of maybe medium-term outlook. And then yes, Tim or other may want to jump in in terms of the longer-term outlook. And Nick just in terms of additional context as we look out over our development pipeline over the next couple of years, we took our overall starts for this year up to $1.2 billion. We think over the next couple of years in that $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion type of range is achievable plus the opportunity for additional development starts in our expansion markets as we get moving heavier in that direction. Yeah. Good question, John. I want to give you some qualitative answers. And then, we can follow-up off-line with detail because there's a fair amount of details associated with that. But for the most part, I would say, at this point in time, we're back to a pretty high percentage of recurring fee income, across most of the footprint with a few exceptions like, in Washington state we can't charge for much of anything, as a result of some -- you may recall some changes in New York State. We had to change some fees from upfront to monthly, that's still working its way through the system. So it's not a simple answer. But I would say that for the most part we're back to sort of what we expected on a stabilized basis with a little bit yet to come. But I can follow-up off-line with a little more detail to help you kind of roadmap it. Yeah. Yes, Rich, this is Sean. It's a long answer to that one, based on the various -- moratoria and other things that are out there. What I'd say in characterizing is, that we're in the early stages of seeing the various eviction moratoria or rent caps, et cetera, et cetera, beginning to phase out. But we do think that process, for a number of different reasons, will be sort of a slow burn, if you want to call it that, over the next couple of quarters, as opposed to all of a sudden, it's kind of open game everywhere. And you're already starting to see that in terms of what's happened in various regions, whether it's Washington State, ended June 30, but there's a transitional period for 90 days. California extended through September. Local jurisdictions are prohibited from doing anything subsequent to that until March. Biden's requests obviously on the CDC side of what the government can do. So I think people are trying to find the right way to transition it. And therefore, I think, the impact of the bad debt kind of came back to normal levels, is probably a multi-quarter process to get there, as opposed to flipping a switch and it happens in one or two quarters, just based on the way things will bleed in across, not only at the state level, but at the local level as well. Yes. Jeff this is Sean. Good question. It's a question I'm not sure that has a completely knowable answer but I can say the factors that would relate to it. I mean the urban environments in terms of, what's dragging at this point in time its places that you might expect. So places that are below the 2019 peak for moving values are like New York City, the district, a little bit in some of the urban submarkets within Northern Virginia and then the urban submarkets in Northern California. And I think all of those are a function of various stages of reopening that they're in. And as the major employers call people back to work what does that look like in terms of when it happens? Is it around Labor Day? Is it thereafter? Is it everyone? Or is it partial? What happens with the university campuses and their housing? And one of the things that we don't know for sure in every case is some of the universities these have been packing in pretty tight. And as Tim referred to, if there's some de-densifying that occurs that should help support local demand outside the university campuses in terms of their dorm housing. And various other factors like that really will influence, what happens in these urban environments and we should have a much better sense of that as we get beyond Labor Day, I would say. I think a number of us expect pretty good demand through Labor Day. What does that look like and how much does that boost asking rents and therefore, lagging behind that would be move-in values. Those would be the factors you'd want to think about in terms of where you get back to -- when you get back to sort of those peak levels of move-in rents. In terms of what's in guidance, we have factored in continued growth across the markets consistent with what we have been seeing. And right now urban has been lagging and we do expect it to continue to lag the suburban environments, but catch up over the next few months is the way I would describe it in sort of general terms. Yeah, good question. A couple of different -- actually a couple of different questions in there. So first on the latter part around lease expirations, lease expirations don't -- the one piece that's different today based on the eviction moratoria and some of the rent increase caps that exist is just very little incentive for residents in some jurisdictions to actually go on to leases. So our month-to-month percentage is higher than it normally is. It's normally around 1%. It's about three times that right now around 3%. So in terms of lease expiration profile, we're not too concerned about that. And given lease breaks that occur month-to-month as we move through the year we're always resetting lease expirations as we offer new leases to make sure that stays in check. So that's just something we normally do all the time. As it relates to the first part of your question, which is more around seasonality. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we really haven't seen any seasonal softening this year that would typically occur. If you go back to normal times, rents rise pretty -- asking rents rise pretty materially from January through say mid-July, and then you start to see some seasonal adjustments and downward slope as you move through the back half of the year. We have not experienced that this year. And by all the metrics that we see in terms of lead volume, visit volume, et cetera, low availability we certainly don't see that in terms of the near-term outlook over the next 30 days or so. The question would be if you're thinking about what the risks are the delta variants and the impact on potential delays for reopening of certain companies and things like that might there be seasonality in Q4 that we're not seeing today that's a possibility. We do feel good about where we are positioned though, because again the spread between asking rents and move-in rents is about 12%. Even if those asking rents start to decelerate a little bit there's still a nice spread there to continue to grow move-in rents, even if asking rents do decelerate. So again we haven't seen that seasonal adjustment yet. But to the extent some macro factors impact it and we start to see it, we do have enough spread that we can continue to grow move-in rents. Yeah."

            "content": "Thank you, Tim. Slide four highlights our Q2 results and activity. And while we meaningfully exceeded our guidance for Q2 with core FFO of $1.98 versus guidance at the midpoint of $1.90 per share, our year-over-year core FFO figures were down 11.2% for the quarter and 14.8% year-to-date, reflecting the disruption that we've seen in our business over the last 12 months. Notably and reflecting the strong recovery that Tim emphasized, rental revenue increased on a sequential basis turning positive for the first time since March of 2020 with a 90 basis point increase on a GAAP basis and 170 basis points on a cash basis from Q1 to Q2. As Sean will delve into in more detail, rental rates improved during each month of the quarter with continued growth in July. Our development platform also continues to create meaningful shareholder value. We completed $385 million of development in the quarter and close to $1 billion through the first half of 2021. These developments are primarily suburban and are benefiting from the renter demand and increasing rents we're experiencing across our suburban communities. For our completions in the second quarter, the initial projected stabilized yield is 6.4% providing roughly 250 basis points of spread to the sub-4% stabilized cap rates we're seeing in the asset sale market today. These completed projects along with others that are in lease-up also provide a meaningful incremental boost to earnings growth as Matt will discuss in more detail. We also started $580 million of new developments in Q2 and are on track to meet our target of $1.2 billion of new starts in 2021, which we increased last quarter from our initial target of $750 million of new starts. During the quarter we raised $540 million of capital through dispositions at an average cost of capital of 3.7%. By match funding our development activity, primarily with these disposition proceeds, we in turn are able to reduce the capital cost risk associated with the earnings and NAV accretion as we execute on our development pipeline over the coming years. Slide five breaks down the components of our rental revenue change on a year-over-year basis with lower lease rates over the last 12 months and the amortization of concessions being the largest drivers of the decline. As it relates to concessions, at the end of Q2, we had a total of $29 million of previously granted concessions still to be amortized in our same-store pool over the coming quarters. However, concession usage has declined by roughly 85% since Q4 2020 from $1,900 per move-in to just above $300 in July. Slide six provides the factors leading to our increase in rental revenue from Q1 to Q2 with a turn to the positive being driven by higher occupancy and an improvement in uncollectible lease revenue. At a portfolio level, uncollectible lease revenue remains elevated with bad debt at roughly 3% versus a more normalized 50 to 60 basis points with the expectation that we'll continue to see elevated bad debt levels until eviction moratoria are behind us. Before turning it over to Sean for further context on our operating performance, slide seven illustrates our strong momentum in the form of like-term effective rent change, which turned positive in June and now stands at 5% in July. With that, I'll turn it to Sean. Thanks Kevin. Turning to our key takeaways on slide 19, we're very encouraged by the continued improvement in our operating fundamentals and believe our portfolio is well positioned for additional growth, as reflected in the growth assumptions incorporated into our second half guidance. Near-term trends in our suburban portfolio continue to look very strong, and we are hopeful that our urban communities, which have been lagging the rest of the portfolio should benefit over the coming months with a fuller return to offices and universities. As Tim mentioned at the start, we also expect that our Class A communities will continue to outperform, as higher income residents and prospects benefit from the economic recovery and seek out high-quality living environments. As discussed, our development acumen and pipeline continue to be a differentiator for us, our projects in lease-up primarily in the suburbs are benefiting from strong renter demand and we've been able to quickly scale up our development activity at attractive yields relative to stabilized cap rates. As we look forward, we expect the breadth of our development expertise will allow us to shift capital to growing markets and evolve our product offering to meet the needs of our targeted customer segments. We also see our operating platform and our investments in innovation as a differentiator. In addition to the expense reductions and the margin opportunities we discussed last quarter, our technology-forward approach positions us to be able to create de novo offerings such as Kanso bringing together the best of our operating, innovation, brand and development expertise as we evolve our offerings and create a better way to live. As we head forward, we're excited about our new growth in Raleigh-Durham, Charlotte, Dallas and Austin in addition to our continued growth in Southeast Florida and Denver bringing us to a total of six expansion markets. We're actively negotiating on opportunities in these new expansion markets and expect to grow through acquisitions, our own development and through the funding of other developers where we own the asset upon stabilization similar to the growth strategies we've successfully utilized to grow our presence in Southeast Florida and Denver. This multi-pronged approach also allows us to invest capital over different time horizons with acquisitions of existing communities being naturally the most immediate and our own development being medium term in duration. We look forward to sharing our long-term goals and portfolio allocation objectives for these markets with investors over the coming. Finally, thank you to the entire AvalonBay organization for their commitment and leadership on ESG, where our recently issued 10th Annual Responsibility Report highlighted our continued ESG leadership position across the wider REIT sector. And with that we'll open it up for questions. [Indiscernible] [24:23]. Hey, Nick, this is Ben. I'll take that one. We're not putting out a specific target at this point. As I mentioned, it's part of what we'll discuss with investors over the coming quarters and also how that ties into our overall portfolio allocation approach. But we do see this announcement as a meaningful one. We are actively engaged with specific opportunities currently on both the acquisition side and on the development side. We've been -- just for some context, we've been growing in Southeast Florida and Denver where we've set a target of 5% for each market as a goal for our overall allocation. And our rough user the Texas and North Carolina have the potential for a similar type of allocation. Overall, we're excited for opening up these new growth opportunities in these new four markets and leveraging our skills across investments development and operations over the coming years. A couple of things I'd add to Matt's comments. One, obviously, depends on the opportunity set and we hit on our prepared remarks. We look at the -- our spread to where we're developing to market cap rates today and our ability to buy match funding and we think there are some pretty attractive development profits, right, that will drive activity. And then the other part, there's our own development, but then there's also our funding of other developers. And that's a method we've been using and are looking to use more fully in our expansion markets and partially from a time perspective, right, we're able to partner up with developers who have sites that are entitled and ready to go and lets us to get activation slightly sooner than if we were going and pursuing our own development right."

Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley:\nTimothy Naughton: Okay, great. Thanks, Jason, and welcome to our Q1 call. With me today are Ben Schall, Kevin O'Shea, Matt Birenbaum and Sean Breslin. Ben, Sean and I will provide comments on the slides that we posted last night, and all of us will be available for Q&A afterward.  For our prepared comments today, I'll start by providing an overview of Q1 results. Sean will elaborate on operating trends in the portfolio. Our fundamentals have improved materially since beginning of the year, and we'll also review our Q2 outlook. And then Ben will provide some thoughts as to why we believe we are positioned for outsized growth as the recovery and expansion take hold.  Now let's turn to results for the quarter, starting on Slide 4. In terms of operating results, it was another tough quarter. Core FFO growth was down by over 18% in Q1. Same-store revenue declined by 9.1% on a year-over-year basis. Given the timing of the pandemic, which began towards the end of Q1 '20, this past quarter will be the toughest year-over-year comp we'll face this year.  On a sequential basis, the decline in same-store revenue leveled off at 1.5% from Q4, which compares to a sequential decline of 1.6% in Q4 of '20. And Sean will touch more on the sequential trends in his comments.  And then lastly, we completed almost $600 million of development in Q1 at a projected initial yield of 5.6%, well above prevailing cap rates we're seeing in the transaction markets, where cap rates are drifting down to or below 4%. Given the improvement we've seen in fundamentals, we're ramping up the development pipeline and expect to start $650 million this quarter in Q2, with much of that to be match funded with expected dispositions of approximately $500 million in the second quarter. \nSean Breslin: All right. Thanks, Tim. Moving to Slide 9. We've seen an acceleration in the trends we spoke about on our last call with physical occupancy continuing to increase during the quarter, now approaching 96%, and average move-in rent value growing steadily over the last 4 months. For April, our month-to-date average move-in rent is roughly 5% above what we experienced in January of this year and approximately 8% below the pre-COVID peak rent we achieved in March of 2020. \nBenjamin Schall: Thank you, Sean. Supported by this backdrop of improving operating fundamentals, we believe that we are well positioned to generate outsized growth as the economy recharges. As we look to the composition of our existing portfolio, each of the subsegments highlighted on Slide 15 have been impacted in varying degrees during the pandemic, and each have their distinct growth opportunities as we look forward.  Our largest segment at 40% of revenue is in what we've called out as other suburban to differentiate it from more densely populated job center suburban markets. This 40% of our portfolio was the least impacted by the pandemic, and our current asking -- our current average asking rent is 6% above the pre-pandemic peak rent we achieved in March of last year. We continue to push asking rents in these submarkets, and concessions have largely been eliminated.  Our next largest segment at 28% of the portfolio represents communities and job center suburban markets, including our transit-oriented development. This is like Redmond, Washington; Tysons Corner in Virginia; and Assembly Row in Massachusetts. Operating fundamentals in many of these suburban locations have been more significantly impacted with asking rents still 3% to 4% below pre-pandemic levels and with the continued use of concessions in certain markets. Our expectation is that as people increasingly return to the office and nearby restaurants and as other amenities start to reopen more fully, we will increasingly see prospects that seek out these environments for walkability, ease of transportation and the array of services provided.  For our communities and urban environments, we have a mix of core urban, effectively central business districts, and secondary urban, locations like Jersey City, New Jersey; and the Rosslyn-Ballston Corridor in Northern Virginia, which make up 19% and 13% of our portfolio, respectively. As Sean noted, occupancy in our urban portfolio has climbed more than 500 basis points, and rents are trending upward in pretty much all of the urban environments. And this has occurred with urban office usage still at very low levels of less than 20%. As a return to offices starts to gain real momentum this summer and leading up to Labor Day, we do expect a significant rebound in our urban portfolio as in prior cycles.  This is a theme that we expect to be true across much of our portfolio. And as shown on Chart 1 of Slide 16, Class A communities, which represent approximately 70% of our portfolio, have historically outperformed early in cycles. We expect similar trends in this recovery, particularly as the traditional higher-income AVB resident is poised to benefit financially as the economy heats up. And while our residents stand to benefit from the recovery, it is also becoming more challenging for those interested in buying a home to afford one, given the acceleration in home prices in many of our coastal markets. Chart 2 on Slide 16 shows this long-term affordability trend and the growing attractiveness of renting versus owning a home in our markets. \nTimothy Naughton: Great. Thanks, Ben. And just turning to the last slide and to summarize some key points for the quarter, Slide 20. Q1 was a challenging quarter in terms of results. But as I mentioned before, it is expected to be the toughest year-over-year revenue comp we see this year.  In addition, the recovery in fundamentals is taking hold in our markets as Sean discussed. And many suburban submarkets are now at or above pre-COVID levels, while the early improvement we're seeing in urban submarkets should gain strength midyear and into the fall as workers return back to the office.  And lastly, as Ben mentioned in his remarks, we believe we are very well positioned over the next few years due to a number of factors, including our coastal market footprint, a portfolio that is heavily concentrated in urban and job center urban -- job center infill urban -- infill suburban markets, excuse me, the rising cost of homeownership, healthy performance and a ramp in our development pipeline, margin improvement in our stabilized portfolio due to innovation in the operating model and then lastly, a leadership position in ESG, where the investment we've made over the last several years is paying off in terms of OpEx savings and stakeholder engagement.  So with that, operator, Anna, we'd be happy to open the call for questions.\nOperator: . And we'll now take a question from Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNicholas Joseph: Maybe just starting off with guidance. I was wondering if you can talk through the decision to not issue full year guidance at this point. Just given that we already have 1Q results and the operating trends that you've walked through, what held back that decision to institute 2021 guidance?\nKevin O'Shea: Nick, this is Kevin. Yes. I mean as we've indicated before, providing quarterly guidance, which is what we've done this week -- this quarter, is consistent with how we have been managing the business as we move through a pretty dynamic environment and in an uncertain period of time. But given the stability and the growth that we're seeing in April and as we head into May, as Sean pointed out, we do expect to be able to provide guidance for the balance of the year in connection with our second quarter call after we've had a chance to complete our customary midyear reforecast, which is a lot more fulsome than the Q1 reforecast process that we do for this call.\nNicholas Joseph: That's helpful. And then for the $650 million of starts this quarter, what's the expected initial yield on those? And then is that on in-place rents or trended rents?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Nick, it's Matt. Yes, those deals, the yield is kind of very consistent with where our current development under way is. It's kind of high 5s, and that's pretty much in every case. When we quote yields, we're quoting based on today's rents, today's cost. We don't trend it. So -- and in fact, on our development attachment, we don't mark those rents to current market until we get at least about 20% leased. So that's why we see most of the rents in the attachment are still what we were carrying when we started the job. So my guess is, given where we are today and given the ones we haven't started at today's market, there's probably a pretty good chance that we'll exceed the underwriting on those by the time they stabilize.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore.\nRichard Hightower: I think Nick took two of my questions, so let me fire a different one at you. But just to follow up on the development question. We could -- we probably said the same thing for the last 5 or 10 years, but market cap rates can't go any lower than they are. And so if -- tell us how you think about the possibility of market cap rates expanding from here and perhaps that yield differential narrowing as you think about that high 5s development yield target? How much cushion do you sort of bake into the way you think about that?\nTimothy Naughton: Rich, Tim here. I mean as Kevin has mentioned plenty of times in the past, I mean, we -- it is something we take into consideration. It informs how we think about match funding the development book. And I think we showed this quarter, it's largely matched funded, and we expect as -- if there -- if we believe that there's capital market risk, that we're going to be closer to 100% match-funded, which means, essentially, at the time we start construction is making the big capital commitment, the permanent capital has already been raised either in the form of equity, debt or dispositions.\nRichard Hightower: Okay. That's fine. And then just on the expense guidance, I know that we are lapping a tough comp in 2Q, and there's a little bit of detail in the slide deck on this. But maybe just break down some of the categories where you expect the biggest year-over-year growth in expenses.\nSean Breslin: Yes, Rich, this is Sean. I mean, I hate to say it, but it's pretty broad-based. I mean, if you think about what happened in Q2 last year, things really shut down. So turnover decline, we draw back to strictly essential maintenance only for our resident customers. We pulled back on marketing, given sort of the demand shock. We had talked to the hiring freeze.  So if you think about all the various sort of maintenance activities, payroll, et cetera, we're expecting all of those to look more normal as compared to the depressed levels that we experienced in Q2 of 2020. So it's relatively broad-based. Most of it is on the sort of what I would call the controllable side of things, and it's a more modest increase in taxes and insurance. But all the activity kind of base costs and payroll really are coming up pretty materially on a year-over-year basis.\nOperator: We'll now take a question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRichard Hill: I want to spend maybe a little bit more time talking about your suburban versus urban portfolio. We're right there with you on the urban portfolio and the inflections that we're seeing, and we think they're very real. But as you think about the urban portfolio, you and your peers have noted that rents are above, in many cases, pre-COVID levels.  How are we supposed to think about those suburban markets going forward? Is there any chance that they begin to normalize, while urban markets are inflecting? Or do you think that there's more than sufficient demand coming from a younger generation that can support that?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Rich, Sean. I'm happy to start and anyone else can jump in. I think you said that rents in our urban portfolio are above the pre-COVID peak. That's actually not the case.\nRichard Hill: Yes, I maybe misheard. Yes.\nSean Breslin: Yes. In other words, asking rents in the urban portfolio down about 8% from the pre-COVID peak. But in the suburban portfolio, we're up a little more than 2%. And I'd say, certainly, we'll see a snapback, and we've already started to see that in the urban submarkets. But the suburbs are pretty healthy. I mean if you keep in mind the slide that Ben showed, there's still a number of these sort of job center suburban submarkets that have probably another leg to come because people have not been called back to the office. If you think of just sort of maybe even the kind of the headline FANG stock, as an example, they -- people have gotten called back to Google and Facebook and Apple and Amazon and Microsoft over at Redmond. So there's some pretty good embedded demand that should be coming back to those environments that should support the suburban portfolio.  And then additionally, also as Ben pointed out, if you look at sort of the single-family side, it's a very tight market. Prices, if you go look at kind of home price inflation on a year-over-year basis, it's up kind of double digits. So the ability to exit into that product is more constrained. It's just not as available.  So I think there's a number of factors when you look at the suburban portfolio that give it a fairly high tailwind. You may not see the same sort of percentage gain over the next couple of quarters as people come back to these urban environments just because it's so concentrated, but there's still some very good sort of demand tailwinds in the suburban -- for the suburban portfolio over the next quarter -- couple of quarters as well. So Tim, do you want to add on to that?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. Yes, Richard, I think the other aspect to your question is just the notion that we would expect as the economy reopens and these urban markets reopen, we're going to just see convergence in performance. So there's going to be some normalization. I think Sean is right. It doesn't mean we're going to see suburban rents fall while urban rents rise because there's some -- there's still some pretty compelling supply-demand dynamics going on in the suburbs.  But as I mentioned on the last call, I do think as you sort of think out, you look out over the next few years, supply, I think, in the urban markets is frankly to be quite a bit lower than what we see in the suburbs. And in some ways, you may see the relationship between urban and suburban flip this coming cycle relative to what we saw in the last cycle where urban demand was stronger, but urban demand -- urban supply have more than offset that. So the suburbs actually outperformed.  You get out 3 or 4 years from now, so I think I mentioned this in the last call, 2024, '25, I would not be surprised if you see urban more than -- urban outperforming the suburban markets. When you look long term at our markets, that's one of the reasons why we've been somewhat agnostic, and we want to have a diversified portfolio.  Really, the winners and losers are really kind of at the MSA level, and the performance tends to normalize over time between the urban, suburban markets. It's a dynamic market both on the demand and the supply side. But I think we are at a moment in time, obviously, right now, where urban is massively underperforming suburban. But we think we're kind of on the precipice where those lines are going to start to converge.\nRichard Hill: Yes. And the reason I focus on it is I look at your weekly asking rent chart that looks like we're back to -- pretty close to back to pre-COVID levels. But it just strikes me, given this dynamic that you're talking about, if you're looking at that one singular chart and suburban is above COVID and we're inflecting on urban, isn't there a really good chance that asking rents could completely overshoot on a weighted average basis as this recovery continues?\nTimothy Naughton: No. Absolutely. You think about the reopening combined with the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus being injected in the economy, I think we could see it really much closer to a V-shape recovery than I think any of us were thinking about 3, 6 months ago. I think maybe with -- inside of a K-shape recovery because it's going to be an uneven -- I think it's likely to be an uneven recovery, still favoring the educated and knowledge-based jobs. But that one slide that Ben showed that actually broke down the portfolio into the 4 buckets is pretty telling, right? I mean you had the other suburban at 6% asking rent growth and the job center suburban a little over -- down about 3%, secondary urban down 6% and core urban down 8%. That's -- those are pretty big disparities from just a year ago, right, that, yes, as the economy reopens, we would just expect things to start leveling off a bit.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: You've been a very consistent seller of assets at attractive returns and economic gains over the last -- throughout your history. But right now, with cap rates compressing and 1031 on the table for potentially being repealed, do you think about expediting sales at all?\nTimothy Naughton: So John, your question is because 1031 may come off the table, I mean it's -- we've used 1031s, but we haven't had to use them extensively. We typically have a couple hundred million -- $200 million, $300 million sort of gains capacity in a typical year that we can absorb on the sales side. So really -- it's really a function of how much portfolio recycling we really need to do. We've been pretty aggressive about it over the last few years. And we've used the 1031s on a limited basis to help kind of manage the tax impact. But for the most part, we basically have just absorbed the gains capacity that we have embedded in our earnings.\nJohn Kim: So it's not just the 1031 but just the cap rates compressing so much, and is this a better time today to sell assets that are maybe a little bit older in your portfolio than it would be the last few years?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. No, I think that's a fair point. It's something we debate when we look at asset sales, we look at equity, we look at debt. Debt is still the most compelling source of capital today for us. But asset sales are creeping closer for sure just in terms of what we're seeing, the additional compression in cap rates and asset values. And a lot of the submarkets, particularly the suburban submarkets, are actually up from pre-COVID level. So it's a fair point. It does inform some of our capital allocation decisions at the margin, for sure.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And then you've had notably stronger rental growth in April in Southeast Florida and Denver. Do you see that outperformance continuing for the rest of the year? And also, how important is it for you to either expedite your exposure in those markets or potentially enter new markets, given this validated your strategy to enter them?\nSean Breslin: Yes. John, this is Sean. I'll take the first one, and then I'll let Tim talk about sort of the expansion market strategy a bit. But the first one, one thing to recognize is that at present, those 2 expansion markets represent a very small basket of assets. So noise from one asset to another can create some volatility here. So the kind of growth that we've seen on a year-over-year basis in Q1, I would not expect that to be same level moving forward for the balance of the year. There's just some unique factors with 1 or 2 of those assets. And when you only have 3 or 4 in the basket, it can move the needle quite a bit within 1 quarter. So I wouldn't count on that as sort of the run rate for the balance of the year.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. John, this is Matt. I guess to the second question about kind of what our appetite is, I mean we said we are looking to grow both of those markets to be roughly at least 5% of our portfolio. And so I think right now, including nonsame-store, they're probably about 2% each. So we still have a ways to go. We do have starts planned in both of those regions in the next quarter or 2. So we are continuing to move forward with development there. We have additional pipeline starts that are probably '22 starts in each of those regions, and we're out looking for more. And we're actively pursuing acquisitions in both of those markets as well. And we'll continue to do what we've done in the past, which is we find acquisitions, rotate capital out of some of our legacy markets to fund that.  As it relates to other markets beyond those, I mean, I think we've said before that we are looking at other markets. We don't have anything to announce at this time. But we are looking for markets that are going to be over-indexed to the knowledge economy and over-indexed to kind of the higher-income jobs, the higher education jobs, which we think will drive outsized performance for our portfolio. And we do think Denver and Florida are 2 of those markets, and there are others as well that probably fit that description over time.\nOperator: Your next question will be from Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRichard Anderson: So I heard you sort of adjusting maybe at the margin some of the product that you're planning to deliver. You mentioned townhomes and direct-entry-type product. And I'm curious if a hybrid office environment is sort of the first landing point for the office business, is that actually a good thing for multifamily in your property, in particular? Because they need to be close to the office, but they're also going to spend more time at home, so more attention spent on having usable space where they live, too. Do you kind of see hybrid office is a good thing for your business?\nTimothy Naughton: Rich, I think, as I mentioned before, kind of agnostic between urban and suburban and that we're generally looking at where we think there's -- we're going to tilt towards where we think there's more -- there's better value. And I think it argues that there's just -- that suburban household formation should be a little stronger this cycle than last cycle as people don't have to commute as many days. And it just ought to spread the workforce out within an MSA and maybe across broader geography as well as people -- there'll be some folks who could be able to telecommute 100% of the time. But for those that are more in a hybrid situation, absolutely. We think there's going to be some people at the margin that are going to be willing to live 10, 15 miles further out than they otherwise would because they only have to be in the office 2 or 3 days a week versus 5 days a week. And we're in a position to capture them in either case. So...\nRichard Anderson: Right, right. And the second question is, any other sort of post-pandemic changes that you're seeing in terms of how the business -- the cadence of the business? Is there any silver lines such as perhaps more likelihood to live alone, that kind of thing? Are you seeing anything like that? Or is it just too soon to tell at this point?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Rich, it's Sean. I'd say it's probably a little too early to tell. I think when we get up to the sort of other side of the pandemic, things stabilize, we'll have a better sense of has resident profile really changed in terms of suburban or urban assets. And as we continue to communicate with our residents, maybe kind of touching on the last question that you had, that may inform our product choices in some of those suburban markets in terms of some of the larger floor plans, what we provide in the way of workspace or work lounges in the building and program in more townhomes in some cases or things like that. It's probably just a little too early to peg that just yet.\nOperator: We will now take a question from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Matt, curious if you can give us some sense of the compression in development yields, not on starts that you're about -- or projects you're about to start, but if these construction cost pressures prove more persistent a year from now, what kind of development yield compression will we be looking at?\nMatthew Birenbaum: I wish I knew, John. I do think that cost pressures are definitely rising. But on the other hand, there's also the numerator, right? And we're underwriting deals still with rents that are, for the most part, less than maybe they were in the prior peak because a lot of our suburban development is job center suburban. Maybe in some of the other suburban category from Ben's slide, maybe some of that rents are higher than the prior peak in terms of what we're underwriting.  So I do think there's still some list to come on the numerator. And I guess what I would say is on the denominator, what we've seen so far, the deals that we're lining up now in many cases, our total capital cost for those deals isn't any higher than it was a year ago. Maybe it's higher than it was 6 months ago as lumber has come up some, but there were some other trades costs which came down a little bit. Soft costs may have softened a bit.  So certainly, there's going to be some cost pressures going forward. And we're mindful of that. If anything, the margin right now is wider than it was on deals we started a year or 2 ago just because of what's happened to asset values and cap rates on the other side. So there's probably a little bit of room there.\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. John, I guess I'd say, I think the market, if I had a guess, would be betting on NOIs outpacing total development costs over the next 12 months. There's clearly some inflation pressures because of supply chain issues, I think, as your question implies, and a real question in how transitory versus sort of permanent those cost pressures will be. But there's some pretty good pressures building on the rent side, too. And so I think that's -- I know you all have written a lot about the supply side and sort of stay in sort of stubbornly in that 350,000 to 400,000 range. I expect it's going to continue because I think as people are looking at economics, and the people that do trends, things are probably looking better today than they were maybe even a year ago.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. That makes sense. Understood. Last one for me. Sean, in markets where you've had to pull the concession lever harder, as we anniversary the vintage and leases signed with concession, do you expect occupancy to decline in the next few months due to just lower retention?\nSean Breslin: Yes. No, good question, John. I mean, I think it speaks to sort of the, I guess, you want to call it sort of the durability of the customers that have allowed us to build occupancy. I mean we'll see. The -- I mean if you look at sort of our portfolio income levels for our residents are down about 6% on a year-over-year basis. So there's -- based on what we've seen, I'd say there's some embedded capacity there to pay. Whether people want to pay or not will be a question that we'll have to come across here.  So I mean, in Q1, we started to see pretty good lift. Turnover was up but not for really financial reasons, just for other reasons in terms of people wanting to move for whether it's roommate situations or all the other sort of typical stuff. So it doesn't seem to be, based on what we're realizing from our customers today, much in the way of financial pressure. As we move through the second and third quarter, particularly in the urban environments, we'll have a much better sense for that.  So could there be a little bit of pressure there? Yes. I mean the other thing that I think we're going to see is right now, Tim talked about the bad debt kind of lapping the bad debt side of it. At some point, as we get it on the other side of the eviction moratoria, some of that bad debt is going to convert to just physical vacancy. So you'll see a little bit of that start to trickle in, in the back half of the year, just depending on what happens in the overall regulatory environment. So maybe a little noisy in terms of physical occupancy as it relates to that one issue alone in a couple of markets, particularly places like L.A., as an example.\nOperator: We'll now take a question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Just a question on development, given the positive outlook that you have in your markets and some of the benefits you spoke to from the stimulus entering the system, how are you guys thinking about just sizing up the development pipeline overall in the next couple of years?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. I can start, and maybe Ben or Matt wants to jump in. As Ben had mentioned, we are kind of up in our outlook here of -- to over $1 billion this year. And as we've talked about sort of years past, middle of last cycle, development pipeline was probably about $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion in terms of kind of how it was scaled. And we kind of rescaled it as we got into later part of the cycle in a downturn to something that's more in the $800 million to $900 million range. We think we can flex that up pretty easily to $1.2 billion without too much trouble and probably to $1.5 billion. So I think kind of -- those are the kind of ranges we're looking at right now, absent potentially entering some new markets and expanding the footprint.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. And then as far as some of the initiatives you guys outlined, the $10 million from some of the things you've already deployed on the technology side and then you outlined another $25 million to $30 million, what's the total investment that goes into generating that incremental NOI?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes, Austin, good question. So the way I'd lay it out for you is that the technology initiatives around the digital platform, the AI that Ben described and things like that, that will be roughly around $30 million. And then beyond that, the smart access and smart home component is the piece that's up in air. It's a little bit of a TBD based on customer adoption, what they're willing to pay, what features they want. Is it just the smart access component for guests? Or is it more along the lines of thermostat control, lighting, various sort of things. So that's a little bit of a TBD on the investment. But the foundational elements to have the infrastructure, the digital platforms and all that is around $30 million.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBradley Heffern: Just circling back to the development question. I'm curious, last cycle and typically at the beginning of a cycle, you've seen a big trough in supply. And that's part of the reason that you ramp development at the beginning of the cycle. Certainly, we haven't seen as much of that this time around. So I'm curious, does that moderate your expectations as to how big the program could go versus how large it got in kind of 2013, '14, '15, that time frame?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. It became awfully profitable, right, last cycle, particularly for the first 3 years. It's -- we're developing a value creation margins that we hadn't seen really before, probably in the 40%, 45% range in some cases. So I think the range I talked about is right, the kind of the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. It's probably a little less as it relates to enterprise value to maybe what you're driving at. But no, I think it's about $1 billion, $1.5 billion seems about right just in terms of the opportunity set within our markets and kind of where the platform has scaled and what the balance sheet can kind of handle without sort of over-relying on the equity markets being continuously open.\nBradley Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then you touched on bad debt a little bit, but I was just curious, it's hung out in the 3% range for several quarters now. Has there been any movement on that in April? And have you seen any impact from the federal funds at this point?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Brad. This is Sean. Happy to chat about that, and then Kevin could jump in if he'd like. But yes, I mean, I think, for us, we're not expecting a meaningful shift in bad debt until we get beyond kind of the moratoria that's in place today, which is likely in the second half of the year. There's a number of orders that are right now set to expire in June, I think June 30. Some may be extended. Some may not. It's a little too early to tell. So we're not seeing a lot of movement right now sort of month-to-month in terms of a significant shift one way or another in bad debt. I suspect as customers see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the eviction option becoming available to us, we're going to see some greater movement.  And then on the stimulus side, yes, we're heavily involved in that. In some places, we can apply sort of in bulk on behalf of our customers. In other locations, we prompt them with e-mails where they have to sign up, and then we ultimately receive the fund. So we receive some funds, but I would tell you, it's been very slow and it's been sort of trickling as opposed to a big avalanche of funds So I just don't think the agencies that are within these states and counties are set up to administer the funds. They just weren't set up for that. And therefore, it's taken quite a bit of time for them to figure out how to develop a process to make it work at resident certifications, how do we get the funds to the landlord, to validate it's the right owner, all that kind of stuff. It's just been painfully slow.\nOperator: We'll now take a question from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Just going back to the development, I saw that you guys -- the yields on the stuff that you have in the pipeline now are only 20 basis points lower. But just help me walk through. I mean 2x4 lumber, I mean anything mechanical, anything involving construction or -- is just through the roof. I mean double-digit increases, substantial increases. Rents haven't kept pace. I understand the wider margin given the cap rate compression. So just help me understand why development yields really seem unaffected, given that rents are softer, construction costs are through the roof, labor is still a challenge. What's the offset? Just help me understand.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Alex, it's Matt. So on the stuff that's currently under way, that's all bought out. So that part is...\nAlexander Goldfarb: That part, I get. That part, I get.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. In some cases, there are actually savings there because there was some sense that there was pretty strong momentum in construction cost inflation in many of our markets pre-pandemic. So a lot of it has to do with what Tim was saying, is it going to be kind of transitory based on supply chain bottlenecks or not.  But I think there's a little bit of an underappreciation about how our cost breakdown actually works. I mean if you think of a typical development deal and you say, for every dollar that's in a total development budget, $0.15 to $0.20 is land. So that -- and everything that's in our pipeline, for the most part, is land that we contracted before the pandemic. In some cases, there was an opportunity to recut some of those land deals in some situations based on the slowdown we saw last year. Then you probably have anywhere from $0.15 to $0.20 that is soft cost, whether that's architectural engineering fees, permits, capitalized interest, which has come down. So there's a little bit of an offset there.  And then you have maybe $0.60 to $0.65 that's the actual hard cost. And then when you drill down on that piece, probably 2/3 of that is labor, and 1/3 of that is materials. And actually, even on the materials, when you peel it back further, a lot of those materials, it's not an appliance that you're buying. It's a roof truss, which is lumber, but it's also labor to put the roof truss together.  So probably the key is the pressure on labor cost. That's what would really move the equation more. I mean we can see lumbers double, then it probably increases the total capital budget of a job by 3%, for example, 2% or 3%, which is something. But probably, that's the thing I would keep an eye on would be labor cost because if that starts to really move, that would start to .\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. And Alex, maybe explaining this real quick. I think in reality, we underwrite on a current basis, as Matt mentioned before, current cost, current rents, current OpEx. I think in reality, the yields have deteriorated a little bit. So the deals that Matt talked about were going to start in the high 5s. When we first put those in a contract, went through due diligence, they're probably low 6s in reality. So if you think about it over the last 2 years, rents, maybe they're flattish overall, particularly in the suburban markets, given that's where the focus of the development pipeline is. And costs are up, the denominator is up a little bit. And so I think you probably have seen some deterioration of -- I don't know where to bracket, but somewhere between 25 and 50 basis points of yield erosion. But you've seen cap rate compression that more or less offset that.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. That's helpful. And then the second question, as you guys think about the new markets that you want to enter, there's obviously a cost and efficiency, critical mass, get a platform. How do you guys weigh straight-up acquisitions? I'm not saying that you guys go out and sort of bulk purchase a bunch of communities. But how do you weigh pushing on just buying some existing deals even if the yields are a little skinnier than you'd want versus using your development partnership with like local landowners to get better yields, but understanding that it's going to take a longer time to establish that critical mass as you enter new markets. How do you balance those two?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Alex, this is Matt. I mean, basically, what we've been taking the approach is all of the above. So we're looking to buy existing assets. What we found in the expansion market so far has been it's been an opportunity to buy, in general, brand-new or very young assets and not necessarily pay a premium on a cap rate basis versus older assets. So that's where we've tended to buy so far just because of relative value.  But ultimately, we'd like to own some older communities in those regions as well just for price point diversification. So we're looking to buy. We're looking to build. And we're also looking to capitalize third-party developers, which we've done successfully. In fact, the deal we just completed last quarter in Doral in the Miami area was a partnership with a local merchant builder there, where we funded it. And we work together on the deal. So that's kind of an expansion of our model a bit that we've -- I think we're leaning on in these expansion markets. So that gives us another way we can get capital into these markets and grow our portfolio more quickly. So I don't think we view it as an either/or. We view it as an all of the above.\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. And Alex, the only other thing I would add to that, it also gives us an opportunity to allocate capital over a period of time because they don't -- they're not all on the same time horizon, right? So you buy assets today, if you're funding a third-party developer that may be capital that goes out over the next 1 to 3 years. If you're developing for your own account where you're having to go through the entitlement process yourself, that's maybe more of a 3- to 5-year time horizon. So it allows us to diversify across time as well as sort of buy product in a market.\nOperator: And we'll now take our next question from Alua Askarbek with Bank of America.\nAlua Askarbek: I'll just be really quick. I want to ask a little bit more about Park Loggia. So it seems like you guys had some good traction on the commercial leasing this quarter. Can you tell us who the tenants are and what box sizes are left that you guys have to lease? And then I think a while ago, you guys mentioned that it would be about $10 million in NOI annually once it's stabilized. Are you still on track for that?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Sure. This is Matt. I -- just to give you an update on the retail, as we mentioned in the earnings release, we did lease the remainder of the second space -- second-floor space last quarter. So we're now about 87% leased on the retail, and these are about 8,500 square feet remaining on the ground floor with Broadway bunch. And our sense is for that remaining space, we're going to be patient to find -- wait for kind of activity to restart in New York, which hopefully, we'll start to see pick up in a more meaningful way in the next couple of quarters. That is high dollar space. But the second-floor space that we leased was leased to a medical user. So on the second floor, we have them. We have Fidelity, which is open and operating with a financial services office. And on the ground floor, we have spectrum for a small portion of the ground floor. We have Target with their entrance, and then they have below-grade space there. And then we have kind of the remaining available space on the ground floor.  So we'll see where it settles out in terms of long term, does it generate the amount of NOI that we had talked about before. Obviously, street retail in New York is softer than it was, but a lot of it is going to depend on what we wind up getting for that remaining ground floor space.\nOperator: . We'll now take a question from Brent Dilts with UBS.\nBrent Dilts: Given the return to office is expected to extend through the fall, how do you think that might impact the usual seasonal leasing trends as this year plays out?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Brent, it's Sean. Good question. Not sure we know the answer just yet in terms of how it's going to play out other than I would say, based on the data that we're seeing from prospects and new leases in certain markets, we are seeing some people come back to some of these urban environments from more distant locations than normal. So like in New York City in the past quarter, when you look at the distribution of the leases that we signed and where they came from, more people from locations that are, let's just say, greater than 50 miles away. So we're starting to see some percentage come back.  How it plays out, it's hard to tell. Obviously, as companies further announce what's happening with their return-to-office dates and the trend for universities in terms of on-campus learning in the fall has been pretty positive so far, I think, for our business, where most universities are planning for full on-campus learning, which should be a benefit to these major urban markets for their universities.  And even if we -- as Ben pointed out, office occupancy is less than 20%. So it doesn't take a lot to start to move the needle. Even if we get to 50%, 60%, 70% of what it was previously, that's a pretty good movement from where we are today. So I think it's going to be a pretty positive trend between now and Labor Day. It's hard to say exactly how it's going to play out in terms of getting back to what we would think of as sort of pre-pandemic normal levels, and we really won't know that until we get past Labor Day.\nBrent Dilts: Yes. Makes sense. Okay. And then just one other. On new leases in urban markets, what trends are you seeing in terms of demand by unit type or price point?\nSean Breslin: Yes. The only thing I'd say is in the urban pockets that we're still seeing some difficulty with studio units in terms of single households. So if you look at overall occupancy, they're trailing the portfolio average a couple of hundred basis points. It's most acute in the places you would expect, New York City, DC, San Francisco, urban Boston, places like that. That's really the difference we're seeing in terms of sort of bedroom type at this point in time. There's just not as much demand for single occupancy yet.\nOperator: We'll now move to Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.\nDennis McGill: First question just goes back to the margin potential from some of the technology investments. How should we think about the baseline for that 200 basis point improvement. If we look pre-COVID kind of in the 71%, 72% range, that sort of more peakish cycle how would you think about maybe a normalized margin? And then what this savings would do on top of that?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. No. Good question, Dennis. And what we look at is kind of our stabilized base years, what we call it. And so for the most part, it's kind of a blend. But if you use 2019 as kind of a proxy for controllable NOI margins, excluding taxes and insurance. That's how we think of where the base year is. And the movement from there, obviously, things have distorted during the pandemic, given what's happened, but that would be kind of the way we're looking at it at least.\nDennis McGill: So essentially just controlling for property taxes versus pre-COVID?\nTimothy Naughton: Exactly. With insurance, yes, which pushes those margins. If you look at it carefully and go back there, for example, like '18, '19, those extra margins, excluding that, we're kind of in the 80% range, 80%-plus, if you map out each one in terms of what you've got up there in terms of '18 and '19, but '19 is really kind of a base year.\nDennis McGill: Okay. That's helpful. And then this is probably tougher, but just wondering how you think about it. With the economies reopening in some of these urban environments, in particular, and you have a lot of young adults that are moving back in who were back home or doubled up in some fashion, there's probably a pent-up demand element that the markets are experiencing right now. How do you get comfort around what that next leg of demand might look like, whether there's a continuation of pent-up demand or whether there's going to be an air pocket at some point once you get through sort of satisfying that first level of pent-up demand?\nTimothy Naughton: Yes. Good question. I'm not sure exactly how to answer the air pocket question. I mean we certainly expect people that left these urban environments to come back, not 100%, but people come back. What percent is sort of pure speculation. That would be hard for us or anyone else to say what the number is.  In terms of air pocket beyond that, it really just is a function of sort of the macroeconomy, what's happening with jobs and income growth and sort of more the normal factors that drive the business in terms of demand characteristics. On the supply side, we talked about that a little bit. We expect that to be relatively constant. Probably have a little bit of a tailwind from the single-family market, as Ben pointed out, just given the affordability issues in our legacy markets.  So I think really, I would just sort of pause and look at it as what's the macro environment looks like from a demand and supply standpoint? And how does that support the business going forward once we get to the other side of the pandemic.\nOperator: And it appears there are no further telephone questions. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Naughton for any additional or closing remarks.\nTimothy Naughton: Great. Thank you, Anna. Thanks, everyone, for being on the call today. I know it's a busy day and a busy week. We look forward to catching up with you in early June, at least virtually, I think, in NAREIT. So enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks.\nOperator: And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Timothy Naughton",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Ben. And just turning to the last slide and to summarize some key points for the quarter, Slide 20. Q1 was a challenging quarter in terms of results. But as I mentioned before, it is expected to be the toughest year-over-year revenue comp we see this year.  In addition, the recovery in fundamentals is taking hold in our markets as Sean discussed. And many suburban submarkets are now at or above pre-COVID levels, while the early improvement we're seeing in urban submarkets should gain strength midyear and into the fall as workers return back to the office.  And lastly, as Ben mentioned in his remarks, we believe we are very well positioned over the next few years due to a number of factors, including our coastal market footprint, a portfolio that is heavily concentrated in urban and job center urban -- job center infill urban -- infill suburban markets, excuse me, the rising cost of homeownership, healthy performance and a ramp in our development pipeline, margin improvement in our stabilized portfolio due to innovation in the operating model and then lastly, a leadership position in ESG, where the investment we've made over the last several years is paying off in terms of OpEx savings and stakeholder engagement.  So with that, operator, Anna, we'd be happy to open the call for questions. Rich, Tim here. I mean as Kevin has mentioned plenty of times in the past, I mean, we -- it is something we take into consideration. It informs how we think about match funding the development book. And I think we showed this quarter, it's largely matched funded, and we expect as -- if there -- if we believe that there's capital market risk, that we're going to be closer to 100% match-funded, which means, essentially, at the time we start construction is making the big capital commitment, the permanent capital has already been raised either in the form of equity, debt or dispositions. Yes. Yes, Richard, I think the other aspect to your question is just the notion that we would expect as the economy reopens and these urban markets reopen, we're going to just see convergence in performance. So there's going to be some normalization. I think Sean is right. It doesn't mean we're going to see suburban rents fall while urban rents rise because there's some -- there's still some pretty compelling supply-demand dynamics going on in the suburbs.  But as I mentioned on the last call, I do think as you sort of think out, you look out over the next few years, supply, I think, in the urban markets is frankly to be quite a bit lower than what we see in the suburbs. And in some ways, you may see the relationship between urban and suburban flip this coming cycle relative to what we saw in the last cycle where urban demand was stronger, but urban demand -- urban supply have more than offset that. So the suburbs actually outperformed.  You get out 3 or 4 years from now, so I think I mentioned this in the last call, 2024, '25, I would not be surprised if you see urban more than -- urban outperforming the suburban markets. When you look long term at our markets, that's one of the reasons why we've been somewhat agnostic, and we want to have a diversified portfolio.  Really, the winners and losers are really kind of at the MSA level, and the performance tends to normalize over time between the urban, suburban markets. It's a dynamic market both on the demand and the supply side. But I think we are at a moment in time, obviously, right now, where urban is massively underperforming suburban. But we think we're kind of on the precipice where those lines are going to start to converge. No. Absolutely. You think about the reopening combined with the amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus being injected in the economy, I think we could see it really much closer to a V-shape recovery than I think any of us were thinking about 3, 6 months ago. I think maybe with -- inside of a K-shape recovery because it's going to be an uneven -- I think it's likely to be an uneven recovery, still favoring the educated and knowledge-based jobs. But that one slide that Ben showed that actually broke down the portfolio into the 4 buckets is pretty telling, right? I mean you had the other suburban at 6% asking rent growth and the job center suburban a little over -- down about 3%, secondary urban down 6% and core urban down 8%. That's -- those are pretty big disparities from just a year ago, right, that, yes, as the economy reopens, we would just expect things to start leveling off a bit. So John, your question is because 1031 may come off the table, I mean it's -- we've used 1031s, but we haven't had to use them extensively. We typically have a couple hundred million -- $200 million, $300 million sort of gains capacity in a typical year that we can absorb on the sales side. So really -- it's really a function of how much portfolio recycling we really need to do. We've been pretty aggressive about it over the last few years. And we've used the 1031s on a limited basis to help kind of manage the tax impact. But for the most part, we basically have just absorbed the gains capacity that we have embedded in our earnings. Yes. No, I think that's a fair point. It's something we debate when we look at asset sales, we look at equity, we look at debt. Debt is still the most compelling source of capital today for us. But asset sales are creeping closer for sure just in terms of what we're seeing, the additional compression in cap rates and asset values. And a lot of the submarkets, particularly the suburban submarkets, are actually up from pre-COVID level. So it's a fair point. It does inform some of our capital allocation decisions at the margin, for sure. Rich, I think, as I mentioned before, kind of agnostic between urban and suburban and that we're generally looking at where we think there's -- we're going to tilt towards where we think there's more -- there's better value. And I think it argues that there's just -- that suburban household formation should be a little stronger this cycle than last cycle as people don't have to commute as many days. And it just ought to spread the workforce out within an MSA and maybe across broader geography as well as people -- there'll be some folks who could be able to telecommute 100% of the time. But for those that are more in a hybrid situation, absolutely. We think there's going to be some people at the margin that are going to be willing to live 10, 15 miles further out than they otherwise would because they only have to be in the office 2 or 3 days a week versus 5 days a week. And we're in a position to capture them in either case. So... Yes. John, I guess I'd say, I think the market, if I had a guess, would be betting on NOIs outpacing total development costs over the next 12 months. There's clearly some inflation pressures because of supply chain issues, I think, as your question implies, and a real question in how transitory versus sort of permanent those cost pressures will be. But there's some pretty good pressures building on the rent side, too. And so I think that's -- I know you all have written a lot about the supply side and sort of stay in sort of stubbornly in that 350,000 to 400,000 range. I expect it's going to continue because I think as people are looking at economics, and the people that do trends, things are probably looking better today than they were maybe even a year ago. Yes. I can start, and maybe Ben or Matt wants to jump in. As Ben had mentioned, we are kind of up in our outlook here of -- to over $1 billion this year. And as we've talked about sort of years past, middle of last cycle, development pipeline was probably about $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion in terms of kind of how it was scaled. And we kind of rescaled it as we got into later part of the cycle in a downturn to something that's more in the $800 million to $900 million range. We think we can flex that up pretty easily to $1.2 billion without too much trouble and probably to $1.5 billion. So I think kind of -- those are the kind of ranges we're looking at right now, absent potentially entering some new markets and expanding the footprint. Yes, Austin, good question. So the way I'd lay it out for you is that the technology initiatives around the digital platform, the AI that Ben described and things like that, that will be roughly around $30 million. And then beyond that, the smart access and smart home component is the piece that's up in air. It's a little bit of a TBD based on customer adoption, what they're willing to pay, what features they want. Is it just the smart access component for guests? Or is it more along the lines of thermostat control, lighting, various sort of things. So that's a little bit of a TBD on the investment. But the foundational elements to have the infrastructure, the digital platforms and all that is around $30 million. Yes. It became awfully profitable, right, last cycle, particularly for the first 3 years. It's -- we're developing a value creation margins that we hadn't seen really before, probably in the 40%, 45% range in some cases. So I think the range I talked about is right, the kind of the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. It's probably a little less as it relates to enterprise value to maybe what you're driving at. But no, I think it's about $1 billion, $1.5 billion seems about right just in terms of the opportunity set within our markets and kind of where the platform has scaled and what the balance sheet can kind of handle without sort of over-relying on the equity markets being continuously open. Yes. And Alex, maybe explaining this real quick. I think in reality, we underwrite on a current basis, as Matt mentioned before, current cost, current rents, current OpEx. I think in reality, the yields have deteriorated a little bit. So the deals that Matt talked about were going to start in the high 5s. When we first put those in a contract, went through due diligence, they're probably low 6s in reality. So if you think about it over the last 2 years, rents, maybe they're flattish overall, particularly in the suburban markets, given that's where the focus of the development pipeline is. And costs are up, the denominator is up a little bit. And so I think you probably have seen some deterioration of -- I don't know where to bracket, but somewhere between 25 and 50 basis points of yield erosion. But you've seen cap rate compression that more or less offset that. Yes. And Alex, the only other thing I would add to that, it also gives us an opportunity to allocate capital over a period of time because they don't -- they're not all on the same time horizon, right? So you buy assets today, if you're funding a third-party developer that may be capital that goes out over the next 1 to 3 years. If you're developing for your own account where you're having to go through the entitlement process yourself, that's maybe more of a 3- to 5-year time horizon. So it allows us to diversify across time as well as sort of buy product in a market. Yes. No. Good question, Dennis. And what we look at is kind of our stabilized base years, what we call it. And so for the most part, it's kind of a blend. But if you use 2019 as kind of a proxy for controllable NOI margins, excluding taxes and insurance. That's how we think of where the base year is. And the movement from there, obviously, things have distorted during the pandemic, given what's happened, but that would be kind of the way we're looking at it at least. Exactly. With insurance, yes, which pushes those margins. If you look at it carefully and go back there, for example, like '18, '19, those extra margins, excluding that, we're kind of in the 80% range, 80%-plus, if you map out each one in terms of what you've got up there in terms of '18 and '19, but '19 is really kind of a base year. Yes. Good question. I'm not sure exactly how to answer the air pocket question. I mean we certainly expect people that left these urban environments to come back, not 100%, but people come back. What percent is sort of pure speculation. That would be hard for us or anyone else to say what the number is.  In terms of air pocket beyond that, it really just is a function of sort of the macroeconomy, what's happening with jobs and income growth and sort of more the normal factors that drive the business in terms of demand characteristics.

So I think really, I would just sort of pause and look at it as what's the macro environment looks like from a demand and supply standpoint? And how does that support the business going forward once we get to the other side of the pandemic. Great. Thank you, Anna. Thanks, everyone, for being on the call today.

I mean as we've indicated before, providing quarterly guidance, which is what we've done this week -- this quarter, is consistent with how we have been managing the business as we move through a pretty dynamic environment and in an uncertain period of time. But given the stability and the growth that we're seeing in April and as we head into May, as Sean pointed out, we do expect to be able to provide guidance for the balance of the year in connection with our second quarter call after we've had a chance to complete our customary midyear reforecast, which is a lot more fulsome than the Q1 reforecast process that we do for this call."

            "name": "Matthew Birenbaum",
            "content": "Nick, it's Matt. Yes, those deals, the yield is kind of very consistent with where our current development under way is. It's kind of high 5s, and that's pretty much in every case. When we quote yields, we're quoting based on today's rents, today's cost. We don't trend it. So -- and in fact, on our development attachment, we don't mark those rents to current market until we get at least about 20% leased. So that's why we see most of the rents in the attachment are still what we were carrying when we started the job. So my guess is, given where we are today and given the ones we haven't started at today's market, there's probably a pretty good chance that we'll exceed the underwriting on those by the time they stabilize. Yes. John, this is Matt. I guess to the second question about kind of what our appetite is, I mean we said we are looking to grow both of those markets to be roughly at least 5% of our portfolio. And so I think right now, including nonsame-store, they're probably about 2% each. So we still have a ways to go. We do have starts planned in both of those regions in the next quarter or 2. So we are continuing to move forward with development there. We have additional pipeline starts that are probably '22 starts in each of those regions, and we're out looking for more. And we're actively pursuing acquisitions in both of those markets as well. And we'll continue to do what we've done in the past, which is we find acquisitions, rotate capital out of some of our legacy markets to fund that.  As it relates to other markets beyond those, I mean, I think we've said before that we are looking at other markets. We don't have anything to announce at this time. But we are looking for markets that are going to be over-indexed to the knowledge economy and over-indexed to kind of the higher-income jobs, the higher education jobs, which we think will drive outsized performance for our portfolio. And we do think Denver and Florida are 2 of those markets, and there are others as well that probably fit that description over time. I wish I knew, John. I do think that cost pressures are definitely rising. But on the other hand, there's also the numerator, right? And we're underwriting deals still with rents that are, for the most part, less than maybe they were in the prior peak because a lot of our suburban development is job center suburban. Maybe in some of the other suburban category from Ben's slide, maybe some of that rents are higher than the prior peak in terms of what we're underwriting.  So I do think there's still some list to come on the numerator. And I guess what I would say is on the denominator, what we've seen so far, the deals that we're lining up now in many cases, our total capital cost for those deals isn't any higher than it was a year ago. Maybe it's higher than it was 6 months ago as lumber has come up some, but there were some other trades costs which came down a little bit. Soft costs may have softened a bit.  So certainly, there's going to be some cost pressures going forward. And we're mindful of that. If anything, the margin right now is wider than it was on deals we started a year or 2 ago just because of what's happened to asset values and cap rates on the other side. So there's probably a little bit of room there. Alex, it's Matt. So on the stuff that's currently under way, that's all bought out. So that part is... Yes. In some cases, there are actually savings there because there was some sense that there was pretty strong momentum in construction cost inflation in many of our markets pre-pandemic. So a lot of it has to do with what Tim was saying, is it going to be kind of transitory based on supply chain bottlenecks or not.  But I think there's a little bit of an underappreciation about how our cost breakdown actually works. I mean if you think of a typical development deal and you say, for every dollar that's in a total development budget, $0.15 to $0.20 is land. So that -- and everything that's in our pipeline, for the most part, is land that we contracted before the pandemic. In some cases, there was an opportunity to recut some of those land deals in some situations based on the slowdown we saw last year. Then you probably have anywhere from $0.15 to $0.20 that is soft cost, whether that's architectural engineering fees, permits, capitalized interest, which has come down. So there's a little bit of an offset there.  And then you have maybe $0.60 to $0.65 that's the actual hard cost. And then when you drill down on that piece, probably 2/3 of that is labor, and 1/3 of that is materials. And actually, even on the materials, when you peel it back further, a lot of those materials, it's not an appliance that you're buying. It's a roof truss, which is lumber, but it's also labor to put the roof truss together.  So probably the key is the pressure on labor cost. That's what would really move the equation more. I mean we can see lumbers double, then it probably increases the total capital budget of a job by 3%, for example, 2% or 3%, which is something. But probably, that's the thing I would keep an eye on would be labor cost because if that starts to really move, that would start to . Alex, this is Matt. I mean, basically, what we've been taking the approach is all of the above. So we're looking to buy existing assets. What we found in the expansion market so far has been it's been an opportunity to buy, in general, brand-new or very young assets and not necessarily pay a premium on a cap rate basis versus older assets. So that's where we've tended to buy so far just because of relative value.  But ultimately, we'd like to own some older communities in those regions as well just for price point diversification. So we're looking to buy. We're looking to build. And we're also looking to capitalize third-party developers, which we've done successfully. In fact, the deal we just completed last quarter in Doral in the Miami area was a partnership with a local merchant builder there, where we funded it. And we work together on the deal. So that's kind of an expansion of our model a bit that we've -- I think we're leaning on in these expansion markets. So that gives us another way we can get capital into these markets and grow our portfolio more quickly. So I don't think we view it as an either/or. We view it as an all of the above. Sure. This is Matt. I -- just to give you an update on the retail, as we mentioned in the earnings release, we did lease the remainder of the second space -- second-floor space last quarter. So we're now about 87% leased on the retail, and these are about 8,500 square feet remaining on the ground floor with Broadway bunch. And our sense is for that remaining space, we're going to be patient to find -- wait for kind of activity to restart in New York, which hopefully, we'll start to see pick up in a more meaningful way in the next couple of quarters. That is high dollar space. But the second-floor space that we leased was leased to a medical user. So on the second floor, we have them. We have Fidelity, which is open and operating with a financial services office. And on the ground floor, we have spectrum for a small portion of the ground floor. We have Target with their entrance, and then they have below-grade space there. And then we have kind of the remaining available space on the ground floor.  So we'll see where it settles out in terms of long term, does it generate the amount of NOI that we had talked about before. Obviously, street retail in New York is softer than it was, but a lot of it is going to depend on what we wind up getting for that remaining ground floor space."

            "content": "Thank you, Sean. Supported by this backdrop of improving operating fundamentals, we believe that we are well positioned to generate outsized growth as the economy recharges. As we look to the composition of our existing portfolio, each of the subsegments highlighted on Slide 15 have been impacted in varying degrees during the pandemic, and each have their distinct growth opportunities as we look forward.  Our largest segment at 40% of revenue is in what we've called out as other suburban to differentiate it from more densely populated job center suburban markets. This 40% of our portfolio was the least impacted by the pandemic, and our current asking -- our current average asking rent is 6% above the pre-pandemic peak rent we achieved in March of last year. We continue to push asking rents in these submarkets, and concessions have largely been eliminated.  Our next largest segment at 28% of the portfolio represents communities and job center suburban markets, including our transit-oriented development. This is like Redmond, Washington; Tysons Corner in Virginia; and Assembly Row in Massachusetts. Operating fundamentals in many of these suburban locations have been more significantly impacted with asking rents still 3% to 4% below pre-pandemic levels and with the continued use of concessions in certain markets. Our expectation is that as people increasingly return to the office and nearby restaurants and as other amenities start to reopen more fully, we will increasingly see prospects that seek out these environments for walkability, ease of transportation and the array of services provided.  For our communities and urban environments, we have a mix of core urban, effectively central business districts, and secondary urban, locations like Jersey City, New Jersey; and the Rosslyn-Ballston Corridor in Northern Virginia, which make up 19% and 13% of our portfolio, respectively. As Sean noted, occupancy in our urban portfolio has climbed more than 500 basis points, and rents are trending upward in pretty much all of the urban environments. And this has occurred with urban office usage still at very low levels of less than 20%. As a return to offices starts to gain real momentum this summer and leading up to Labor Day, we do expect a significant rebound in our urban portfolio as in prior cycles.  This is a theme that we expect to be true across much of our portfolio. And as shown on Chart 1 of Slide 16, Class A communities, which represent approximately 70% of our portfolio, have historically outperformed early in cycles. We expect similar trends in this recovery, particularly as the traditional higher-income AVB resident is poised to benefit financially as the economy heats up. And while our residents stand to benefit from the recovery, it is also becoming more challenging for those interested in buying a home to afford one, given the acceleration in home prices in many of our coastal markets. Chart 2 on Slide 16 shows this long-term affordability trend and the growing attractiveness of renting versus owning a home in our markets."

            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Tim. Moving to Slide 9. We've seen an acceleration in the trends we spoke about on our last call with physical occupancy continuing to increase during the quarter, now approaching 96%, and average move-in rent value growing steadily over the last 4 months. For April, our month-to-date average move-in rent is roughly 5% above what we experienced in January of this year and approximately 8% below the pre-COVID peak rent we achieved in March of 2020. Yes, Rich, this is Sean. I mean, I hate to say it, but it's pretty broad-based. I mean, if you think about what happened in Q2 last year, things really shut down. So turnover decline, we draw back to strictly essential maintenance only for our resident customers. We pulled back on marketing, given sort of the demand shock. We had talked to the hiring freeze.  So if you think about all the various sort of maintenance activities, payroll, et cetera, we're expecting all of those to look more normal as compared to the depressed levels that we experienced in Q2 of 2020. So it's relatively broad-based. Most of it is on the sort of what I would call the controllable side of things, and it's a more modest increase in taxes and insurance. But all the activity kind of base costs and payroll really are coming up pretty materially on a year-over-year basis. Yes, Rich, Sean. I'm happy to start and anyone else can jump in. I think you said that rents in our urban portfolio are above the pre-COVID peak. That's actually not the case. Yes. In other words, asking rents in the urban portfolio down about 8% from the pre-COVID peak. But in the suburban portfolio, we're up a little more than 2%. And I'd say, certainly, we'll see a snapback, and we've already started to see that in the urban submarkets. But the suburbs are pretty healthy. I mean if you keep in mind the slide that Ben showed, there's still a number of these sort of job center suburban submarkets that have probably another leg to come because people have not been called back to the office. If you think of just sort of maybe even the kind of the headline FANG stock, as an example, they -- people have gotten called back to Google and Facebook and Apple and Amazon and Microsoft over at Redmond. So there's some pretty good embedded demand that should be coming back to those environments that should support the suburban portfolio.  And then additionally, also as Ben pointed out, if you look at sort of the single-family side, it's a very tight market. Prices, if you go look at kind of home price inflation on a year-over-year basis, it's up kind of double digits. So the ability to exit into that product is more constrained. It's just not as available.  So I think there's a number of factors when you look at the suburban portfolio that give it a fairly high tailwind. You may not see the same sort of percentage gain over the next couple of quarters as people come back to these urban environments just because it's so concentrated, but there's still some very good sort of demand tailwinds in the suburban -- for the suburban portfolio over the next quarter -- couple of quarters as well. So Tim, do you want to add on to that? Yes. John, this is Sean. I'll take the first one, and then I'll let Tim talk about sort of the expansion market strategy a bit. But the first one, one thing to recognize is that at present, those 2 expansion markets represent a very small basket of assets. So noise from one asset to another can create some volatility here. So the kind of growth that we've seen on a year-over-year basis in Q1, I would not expect that to be same level moving forward for the balance of the year. There's just some unique factors with 1 or 2 of those assets. And when you only have 3 or 4 in the basket, it can move the needle quite a bit within 1 quarter. So I wouldn't count on that as sort of the run rate for the balance of the year. Yes. Rich, it's Sean. I'd say it's probably a little too early to tell. I think when we get up to the sort of other side of the pandemic, things stabilize, we'll have a better sense of has resident profile really changed in terms of suburban or urban assets. And as we continue to communicate with our residents, maybe kind of touching on the last question that you had, that may inform our product choices in some of those suburban markets in terms of some of the larger floor plans, what we provide in the way of workspace or work lounges in the building and program in more townhomes in some cases or things like that. It's probably just a little too early to peg that just yet. Yes. No, good question, John. I mean, I think it speaks to sort of the, I guess, you want to call it sort of the durability of the customers that have allowed us to build occupancy. I mean we'll see. The -- I mean if you look at sort of our portfolio income levels for our residents are down about 6% on a year-over-year basis. So there's -- based on what we've seen, I'd say there's some embedded capacity there to pay. Whether people want to pay or not will be a question that we'll have to come across here.  So I mean, in Q1, we started to see pretty good lift. Turnover was up but not for really financial reasons, just for other reasons in terms of people wanting to move for whether it's roommate situations or all the other sort of typical stuff. So it doesn't seem to be, based on what we're realizing from our customers today, much in the way of financial pressure. As we move through the second and third quarter, particularly in the urban environments, we'll have a much better sense for that.  So could there be a little bit of pressure there? Yes. I mean the other thing that I think we're going to see is right now, Tim talked about the bad debt kind of lapping the bad debt side of it. At some point, as we get it on the other side of the eviction moratoria, some of that bad debt is going to convert to just physical vacancy. So you'll see a little bit of that start to trickle in, in the back half of the year, just depending on what happens in the overall regulatory environment. So maybe a little noisy in terms of physical occupancy as it relates to that one issue alone in a couple of markets, particularly places like L.A., as an example. Yes, Brad. This is Sean. Happy to chat about that, and then Kevin could jump in if he'd like. But yes, I mean, I think, for us, we're not expecting a meaningful shift in bad debt until we get beyond kind of the moratoria that's in place today, which is likely in the second half of the year. There's a number of orders that are right now set to expire in June, I think June 30. Some may be extended. Some may not. It's a little too early to tell. So we're not seeing a lot of movement right now sort of month-to-month in terms of a significant shift one way or another in bad debt. I suspect as customers see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the eviction option becoming available to us, we're going to see some greater movement.  And then on the stimulus side, yes, we're heavily involved in that. In some places, we can apply sort of in bulk on behalf of our customers. In other locations, we prompt them with e-mails where they have to sign up, and then we ultimately receive the fund. So we receive some funds, but I would tell you, it's been very slow and it's been sort of trickling as opposed to a big avalanche of funds So I just don't think the agencies that are within these states and counties are set up to administer the funds. They just weren't set up for that. And therefore, it's taken quite a bit of time for them to figure out how to develop a process to make it work at resident certifications, how do we get the funds to the landlord, to validate it's the right owner, all that kind of stuff. It's just been painfully slow. Yes. Brent, it's Sean. Good question. Not sure we know the answer just yet in terms of how it's going to play out other than I would say, based on the data that we're seeing from prospects and new leases in certain markets, we are seeing some people come back to some of these urban environments from more distant locations than normal. So like in New York City in the past quarter, when you look at the distribution of the leases that we signed and where they came from, more people from locations that are, let's just say, greater than 50 miles away. So we're starting to see some percentage come back.  How it plays out, it's hard to tell. Obviously, as companies further announce what's happening with their return-to-office dates and the trend for universities in terms of on-campus learning in the fall has been pretty positive so far, I think, for our business, where most universities are planning for full on-campus learning, which should be a benefit to these major urban markets for their universities.  And even if we -- as Ben pointed out, office occupancy is less than 20%. So it doesn't take a lot to start to move the needle. Even if we get to 50%, 60%, 70% of what it was previously, that's a pretty good movement from where we are today. So I think it's going to be a pretty positive trend between now and Labor Day. It's hard to say exactly how it's going to play out in terms of getting back to what we would think of as sort of pre-pandemic normal levels, and we really won't know that until we get past Labor Day. Yes. The only thing I'd say is in the urban pockets that we're still seeing some difficulty with studio units in terms of single households. So if you look at overall occupancy, they're trailing the portfolio average a couple of hundred basis points. It's most acute in the places you would expect, New York City, DC, San Francisco, urban Boston, places like that. That's really the difference we're seeing in terms of sort of bedroom type at this point in time. There's just not as much demand for single occupancy yet."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the Company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Doug, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities fourth quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon\u2019s press release as well as in the Company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ben Schall, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Ben?\nBen Schall: Thank you, Jason, and hello everyone. I'm joined by Kevin, Sean and Matt, and after our prepared remarks, we will open the line for questions. I'll start by quickly summarizing our 2022 results and highlighting our progress on a number of strategic focus areas. As shown on slide 4, from operating results perspective, 2022 was a phenomenal year, and one of the strongest in the Company's history, with 10.9% same store NOI growth and 18.5% core FFO growth. We ended the year with core FFO of $9.79 per share, which just to reflect back, was $0.24 above our initial guidance at the beginning of 2022. On the capital allocation front, we proactively adjusted during 2022 as the environment and our cost of capital changed. In April, we raised approximately $500 million of forward equity at a spot price of $2.55 per share, which is still fully available. As the year progressed, we pivoted from our original expectation of being a $275 million net buyer to ending the year as a $400 million net seller, a shift of roughly $700 million in total. We also ratcheted down new development starts given the shifting environment -- to $730 million from our original guidance of $1.15 billion. Collectively, these moves put us in an extremely strong liquidity position and fully match-funded with capital secured for all of the development we have underway. We also made significant progress during 2022 on our strategic focus areas, three of which I want to highlight today. First, as detailed on slide 5, continue to make very strong inroads on the transformation of our operating model. We captured approximately $11 million of incremental NOI from our operating initiatives in 2022. In 2023, we're projecting an additional $11 million of incremental NOI from these initiatives, and looking further out expect meaningful contributions in 2024 and beyond. This uplift is being driven by a number of initiatives including our Avalon Connect offering, which is our package of seamless bulk internet, and a new developments Managed Wi-Fi, which we have now deployed to over 20,000 homes and expect to be at over 50,000 homes by the end of 2023. During 2022, we revamped our website and fully digitized our application and leasing process. What used to take 30 plus minutes of associate\u2019s time can now be completed digitally in about 5 minutes. We also rolled out our mobile maintenance platform across the entire portfolio, allowing our residents and maintenance associates to interact much more efficiently and seamlessly. As a result of these initiatives, we believe we are enhancing the customer experience while also driving operating efficiencies, which over the past few years has resulted in a roughly 15% improvement in the number of units managed per onsite FTE. Turning to slide 6 as a second strategic area. We are focused on optimizing our portfolio as we grow. Our goal is to shift 25% of our portfolio to our six expansion markets over the next six to seven years. In addition to diversifying our portfolio, this shift reflects the reality that more and more of ABV\u2019s core customer, knowledge based workers are increasingly in these markets. At the end of 2022, including our development currently underway, we increased our expansion market exposure to 7%, and subject to the capital allocation environment this year, we expect to be at 10% by the end of 2023. We're funding a large portion of this shift through dispositions in our established regions, which also allows us to prune the portfolio of slower growth assets and/or those with higher CapEx profiles, which should lead to stronger cash flow growth in the portfolio in the years ahead. Our third strategic focus area has been on leveraging our development expertise in new ways and in ways that drive additional earnings growth. More specifically, as detailed on slide 7, we are expanding our program of providing capital to third-party developers primarily as a way to accelerate our presence in our expansion markets. In 2022, this included a project start in Durham, North Carolina and a new commitment in Charlotte. During 2022, we also successfully launched our Structured Investment business, with over $90 million of preferred equity or mezzanine loan commitments made during the year. We believe that both of these programs will be increasingly attractive to third-party developers in 2023, and we're also fortunate to be building these books of business now at today's economics and bases versus in yesterday's environment. Before turning it to Kevin to provide the specifics of our 2023 guidance, I want to provide some additional context on our underlying economic assumptions for the year. From a forecasting perspective, we are overlaying the consensus forecast from the National Association of Business Economists, or NABE, on top of our proprietary submarket by submarket research data and model. The NABE consensus assumes a significant slowing in job growth during the year, down to about 50,000 jobs per month by the third quarter and a total of approximately 1 million of net job growth in 2023. The output of our modes is a forecast of market rent growth of 3% during the year. In a year in which we will need to be prepared for a wider set of potential outcomes than usual, there are a number of attributes of our portfolio, and particularly our concentration in suburban coastal markets, that we expect to serve as a ballast in a potentially softening economic environment. As shown on slide 8, the cost of a median-priced home relative to median income in our markets continues to serve as a barrier to home ownership and support demand for our apartment communities. This is in addition to the repercussions of today's higher mortgage rates, which make the economics of renting significantly more attractive. The other side of the equation is supply. In softening times, having an existing asset that is in direct competition with a recently built nearby project and lease-up can be particularly challenging. Our portfolio has some of the lowest levels of directly competitive new supply across the peer group at only 1.4% of stock, which we believe positions us well. And with that, I'll turn it to Kevin to detail our 2023 guidance.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Thanks, Ben. On slide 9, we provide our operating and financial outlook for 2023. For the year, using the midpoint of guidance, we expect 5.3% growth in core FFO per share driven primarily by our same-store portfolio as well as by stabilizing development. In our same-store residential portfolio, we expect revenue growth of 5%, operating expense growth of 6.5% and NOI growth of up 4.25% for the year. For development, we expect new development starts of about $875 million this year, and we expect to generate $21 million in residential NOI from development communities currently under construction and undergoing lease-up during 2023. As for our capital plan, we expect to fund most of this year's capital uses with capital that we sourced during last year's much more attractive cost of capital environment. Specifically, we anticipate total capital uses of $1.8 billion in 2023, consisting of $1.2 billion of investment spend and $600 million in debt maturities. For capital sources, we expect to utilize $550 million of the $630 million in unrestricted cash on hand at year-end 2022, $350 million of projected free cash flow after dividends and $490 million from our outstanding forward equity contract from last year. This leaves only $400 million in remaining capital to be sourced, which we plan to obtain primarily from unsecured debt issuance later in 2023. From a transaction market perspective, we currently plan on being a roughly net neutral seller and buyer in 2023 with a continued focus on selling communities in our established markets and on buying communities in our expansion markets while being prepared to adjust our transaction volume and timing in response to evolving market conditions. On slide 10, we illustrate the components of our expected 5.3% growth in core FFO per share. Nearly all of our expected earnings growth of $0.52 per share is expected to come from NOI growth in our same-store and redevelopment portfolios, which are expected to contribute $0.50 per share. Elsewhere, NOI from investment activity and from overhead JV income and management fees are expected to contribute $0.19 and $0.03 per share, respectively, while being partially offset by a headwind of $0.10 per share each from capital markets activity and from higher variable rate interest expense, resulting in an expected $0.02 per share net earnings growth from these other parts of our business. On slide 11, we show the quarterly cadence of apartment deliveries from development communities under construction for 2022 and on a projected basis for '23 and '24. As you can see on this slide, new deliveries declined in 2022 and remain relatively low as we begin 2023. This recent decline in deliveries was due to our decision during the early days of the pandemic, to reduce wholly owned development starts to $220 million [ph] in 2020 before resuming higher levels of development starts thereafter in 2021. As a result, development NOI for this year is expected to be below trend at $21 million versus $42 million last year. However, new development communities are expected to increase significantly later in the year and into next year, which should set the stage for more robust NOI growth from development communities next year. And with that summary of our outlook, I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss operations.\nSean Breslin: All right. Thank you, Kevin. Moving to slide 12 in terms of our operating environment. After a very strong first half of the year, we ended 2022 with several of our key operating metrics, including occupancy, availability and turnover trending to what we consider more normal levels. In addition, following two years of abnormal patterns, rent seasonality returned with peak values being achieved during Q2 and Q3 before easing in the back half of the year. More recently, the volume of prospective renters visiting our communities increased in January as compared to what we experienced in November and December, which translated into a modest lift in occupancy, and we do see amount of available inventory to lease as we entered February. Additionally, asking rents have increased about 100 basis points since the beginning of the year, which is beginning to flow into rent change. Based on signed leases that take effect in February, we're expecting like-term effective rent change to be in the low-4% range. Turning to slide 13. The midpoint of our outlook reflects same-store revenue growth of 5% for the full year 2023. Growth in lease rates is driving the majority of our revenue growth for the year, which includes 3.5% embedded growth from 2022 and an expectation of roughly 3% effective rent growth for 2023, which contributes about 150 basis points to our full year growth rate. We expect additional contributions from other rental revenue, which is projected to grow by roughly 16%, about two-thirds of which is driven by our operating initiatives, a modest improvement in uncollectible lease revenue and a slight tailwind from the reduced impact of amortized concessions. We're assuming that uncollectible lease revenue improves from 3.7% for the full year 2022 to 2.8% for the calendar year 2023. Of course, this improvement is more than offset by a projected $36 million reduction in the amount of rent relief we expect to recognize in 2023. The combination of the two reflects a projected 80 basis-point headwind from net bad debt for the full year 2023. Moving to slide 14. We expect our East Coast regions to produce revenue growth slightly above the portfolio average, while the West Coast markets are projected to fall below the portfolio average, and our expansion markets are projected to produce the strongest year-over-year revenue growth for the portfolio. One point to highlight is that the reduction in rent relief will have a more material impact on our reported 2023 revenue growth in certain regions and markets, for example, Southern California and Los Angeles. We have footnoted the projected impact for each region at the bottom of slide 14 and enhanced our disclosure in the earnings supplemental, so everyone has visibility into the impact of the change in rent relief as compared to underlying market fundamentals. Turning to slide 15. Same-store operating expense growth is projected to be elevated in 2023 due to a variety of factors. The first is just the underlying inflation in the macro environment, which is impacting several categories, including utilities, wage rates, et cetera. Second, we're expecting greater pressure on insurance rates, given the increase in the number and severity of various disasters over the past couple of years, combined with a relatively light year of claims activity in 2022. We're rolling all that cost pressure into the organic growth rate of 4.8%, you see on the table on slide 15. In addition to the organic pressure in the business, about 170 basis points of additional operating expense growth is coming from the phaseout of property tax abatement programs, primarily in New York City, and NOI accretive initiatives. The phaseout of the property tax abatement programs is projected to add about 70 basis points to our total operating expense growth for the year. While we'll generate some incremental revenue during the phaseout period, the ultimate benefit will be the extinguishment of the rent-stabilized program for those units in a particularly challenging regulatory environment. The impact from initiatives reflects a few key elements of our operating model transformation, including our bulk internet, Managed Wi-Fi and Smart Access offering, which as Ben referenced is bundled and marketed as Avalon Connect. While we expect to recognize an incremental $5 million profit from this specific initiative in 2023, it's adding about 150 basis points to OpEx growth for the full year. There's a modest impact from our on-demand furnished housing initiative, which is also generating a profit for 2023. And finally, we expect additional labor efficiencies to offset some of the growth in other areas of the business as we continue to digitalize and centralize various customer interactions. And then, if you move to slide 16, you can see the progress we've made to date for each one of these three initiatives and the projected incremental impact for 2023. As I mentioned, our Avalon Connect offering is projected to deliver about $5 million in 2023. Furnished housing is contributing another $1 million. And our digitalization efforts are projected to generate an incremental $5 million benefit in 2023. In aggregate, we're expecting an additional $11 million in NOI from these three strategic priorities in 2023 with a lot more to come in future years from these initiatives and others. Now, I'll turn it to Matt to address development.\nMatt Birenbaum: All right. Thanks, Sean. Just broadly speaking, development continues to be a significant driver of earnings growth and value creation for the Company. At year-end, we had $2.4 billion in development underway, most of which was still in the earlier stages of construction. The projected yield on this book of business is 5.8%. And it's worth noting that our conservative underwriting does not include any trending in rents. We do not mark rents to current market levels until leasing is well underway. On this quarter's release, only 4 of the 18 projects underway reflect this mark-to-market. But those 4 are generating rents $395 per month above pro forma, which in turn is lifting their yields by 30 basis points. We expect to see similar lift at many of the 14 other deals as they open for leasing over the next two years. And of course, this portfolio is 100% match-funded with capital that was sourced in yesterday's capital markets when cap rates and interest rates were significantly lower than they are today. If you turn to slide 17, we do expect roughly $900 million in development starts this year across 7 different projects with roughly half in our new expansion regions, and we will continue to target yields at 100 to 150 basis-point spread over prevailing cap rates. We expect the majority of the start activity in the second half of the year and are hopeful that we will be able to take advantage of moderating hard costs across our markets as these budgets are finalized. We have started to see early signs of this in a few of our latest construction buyouts as selected trade contractors have become much more motivated to secure new work. As always, we will continue to be disciplined in our capital allocation, and our projected start activity could vary significantly from our current expectations depending on how interest rates, asset values and construction costs all evolve over the course of the year. Turning to slide 18. While our recent start activity has been modest, we have been building a robust book of future opportunities that could drive significant earnings and NAV growth well into the next cycle. We have increased our development rights pipeline to roughly 40 individual projects, balanced between our established coastal regions and our new expansion regions, providing a deep opportunity set across our expanded footprint. Most of these development rights are structured as longer-term option contracts, where we're not required to close until -- on the land until all entitlements are secured. In addition, in the current environment, we are certainly seeing more flexibility from land sellers who are willing to give us more time as costs and deal economics adjust to all of the changes in the market. We continue to control this book of business with a very modest investment of just $240 million, including land held for development and capitalized pursuit costs as of year-end. For historical context, as shown on the chart on the right-hand side of the slide, this is a lower balance than we averaged through the middle part of the last cycle from 2013 to 2016, even though the dollar value of the total pipeline controlled is larger today than it was then, providing tremendous leverage on our investment in future business. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ben for some closing remarks.\nBen Schall: Thanks, Matt. To conclude, slide 19 recaps our successes during 2022 and highlights our priorities for 2023. All of this is only possible based on the tireless efforts of our AvalonBay associate base, 3,000 strong. A personal thank you to each of you for your dedication to making AvalonBay even stronger as we continue to fulfill our mission of creating a better way to live. You're the heart and soul of our culture, and we thank you. With that, I'll turn it to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And thanks for the call, presentation. It is always helpful as a lot of additional info. So, I always appreciate that. Maybe just starting on development in the transaction market. You mentioned the 100 to 150 basis-point spread. Can you quantify expected yields on the '23 starts and maybe what the current transaction cap rates are -- you're seeing in your markets?\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure. Hey Nick, it's Matt. As I'm sure you're hearing from others as well, not a lot is transacting in the current environment. So there is -- I think everybody is kind of interested to see how the transaction market evolves over the course of the year. What is trading -- seems to be trading in, call it, the mid to high 4% cap rate range, depending on the market. And there are certainly assets that are not trading. But as best we can tell, that's kind of where most transactions in our markets seem to be settling out today. And just as a point of reference, the development we expect to start this year, those yields are underwriting to around 6 -- low 6s today. So that's very consistent with the spread right -- very solidly in that 100 to 150 basis-point range that I mentioned.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. That's helpful. And then just on the -- I guess, the continued reallocation of the capital into these expansion regions, do you expect any difference in cap rates between the buys and sells or as you reallocate that capital this year? And then, where should we expect any asset sales to occur, from which established markets?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. So, I would say, if you look back at what we've done over the last 4 or 5 years, we have rotated quite a bit of capital, and it is kind of overweighted to the Northeast. And I think you can expect that to continue that there will be continued asset sales out of the New York metropolitan area, a little bit out of Boston, some out of the Mid-Atlantic and then, selectively, a little bit on the West Coast as well but, predominantly, that -- kind of that Northeast corridor. The cap rate spread, we'll see. I would say that, that cap rate spread has probably tightened some over the last year or two because there's probably been more movement up in cap rates in the regions where we're buying than that -- in the regions where we're selling. And that's just because those were the regions that had more embedded growth in the rent roll and lower cap rates a year or two ago that -- so as interest rates have risen, basically, a lot of the markets where we're selling, the buyers were already kind of buying for yield as opposed to growth. So, there's probably been a little bit less adjustment there. So I think there might be a little bit of dilution, but I would say probably less than what we've seen in the last couple of years. And then the other part of it is tactically, we have shifted from kind of buying and then essentially doing a reverse exchange by picking an asset off the bench to sell to fund that. Mid last year, we shifted our tactics there to sell first so that we knew where that dispo was pricing. And then that, in turn, informed our view of how much we're willing to pay on the buy side. So, we've shifted to a sell first by second.\nBen Schall: And Nick, yes, in terms of the environment today, I just want to make sure you have the right expectations for activity now versus later in the year. We're testing the market with a couple of potential asset sales generally on the sideline on acquisitions until we see how those assets, one, if we decide to trade on them and how the pricing is and then we'll evaluate the potential trade into the expansion market through other acquisitions or potentially use those proceeds for other capital allocation decisions.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Those ones being tested are in the Northeast?\nMatt Birenbaum: They are, one in the Northeast and one in the Mid-Atlantic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.\nSteve Sakwa: I guess, on page 13, you kind of break out all the drivers of growth. I was just hoping you could maybe tell me the areas where you have kind of the most confidence and the least confidence, where there could be upside, downside and if you also think about that by region. I guess, what areas are you thinking there could be upside in your forecast and potential downside?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Steve, this is Sean. I'll take that one. So in terms of upside and downside, first, across the various categories, reflected on slide 13, there's a couple of things I'd point to. First is, on the lease rent side, as Ben mentioned, we have a certain macroeconomic assumption, job growth, income growth, et cetera, that's reflected in our models from -- that drives that obviously, to the extent that we see either more or less improvement in the economic environment, that's going to have an impact on that and then the timing with which that occurs. So if we don't see much of an impact in terms of a decelerating macro environment until late this year, then it really would impact more '24 than '23. And then, as it relates to the other areas, I'd probably point to bad debt as really being one of the other components that I think we're all trying to estimate the likely impact of what we're going to see in certain markets. But it is one of those items that is a little more challenging to forecast. We're starting the year at roughly 3.1% underlying bad debt here, and we expect to get down to about 2.3% by the end of the year in terms of the pace of improvement and more of the improvement in the second half than the first half just given some of the issues in LA and some of the sluggishness in the courts in the Northeast. That's the other thing I'd point to as a category that would likely move the needle one way or another depending on how things unfold. There could be some upside there since -- while there has been some extensions recently, like in Los Angeles County, the extensions are getting shorter. And I think people see that they're sort of getting to the end of the tunnel on this. So, at the margin, we've incorporated that, but maybe it improves. It's hard to tell. And then geographically, I'd say, certainly, it's been more sluggish in the tech markets in Northern California and Seattle as an example, maybe to a lesser extent here in the Mid-Atlantic in terms of the government not being back in the office and things of that sort. So, depending on how the tech market unfolds here, that would be the likely impact in those regions. And then, the other regions, we're seeing strong performance out of New York City, out of Boston, generally pretty good in Southern California. So, right now, if you look at it, there's probably, I'd say, maybe a little more risk on the tech side of things, really decelerate, but we do have some stabilizers in some of these other regions. So, on par, it probably is kind of a net neutral when you add it all up.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. Thanks. And then just on development, maybe for Matt, as you think about construction costs and what's happened with inflation, and I assume that that's starting to moderate. But how did that get factored into the $900 million of starts? And presumably, the yields are somewhere in that 6% to 6.5% range on what you're going to start. But I guess, what kind of cushion or upside could you possibly see if inflation continues to moderate?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. I guess, it's a question, Steve, of which slows down more, hard cost or rents. I think at this point, we think hard costs are moderating more. So, I would agree with you that -- it's very hard to know where hard costs truly are today until you have a hard set of plans to bid and you're truly ready to start. So, what we're starting to see is on a couple of projects that we've started in Q3 and Q4. Once we actually start moving dirt and the subcontractors see the deal is real, they are coming back with more growth in pricing, and we are starting to see some savings on the buyout, whereas a year or two ago, we were scrambling. The number was going up 1% a month. That's definitely not happening. And it is starting to move the other direction, and it's regional. So, it really does depend on the region you're in and how much subcontractor capacity there is. Sorry, we got something going on here. But -- so -- but we do -- we would expect that hard costs in many of the regions that we're looking to start business in over the next year -- or this year, I would take the under on where they're going to be relative to where they would have been, say, Q3, Q4 of last year. And so what we -- we mentioned that our starts are back loaded this year. Some of that is just the natural evolution of these deals. But some of that is actually strategic as well on our part to say we think that we'll have a better shot and it will be a better environment to buy out some of these trades over the summer, once they've kind of felt the pressure of running out of work and starts decelerating pretty dramatically.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Ben, just going back a little bit to your comments on the capital recycling side. I'm just curious how significant the volume of assets are on the market within your expansion markets that meet your underwriting criteria from a location quality perspective. And also curious if that 6 to 7-year time frame you outlined to achieve that rotation into the expansion markets, is that just a function of what you can sell in any given year?\nBen Schall: Yes. Thanks for that, Austin. So, on the transaction side, as I mentioned, we're out in the market with a couple of assets for potential sale. Our transactions team is obviously staying close to the buying side of the market, but we're not currently actively underwriting any particular deals. We do have very detailed market-by-market analytics that are driving which submarkets. We have our close eye on type of product across various price points. So once we're ready to -- and if during this year, we decided to get back into our trading activity, we'll be ready to ramp that activity back up. In terms of your kind of broader question, the time period, we've set the broad target of getting to 25% over the next 6 to 7 years, like we've been making some good inroads over the last couple of years through trading, through our acquisition activity and then increasingly through our development funding program. We're hopeful that, in an environment like this, capital less abundant, maybe some dislocation, that there'll be opportunities for us to step in and potentially accelerate that activity. Our cost of capital, obviously, will need to be there to support that. But we could be in a window later this year where those types of opportunities start to present themselves.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes. That's helpful. And then, I'm also just curious, with the available dry powder that you have exiting this year, I'm curious what's sort of the most development you'd be comfortable starting in a given year? As you guys highlighted, you do have significant deliveries in 2024, which will accelerate the NOI contribution. And I'm just curious what kind of volume we could see you do maybe as you get into next year and beyond if the environment is sort of appropriate for accelerating starts.\nBen Schall: Yes. Broad strokes, Austin, I'd guide you, this is not a hard and fast sort of area. But in the range of 10% upper enterprise value that we want to have under construction at a particular period of time, we're light of that today, and that's a reflection of that we have retrenched on development starts over the last couple of years given the operating environment. Yes. We've got the opportunity set that's there. Matt described that. So, we have the pipeline. We control that pipeline at a relatively limited cost. We\u2019re spending a lot of time right now restructuring deals to our benefit because the land market has changed. So, that's there. We've got a phenomenal team, has been doing this a long time. So, an element will be how do we think about the spreads, right, how do we think about -- Matt was talking the kind of rental -- the trend lines on rents relative to the trend line on costs; how we think about maintaining a 100 to 150 basis points of spread to underlying cap rates and our cost of capital. That will -- those would be the signals where we start to lean in more fully.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Maybe, Austin, just to add -- this is Kevin here. Obviously, as we talked about in the past, the development activity in terms of what we started is a function typically of three variables: the opportunity set, our organizational capacity and then our funding capacity. And on that last point, our funding capacity, we're probably set up to be able to start and self-fund through free cash flow, asset sales and leveraged EBITDA growth somewhere between $1 billion and $1.5 billion worth of new development a year. And of course, if the equity market is there, we can flex that number up. But that's probably what we sort of aim for somewhere in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion from a funding side, plus whatever we can additionally fund from the equity markets to the extent the opportunity set and the organizational capacity is also there.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Got it. But it's fair to assume, with where leverage is today, that capacity may be a little bit greater?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Potentially, if you can find -- yes, certainly, from a leverage capacity standpoint. We're , as you know, 4.5 times net debt to EBITDA. Our target range is 5 to 6 times. So we certainly have borrowing capacity here to be -- to play offense quite a bit. If we see opportunities in the development side of the house or in the transaction markets, of course, we all just have to look at sort of where the cost of debt is for to fund that activity. And fortunately, we have among the lowest costs of debt capital in the REIT industry. And today, we could probably fund 10-year debt somewhere around 4.7%. So, that would be also a relevant factor as we think about the degree to which we want to lean into our leverage capacity to support additional investment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: In terms of your outlook for your Structured Investment Program, are you seeing any deals in the market that are in distress or might be in the need for capital and could be opportunities for you? And then, what gives you confidence on generating returns of 12%?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. I can take the first one. I'm not sure I heard the second one. Confidence in\u2026?\nBen Schall: Returns of 12%.\nMatt Birenbaum: Okay. Yes, sure. So yes, it's Matt here. Are we seeing distress? No, but we're not really in that market, I would say, in the sense that the SIP is really targeted at providing mezz capital, either mezz or preferred equity, for new construction, merchant builders building new apartment communities in our markets. So, we're coming at the beginning of the story when they're putting together the capital stack to build the project. And what we're seeing there is given where interest rates have gone and given what's happened to proceeds, their construction loan proceeds is coming down. So developers are looking to fill that gap where maybe they were getting 60%, 65% construction loan before, now they're only getting 50% or 55%. So, we have seen kind of our investment move from maybe 65% to 85% of that stack down to, call it, 55% to 70% or 75%. And the rate has gone up, and we -- there are deals getting done in that 12% range. There are folks out there looking for short-term bridge money who started jobs two and three years ago and their first -- their construction loans are coming due, and they don't have enough refi proceeds to pay that off and their mezz. So there is a little bit -- I don't know if I call that distress, but there's a little bit of a recapitalization of newly built asset opportunity out there. That is not a market that we have gone to at this point. We're pretty much focused on the new construction side of this.\nBen Schall: And Chandni, this is -- Matt, just to emphasize sort of the broader market, we do expect our capital through the -- through our SIP to be more attractive to developers this year than it has been over the last couple of years, which inherently then means we're going to have the opportunity to be more selective, right, about quality of the sponsor, amount of capital they're putting in, our views on the underlying real estate. And we're not entering into these SIP deals with the prospect of owning the assets to the end, but we do very detailed underwriting to make sure we're comfortable with the prospect of owning the assets if we need to.\nChandni Luthra: Great. And then, as we think about tech layoff headlines, obviously, January was a very big month. We saw a big bump in layoffs in January, and that was significantly higher than November, which, obviously, when you think about the impact of November, December, everybody -- you guys talked about sort of seeing a slowdown. But then you talked about towards the end of January rents accelerated a little bit. So, as we think about the fact that we are only sort of just coming off these headlines that keep hitting our screens every day, this morning we saw from Disney, are you seeing any early signs in your conversations with tenants, be it around move-outs or lease negotiations, of any notices? I mean what gives you confidence that things are in -- sort of on the right path, and we are not looking at things just falling off a cliff?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Chandni, that's a good question. I'm not sure there's a notable answer to it. I can tell you about what we're seeing. But in terms of how it unfolds, I think that's what everybody is trying to understand well. What I would say is just based on the data that we collect from residents as it relates to relocation, rent increase, et cetera, et cetera, we're not seeing anything that's material at this point that would indicate that there is a significant issue underlying the economy and some of the tech markets. So, relocation has actually come down in terms of reason for move-out. Rent increase is up a little bit. But not surprising, rents have gone up quite a bit over the last 12 to 14 months. So, I don't think those are indicators that are surprise to us, and there's nothing yet in the data that would tell us that there's a significant underlying issue. Now the question, I think, that a lot of people have is severance, unemployment, et cetera, et cetera, is that sort of supporting people for a period of time. And they are, in fact, transitioning into new roles into other organizations. And there's a little bit of this sort of rotational effect from maybe some of the tech companies that took on more employees that they needed to during the pandemic and now they're rotating into other organizations, more mainstream corporate America. It's hard to tell all that, but we're not seeing anything specifically in the data, and we're not hearing a lot anecdotally from our teams on the ground saying that there is a significant issue there. I was in San Jose last week speaking to our teams, targeted people on the ground. And they're just not seeing it yet. The sandbox and the headlines are there in terms of layoffs, but it's not showing up in terms of the front door yet. So we're being proactive in some of those markets in terms of how we're thinking about extending lease duration, how we look at lease termination fees and other things to hedge a little bit. But thus far, it's not showing up in the data.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: I just wanted to ask about the same-store expense guide. I think I really appreciate kind of the deck overall but I think specifically that slide in the deck kind of breaking out the different components. Specifically on the tax abatement, just wondering kind of -- if that's a onetimer or if that's kind of going to repeat in future years, and again, just trying to figure out what is kind of the proper recurring run rate kind of same-store expense number to kind of use as a proxy.\nSean Breslin: Yes. Adam, good question. And what I can tell you, because if things do change in terms of the assets that we have in the portfolio, what we trade and sell a lot of , et cetera, et cetera. But for the assets that are contributing to the phaseout of the tax abatements in our '23 same-store bucket, one does phase out by the end of 2023, two phase out by the end of 2024 and then the other four extend out another two or three years. So, you're going to see a little lumpiness over the next few years as some assets slowly drop out of that phaseout. Now, as I mentioned, there are some benefits we get along the way in terms of an incremental fee each year of the phaseout. And then, ultimately, in what people would consider as New York as a pretty challenging market from a regulatory standpoint. Eventually, we just get off that program at the end of the phaseout. And there should be a nice -- a pretty nice lift there in terms of rents. So, that's sort of the way to think about it a little bit. I can't give precise sort of guidance as to what to expect for years beyond 2024 in terms of what the headwind might be from that activity, but there will be some kind of headwind for the next few years.\nAdam Kramer: That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up, thinking through the expansion markets, recognizing potentially better job growth there. I think that makes a lot of sense. But just thinking about the supply -- the supply side of things, right, and look, I think it's kind of well publicized that some of the expansion markets, Sunbelt broadly, just the elevated supply, call it, maybe for the next 12 months or so. How are you guys thinking through that? Is that kind of just weather the supply storm and probably less supply on the other side, given financing challenges today for kind of development starting today for others out there, or is it maybe the supply thing is overblown? And actually, the next 12 months is not going to have as much supply as maybe people think?\nBen Schall: Yes. Let me handle it big picture and others can add on. The first comment I'd make, our portfolio allocation objectives, these are long-term objectives, right? We're setting these because we think they're the appropriate allocation to have over the next 20 to 30 years, right, not necessarily based on the supply and demand dynamics out of the next couple of years. With that said, we do expect the next couple of years and potentially with some reversion to the mean on the rent side and the high levels of supply could lead to more muted growth in some of these high-growth markets. We're fortunate we don't have any new deliveries. We have very limited deliveries coming on line over the next couple of years. So most of our activity that you hear us talking about, including our own development, which we're now starting, and our developer funding program, those are projects that are going to be coming on line in 2025, 2026, which currently looks like could be some lighter years from a supply perspective.\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. I'd just add one other thing to that, which is we are conscious of submarket selection as well as market selection as we build the portfolio in these markets. So, if you look -- and I would point you to Denver portfolio is a good example. It's been a great market. Our portfolio, I think, has done even better than the market. And if you look at where we bought assets, it's mostly been suburban garden assets in jurisdictions where it is more supply-constrained. There's a lot of supply in Denver, but the vast majority of it is within the city of Denver proper. And we have not bought an asset in Denver. We completed one lease-up development deal there in Rhino last year, and we have another one under construction, but we're balancing that out with a suburban heavy acquisition strategy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. Thanks for all the color and additional disclosure on uncollectible lease revenue. It did strike us a surprisingly high in New York and Southeast Florida. And I was wondering if you can comment on that. Is this due to affordability? And could you see this potentially remaining high, just given what's happening in the economy?\nSean Breslin: Yes. John, it's Sean. Yes, New York certainly has been high in certain pockets. Even pre-pandemic, places like Long Island took forever to get through the court process. So, that's not necessarily a significant surprise. And as you might imagine, the environment is relatively pro resident friendly. And so any opportunity as they get to sort of kick the can down the road through the court system, we've generally seen that happen over the last 12 to 14 months. As I mentioned earlier, I think a lot of that is slowly coming to an end, and things are opening up, but it is moving slowly. And you basically have the same phenomenon happening in Florida. Things are moving along. Obviously, it's not as kind of \"pro tenant-friendly\" is a place like New York by any stretch. But, courts are back up as a lot of cases that have just been on the docket for months and months, and it's taking time for things to move through the system at this point in time, just much longer than average. So, in terms of is there a particular reason in Florida, I wouldn't say necessarily that's the case. It's a market that has had higher bad debt historically. So, we're not necessarily surprised by that.\nBen Schall: And John, from an overall portfolio perspective, I know you know this, but just for the broader audience, I mean pre-pandemic, right, our traditional bad debt number was in the 50 to 75 basis-point range. So, still a significant runway from the types of figures we're assuming for this year over the next couple of years. It may take a while, given Sean's comments, but we're hopeful we'll be headed in the right direction.\nJohn Kim: Okay. My second question is on page 11 of your presentation. You show the NOI contribution from development completions, which is very helpful. I'm just curious why you estimate that '23 NOI will be about half of last year's. Just given if you look at the first half of this year's deliveries versus the first half of last year, it looks about the same.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yes. John, this is Kevin. I'll take a crack at this. Others may want to chime in. And essentially, as you build out the model for forecasting, NOI from communities undergoing lease-up, obviously, you have to start with when we began to put shovels in the ground. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we did start to ramp back up in 2021. And usually, most developments take 8 to 10 quarters to complete, and then that results in deliveries, and then that then thereafter results in occupancies, which is where you start to see revenue growth. So, there is a little bit of a lag when you play this out. So, this is -- the bar charts here on slide 11 in our deck are not meant to be a coincident proxy for when we expect NOI to ramp. Rather, it's showing deliveries when they ramp. And so therefore, you'll have to have occupancy that follows that an NOI that follows that. So, it tends to create a lag effect as you move it through the P&L.\nJohn Kim: I'm sure the next question will be earn in on deliveries from last year, but I'll save that for a later call. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alan Peterson with Green Street.\nAlan Peterson: Just had two quick questions on the transaction market side. Matt, in regards to the asset sale commentary being out of the Northeast corridor as well as California, when you think about dispositions in California, are they wholly owned dispositions, or would you look to enter into a joint venture for property tax reasons on the West Coast?\nMatt Birenbaum: It's a good question, Alan. We have -- so far, the only partial interest sale we've done was the New York JV that we did back in late 2018. So, the disposal we've done out of California, and there haven't been a lot over the last couple of years of wholly owned disposed, were just fee simple. We have talked about that that obviously, if you sell a 49% interest, you don't suffer the prop 13 reset. The prop 13 overhang or reset was probably a lot larger. Last year, at this time when you think about where asset values were than where they are today. There's been some correction there. So the spread isn't quite as wide as it was. But that is something that we have talked about that we might consider at some point.\nAlan Peterson: And then, I'm curious whether you're starting to see a portfolio of premiums -- potentially swing to portfolio discounts with the financing markets becoming a little bit more challenging and whether acquisitions start becoming more attractive to the AVB team there?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. I would say there -- the portfolio discount today is 100%, right? Just their own portfolio is transacting today, for the most part, because the debt markets. So -- and what we are seeing is, in general, right now, what's transacting are deals with assumable debt or deals of modest deal size, $100 million or $150 million or less. So, you're right, a year or two ago, the efficiency -- debt was so cheap and the efficiency of being able to buy a large portfolio put a lot of debt on that all at once. That's gone into reverse. I think the expectation is, as the debt markets stabilize, you will start to see some more sizable asset sales come to market later in the year. That's kind of what everybody's waiting for. I know there was a lot of talk at NMHC about, are you going to go, are you going to go. So -- but yes, I would say that I would certainly expect that this year a much higher percentage of the total transaction volume will be one-offs as opposed to portfolios.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRich Anderson: So, back to slide 11. Can you -- I got what you said about timing to John's question, but the kind of trend upwards in deliveries, does that inform us at all about what you're thinking about in terms of the overall macro environment, the economy and potential recession? I assume you prefer to deliver into strength. So, can you comment at all on this image and what you're thinking broadly about what the overall landscape will look like by the time 2024 rolls around?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yes. Hey Rich, this is Kevin. I'll start here. Others may want to join. So, in terms of slide 11, just to sort of recap, it shows the timing of apartment deliveries from completing development over '22 through '24. And that is really a lagged effect of what happened 8 to 10 quarters previously. And if you kind of just step back and look at the last few years for us and tie it with a comment that I made in Austin's earlier question about kind of our typical start capacity, as you know, we typically try to start somewhere in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. If you look over the last three years, on average, I think we started about $700 million or $800 million when you include the $200 million or so in 2020 and $1.7 billion or so last year. So it's been below trend level of starts over the last few years, which with the lag is created in the last year or so and then probably for maybe the better part of the next year, a little bit of a below average trend NOI realization from the lease-up portfolio. So that's just sort of how mechanics work. In terms of your question about what does this say, I think really, our lower levels of starts is more reflective of the volatility and the uncertainty of the environment over the last few years when we were looking to start jobs. As we look at where we are today, certainly, the Company is in a terrific financial position to start not just the $875 million that we have in the plan for this year, which, as an aside, is a below average level of starts generally. But we are in a position to start a whole lot more, not only because our lower level of leverage today, which gives us debt capacity. So, we are looking to lean in and increase development starts in the next two years if the environment is broadly accommodative of our doing so and is a reasonably stable environment from a capital markets perspective and a macroeconomic perspective with respect to the likelihood for realizing decent NOI growth. So, that is kind of our general look at the macro environment, and our capacity is there to sort of ramp things up as we want to do so. As things stand in terms of what's already underway, we are well positioned just on the $2.2 billion of development under construction that's essentially paid for to deliver robust NOI growth irrespective of what we start in the next year or two. So I don't know, Matt, if you want to add.\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Rich, just to clarify, those deliveries, the way they show, that die is already cast. So, they'll deliver into the market that it is at that time. We're not smart enough to say, yes, we deliberately plan to have fewer deliveries in '23 because we thought there might be a recession two years ago, just playing out that way because we had less start activity a couple of years ago, as Kevin said. But, those are all underway, and we'll take those deliveries as soon as we can get them.\nRich Anderson: Okay. Fair enough. And the second question is on the developer funding program. Can you talk about the economics of that relative to everything being done in-house, assuming a fee paid to the third-party developer and all the different moving parts there? And if this program is sort of like a stepping stone for you to get into these markets more efficiently in that over the course of time, you kind of would revert back to the more conventional approach to development longer term. Is that the way to think about it?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Rich, this is Matt. I can respond to that, Ben may want to as well. The way we think about that program is the returns are somewhere between a development and an acquisition because the risk is somewhere between a development and an acquisition. So, the developer is taking the pursuit cost risk, the construction risk, we're taking the lease-up and the capital risk. And so, the yields on that are a little bit less than an AVB straight-up development because we are paying fees and then there's an earnout based on how the deal does. But we think it's a good risk-adjusted return. And I guess, it does two things for us. One, it accelerates our investment activity in the expansion regions because it does take time to get the teams on the ground as -- and we're further along in some markets than others. Where we're doing the DFP so far has been more like say, North Carolina, where we just started there a year or two ago, not so much in Denver where we've been there for five years already. But we also view it as a supplement to our own development activity in the sense that it's a dial -- we can dial up or down more quickly and more opportunistically in response to market conditions and our own cost of capital. So, even when we are fully established in these expansion regions, it may well be an additional line of business for us, but it may be a line of business for us that we're more nimble in terms of turning it up and down than our own development.\nBen Schall: No, it's well put. And the last piece I'd add, we definitely also see synergies within a market. Being able to talk with third-party developers could be something they've just completed and they're looking to sell. It could be a deal they're wanting to develop, need a piece of capital, right, and/or places where they need a fuller capital stack and we have an interest in owning that asset long term. So, that also helps the kind of flywheel accelerate in these expansion markets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Can you talk a little bit about the GAAP and performance trends for your suburban portfolio relative to the urban? And then kind of connected to that, there's a chart that says suburban supply growth is 1.2%, while urban supply growth is 1.8%. How does that compare with historical norms?\nSean Breslin: Yes. So, good questions. As it relates to performance in terms of suburban versus urban as an example, certainly, urban, as we move through the pandemic, took the greatest hit. So, as we've continued to recover from that, we have seen stronger growth to date in terms of our urban assets, but they are recovering, to keep in mind. To give you an example like, in Q4, rent change was a blended 5%. It's about 4.5% in our suburban portfolio but just north of 6% in the urban portfolio. And I think, yes, that's a function of the decline and people coming back to the office slowly and steadily in various urban environments. As it relates to the urban/suburban supply mix, suburban submarkets within our regions have always been difficult in terms of development, more nimbyism, local jurisdictions concerned about impacting school districts, et cetera, et cetera. It's always been challenging. Coming out of the GFC, there was a little more of a renaissance in terms of the urban environment and all of a sudden economics for urban development made good sense, and there was demand there in terms of millennials flocking to urban environments. So, that's why you saw a significant pickup in urban supply over the course of the last cycle. As you look at it today and where we are, from a development standpoint, almost everything we're doing right now is suburban. But given some things that are happening in the urban environments, there will likely be, at some point in time, opportunities to play urban development. Supply is -- right now, if you look at it from an economic standpoint, there's not much of anything that makes sense in an urban environment. So things may overcorrect there, in some cases, and there will be opportunities for us to play there. But the demographic way that sort of supported that is moving on at this point. So, we'll probably be more selective than we were in the last cycle in terms of urban development opportunities.\nMichael Goldsmith: That's very helpful. And as a follow-up, you started a Kanso project in the quarter. How do construction costs per unit differ for this type of development relative to a fully amenitized development? How do the rents compare? So essentially, how does the yields compare? And how has the resident reception been to the Kanso development? Is that a product that will more likely to pencil in maybe just a less certain macro economy? Thank you.\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes, sure. This is Matt. I can speak to that one a little bit. We only have a little bit of it out there. The customer reception has been strong. And the brand really started with customer research insights that there are a lot of customers out there who want a nice new apartment and don't -- we're overserving as an industry today that don't value necessarily all the on-site service, don't value all the amenities and the other pieces of the offering that an Avalon provides and a lot of our competitors provide. So our goal is to be able to bring that offering in at a rent that is 10% to 15% below the rent of a new fully amenitized Avalon or comparable in the same submarket in the same type of location. I think, so far, the little we've done would suggest that the discount might actually be a little bit less than that. It might be more like 7% or 8%. And the costs, there's really -- there's savings in the upfront capital cost because you're not building a pool, you're not building a fitness center, et cetera. And then there's also savings in the ongoing operating expenses because you're not operating and cleaning those spaces and then, ultimately, in CapEx because you're not remerchandising those spaces. The upfront hard cost savings, it's not -- I mean, we might typically spend 7,000 to 10,000 a unit on amenities at a community at a new build, maybe a little bit more than that. So, you're saving most of that. And then on the operating expense side, the savings is at least a couple of thousand a door in controllable OpEx. So actually, the yield winds up being about the same, but it serves a different customer, and it kind of gets us further down the pricing pyramid. So, it expands the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So, two quick ones. First, initially on the DP, [ph] I think in response to of the questions, you said that your intent wasn\u2019t to own the deal at the end but then in a subsequent question you referenced, it's a good way to accelerate into the market. So maybe I misheard or maybe it's just a way of how you look at deals in different markets, maybe they\u2019re markets that you're looking to more grow in, use DP to actually own the deals versus other markets where it's more of just an investment because you already have an establishment. So I just want to get some clarity.\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Alex, it's Matt. I think you're referring to -- we really have two different programs. The DFP, the Developer Funding Program, those are assets that we own really from the beginning. We fund the construction and those we\u2019re taking into our portfolio, day one. The SIP, the Structured Investment Program, that's the mezz lending program. Those are the assets that were -- that's really about generating earnings and leveraging our capabilities, and that's the program Ben was referring to where we do not expect to own those assets, although we're prepared to if we need to.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So what's the difference -- I mean, because you guys are pretty thorough in your underwriting and your -- and how you pick deals. Why have two different buckets? It would seem like basically, it's sort of the same bucket you're picking assets that you'd want to own. So why the difference between the 2?\nMatt Birenbaum: It's a very different investment profile. The SIP we're lending 20 to $30 million for three years, call it at 11% or 12% and then we're getting paid back. And we're actually focused on doing that in our established regions, where we're not necessarily looking from a portfolio allocation point of view to grow the portfolio, but we have the construction and development expertise to underwrite it and to understand what it takes to do that kind of lending. The DFP is very similar to the way we would underwrite development or an acquisition that we expect to own for the long term. And that's 100% focused on the expansion regions.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Second question is on the Avalon Connect and the launching of Wi-Fi and other connectivity, obviously, we're all familiar with what the White House said and extra fees, having the regulators look at fees, et cetera, whether it's hotels or apartments, et cetera. Obviously, you guys feel pretty comfortable with what -- these programs. But do you feel like the regulators are going to look harder at these type of additional fees, or your view is that there's already regulation covering this stuff and so it's already sort of covered under existing regulations?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Alex, this is Sean. Happy to take that one, and a good question. What I would say is two things. One is it's hard to know exactly where regulators might go in terms of what they're looking for. But, this has been addressed by the FTC a couple of different times, including last year, in terms of what's appropriate, what's inappropriate with telecom providers and people that are providing this kind of service. So, at least now, I think it has been addressed. That doesn't mean something might not change in the future, but I think we all have sort of a playing field that we feel comfortable with, has been blessed by the regulators. And we're all moving forward under that particular regime, I guess, is the way I'd describe it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I wanted to touch base on that Avalon Connect and furnished housing same-store expenses. I like what you broke out on page 15. How should we think about the associated same-store revenue from those programs?\nSean Breslin: Yes. No, good question. Based on -- and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks as it relates to other rental revenue growth. But if you look at it overall, for 2023, on an incremental basis, roughly 60 basis points or so of our revenue growth is associated with those various initiatives that I identified.\nJoshua Dennerlein: So, does that include Avalon Connect, furnished housing and the labor efficiencies?\nSean Breslin: They include Avalon Connect and furnished housing, there's no labor efficiencies and revenue. That's on the expenses side.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Yes, that makes sense. For the Avalon Connect and furnished housing, are those kind of onetime bumps to same-store expenses, or is that something that kind of carries through on a go-forward basis and you have offsetting same-store revenue growth as well?\nSean Breslin: Yes. No, good question. I mean, the expectation right now is that for both Avalon Connect and furnished housing, and also even on the labor side as well, is that we're going to continue to see additional enhancements to those programs over the next couple of years. So, you'll probably see them stabilize around 20, 25 or so. And at a high level, the way I think about it is our expectation is that these programs overall will probably contribute about $50 million of incremental NOI to the portfolio, of which, if you -- without getting into the detail on the accounting, about $18 million is projected to flow through the P&L for 2023. So, we're about 35% of the way there. There's still a lot to come, but you will see some pressure on OpEx for the next two years, specifically for furnished and Avalon Connect until it stabilizes. But again, it's a highly profitable activity that is contributing meaningfully to earnings over the next couple of years when you look at it in aggregate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sam Cho [ph] with Credit Suisse.\nUnidentified Analyst: I'm on for Tayo today. Just one question. I know your portfolio strategy is to invest in the expansion regions. But just wondering if the rent control and the regulatory, I guess, noise has contributed to any strategic changes in how AVB is thinking about portfolio construction going forward. Thank you.\nBen Schall: Yes. Thanks, Sam. Short answer is when we arrived at our portfolio allocation decisions a couple of years ago, it incorporated in the prospect of the regulatory environment. And so, it continues to be a motivator on why we want to get our exposure in the expansion markets at a minimum for diversification as it relates to various regulatory dynamics.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.\nJamie Feldman: I guess sticking with rent control, I mean, have you factored in at all any changes in your '23 guidance? And where do you see the most risk, whether at the municipal level or state level?\nSean Breslin: Hey Jamie, this is Sean. That is probably a very long answer. What I would say is that, obviously, housing affordability is a significant issue in the country, mainly as a result of just the lack of new supply. So, we continue -- us, our peers in the industry and the industry associations educate both federal, state and local governments about what will work in terms of trying to ease some of the issues that they are hearing about from the electorate. So, it's going to take continued efforts to make sure that people understand it. In terms of what might happen in 2023 that's purely speculative at this point, and wouldn't be appropriate for us to necessarily go there.\nJamie Feldman: And then, if I heard your discussion right, it sounds like you've got the $600 million of unsecured, you plan to take those out and replace with $400 million of new unsecured. Is there a price point -- I mean, we'll probably see some volatility here on rates and pricing. I mean, is there a price point at which you have to think about other sources than new $400 million, or maybe a comment on what do you think of pricing today or where it may head?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yes. I mean I guess, Jamie, at some level, when you've put together a capital plan, you always have that debate about what your uses are and then how -- what's the most efficient source of capital to address those uses. And I think the budget we have today reflects a view that raising that $400 million primarily through the issuance of additional unsecured debt is today and is likely going to be the most cost-effective source of capital for us. Certainly, there could be other sources that might arise, but basically, our choices are relatively straightforward. It's asset sales or common equity, and common equity is unattractively priced today. Asset sales could be a potential source. But as we've just discussed, there's less transparency and liquidity around pricing in that market. So, that's why we ended up with unsecured choice as our likely expected choice. And so, that's -- we've got some time and room to figure that out, and we've got abundant liquidity with potentially nothing drawn on our $2.25 billion line of credit that gives us abundant time and room to figure out what the right source of capital is to take that maturity out.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. That makes sense. And then how early can you take out the $600 million?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Well, the $600 million is -- it consists of two pieces of debt, $250 million in March and then $350 million in December. And so, their bond offering, that typically can't be prepaid materially before they are due, absent some yield maintenance payment. So, it's just part of our business that, as an unsecured borrower, we typically have $600 million to $700 million of debt coming due in any given year. This is a typical year for AvalonBay. So, it's not a particular concern. It's just part of the business of financing our company, and we typically have two pieces of debt that usually total about $600 million. So, kind of a regular way year from our standpoint where we got the first part coming in March and the second one in December.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand it back to Mr. Schall for closing remarks.\nBen Schall: All right. Thank you. Thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to visiting with you in person over the coming months.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Birenbaum",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Sean. Just broadly speaking, development continues to be a significant driver of earnings growth and value creation for the Company. At year-end, we had $2.4 billion in development underway, most of which was still in the earlier stages of construction. The projected yield on this book of business is 5.8%. And it's worth noting that our conservative underwriting does not include any trending in rents. We do not mark rents to current market levels until leasing is well underway. On this quarter's release, only 4 of the 18 projects underway reflect this mark-to-market. But those 4 are generating rents $395 per month above pro forma, which in turn is lifting their yields by 30 basis points. We expect to see similar lift at many of the 14 other deals as they open for leasing over the next two years. And of course, this portfolio is 100% match-funded with capital that was sourced in yesterday's capital markets when cap rates and interest rates were significantly lower than they are today. If you turn to slide 17, we do expect roughly $900 million in development starts this year across 7 different projects with roughly half in our new expansion regions, and we will continue to target yields at 100 to 150 basis-point spread over prevailing cap rates. We expect the majority of the start activity in the second half of the year and are hopeful that we will be able to take advantage of moderating hard costs across our markets as these budgets are finalized. We have started to see early signs of this in a few of our latest construction buyouts as selected trade contractors have become much more motivated to secure new work. As always, we will continue to be disciplined in our capital allocation, and our projected start activity could vary significantly from our current expectations depending on how interest rates, asset values and construction costs all evolve over the course of the year. Turning to slide 18. While our recent start activity has been modest, we have been building a robust book of future opportunities that could drive significant earnings and NAV growth well into the next cycle. We have increased our development rights pipeline to roughly 40 individual projects, balanced between our established coastal regions and our new expansion regions, providing a deep opportunity set across our expanded footprint. Most of these development rights are structured as longer-term option contracts, where we're not required to close until -- on the land until all entitlements are secured. In addition, in the current environment, we are certainly seeing more flexibility from land sellers who are willing to give us more time as costs and deal economics adjust to all of the changes in the market. We continue to control this book of business with a very modest investment of just $240 million, including land held for development and capitalized pursuit costs as of year-end. For historical context, as shown on the chart on the right-hand side of the slide, this is a lower balance than we averaged through the middle part of the last cycle from 2013 to 2016, even though the dollar value of the total pipeline controlled is larger today than it was then, providing tremendous leverage on our investment in future business. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ben for some closing remarks. Sure. Hey Nick, it's Matt. As I'm sure you're hearing from others as well, not a lot is transacting in the current environment. So there is -- I think everybody is kind of interested to see how the transaction market evolves over the course of the year. What is trading -- seems to be trading in, call it, the mid to high 4% cap rate range, depending on the market. And there are certainly assets that are not trading. But as best we can tell, that's kind of where most transactions in our markets seem to be settling out today. And just as a point of reference, the development we expect to start this year, those yields are underwriting to around 6 -- low 6s today. So that's very consistent with the spread right -- very solidly in that 100 to 150 basis-point range that I mentioned. Yes. So, I would say, if you look back at what we've done over the last 4 or 5 years, we have rotated quite a bit of capital, and it is kind of overweighted to the Northeast. And I think you can expect that to continue that there will be continued asset sales out of the New York metropolitan area, a little bit out of Boston, some out of the Mid-Atlantic and then, selectively, a little bit on the West Coast as well but, predominantly, that -- kind of that Northeast corridor. The cap rate spread, we'll see. I would say that, that cap rate spread has probably tightened some over the last year or two because there's probably been more movement up in cap rates in the regions where we're buying than that -- in the regions where we're selling. And that's just because those were the regions that had more embedded growth in the rent roll and lower cap rates a year or two ago that -- so as interest rates have risen, basically, a lot of the markets where we're selling, the buyers were already kind of buying for yield as opposed to growth. So, there's probably been a little bit less adjustment there. So I think there might be a little bit of dilution, but I would say probably less than what we've seen in the last couple of years. And then the other part of it is tactically, we have shifted from kind of buying and then essentially doing a reverse exchange by picking an asset off the bench to sell to fund that. Mid last year, we shifted our tactics there to sell first so that we knew where that dispo was pricing. And then that, in turn, informed our view of how much we're willing to pay on the buy side. So, we've shifted to a sell first by second. They are, one in the Northeast and one in the Mid-Atlantic. Yes. I guess, it's a question, Steve, of which slows down more, hard cost or rents. I think at this point, we think hard costs are moderating more. So, I would agree with you that -- it's very hard to know where hard costs truly are today until you have a hard set of plans to bid and you're truly ready to start. So, what we're starting to see is on a couple of projects that we've started in Q3 and Q4. Once we actually start moving dirt and the subcontractors see the deal is real, they are coming back with more growth in pricing, and we are starting to see some savings on the buyout, whereas a year or two ago, we were scrambling. The number was going up 1% a month. That's definitely not happening. And it is starting to move the other direction, and it's regional. So, it really does depend on the region you're in and how much subcontractor capacity there is. Sorry, we got something going on here. But -- so -- but we do -- we would expect that hard costs in many of the regions that we're looking to start business in over the next year -- or this year, I would take the under on where they're going to be relative to where they would have been, say, Q3, Q4 of last year. And so what we -- we mentioned that our starts are back loaded this year. Some of that is just the natural evolution of these deals. But some of that is actually strategic as well on our part to say we think that we'll have a better shot and it will be a better environment to buy out some of these trades over the summer, once they've kind of felt the pressure of running out of work and starts decelerating pretty dramatically. Yes. I can take the first one. I'm not sure I heard the second one. Confidence in...? Okay. Yes, sure. So yes, it's Matt here. Are we seeing distress? No, but we're not really in that market, I would say, in the sense that the SIP is really targeted at providing mezz capital, either mezz or preferred equity, for new construction, merchant builders building new apartment communities in our markets. So, we're coming at the beginning of the story when they're putting together the capital stack to build the project. And what we're seeing there is given where interest rates have gone and given what's happened to proceeds, their construction loan proceeds is coming down. So developers are looking to fill that gap where maybe they were getting 60%, 65% construction loan before, now they're only getting 50% or 55%. So, we have seen kind of our investment move from maybe 65% to 85% of that stack down to, call it, 55% to 70% or 75%. And the rate has gone up, and we -- there are deals getting done in that 12% range. There are folks out there looking for short-term bridge money who started jobs two and three years ago and their first -- their construction loans are coming due, and they don't have enough refi proceeds to pay that off and their mezz. So there is a little bit -- I don't know if I call that distress, but there's a little bit of a recapitalization of newly built asset opportunity out there. That is not a market that we have gone to at this point. We're pretty much focused on the new construction side of this. Yes. I'd just add one other thing to that, which is we are conscious of submarket selection as well as market selection as we build the portfolio in these markets. So, if you look -- and I would point you to Denver portfolio is a good example. It's been a great market. Our portfolio, I think, has done even better than the market. And if you look at where we bought assets, it's mostly been suburban garden assets in jurisdictions where it is more supply-constrained. There's a lot of supply in Denver, but the vast majority of it is within the city of Denver proper. And we have not bought an asset in Denver. We completed one lease-up development deal there in Rhino last year, and we have another one under construction, but we're balancing that out with a suburban heavy acquisition strategy. It's a good question, Alan. We have -- so far, the only partial interest sale we've done was the New York JV that we did back in late 2018. So, the disposal we've done out of California, and there haven't been a lot over the last couple of years of wholly owned disposed, were just fee simple. We have talked about that that obviously, if you sell a 49% interest, you don't suffer the prop 13 reset. The prop 13 overhang or reset was probably a lot larger. Last year, at this time when you think about where asset values were than where they are today. There's been some correction there. So the spread isn't quite as wide as it was. But that is something that we have talked about that we might consider at some point. Yes. I would say there -- the portfolio discount today is 100%, right? Just their own portfolio is transacting today, for the most part, because the debt markets. So -- and what we are seeing is, in general, right now, what's transacting are deals with assumable debt or deals of modest deal size, $100 million or $150 million or less. So, you're right, a year or two ago, the efficiency -- debt was so cheap and the efficiency of being able to buy a large portfolio put a lot of debt on that all at once. That's gone into reverse. I think the expectation is, as the debt markets stabilize, you will start to see some more sizable asset sales come to market later in the year. That's kind of what everybody's waiting for. I know there was a lot of talk at NMHC about, are you going to go, are you going to go. So -- but yes, I would say that I would certainly expect that this year a much higher percentage of the total transaction volume will be one-offs as opposed to portfolios. Yes. Rich, just to clarify, those deliveries, the way they show, that die is already cast. So, they'll deliver into the market that it is at that time. We're not smart enough to say, yes, we deliberately plan to have fewer deliveries in '23 because we thought there might be a recession two years ago, just playing out that way because we had less start activity a couple of years ago, as Kevin said. But, those are all underway, and we'll take those deliveries as soon as we can get them. Yes. Rich, this is Matt. I can respond to that, Ben may want to as well. The way we think about that program is the returns are somewhere between a development and an acquisition because the risk is somewhere between a development and an acquisition. So, the developer is taking the pursuit cost risk, the construction risk, we're taking the lease-up and the capital risk. And so, the yields on that are a little bit less than an AVB straight-up development because we are paying fees and then there's an earnout based on how the deal does. But we think it's a good risk-adjusted return. And I guess, it does two things for us. One, it accelerates our investment activity in the expansion regions because it does take time to get the teams on the ground as -- and we're further along in some markets than others. Where we're doing the DFP so far has been more like say, North Carolina, where we just started there a year or two ago, not so much in Denver where we've been there for five years already. But we also view it as a supplement to our own development activity in the sense that it's a dial -- we can dial up or down more quickly and more opportunistically in response to market conditions and our own cost of capital. So, even when we are fully established in these expansion regions, it may well be an additional line of business for us, but it may be a line of business for us that we're more nimble in terms of turning it up and down than our own development. Yes, sure. This is Matt. I can speak to that one a little bit. We only have a little bit of it out there. The customer reception has been strong. And the brand really started with customer research insights that there are a lot of customers out there who want a nice new apartment and don't -- we're overserving as an industry today that don't value necessarily all the on-site service, don't value all the amenities and the other pieces of the offering that an Avalon provides and a lot of our competitors provide. So our goal is to be able to bring that offering in at a rent that is 10% to 15% below the rent of a new fully amenitized Avalon or comparable in the same submarket in the same type of location. I think, so far, the little we've done would suggest that the discount might actually be a little bit less than that. It might be more like 7% or 8%. And the costs, there's really -- there's savings in the upfront capital cost because you're not building a pool, you're not building a fitness center, et cetera. And then there's also savings in the ongoing operating expenses because you're not operating and cleaning those spaces and then, ultimately, in CapEx because you're not remerchandising those spaces. The upfront hard cost savings, it's not -- I mean, we might typically spend 7,000 to 10,000 a unit on amenities at a community at a new build, maybe a little bit more than that. So, you're saving most of that. And then on the operating expense side, the savings is at least a couple of thousand a door in controllable OpEx. So actually, the yield winds up being about the same, but it serves a different customer, and it kind of gets us further down the pricing pyramid. So, it expands the market. Yes. Alex, it's Matt. I think you're referring to -- we really have two different programs. The DFP, the Developer Funding Program, those are assets that we own really from the beginning. We fund the construction and those we're taking into our portfolio, day one. The SIP, the Structured Investment Program, that's the mezz lending program. Those are the assets that were -- that's really about generating earnings and leveraging our capabilities, and that's the program Ben was referring to where we do not expect to own those assets, although we're prepared to if we need to. It's a very different investment profile. The SIP we're lending 20 to $30 million for three years, call it at 11% or 12% and then we're getting paid back. And we're actually focused on doing that in our established regions, where we're not necessarily looking from a portfolio allocation point of view to grow the portfolio, but we have the construction and development expertise to underwrite it and to understand what it takes to do that kind of lending. The DFP is very similar to the way we would underwrite development or an acquisition that we expect to own for the long term. And that's 100% focused on the expansion regions."

            "content": "Thanks, Ben. On slide 9, we provide our operating and financial outlook for 2023. For the year, using the midpoint of guidance, we expect 5.3% growth in core FFO per share driven primarily by our same-store portfolio as well as by stabilizing development. In our same-store residential portfolio, we expect revenue growth of 5%, operating expense growth of 6.5% and NOI growth of up 4.25% for the year. For development, we expect new development starts of about $875 million this year, and we expect to generate $21 million in residential NOI from development communities currently under construction and undergoing lease-up during 2023. As for our capital plan, we expect to fund most of this year's capital uses with capital that we sourced during last year's much more attractive cost of capital environment. Specifically, we anticipate total capital uses of $1.8 billion in 2023, consisting of $1.2 billion of investment spend and $600 million in debt maturities. For capital sources, we expect to utilize $550 million of the $630 million in unrestricted cash on hand at year-end 2022, $350 million of projected free cash flow after dividends and $490 million from our outstanding forward equity contract from last year. This leaves only $400 million in remaining capital to be sourced, which we plan to obtain primarily from unsecured debt issuance later in 2023. From a transaction market perspective, we currently plan on being a roughly net neutral seller and buyer in 2023 with a continued focus on selling communities in our established markets and on buying communities in our expansion markets while being prepared to adjust our transaction volume and timing in response to evolving market conditions. On slide 10, we illustrate the components of our expected 5.3% growth in core FFO per share. Nearly all of our expected earnings growth of $0.52 per share is expected to come from NOI growth in our same-store and redevelopment portfolios, which are expected to contribute $0.50 per share. Elsewhere, NOI from investment activity and from overhead JV income and management fees are expected to contribute $0.19 and $0.03 per share, respectively, while being partially offset by a headwind of $0.10 per share each from capital markets activity and from higher variable rate interest expense, resulting in an expected $0.02 per share net earnings growth from these other parts of our business. On slide 11, we show the quarterly cadence of apartment deliveries from development communities under construction for 2022 and on a projected basis for '23 and '24. As you can see on this slide, new deliveries declined in 2022 and remain relatively low as we begin 2023. This recent decline in deliveries was due to our decision during the early days of the pandemic, to reduce wholly owned development starts to $220 million [ph] in 2020 before resuming higher levels of development starts thereafter in 2021. As a result, development NOI for this year is expected to be below trend at $21 million versus $42 million last year. However, new development communities are expected to increase significantly later in the year and into next year, which should set the stage for more robust NOI growth from development communities next year. And with that summary of our outlook, I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss operations. Maybe, Austin, just to add -- this is Kevin here. Obviously, as we talked about in the past, the development activity in terms of what we started is a function typically of three variables: the opportunity set, our organizational capacity and then our funding capacity. And on that last point, our funding capacity, we're probably set up to be able to start and self-fund through free cash flow, asset sales and leveraged EBITDA growth somewhere between $1 billion and $1.5 billion worth of new development a year. And of course, if the equity market is there, we can flex that number up. But that's probably what we sort of aim for somewhere in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion from a funding side, plus whatever we can additionally fund from the equity markets to the extent the opportunity set and the organizational capacity is also there. Potentially, if you can find -- yes, certainly, from a leverage capacity standpoint. We're , as you know, 4.5 times net debt to EBITDA. Our target range is 5 to 6 times. So we certainly have borrowing capacity here to be -- to play offense quite a bit. If we see opportunities in the development side of the house or in the transaction markets, of course, we all just have to look at sort of where the cost of debt is for to fund that activity. And fortunately, we have among the lowest costs of debt capital in the REIT industry. And today, we could probably fund 10-year debt somewhere around 4.7%. So, that would be also a relevant factor as we think about the degree to which we want to lean into our leverage capacity to support additional investment. Yes. John, this is Kevin. I'll take a crack at this. Others may want to chime in. And essentially, as you build out the model for forecasting, NOI from communities undergoing lease-up, obviously, you have to start with when we began to put shovels in the ground. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we did start to ramp back up in 2021. And usually, most developments take 8 to 10 quarters to complete, and then that results in deliveries, and then that then thereafter results in occupancies, which is where you start to see revenue growth. So, there is a little bit of a lag when you play this out. So, this is -- the bar charts here on slide 11 in our deck are not meant to be a coincident proxy for when we expect NOI to ramp. Rather, it's showing deliveries when they ramp. And so therefore, you'll have to have occupancy that follows that an NOI that follows that. So, it tends to create a lag effect as you move it through the P&L. Yes. Hey Rich, this is Kevin. I'll start here. Others may want to join. So, in terms of slide 11, just to sort of recap, it shows the timing of apartment deliveries from completing development over '22 through '24. And that is really a lagged effect of what happened 8 to 10 quarters previously. And if you kind of just step back and look at the last few years for us and tie it with a comment that I made in Austin's earlier question about kind of our typical start capacity, as you know, we typically try to start somewhere in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range. If you look over the last three years, on average, I think we started about $700 million or $800 million when you include the $200 million or so in 2020 and $1.7 billion or so last year. So it's been below trend level of starts over the last few years, which with the lag is created in the last year or so and then probably for maybe the better part of the next year, a little bit of a below average trend NOI realization from the lease-up portfolio. So that's just sort of how mechanics work. In terms of your question about what does this say, I think really, our lower levels of starts is more reflective of the volatility and the uncertainty of the environment over the last few years when we were looking to start jobs. As we look at where we are today, certainly, the Company is in a terrific financial position to start not just the $875 million that we have in the plan for this year, which, as an aside, is a below average level of starts generally. But we are in a position to start a whole lot more, not only because our lower level of leverage today, which gives us debt capacity. So, we are looking to lean in and increase development starts in the next two years if the environment is broadly accommodative of our doing so and is a reasonably stable environment from a capital markets perspective and a macroeconomic perspective with respect to the likelihood for realizing decent NOI growth. So, that is kind of our general look at the macro environment, and our capacity is there to sort of ramp things up as we want to do so. As things stand in terms of what's already underway, we are well positioned just on the $2.2 billion of development under construction that's essentially paid for to deliver robust NOI growth irrespective of what we start in the next year or two. So I don't know, Matt, if you want to add. Yes. I mean I guess, Jamie, at some level, when you've put together a capital plan, you always have that debate about what your uses are and then how -- what's the most efficient source of capital to address those uses. And I think the budget we have today reflects a view that raising that $400 million primarily through the issuance of additional unsecured debt is today and is likely going to be the most cost-effective source of capital for us. Certainly, there could be other sources that might arise, but basically, our choices are relatively straightforward. It's asset sales or common equity, and common equity is unattractively priced today. Asset sales could be a potential source. But as we've just discussed, there's less transparency and liquidity around pricing in that market. So, that's why we ended up with unsecured choice as our likely expected choice. And so, that's -- we've got some time and room to figure that out, and we've got abundant liquidity with potentially nothing drawn on our $2.25 billion line of credit that gives us abundant time and room to figure out what the right source of capital is to take that maturity out. Well, the $600 million is -- it consists of two pieces of debt, $250 million in March and then $350 million in December. And so, their bond offering, that typically can't be prepaid materially before they are due, absent some yield maintenance payment. So, it's just part of our business that, as an unsecured borrower, we typically have $600 million to $700 million of debt coming due in any given year. This is a typical year for AvalonBay. So, it's not a particular concern. It's just part of the business of financing our company, and we typically have two pieces of debt that usually total about $600 million. So, kind of a regular way year from our standpoint where we got the first part coming in March and the second one in December."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Kevin. Moving to slide 12 in terms of our operating environment. After a very strong first half of the year, we ended 2022 with several of our key operating metrics, including occupancy, availability and turnover trending to what we consider more normal levels. In addition, following two years of abnormal patterns, rent seasonality returned with peak values being achieved during Q2 and Q3 before easing in the back half of the year. More recently, the volume of prospective renters visiting our communities increased in January as compared to what we experienced in November and December, which translated into a modest lift in occupancy, and we do see amount of available inventory to lease as we entered February. Additionally, asking rents have increased about 100 basis points since the beginning of the year, which is beginning to flow into rent change. Based on signed leases that take effect in February, we're expecting like-term effective rent change to be in the low-4% range. Turning to slide 13. The midpoint of our outlook reflects same-store revenue growth of 5% for the full year 2023. Growth in lease rates is driving the majority of our revenue growth for the year, which includes 3.5% embedded growth from 2022 and an expectation of roughly 3% effective rent growth for 2023, which contributes about 150 basis points to our full year growth rate. We expect additional contributions from other rental revenue, which is projected to grow by roughly 16%, about two-thirds of which is driven by our operating initiatives, a modest improvement in uncollectible lease revenue and a slight tailwind from the reduced impact of amortized concessions. We're assuming that uncollectible lease revenue improves from 3.7% for the full year 2022 to 2.8% for the calendar year 2023. Of course, this improvement is more than offset by a projected $36 million reduction in the amount of rent relief we expect to recognize in 2023. The combination of the two reflects a projected 80 basis-point headwind from net bad debt for the full year 2023. Moving to slide 14. We expect our East Coast regions to produce revenue growth slightly above the portfolio average, while the West Coast markets are projected to fall below the portfolio average, and our expansion markets are projected to produce the strongest year-over-year revenue growth for the portfolio. One point to highlight is that the reduction in rent relief will have a more material impact on our reported 2023 revenue growth in certain regions and markets, for example, Southern California and Los Angeles. We have footnoted the projected impact for each region at the bottom of slide 14 and enhanced our disclosure in the earnings supplemental, so everyone has visibility into the impact of the change in rent relief as compared to underlying market fundamentals. Turning to slide 15. Same-store operating expense growth is projected to be elevated in 2023 due to a variety of factors. The first is just the underlying inflation in the macro environment, which is impacting several categories, including utilities, wage rates, et cetera. Second, we're expecting greater pressure on insurance rates, given the increase in the number and severity of various disasters over the past couple of years, combined with a relatively light year of claims activity in 2022. We're rolling all that cost pressure into the organic growth rate of 4.8%, you see on the table on slide 15. In addition to the organic pressure in the business, about 170 basis points of additional operating expense growth is coming from the phaseout of property tax abatement programs, primarily in New York City, and NOI accretive initiatives. The phaseout of the property tax abatement programs is projected to add about 70 basis points to our total operating expense growth for the year. While we'll generate some incremental revenue during the phaseout period, the ultimate benefit will be the extinguishment of the rent-stabilized program for those units in a particularly challenging regulatory environment. The impact from initiatives reflects a few key elements of our operating model transformation, including our bulk internet, Managed Wi-Fi and Smart Access offering, which as Ben referenced is bundled and marketed as Avalon Connect. While we expect to recognize an incremental $5 million profit from this specific initiative in 2023, it's adding about 150 basis points to OpEx growth for the full year. There's a modest impact from our on-demand furnished housing initiative, which is also generating a profit for 2023. And finally, we expect additional labor efficiencies to offset some of the growth in other areas of the business as we continue to digitalize and centralize various customer interactions. And then, if you move to slide 16, you can see the progress we've made to date for each one of these three initiatives and the projected incremental impact for 2023. As I mentioned, our Avalon Connect offering is projected to deliver about $5 million in 2023. Furnished housing is contributing another $1 million. And our digitalization efforts are projected to generate an incremental $5 million benefit in 2023. In aggregate, we're expecting an additional $11 million in NOI from these three strategic priorities in 2023 with a lot more to come in future years from these initiatives and others. Now, I'll turn it to Matt to address development. Yes. Steve, this is Sean. I'll take that one. So in terms of upside and downside, first, across the various categories, reflected on slide 13, there's a couple of things I'd point to. First is, on the lease rent side, as Ben mentioned, we have a certain macroeconomic assumption, job growth, income growth, et cetera, that's reflected in our models from -- that drives that obviously, to the extent that we see either more or less improvement in the economic environment, that's going to have an impact on that and then the timing with which that occurs. So if we don't see much of an impact in terms of a decelerating macro environment until late this year, then it really would impact more '24 than '23. And then, as it relates to the other areas, I'd probably point to bad debt as really being one of the other components that I think we're all trying to estimate the likely impact of what we're going to see in certain markets. But it is one of those items that is a little more challenging to forecast. We're starting the year at roughly 3.1% underlying bad debt here, and we expect to get down to about 2.3% by the end of the year in terms of the pace of improvement and more of the improvement in the second half than the first half just given some of the issues in LA and some of the sluggishness in the courts in the Northeast. That's the other thing I'd point to as a category that would likely move the needle one way or another depending on how things unfold. There could be some upside there since -- while there has been some extensions recently, like in Los Angeles County, the extensions are getting shorter. And I think people see that they're sort of getting to the end of the tunnel on this. So, at the margin, we've incorporated that, but maybe it improves. It's hard to tell. And then geographically, I'd say, certainly, it's been more sluggish in the tech markets in Northern California and Seattle as an example, maybe to a lesser extent here in the Mid-Atlantic in terms of the government not being back in the office and things of that sort. So, depending on how the tech market unfolds here, that would be the likely impact in those regions. And then, the other regions, we're seeing strong performance out of New York City, out of Boston, generally pretty good in Southern California. So, right now, if you look at it, there's probably, I'd say, maybe a little more risk on the tech side of things, really decelerate, but we do have some stabilizers in some of these other regions. So, on par, it probably is kind of a net neutral when you add it all up. Yes. Chandni, that's a good question. I'm not sure there's a notable answer to it. I can tell you about what we're seeing. But in terms of how it unfolds, I think that's what everybody is trying to understand well. What I would say is just based on the data that we collect from residents as it relates to relocation, rent increase, et cetera, et cetera, we're not seeing anything that's material at this point that would indicate that there is a significant issue underlying the economy and some of the tech markets. So, relocation has actually come down in terms of reason for move-out. Rent increase is up a little bit. But not surprising, rents have gone up quite a bit over the last 12 to 14 months. So, I don't think those are indicators that are surprise to us, and there's nothing yet in the data that would tell us that there's a significant underlying issue. Now the question, I think, that a lot of people have is severance, unemployment, et cetera, et cetera, is that sort of supporting people for a period of time. And they are, in fact, transitioning into new roles into other organizations. And there's a little bit of this sort of rotational effect from maybe some of the tech companies that took on more employees that they needed to during the pandemic and now they're rotating into other organizations, more mainstream corporate America. It's hard to tell all that, but we're not seeing anything specifically in the data, and we're not hearing a lot anecdotally from our teams on the ground saying that there is a significant issue there. I was in San Jose last week speaking to our teams, targeted people on the ground. And they're just not seeing it yet. The sandbox and the headlines are there in terms of layoffs, but it's not showing up in terms of the front door yet. So we're being proactive in some of those markets in terms of how we're thinking about extending lease duration, how we look at lease termination fees and other things to hedge a little bit. But thus far, it's not showing up in the data. Yes. Adam, good question. And what I can tell you, because if things do change in terms of the assets that we have in the portfolio, what we trade and sell a lot of , et cetera, et cetera. But for the assets that are contributing to the phaseout of the tax abatements in our '23 same-store bucket, one does phase out by the end of 2023, two phase out by the end of 2024 and then the other four extend out another two or three years. So, you're going to see a little lumpiness over the next few years as some assets slowly drop out of that phaseout. Now, as I mentioned, there are some benefits we get along the way in terms of an incremental fee each year of the phaseout. And then, ultimately, in what people would consider as New York as a pretty challenging market from a regulatory standpoint. Eventually, we just get off that program at the end of the phaseout. And there should be a nice -- a pretty nice lift there in terms of rents. So, that's sort of the way to think about it a little bit. I can't give precise sort of guidance as to what to expect for years beyond 2024 in terms of what the headwind might be from that activity, but there will be some kind of headwind for the next few years. Yes. John, it's Sean. Yes, New York certainly has been high in certain pockets. Even pre-pandemic, places like Long Island took forever to get through the court process. So, that's not necessarily a significant surprise. And as you might imagine, the environment is relatively pro resident friendly. And so any opportunity as they get to sort of kick the can down the road through the court system, we've generally seen that happen over the last 12 to 14 months. As I mentioned earlier, I think a lot of that is slowly coming to an end, and things are opening up, but it is moving slowly. And you basically have the same phenomenon happening in Florida. Things are moving along. Obviously, it's not as kind of \"pro tenant-friendly\" is a place like New York by any stretch. But, courts are back up as a lot of cases that have just been on the docket for months and months, and it's taking time for things to move through the system at this point in time, just much longer than average. So, in terms of is there a particular reason in Florida, I wouldn't say necessarily that's the case. It's a market that has had higher bad debt historically. So, we're not necessarily surprised by that. Yes. So, good questions. As it relates to performance in terms of suburban versus urban as an example, certainly, urban, as we move through the pandemic, took the greatest hit. So, as we've continued to recover from that, we have seen stronger growth to date in terms of our urban assets, but they are recovering, to keep in mind. To give you an example like, in Q4, rent change was a blended 5%. It's about 4.5% in our suburban portfolio but just north of 6% in the urban portfolio. And I think, yes, that's a function of the decline and people coming back to the office slowly and steadily in various urban environments. As it relates to the urban/suburban supply mix, suburban submarkets within our regions have always been difficult in terms of development, more nimbyism, local jurisdictions concerned about impacting school districts, et cetera, et cetera. It's always been challenging. Coming out of the GFC, there was a little more of a renaissance in terms of the urban environment and all of a sudden economics for urban development made good sense, and there was demand there in terms of millennials flocking to urban environments. So, that's why you saw a significant pickup in urban supply over the course of the last cycle. As you look at it today and where we are, from a development standpoint, almost everything we're doing right now is suburban. But given some things that are happening in the urban environments, there will likely be, at some point in time, opportunities to play urban development. Supply is -- right now, if you look at it from an economic standpoint, there's not much of anything that makes sense in an urban environment. So things may overcorrect there, in some cases, and there will be opportunities for us to play there. But the demographic way that sort of supported that is moving on at this point. So, we'll probably be more selective than we were in the last cycle in terms of urban development opportunities. Yes. Alex, this is Sean. Happy to take that one, and a good question. What I would say is two things. One is it's hard to know exactly where regulators might go in terms of what they're looking for. But, this has been addressed by the FTC a couple of different times, including last year, in terms of what's appropriate, what's inappropriate with telecom providers and people that are providing this kind of service. So, at least now, I think it has been addressed. That doesn't mean something might not change in the future, but I think we all have sort of a playing field that we feel comfortable with, has been blessed by the regulators. And we're all moving forward under that particular regime, I guess, is the way I'd describe it. Yes. No, good question. Based on -- and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks as it relates to other rental revenue growth. But if you look at it overall, for 2023, on an incremental basis, roughly 60 basis points or so of our revenue growth is associated with those various initiatives that I identified. They include Avalon Connect and furnished housing, there's no labor efficiencies and revenue. That's on the expenses side. Yes. No, good question. I mean, the expectation right now is that for both Avalon Connect and furnished housing, and also even on the labor side as well, is that we're going to continue to see additional enhancements to those programs over the next couple of years. So, you'll probably see them stabilize around 20, 25 or so. And at a high level, the way I think about it is our expectation is that these programs overall will probably contribute about $50 million of incremental NOI to the portfolio, of which, if you -- without getting into the detail on the accounting, about $18 million is projected to flow through the P&L for 2023. So, we're about 35% of the way there. There's still a lot to come, but you will see some pressure on OpEx for the next two years, specifically for furnished and Avalon Connect until it stabilizes. But again, it's a highly profitable activity that is contributing meaningfully to earnings over the next couple of years when you look at it in aggregate. Hey Jamie, this is Sean. That is probably a very long answer. What I would say is that, obviously, housing affordability is a significant issue in the country, mainly as a result of just the lack of new supply. So, we continue -- us, our peers in the industry and the industry associations educate both federal, state and local governments about what will work in terms of trying to ease some of the issues that they are hearing about from the electorate. So, it's going to take continued efforts to make sure that people understand it. In terms of what might happen in 2023 that's purely speculative at this point, and wouldn't be appropriate for us to necessarily go there."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Ben Schall",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and hello everyone. I'm joined by Kevin, Sean and Matt, and after our prepared remarks, we will open the line for questions. I'll start by quickly summarizing our 2022 results and highlighting our progress on a number of strategic focus areas. As shown on slide 4, from operating results perspective, 2022 was a phenomenal year, and one of the strongest in the Company's history, with 10.9% same store NOI growth and 18.5% core FFO growth. We ended the year with core FFO of $9.79 per share, which just to reflect back, was $0.24 above our initial guidance at the beginning of 2022. On the capital allocation front, we proactively adjusted during 2022 as the environment and our cost of capital changed. In April, we raised approximately $500 million of forward equity at a spot price of $2.55 per share, which is still fully available. As the year progressed, we pivoted from our original expectation of being a $275 million net buyer to ending the year as a $400 million net seller, a shift of roughly $700 million in total. We also ratcheted down new development starts given the shifting environment -- to $730 million from our original guidance of $1.15 billion. Collectively, these moves put us in an extremely strong liquidity position and fully match-funded with capital secured for all of the development we have underway. We also made significant progress during 2022 on our strategic focus areas, three of which I want to highlight today. First, as detailed on slide 5, continue to make very strong inroads on the transformation of our operating model. We captured approximately $11 million of incremental NOI from our operating initiatives in 2022. In 2023, we're projecting an additional $11 million of incremental NOI from these initiatives, and looking further out expect meaningful contributions in 2024 and beyond. This uplift is being driven by a number of initiatives including our Avalon Connect offering, which is our package of seamless bulk internet, and a new developments Managed Wi-Fi, which we have now deployed to over 20,000 homes and expect to be at over 50,000 homes by the end of 2023. During 2022, we revamped our website and fully digitized our application and leasing process. What used to take 30 plus minutes of associate's time can now be completed digitally in about 5 minutes. We also rolled out our mobile maintenance platform across the entire portfolio, allowing our residents and maintenance associates to interact much more efficiently and seamlessly. As a result of these initiatives, we believe we are enhancing the customer experience while also driving operating efficiencies, which over the past few years has resulted in a roughly 15% improvement in the number of units managed per onsite FTE. Turning to slide 6 as a second strategic area. We are focused on optimizing our portfolio as we grow. Our goal is to shift 25% of our portfolio to our six expansion markets over the next six to seven years. In addition to diversifying our portfolio, this shift reflects the reality that more and more of ABV's core customer, knowledge based workers are increasingly in these markets. At the end of 2022, including our development currently underway, we increased our expansion market exposure to 7%, and subject to the capital allocation environment this year, we expect to be at 10% by the end of 2023. We're funding a large portion of this shift through dispositions in our established regions, which also allows us to prune the portfolio of slower growth assets and/or those with higher CapEx profiles, which should lead to stronger cash flow growth in the portfolio in the years ahead. Our third strategic focus area has been on leveraging our development expertise in new ways and in ways that drive additional earnings growth. More specifically, as detailed on slide 7, we are expanding our program of providing capital to third-party developers primarily as a way to accelerate our presence in our expansion markets. In 2022, this included a project start in Durham, North Carolina and a new commitment in Charlotte. During 2022, we also successfully launched our Structured Investment business, with over $90 million of preferred equity or mezzanine loan commitments made during the year. We believe that both of these programs will be increasingly attractive to third-party developers in 2023, and we're also fortunate to be building these books of business now at today's economics and bases versus in yesterday's environment. Before turning it to Kevin to provide the specifics of our 2023 guidance, I want to provide some additional context on our underlying economic assumptions for the year. From a forecasting perspective, we are overlaying the consensus forecast from the National Association of Business Economists, or NABE, on top of our proprietary submarket by submarket research data and model. The NABE consensus assumes a significant slowing in job growth during the year, down to about 50,000 jobs per month by the third quarter and a total of approximately 1 million of net job growth in 2023. The output of our modes is a forecast of market rent growth of 3% during the year. In a year in which we will need to be prepared for a wider set of potential outcomes than usual, there are a number of attributes of our portfolio, and particularly our concentration in suburban coastal markets, that we expect to serve as a ballast in a potentially softening economic environment. As shown on slide 8, the cost of a median-priced home relative to median income in our markets continues to serve as a barrier to home ownership and support demand for our apartment communities. This is in addition to the repercussions of today's higher mortgage rates, which make the economics of renting significantly more attractive. The other side of the equation is supply. In softening times, having an existing asset that is in direct competition with a recently built nearby project and lease-up can be particularly challenging. Our portfolio has some of the lowest levels of directly competitive new supply across the peer group at only 1.4% of stock, which we believe positions us well. And with that, I'll turn it to Kevin to detail our 2023 guidance. Thanks, Matt. To conclude, slide 19 recaps our successes during 2022 and highlights our priorities for 2023. All of this is only possible based on the tireless efforts of our AvalonBay associate base, 3,000 strong. A personal thank you to each of you for your dedication to making AvalonBay even stronger as we continue to fulfill our mission of creating a better way to live. You're the heart and soul of our culture, and we thank you. With that, I'll turn it to the operator for questions. And Nick, yes, in terms of the environment today, I just want to make sure you have the right expectations for activity now versus later in the year. We're testing the market with a couple of potential asset sales generally on the sideline on acquisitions until we see how those assets, one, if we decide to trade on them and how the pricing is and then we'll evaluate the potential trade into the expansion market through other acquisitions or potentially use those proceeds for other capital allocation decisions. Yes. Thanks for that, Austin. So, on the transaction side, as I mentioned, we're out in the market with a couple of assets for potential sale. Our transactions team is obviously staying close to the buying side of the market, but we're not currently actively underwriting any particular deals. We do have very detailed market-by-market analytics that are driving which submarkets. We have our close eye on type of product across various price points. So once we're ready to -- and if during this year, we decided to get back into our trading activity, we'll be ready to ramp that activity back up. In terms of your kind of broader question, the time period, we've set the broad target of getting to 25% over the next 6 to 7 years, like we've been making some good inroads over the last couple of years through trading, through our acquisition activity and then increasingly through our development funding program. We're hopeful that, in an environment like this, capital less abundant, maybe some dislocation, that there'll be opportunities for us to step in and potentially accelerate that activity. Our cost of capital, obviously, will need to be there to support that. But we could be in a window later this year where those types of opportunities start to present themselves. Yes. Broad strokes, Austin, I'd guide you, this is not a hard and fast sort of area. But in the range of 10% upper enterprise value that we want to have under construction at a particular period of time, we're light of that today, and that's a reflection of that we have retrenched on development starts over the last couple of years given the operating environment. Yes. We've got the opportunity set that's there. Matt described that. So, we have the pipeline. We control that pipeline at a relatively limited cost. We're spending a lot of time right now restructuring deals to our benefit because the land market has changed. So, that's there. We've got a phenomenal team, has been doing this a long time. So, an element will be how do we think about the spreads, right, how do we think about -- Matt was talking the kind of rental -- the trend lines on rents relative to the trend line on costs; how we think about maintaining a 100 to 150 basis points of spread to underlying cap rates and our cost of capital. That will -- those would be the signals where we start to lean in more fully. Returns of 12%. And Chandni, this is -- Matt, just to emphasize sort of the broader market, we do expect our capital through the -- through our SIP to be more attractive to developers this year than it has been over the last couple of years, which inherently then means we're going to have the opportunity to be more selective, right, about quality of the sponsor, amount of capital they're putting in, our views on the underlying real estate. And we're not entering into these SIP deals with the prospect of owning the assets to the end, but we do very detailed underwriting to make sure we're comfortable with the prospect of owning the assets if we need to. Yes. Let me handle it big picture and others can add on. The first comment I'd make, our portfolio allocation objectives, these are long-term objectives, right? We're setting these because we think they're the appropriate allocation to have over the next 20 to 30 years, right, not necessarily based on the supply and demand dynamics out of the next couple of years. With that said, we do expect the next couple of years and potentially with some reversion to the mean on the rent side and the high levels of supply could lead to more muted growth in some of these high-growth markets. We're fortunate we don't have any new deliveries. We have very limited deliveries coming on line over the next couple of years. So most of our activity that you hear us talking about, including our own development, which we're now starting, and our developer funding program, those are projects that are going to be coming on line in 2025, 2026, which currently looks like could be some lighter years from a supply perspective. And John, from an overall portfolio perspective, I know you know this, but just for the broader audience, I mean pre-pandemic, right, our traditional bad debt number was in the 50 to 75 basis-point range. So, still a significant runway from the types of figures we're assuming for this year over the next couple of years. It may take a while, given Sean's comments, but we're hopeful we'll be headed in the right direction. No, it's well put. And the last piece I'd add, we definitely also see synergies within a market. Being able to talk with third-party developers could be something they've just completed and they're looking to sell. It could be a deal they're wanting to develop, need a piece of capital, right, and/or places where they need a fuller capital stack and we have an interest in owning that asset long term. So, that also helps the kind of flywheel accelerate in these expansion markets. Yes. Thanks, Sam. Short answer is when we arrived at our portfolio allocation decisions a couple of years ago, it incorporated in the prospect of the regulatory environment. And so, it continues to be a motivator on why we want to get our exposure in the expansion markets at a minimum for diversification as it relates to various regulatory dynamics. All right. Thank you. Thank you for joining us today. And we look forward to visiting with you in person over the coming months."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the Company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your host for today\u2019s conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Doug, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon\u2019s press release as well as in the Company\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today\u2019s discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ben Schall, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Ben?\nBen Schall: Thank you, Jason, and thank you everyone for joining us today, here with Kevin, Matt, Sean, and after our opening comments, we will open the lineup for questions. In many ways, Q3 continued our strong momentum from the first half of the year with significant year-over-year increases in our earnings and operating metrics. As referenced on slide 4 of our quarterly investor presentation, core FFO for the quarter increased 21% as compared to a year ago. Same-store revenue increased almost 12% from last year, and 2.2% sequentially compared to our strong Q2 figure. Before progressing further into the presentation, I wanted to emphasize a number of AvalonBay specific drivers of future earnings growth. First up and as Sean will describe more fully, we expect to head into 2023 with an earn-in above traditional levels. In short, just a simple roll through of our existing rent roll creates positive earnings momentum, which can then be further enhanced by our underlying loss-to-lease. There are then three other drivers of earnings growth, which we estimate should generate in the range of $200 million of incremental NOI over the next several years. The most significant of these drivers is the development projects we have underway, which we refer to as projects with yesterday\u2019s costs and today\u2019s rents. Our current lease-ups continue to outperform, currently yielding nearly 7%, and we expect our current development activity to deliver $130 million of incremental NOI upon stabilization, which Matt will cover further. The other two significant drivers are further margin improvement from our operating model initiatives, which we\u2019ve targeted for $50 million of NOI uplift and expect to have delivered about 40% or $20 million of this NOI uplift to our bottom line by year-end and the return on our structured investment program as we build that book of business up to $300 million to $500 million. In a potentially recessionary environment, the $200 million of incremental earnings generated from these activities collectively serve as a ballast for our future earnings. Turning to slide 5. While our Q3 performance was strong, it was short of guidance. Q3 core FFO per share was $0.02 below guidance, and we reduced our full year core FFO per share figure by $0.07, updating our estimate of full year core FFO growth to 18.5%. For the full year, on the revenue side, while we contemplated the return of rent seasonality, the seasonal trend line has been slightly greater than historical norms. On the expense side, turnover has been slightly higher than we forecasted, leading to higher repairs and maintenance costs to turn apartments, and utility costs are projected to be higher. Slide 6 highlights how we\u2019ve been actively adjusting our balance sheet and [Technical Difficulty] strategy during the year based on the changing capital markets environment. Based on the steps taken by Kevin and Joanne Lockridge and our Capital Markets team, our balance sheet is stronger than ever. Recently, we increased our line of credit by $500 million to $2.25 billion and extended the maturity date out to 2026. Additionally, we have an interest rate swap in place for our next $150 million of debt borrowings and our $500 million equity forward proactively addressed the bulk of development funding through the end of 2023. On the transaction front, we shifted our strategy earlier this year to a posture of selling assets first and locking in the cost of that capital before selectively deploying capital into acquisitions in our expansion markets, which given cap rate movements has worked to our benefit. As part of this shift, we also pivoted during the year from expecting to be a net buyer of approximately $275 million to being a net seller of $400 million or nearly $700 million total swing. In an environment where profit margins on new development are likely to come down and the costs associated with that incremental capital has increased, we\u2019ve also reduced new development starts. For 2022, we reduced our starts from $1.15 billion to a projected $850 million. In 2023, while we haven\u2019t provided guidance regarding new starts, our expected start figure is trending lower than we previously anticipated as we use the flexibility we have with our development rights pipeline to manage our land contracts and the timing of potential starts. We will continue to make adjustments based on trends in rent and construction costs, the spread between potential development yields and underlying market cap rates with a continued target of 100 to 150 basis to spread and our cost of incremental capital with a laser focus on making the appropriate long-term value-creation decisions. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it to Sean to more fully discuss the operating environment and our approach.\nSean Breslin: All right. Thank you, Ben. Before I start, I\u2019d like to give a big shout out to all the AvalonBay associates who are out there working hard to provide our customers with a high-quality apartment home and service experience. I\u2019d like to thank you for your efforts with our customers and the performance you deliver for our shareholders. Moving to slide 7. Our strong Q3 revenue growth of 11.8% was primarily driven by higher lease rates, which increased 9.5% year-over-year, the reduced impact of concessions, which contributed 240 basis points and other more modest contributions from other rental revenue and underlying bad debt trends. As noted on the chart, rent relief was 140 basis-point headwind for the quarter as we recognized $5.7 million versus the $12.7 million from Q3 2021. Turning to slide 8. Same-store trends during the quarter remained quite strong relative to historical norms. Starting with chart 1, turnover increased a little more than we anticipated as we pushed through healthy rent increases, but was still well below pre-pandemic levels. As a result of the increased turnover, physical occupancy ticked down to 96%, but remained roughly 20 basis points above our typical experience during the quarter. Additionally, as noted in the 2 charts at the bottom of the slide, while our availability increased relative to the last few quarters, we realized a double-digit rent increase on the unit inventory we leased and occupied during the quarter, a very favorable outcome that sets us up well for 2023. Moving to slide 9. I thought I\u2019d provide an overview of some of the key revenue drivers for our portfolio as we think ahead to 2023. Beginning with chart 1, given the very strong rent change we\u2019ve experienced this year, we\u2019ll likely start in 2023 with built-in revenue growth of roughly 4%, the second highest level in our history, and more than 100 basis points stronger than our starting point of roughly 2.5% entering 2022. In addition to the baked-in revenue growth outlined in chart 1, our loss-to-lease is currently running at roughly 6% and is depicted in chart 2, providing plenty of opportunity to benefit from renewal rent increases as leases expire throughout 2023. Shifting to the bottom of the slide, chart 3, our collection rate from residence continues to improve. At the beginning of the year, bad debt was trending in the high 4% range but has declined by roughly 200 basis points as the years progressed. As eviction moratoria has expired and the courts are continuing to make progress processing new cases, we expect the overall downward trend to continue as we move into 2023, providing a tailwind for revenue growth. Of course, as indicated in chart 4, we\u2019ll likely experience immaterial amounts of rent relief in 2023 as compared to the $35 million we\u2019ve recognized in 2022, presenting a headwind for \u201823 revenue growth. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Matt to address development. Matt?\nMatt Birenbaum: Great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to slide 10. [Technical Difficulty] development communities currently in lease-up, all of which are in suburban locations that have seen very limited new supply and strong demand over the past few years. These developments are benefiting from today\u2019s higher rents while having a basis based on yesterday\u2019s lower construction costs, resulting in an exceptional yield on cost, as Ben mentioned earlier, of nearly 7%. As these communities reach stabilization, they will contribute strong growth to both NAV and core FFO. As shown on slide 11, the vast majority of our development NOI is still to come. The $2.6 billion in development currently underway is mostly still in the earlier stages of construction and generated only $19 million in annualized NOI this past quarter. As these assets proceed to lease-up and stabilization, we expect another $130 million in NOI, which will drive further earnings growth over the next several years. It\u2019s also worth noting that this future growth is based on our conservative underwriting with untrended rents that are set when construction starts as we typically do not mark rents on these projects to current market levels until we\u2019ve achieved roughly 20% lease status. And again, with only four of these assets currently at that level of leasing, the vast majority of our development underway should benefit from a further lift in NOI when they do open for business as evidenced by the $385 per month lift in rents shown on the prior slide on those four deals that are currently in lease-up. In the transaction market, we\u2019ve also been ramping up our disposition activity in the past quarter, using the asset sales market to source attractively priced capital to fund this development. We were able to close on the sale of five wholly-owned assets in Q3, which were priced before the most recent increase in interest rates, generating $540 million of proceeds at a weighted average cap rate of 4.1% and pricing of $480,000 per home. We also completed the sale of the final assets in one of our private investment fund vehicles last quarter, generating additional capital and with pricing of $470,000 per home and a 3.6% cap rate. Since the start of the year, as best we can tell, cap rates have risen roughly 75 to 100 basis points in our established coastal regions, where we\u2019ve been trading out of assets while cap rates in our expansion regions have risen more on the order of 100 to 150 basis points. Strong growth in NOI has offset some of this rise in cap rates. But on balance, as values might be down roughly 10% to 15% in our established regions and maybe 15% to 25% in these expansion markets, we think this bodes well for our future portfolio trading activity as the relative value of what we are selling has been less diminished than what we are buying. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin to review our funding position and the balance sheet.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Great. Thanks, Matt. Turning to slide 13, as Ben mentioned in his opening remarks, with the shift in the capital markets this year, we\u2019ve taken a number of steps to bolster our already strong financial position. These steps include having increased our match-funding and development underway with long-term capital to approximately 95% as of the end of the third quarter, up from about 80% at the beginning of the year. As a result, we have locked in the cost of capital on nearly all of the $2.5 billion of development underway, essentially with yesterday\u2019s lower cost of capital, which in turn will help to ensure that these projects will provide earnings and NAV growth when they are completed and stabilized. In addition, as you can see on slide 14, another step we\u2019ve taken is the recent renewal and expansion of our line of credit $2.25 billion, which is up by $500 million from our previous $1.75 billion line of credit. As a result, we possess tremendous financial strength and flexibility. In particular, at quarter end, we enjoyed $1.9 billion in excess liquidity relative to our unfunded investment commitments of $300 million. Our leverage declined to 4.6 times net debt to EBITDA at quarter end versus 5.1 times in the fourth quarter of last year, and we remain comfortably below our target range of 5 to 6 times. Our unencumbered NOI percentage remained at a record level of strength at 95%, and our debt maturities are both relatively modest in size and well laddered with the weighted average years to maturity of just over eight years. Thus, as a consequence of our conservative approach to balance sheet management and the other actions we\u2019ve taken recently, including the $500 million equity forward that we completed in April at a share price of $255, we possess tremendous financial flexibility and do not need to tap the capital markets to fund our business for an extended period of time. Finally, on slide 15, as you\u2019re aware, AvalonBay has long maintained a commitment to being a leader in sustainability and corporate responsibility. It\u2019s a goal that is consistent with our culture and our core values of integrity, spirit of carrying a continuous improvement, and it is of increasing [Technical Difficulty] to our residents, to our associates and to our investors. On slide 15, we are excited to report that we received our highest score yet from the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark, or GRESB. This year, we earned the 5-star designation for the eighth year in a row. We also earned the number one spot among the 11 listed multifamily residential companies and the number one spot among the 37 listed residential companies. We are grateful for GRESB for acknowledging our progress in this important area, and we are especially grateful to our own people for their efforts in making these achievements possible and for their ongoing commitment to making a positive difference in the lives of our residents and the communities in which we operate. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ben.\nBen Schall: Thanks, Kevin. And quickly to summarize, we\u2019re pleased with our continued strong earnings and operating momentum with a number of AvalonBay specific earnings drivers in front of us. In this environment, we have and will continue to adjust our approaches to strengthen our position and to allow us to keep our focus on long-term value creation. We\u2019re confident that we are well positioned for a broad range of potential economic paths and to potentially step into opportunities based on dislocations in the marketplace. And I\u2019ll end by reiterating our thanks to the wider AvalonBay associate base for their commitments to our ESG leadership and their broader dedication to our mission of creating a better way to live. With that, I\u2019ll turn it to the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. So, I understand the seasonality returning this year, but a bit surprised that impacted 3Q as much as it did. I was hoping you could provide some more details on when it really started to diverge versus your expectations? And then if there are any specific markets that drove it?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Nick, it\u2019s Sean. Happy to address that. And you are correct that more of the impact is being felt is our expectation in Q4 as compared to Q3 if you look at the road map that we have provided. But for the most part, when we did our [Technical Difficulty] forecast, we expected and I communicated on the last call that seasonality would return, but our expectation based on what we have seen thus far is it would be about half the normal rate that we typically see. And we started to see that begin to shift in August, kind of late August for us. It impacted sort of late August and moving into September and then continues to bleed into the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s really how it played out. I mean, if you look at the rent change that we expected, July was pretty much spot on what we expected. But then, as you move through the balance of the last couple of months here, it has decelerated from what we anticipated, mainly on the move-in side. Renewals have held up relatively well. But on the move-in side it\u2019s decelerated, which corresponds with the adjustment in asking rents as you move through the season. So, that\u2019s how that played out. And in terms of markets, for the most part, there\u2019s really about three regions that are responsible for most of it is Northern California, the Pacific Northwest and to a somewhat lesser degree, the Mid-Atlantic. Those are really the primary three.\nNick Joseph: And then, I recognize you guys have been a bit tactical adjusting your approach being net sellers, slowing a bit on the start side. How are you thinking about now being the right time to grow the structured investment product program? And what changes are you seeing to the mezz market and yields there?\nMatt Birenbaum: Hey Nick, this is Matt. The -- our entry into that space really was kind of a strategic decision that we made a year or two ago. And so, we\u2019re just building the book. This is the first year we\u2019ve originated investments. I actually think it\u2019s probably a good time to be entering that market because capital is getting more and more scarce. So, for sure, our phone is ringing more and more. And some of that is some of the relationships we\u2019ve established with some of the construction lenders, and some of that is just capital is getting harder to put together for new starts. So, we have the ability to be very selective and measured about the business that we take on, which we\u2019re certainly doing. Our rates are rising a bit in terms of the coupon that we\u2019ll be charging on those investments. And our underwriting will reflect what\u2019s going on in the current market. So, we generally are looking at kind of where our lender basis will be on those assets when they\u2019re completed and compare that to current spot values today. Again, everything kind of trended on the eyes. And then when we look at what the margin is between those two and we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got an adequate margin there of safety in case asset values erode further. So, we think that it\u2019s actually not a bad time to be in the business, but it\u2019s going to certainly be harder for developers to get deals to work, and we may have to look at 15 deals for every 1 that we\u2019re willing to commit to.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore.\nSteve Sakwa: I guess on slide 9, if you were to combine the impacts of slide 3 and 4 or charts 3 and 4, kind of into a net bad debt number for all of 2022, what is that number? And what is your expectation for that trend in \u201823 broadly?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Steve, it\u2019s Sean. Happy to take that one. So for the full year 2022, we expect our reported net bad debt to be roughly 1.7% which includes the benefit of our estimation of $36 million to $37 million in rent relief that we\u2019ve recognized or will recognize throughout the full calendar year. If you strip out the impact of rent relief, underlying bad debt is associated with our resident base essentially started the year in the high-4% range and is expected to end the year at roughly 2.7%. So, if you look forward to 2023, the way to think about it is, at this point, we expect really immaterial amounts of rent relief, if any, for 2023. As a result, underlying bad debt trends for the full year 2023 would need to average essentially that 1.7% that I mentioned to have a neutral impact on revenue growth for the full year. And so, we certainly expect continued improvement in underlying bad debt trends as we move into 2023. But it\u2019s still early to provide a precise forecast. I\u2019d say at this point, based on what we know, in terms of what\u2019s happening with eviction moratorium in L.A. as an example, expiring in February and how things will play out in the courts and in markets like L.A. It\u2019s probably more likely than not that net bad debt will be a modest headwind to 2023 revenue growth based on what we know today.\nSteve Sakwa: And then just secondly, maybe for Matt. I realize pegging construction cost is a little difficult. But if you were to kind of look at the projects that maybe are most near term on deck to start next year, where do you think those are sort of penciling out on a return basis? And is it that you need to see costs come down more to make those really work, or is it that rents need to keep going up to get them into the zone?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Steve, it\u2019s probably -- it depends. It really does vary based on the [Technical Difficulty] and the region. So, the -- our target yields have been moving up. So, our current development underway as shown on the exhibit is in the high-5s yield, and a lot of those deals when they actually start leasing will be above 6, because a lot of those deals, as I mentioned, aren\u2019t mark-to-market yet. On the deals in the pipeline that we haven\u2019t yet started, that pipeline was underwriting somewhere on average to kind of the mid-5s, and that\u2019s thin based on where cap rates are trending towards today. So some of those deals will be comfortably above prevailing cap rates and our targets and, therefore, generate good value creation, even based on today\u2019s hard costs and rents. And then some of those deals will need some form of help in terms of hard costs potentially starting to level off or come down some. And then some may require some -- a second look at the land. Most of those deals that we have in the pipeline, we have not yet bought the land on. We\u2019ve only bought the land on 7 of 30-some development rights that we have. So, we do have the ability at that time to have another conversation with those land sellers, if appropriate and if need be. So, it\u2019s going to be a combination of all those things. We are definitely starting to see hard cost level off, much better bid coverage, not everywhere, but in a lot of regions. And I think that hopefully, there\u2019s a pretty good chance that hard costs, some trades may start to come down. Obviously, some of the commodities come down, lumber, copper, but overall, total hard costs are still well north of where they were on a year-over-year basis, if not on a sequential basis.\nBen Schall: Steve, this is Ben. I\u2019d add -- that was well put by Matt. I\u2019d add a couple of elements. This really gets into the underlying flexibility that we have in our development rights pipeline. So part of it is potential retrading land to today\u2019s values. The other part if maybe not the more significant part is with respect to timing, right? So it allows us to manage the timing of our pipeline, which potentially allows some of the normalization that you were getting at in your question about the trend lines on rents and construction costs.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Just one last one for Sean. Just are you seeing any sort of behavioral trends, doubling up, roommates, folks moving out just in any markets that creates any sort of concern going into \u201823 from a demand perspective?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Steve, nothing at this point, no. I mean, the trend that we talked about as we move through COVID, was the fewer number of adults per household. We looked at that carefully in the third quarter that sort of remains a tax. So, we\u2019re not seeing the behavioral elements as you talked about that relate to people feeling pinched if you want to describe it that way. I mean, new lease income for our residents moved in, in the third quarter was up 11% compared to last year move-ins in the third quarter, move-in values were up around 10%, 11%. So it sort of matches, things are kind of running equal. And then, the only other thing I\u2019d say is we continue to see good movement into our markets in terms of what we call these big moves I mentioned in the past, which is people moving in from greater than 150 miles away. That was up roughly 20% in terms of volume in the third quarter as compared to kind of pre-COVID norms, solid trend in the urban environment, solid trend in the suburban job center environments. Same trend, but not as strong in some of the more outlined suburban areas. So, that trend continues, which I think is a function of a number of different things, but certainly, people being called back to the office on a more consistent basis, probably has something to do with that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc.\nAustin Wurschmidt: So, I appreciate all the detail you guys gave on seasonality, but the guidance reduction was a bit of a surprise given the loss to lease position you were in back in July. And I\u2019m just curious if at any point you considered providing an intra-quarter update for -- operationally about what was happening more real time through your portfolio?\nSean Breslin: Yes. That\u2019s not our practice overall. So, we didn\u2019t feel like there was necessarily the need to do that. And if you look at the breakout of the road map for the third quarter, the revenue where things came in relative to our expectations was $0.01, and that\u2019s it. So, we didn\u2019t feel like it was material enough to preempt the normal process that we go through.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Understand. And then, just going to development a little bit. You guys have historically targeted development in the 10% to 15% of enterprise value, you\u2019ve been running below that for various reasons in recent years. But over time, I guess, what\u2019s the right level of development that you think kind of gets the benefit of value creation and also manages the earnings impact throughout a cycle without really getting dinged for the various risks associated with being in that business?\nBen Schall: So, a good question, and one we\u2019ve talked about from a strategic perspective. It is -- I\u2019ll make a couple of comments on it. One, as we\u2019ve thought about the opportunities in our expansion markets and other reasons, we\u2019re headed to our expansion markets in addition to more and more of our type of customer and knowledge-based worker there, it allows us to take what we do well, including our development platform and have a wider playing field. So, that is part of the effort there. In terms of the percentage of where we are today towards where we\u2019d like to get to, you\u2019re right, it has been in the sort of 4% to 5% range. And for a lot of last year, we were very actively looking to build up our development rights pipeline to take advantage of the opportunities. Now, in reality, right, when our cost of capital changes, right, we\u2019re going to change our return thresholds and we\u2019re going to change the level that we\u2019re pulling. So, longer term, right, we\u2019d like to continue to grow our development book as a percentage of our business from where it is today, but we recognize in the near term that we\u2019re going to be more restrained given the broader economic environment.\nAustin Wurschmidt: And then, just last part. So, when you kind of look at the development pipeline today, I know there are moving variables specifically in the owned versus option land portion. But what percentage of those deals would price based on the 100 to 150 basis-point spread you outlined in your prepared remarks?\nMatt Birenbaum: I don\u2019t know that I can put a percentage on it necessarily. A lot of those deals are deals that are going through an entitlement process are still a couple of years out. And so kind of knowing what comes out of that process, kind of is -- we\u2019re very good at that, but that is speculative -- there\u2019s a wide variety of outcomes on some of those. It\u2019s really hard to say kind of -- what I\u2019ll say is there\u2019s certainly significant number that will work in today\u2019s environment. And then there\u2019s a significant number that probably will require some kind of change, whether it\u2019s some combination of hard cost or land value. And we\u2019re going to just continue to work through those -- dynamic environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Spector with Bank of America.\nJeff Spector: First question, can you talk about any differences you\u2019re seeing between your urban portfolio versus suburban assets?\nSean Breslin: Anything specific, Jeff, just in terms of performance trends overall or\u2026?\nJeff Spector: Yes, just -- yes, exactly performance trends. If you could talk a little bit more about move-ins versus turnover, rent trends? Are you seeing anything -- are there any differences between urban and suburban, or are they acting similar?\nSean Breslin: Okay. Yes. So, that\u2019s helpful. So, yes, I mean what I would say is like on rent change, we provided rent change in the earnings release. And I highlighted in my prepared remarks, which was essentially 11% for the quarter. As you might expect given the recovery in the urban environment, was a little longer on the urban side, about 12.5% compared to suburban, which is around 10.2%. And then across the markets, I mean, the only thing that I would point out that I mentioned earlier is a little more weakness in the urban environments in both Northern California and Seattle as opposed to, say, New York City or urban Boston as an example. Other than that, things are about what you would expect in terms of rent income is moving up -- or excuse me, lease income is moving up with new move-ins, things of that sort. And then, as I mentioned, just a couple of moments ago that we are seeing more move-ins from 150 miles away into our urban job center and suburban job center environment as compared to maybe some of the more outlined suburban areas. Those are probably the three that are top of mind for me.\nBen Schall: Jeff, the other area in terms of suburban versus urban and gets us to what we see as the general strength of our portfolio positioning is on the topic of supply, right? Two-thirds of our business is in the suburban coastal markets. Supply -- new supplies of [Technical Difficulty] stock has been in the range of 1.5%. And as we look out next year, that number is probably coming down even a little bit more. So, in a potentially softening environment or a recessionary environment, our belief is markets with lower supply are going to prove out to be more durable and more resilient.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. To clarify, are you saying that\u2019s suburban versus urban or you\u2019re saying in all, lower as a percentage\u2026\nBen Schall: So, that\u2019s our 1.5% of stock. That\u2019s in our suburban markets. And supply is higher in our urban markets. The other third of our portfolio is obviously also higher in the Sunbelt markets, right? So, as we look out on overall portfolio positioning, we think we\u2019re in a relatively strong place from that perspective.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. And then I had a follow-up on the turnover. I guess, I think you do surveys on turnover like reasons to move out. Can you discuss that at all? I mean, do you -- I think you do those surveys?\nSean Breslin: Yes, we do. We track that -- and we [Technical Difficulty] all that kind of good stuff. So, a couple of things on turnover. First is the third quarter was the first quarter this year where turnover wasn\u2019t materially lower as compared to last year. So, if you look back at the data we provided in the earnings release attachments, on previous quarter turnover on a year-over-year basis, it was down pretty significantly anywhere from 500 to 800 basis points versus the third quarter, it was basically flat year-over-year. So, it was a little more turnover than we anticipated. And in terms of reasons, a little bit of an increase in terms of people moving out due to rent increases, not surprising given how much and we were pushing rents. And then, the other piece that really is out there is I talked about the underlying bad debt trend improving, which is a function of a number of variables. One of those is more evictions as we move through the court process or people who are just skipping out because they know they\u2019re getting to their court date. So, a little bit of a pickup there. Those are really the only two that had any kind of pickup in terms of reasons for move out. The others came down in terms of relocation, obviously came down as it relates to home and condo purchase as you might expect, things of that sort, all came down.\nJeff Spector: Thank you. Just curious on the move-outs because of rate, do they comment on if they\u2019re going back to live with parents or do they comment on what they\u2019re doing? Are they going to a lower-priced unit elsewhere?\nSean Breslin: Yes. That\u2019s usually anecdotal. We don\u2019t always have that data that we track it well. We track the ZIP code, so we have that kind of information. But in terms of what they\u2019re actually doing and the reasons behind it, it\u2019s kind of behavioral things and various things like that, that tend to be anecdotal as opposed to real data that you can count on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: I just wanted to ask about rent-to-income ratios in the portfolio, kind of the latest metric that you have and maybe how that compares to a year ago, two years ago or maybe kind of pre-COVID?\nSean Breslin: Yes. No. Good question, Adam. I think the right way to think about it is the comment that I made earlier in that when you look at new move-ins in the third quarter, for this year compared to last year, the household income associated with those move-ins is up around 11%. And if you look at the move-in value associated with those move-ins, it was up about 10%. So these, basically, people are kind of trading at a consistent level from -- if you think of it from a rent to income perspective. So, we have people moving in with that much higher income and our rents are up about that much. It sort of makes sense overall. Certainly, we have some people that are moving out, as I just mentioned, due to rent increase. Given the numbers we\u2019ve been pushing through, that\u2019s not surprising. But we continue to source demand that is comfortable paying what we are expecting and their incomes appear to support it.\nAdam Kramer: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And then, just in terms of the kind of loss to lease, I think it was 15% last quarter. I know you guys disclosed 6% last night. Just in terms of how you view kind of the last couple of months of the year here. I mean, do you anticipate kind of still having a loss to lease as you enter next year, or is kind of the rents that you\u2019re going to run, so you\u2019re going to sign in the next couple of months, probably going to heat up into the kind of that last 6%?\nSean Breslin: Yes, good question. We certainly won\u2019t eat into everything, but I mean maybe a simple way to think about it is if you think about the lease expiration volume that we have typically in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s around 20% of our leases expire. Those folks will get renewal rent increases and that will impact the loss to lease. The third quarter is closer to 30% of our leases expire, 30%, 32%, and that is when seasonal -- the kind of seasonality of rents kick in. So typically, the most impactful quarter is as you\u2019re moving through the third quarter because of not only the heightened volume of lease expirations, but then you have rent seasonality kick in. The fourth quarter is typically much more moderate in terms of the impact on loss to lease as compared to the third quarter. Does that make sense?\nAdam Kramer: Yes, that does. That\u2019s really helpful. Just a final one here, I think the kind of revenue disclosure around this kind of 2023 building blocks is all really helpful. Just wondering on the cost side, and apologies if you guys mentioned and I missed it. But look, I think some peers kind of across the resi space are talking about property tax expense increases kind of given various dynamics there, certainly inflationary impacts, right? I was wondering, maybe again, not asking you to guide here, but just maybe put a little bit of color around 2023 expense growth kind of building blocks or kind of potential headwinds there?\nSean Breslin: Sure. Why don\u2019t I give you a sense of maybe the top three or four categories just how to think about them a little bit. And so, for -- take property taxes, which obviously is the greatest percentage of our expense structure. This year, we\u2019re kind of putting in numbers here that are just under 2%. We don\u2019t expect a sort of 2% handle that we\u2019re experiencing in 2022 to be in place as we move into \u201823, \u201824. There certainly will be upward pressure due to rates and assessments as you have heard from others. Payroll, similar to 2022, should remain very constrained due to our innovation efforts, and you can see what that looks like on the expense attachment to the earnings release in terms of what \u201822 looks like, and then, maybe just a couple of others. Repairs and maintenance, certainly, there\u2019ll be some wage inflation from our contractors and a potential increase in turnover. And then utilities, there\u2019ll be some pressure on rates in the first half of \u201823, given the contract that we signed for procurement of utilities in the middle of \u201822. And there may be some pressure -- or will be some pressure from our bulk internet and smart access offering, but we also expect that profit to be substantial in terms of the growth next year, probably more than triple the level in \u201822 as we move into 2023. So, while there be some pressure on the OpEx side, there\u2019ll be a nice boost to NOI given the revenue contribution from that activity. So, those are kind of the top four in terms of maybe some color as to how to think about them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alan Peterson with Green Street.\nAlan Peterson: Matt, to your earlier point regarding renegotiating land pricing on the development rights pipeline, from the conversations you\u2019re having with brokers and other market participants, are you getting the sense that land sellers are starting to capitulate on pricing? And if so, to what degree?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Alan, I would say it\u2019s early. So, the first thing is land only represents typically 10% to 15% of the total basis in the project, maybe 20% in areas where rents are higher and land represents a higher percentage. So, it doesn\u2019t move the needle nearly as much as hard costs, and land transactions are long-lived deals. So, land deals that are closing now might be land deals that you cut depending on the region 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago, depending if you\u2019re in California or maybe if you\u2019re in Texas, it could have been 6 months ago. But -- so they are a lagging indicator and those brokers sometimes are similar, but it\u2019s going to take time there. You\u2019ll see it first, and we are seeing it first in the transaction market. And then over time, it will work its way backwards through the system, so to speak.\nAlan Peterson: I appreciate that. That\u2019s helpful. And Sean, in regards to the operating trends in October, the high 3% effective rent change in Northern California, is that starting to imply negative new lease growth within that region?\nSean Breslin: No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s still positive.\nAlan Peterson: It\u2019s still positive. Are you getting the sense that you\u2019re going to need to turn on concessions or potentially reduce rents to maintain occupancy across Northern California or even the Pacific Northwest, which you mentioned was a little bit softer than the rest of the portfolio?\nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean, I don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s going to look like for the rest of the year. But certainly, that\u2019s a possibility to the extent that we see some weak environments there, for sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: I had a question on development starts that you\u2019ve reduced. Ben, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the likelihood of compressed profit margins. And I\u2019m assuming that means the yield -- the difference between yields and market cap rates. If that\u2019s the case, what are you underwriting for cap rates on developments that you\u2019re starting today?\nBen Schall: John, the profits have come down. If you look back a year ago, we were running at development profits that were to tune of 50% because the spread between where we are developing to the underlying cap rates was out to 250 basis points. That\u2019s the type of arena. So, that has compressed. And what I would guide you to, as I mentioned before, is our focus on maintaining 100 to 150 basis points of spread between where we\u2019re developing and where underlying cap rates are. There can be and like would be certain deals that are slightly below that. But as a group, that\u2019s the approach.\nJohn Kim: On the development and lease-up going to almost 7% yield, is that specific to those projects because your overall pipeline is at 5.8%? So, I was wondering if it was just these projects and leased up are currently at those levels, or is there a difference in the way that you calculate the rent as part of that stabilized yield number?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Hey John, it\u2019s Matt. So I guess the answer to that is -- to be clear, that [Technical Difficulty] is on 4 deals, 4 of the 17 development right -- development communities are currently in lease-up. So, those are the only 4 that we\u2019ve marked-to-market, and they are coming in at [Technical Difficulty] today. Now, they were originally underwriting -- underwritten, sorry, if you look at that slide 2, I think, 6.5%. So, they were among the higher-yielding deals on the -- in the development book when we started them based on -- some of that was timing, some of that was location. A lot of those are suburban Northeast deals. But if we see the same uplift in rents on the rest of the book when we mark it to market, when those deals come to lease, that would push the rest of the book up another 40 basis points as well. And obviously, that\u2019s going to depend on what happens to market rents between when we started the deals in today and then between today when they start leasing. So, we may get less, we may get more, but on those deals, we saw that 40 bps uplift.\nJohn Kim: So just to clarify, the 5.8% yield on your overall development pipeline, that\u2019s on your original underwriting, or is that based on the current market rents?\nMatt Birenbaum: So, it\u2019s based on the current market rents on those four deals, which are the [Technical Difficulty] and the other 15 -- or 13 are at what the initial underwriting was. So like I said, the other deals have the same amount of with that overall 5.8%, we\u2019ll probably rise to a 6.0% or 6.1% is a way to think about it. That 5.8% represents 4 deals that are [Technical Difficulty] 13 deals that are not.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: So, two items. First, on the turnover, you guys pointed out in the presentation on page 8 that turnover is still below pre-pandemic levels. So just sort of curious, as you guys -- as the numbers fell below what you thought you would achieve in the third quarter, it still seems like turnover is low historically. So, were you guys just expecting turnover to be even lower? And if that is not the case, how do we think about turnover returning to its pre-pandemic level, especially because I think you said that new rents were the ones that were being hit, whereas the renewals were holding in there.\nSean Breslin: Yes. Alex, it\u2019s Sean. Just to try to be clear, we expect it to be lower, independent of the historical norms. And the reason we had a belief is if you go back and look at the turnover that we experienced in Q1 and Q2 relative to last year as an example. The first quarter of this year, turnover was 35%. Last year, Q1 was 44%. Q2 this year was 46%. Last year, it was 50.8%. Q3 ended up being basically on top of last year. So, we had two quarters earlier this year, where we were pushing rents pretty aggressively that there was a pretty wide spread on a year-over-year basis. So we expect Q3 to continue that trend of being below what we experienced last year, even though we were continuing to push rents. And that was not the case. It was essentially on top of last year. So hopefully, that answers that question as it relates to turnover and our expectations.\nAlexander Goldfarb: That does. And the second question is I think initially, there were three markets that you guys highlighted as being weak, Northern Cal, Seattle and the Mid-Atlantic. You addressed Northern Cal and Seattle to Jeff Spector\u2019s question. Mine is if Mid-Atlantic, if I heard correctly, that Mid-Atlantic is one of the weak ones. That\u2019s a market that just perennially for the past decade has been sort of anemic. So, was this a case where the market you thought would rebound and it just didn\u2019t or it\u2019s weaker than sort of the normal stuff that goes on? Obviously, that market gets placed with supply.\nSean Breslin: Yes. And one thing we should probably try to be clear about, Alex, is when we talked about weaker, weaker, it was just a little bit weaker than our expectations. The revenue miss was $0.01 on $600 million for the quarter. So, it\u2019s not a -- when you run the math, it\u2019s not a significant dollar amount here. And so, we\u2019re still seeing good growth in those markets. In the Mid-Atlantic, as an example, if you take a look at what we experienced in Q3 rent change, it was pushing 10%, California was 9%, Seattle was almost 12%. But things began to decelerate a little more quickly than we anticipated. So, I wouldn\u2019t -- I\u2019d be careful about saying those are the weak markets like things are going south quickly type of approach as opposed to the rate of deceleration was just a little more than we anticipated in terms of rent change. But it\u2019s still -- in absolute terms, these are pretty healthy numbers, well above historical norms when you think about the long-term rent growth across our footprint. These numbers are pretty strong. So, that\u2019s the way I would think about it. But specific to the Mid-Atlantic, there\u2019s three major regions, the [Technical Difficulty] Northern Virginia and then the district. I\u2019d say, the district maybe 1 or 2 pockets in Northern Virginia, probably have struggled the most, particularly D.C. where office utilization remains, I think, is the second lowest in the country at this point behind San Francisco, a lot of professional services jobs, government jobs. And so, the people haven\u2019t necessarily had the need to be in the office. We continue to see positive movement in that trend, but it\u2019s still not where it needs to be to really sort of push through and be in a position where we could see stronger results from the Mid-Atlantic overall, including D.C. So -- and if you look at just absolute job growth here of all of our regions, it\u2019s been the weakest this year. So, you have a combination of weaker job growth. And then for the jobs that you do have, not everybody has to be in the office, and we just need to see better trends in that data to see the market pick up even more.\nAlexander Goldfarb: I mean, as you know, we\u2019re just down there and we\u2019re surprised that when speaking to some government folks that all the government people are still working from home. It\u2019s only the political people who are back in the office, which blew us away. So, your message definitely resonates. So, thank you.\nSean Breslin: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.\nJamie Feldman: Thank you. And this might be a little bit more theoretical. But your comment on underwriting developments at 100 to 150 basis-point spread to market cap rates. I mean, how do you think about cap rates going higher and the risk, especially by the time developments are delivered? Just kind of what are your thoughts around that? And how do you bake that into your underwriting?\nMatt Birenbaum: Hey Jamie, it\u2019s Matt. I\u2019d say a couple of things. The first and most important is match-funding. So, if we\u2019re match-funding that deal with permanent capital when we start it because we\u2019re either sourcing equity or debt or selling an asset that\u2019s based on those prevailing cap rates, then if cap rates are 100 basis points higher, when that deal is finished, we still locked in that spread. It typically works the other way. And honestly, it has like over the last few years, we finished deals and cap rates were a lot lower than they were in the environment in which we funded them. So -- and I think the equity forward is a good example of that in terms of locking in that capital based on kind of what the cap rate was or the yield was on our stock at that time. So, that\u2019s the first thing. Beyond that, obviously, as I mentioned, we don\u2019t trend rents and NOIs that also, most of the time, rents and NOIs are growing. So most of the time, there is some lift there, and that provides a little bit more conservatism as well.\nSteve Sakwa: As you think about underwriting today, what are you baking in for that cushion on the revenue side?\nMatt Birenbaum: Well, like I said, we don\u2019t -- we look at today\u2019s NOI, today\u2019s rents, today\u2019s expenses, today\u2019s cost, and so we come up with a spot yield. And we\u2019ll compare that with a spot cap rate or spot asset value if the asset was being sold today. And then we don\u2019t -- generally, what we find, if you look at -- we have a long history of the deals when they stabilize, stabilizing at yields higher than what we underwrite because of that because we don\u2019t have the growth in there. We have the growth in kind of a 10-year forward IRR model in a long-term return, but not in the yields that we quote.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And so, you\u2019re using spot expenses, too? Is that what you said?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes.\nJamie Feldman: Yes. And how do you think about the risk of that?\nMatt Birenbaum: I mean -- so again, typically what we would see is when a deal stabilizes, rents will have moved, OpEx will have moved some as well. The biggest piece of the OpEx is the property taxes, and that\u2019s really based on the asset value. So, that\u2019s going to be the biggest probably mover in where OpEx settles out relative to where it was [Technical Difficulty] significantly high. It\u2019s usually because the assets were significantly more than we underwrote, which means we got more value creation there. But generally, if everything grows together, we\u2019re at a very high margin -- operating margin business, so we get operating leverage. And if rents and OpEx grow at the same percentage rate, that means you\u2019re going to wind up with that much more NOI.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.\nTayo Okusanya: My question is around the strategic initiatives you guys started with industrials around co-working space. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the economics of that business, the size of the opportunity and potentially what it could contribute to your bottom line?\nBen Schall: Sure. I would frame it just in the context of our overall initiatives of activating retail space at the bottom of our buildings. A couple of different components of that, one of which was we self-started our own small but self started own co-working program at a project out in California, which we call Second Space. The industrious relationship, which you referenced, is a pilot to further tap into their network of potential clients, as we think about our Second Space product. But it\u2019s an area where we\u2019re actively talking with multiple users, and we think it\u2019s somewhere we can help create some incremental value, particularly to our residents above by creating activated space at the ground floor.\nTayo Okusanya: And you\u2019re just renting the space to industrious, so there\u2019s no kind of shared revenue model or anything like that?\nBen Schall: It\u2019s a -- I don\u2019t want to get too much into details that would give it the pilot nature, but it\u2019s a share -- it\u2019s more of a shared model as opposed to a traditional retail model.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nBen Schall: Thank you all for joining us today. I appreciate the dialogue and look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Birenbaum",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to slide 10. [Technical Difficulty] development communities currently in lease-up, all of which are in suburban locations that have seen very limited new supply and strong demand over the past few years. These developments are benefiting from today's higher rents while having a basis based on yesterday's lower construction costs, resulting in an exceptional yield on cost, as Ben mentioned earlier, of nearly 7%. As these communities reach stabilization, they will contribute strong growth to both NAV and core FFO. As shown on slide 11, the vast majority of our development NOI is still to come. The $2.6 billion in development currently underway is mostly still in the earlier stages of construction and generated only $19 million in annualized NOI this past quarter. As these assets proceed to lease-up and stabilization, we expect another $130 million in NOI, which will drive further earnings growth over the next several years. It's also worth noting that this future growth is based on our conservative underwriting with untrended rents that are set when construction starts as we typically do not mark rents on these projects to current market levels until we've achieved roughly 20% lease status. And again, with only four of these assets currently at that level of leasing, the vast majority of our development underway should benefit from a further lift in NOI when they do open for business as evidenced by the $385 per month lift in rents shown on the prior slide on those four deals that are currently in lease-up. In the transaction market, we've also been ramping up our disposition activity in the past quarter, using the asset sales market to source attractively priced capital to fund this development. We were able to close on the sale of five wholly-owned assets in Q3, which were priced before the most recent increase in interest rates, generating $540 million of proceeds at a weighted average cap rate of 4.1% and pricing of $480,000 per home. We also completed the sale of the final assets in one of our private investment fund vehicles last quarter, generating additional capital and with pricing of $470,000 per home and a 3.6% cap rate. Since the start of the year, as best we can tell, cap rates have risen roughly 75 to 100 basis points in our established coastal regions, where we've been trading out of assets while cap rates in our expansion regions have risen more on the order of 100 to 150 basis points. Strong growth in NOI has offset some of this rise in cap rates. But on balance, as values might be down roughly 10% to 15% in our established regions and maybe 15% to 25% in these expansion markets, we think this bodes well for our future portfolio trading activity as the relative value of what we are selling has been less diminished than what we are buying. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin to review our funding position and the balance sheet. Hey Nick, this is Matt. The -- our entry into that space really was kind of a strategic decision that we made a year or two ago. And so, we're just building the book. This is the first year we've originated investments. I actually think it's probably a good time to be entering that market because capital is getting more and more scarce. So, for sure, our phone is ringing more and more. And some of that is some of the relationships we've established with some of the construction lenders, and some of that is just capital is getting harder to put together for new starts. So, we have the ability to be very selective and measured about the business that we take on, which we're certainly doing. Our rates are rising a bit in terms of the coupon that we'll be charging on those investments. And our underwriting will reflect what's going on in the current market. So, we generally are looking at kind of where our lender basis will be on those assets when they're completed and compare that to current spot values today. Again, everything kind of trended on the eyes. And then when we look at what the margin is between those two and we want to make sure that we've got an adequate margin there of safety in case asset values erode further. So, we think that it's actually not a bad time to be in the business, but it's going to certainly be harder for developers to get deals to work, and we may have to look at 15 deals for every 1 that we're willing to commit to. Yes. Steve, it's probably -- it depends. It really does vary based on the [Technical Difficulty] and the region. So, the -- our target yields have been moving up. So, our current development underway as shown on the exhibit is in the high-5s yield, and a lot of those deals when they actually start leasing will be above 6, because a lot of those deals, as I mentioned, aren't mark-to-market yet. On the deals in the pipeline that we haven't yet started, that pipeline was underwriting somewhere on average to kind of the mid-5s, and that's thin based on where cap rates are trending towards today. So some of those deals will be comfortably above prevailing cap rates and our targets and, therefore, generate good value creation, even based on today's hard costs and rents. And then some of those deals will need some form of help in terms of hard costs potentially starting to level off or come down some. And then some may require some -- a second look at the land. Most of those deals that we have in the pipeline, we have not yet bought the land on. We've only bought the land on 7 of 30-some development rights that we have. So, we do have the ability at that time to have another conversation with those land sellers, if appropriate and if need be. So, it's going to be a combination of all those things. We are definitely starting to see hard cost level off, much better bid coverage, not everywhere, but in a lot of regions. And I think that hopefully, there's a pretty good chance that hard costs, some trades may start to come down. Obviously, some of the commodities come down, lumber, copper, but overall, total hard costs are still well north of where they were on a year-over-year basis, if not on a sequential basis. I don't know that I can put a percentage on it necessarily. A lot of those deals are deals that are going through an entitlement process are still a couple of years out. And so kind of knowing what comes out of that process, kind of is -- we're very good at that, but that is speculative -- there's a wide variety of outcomes on some of those. It's really hard to say kind of -- what I'll say is there's certainly significant number that will work in today's environment. And then there's a significant number that probably will require some kind of change, whether it's some combination of hard cost or land value. And we're going to just continue to work through those -- dynamic environment. Yes. Alan, I would say it's early. So, the first thing is land only represents typically 10% to 15% of the total basis in the project, maybe 20% in areas where rents are higher and land represents a higher percentage. So, it doesn't move the needle nearly as much as hard costs, and land transactions are long-lived deals. So, land deals that are closing now might be land deals that you cut depending on the region 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago, depending if you're in California or maybe if you're in Texas, it could have been 6 months ago. But -- so they are a lagging indicator and those brokers sometimes are similar, but it's going to take time there. You'll see it first, and we are seeing it first in the transaction market. And then over time, it will work its way backwards through the system, so to speak. Yes. Hey John, it's Matt. So I guess the answer to that is -- to be clear, that [Technical Difficulty] is on 4 deals, 4 of the 17 development right -- development communities are currently in lease-up. So, those are the only 4 that we've marked-to-market, and they are coming in at [Technical Difficulty] today. Now, they were originally underwriting -- underwritten, sorry, if you look at that slide 2, I think, 6.5%. So, they were among the higher-yielding deals on the -- in the development book when we started them based on -- some of that was timing, some of that was location. A lot of those are suburban Northeast deals. But if we see the same uplift in rents on the rest of the book when we mark it to market, when those deals come to lease, that would push the rest of the book up another 40 basis points as well. And obviously, that's going to depend on what happens to market rents between when we started the deals in today and then between today when they start leasing. So, we may get less, we may get more, but on those deals, we saw that 40 bps uplift. So, it's based on the current market rents on those four deals, which are the [Technical Difficulty] and the other 15 -- or 13 are at what the initial underwriting was. So like I said, the other deals have the same amount of with that overall 5.8%, we'll probably rise to a 6.0% or 6.1% is a way to think about it. That 5.8% represents 4 deals that are [Technical Difficulty] 13 deals that are not. Hey Jamie, it's Matt. I'd say a couple of things. The first and most important is match-funding. So, if we're match-funding that deal with permanent capital when we start it because we're either sourcing equity or debt or selling an asset that's based on those prevailing cap rates, then if cap rates are 100 basis points higher, when that deal is finished, we still locked in that spread. It typically works the other way. And honestly, it has like over the last few years, we finished deals and cap rates were a lot lower than they were in the environment in which we funded them. So -- and I think the equity forward is a good example of that in terms of locking in that capital based on kind of what the cap rate was or the yield was on our stock at that time. So, that's the first thing. Beyond that, obviously, as I mentioned, we don't trend rents and NOIs that also, most of the time, rents and NOIs are growing. So most of the time, there is some lift there, and that provides a little bit more conservatism as well. Well, like I said, we don't -- we look at today's NOI, today's rents, today's expenses, today's cost, and so we come up with a spot yield. And we'll compare that with a spot cap rate or spot asset value if the asset was being sold today. And then we don't -- generally, what we find, if you look at -- we have a long history of the deals when they stabilize, stabilizing at yields higher than what we underwrite because of that because we don't have the growth in there. We have the growth in kind of a 10-year forward IRR model in a long-term return, but not in the yields that we quote. Yes. I mean -- so again, typically what we would see is when a deal stabilizes, rents will have moved, OpEx will have moved some as well. The biggest piece of the OpEx is the property taxes, and that's really based on the asset value. So, that's going to be the biggest probably mover in where OpEx settles out relative to where it was [Technical Difficulty] significantly high. It's usually because the assets were significantly more than we underwrote, which means we got more value creation there. But generally, if everything grows together, we're at a very high margin -- operating margin business, so we get operating leverage. And if rents and OpEx grow at the same percentage rate, that means you're going to wind up with that much more NOI."

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Matt. Turning to slide 13, as Ben mentioned in his opening remarks, with the shift in the capital markets this year, we've taken a number of steps to bolster our already strong financial position. These steps include having increased our match-funding and development underway with long-term capital to approximately 95% as of the end of the third quarter, up from about 80% at the beginning of the year. As a result, we have locked in the cost of capital on nearly all of the $2.5 billion of development underway, essentially with yesterday's lower cost of capital, which in turn will help to ensure that these projects will provide earnings and NAV growth when they are completed and stabilized. In addition, as you can see on slide 14, another step we've taken is the recent renewal and expansion of our line of credit $2.25 billion, which is up by $500 million from our previous $1.75 billion line of credit. As a result, we possess tremendous financial strength and flexibility. In particular, at quarter end, we enjoyed $1.9 billion in excess liquidity relative to our unfunded investment commitments of $300 million. Our leverage declined to 4.6 times net debt to EBITDA at quarter end versus 5.1 times in the fourth quarter of last year, and we remain comfortably below our target range of 5 to 6 times. Our unencumbered NOI percentage remained at a record level of strength at 95%, and our debt maturities are both relatively modest in size and well laddered with the weighted average years to maturity of just over eight years. Thus, as a consequence of our conservative approach to balance sheet management and the other actions we've taken recently, including the $500 million equity forward that we completed in April at a share price of $255, we possess tremendous financial flexibility and do not need to tap the capital markets to fund our business for an extended period of time. Finally, on slide 15, as you're aware, AvalonBay has long maintained a commitment to being a leader in sustainability and corporate responsibility. It's a goal that is consistent with our culture and our core values of integrity, spirit of carrying a continuous improvement, and it is of increasing [Technical Difficulty] to our residents, to our associates and to our investors. On slide 15, we are excited to report that we received our highest score yet from the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark, or GRESB. This year, we earned the 5-star designation for the eighth year in a row. We also earned the number one spot among the 11 listed multifamily residential companies and the number one spot among the 37 listed residential companies. We are grateful for GRESB for acknowledging our progress in this important area, and we are especially grateful to our own people for their efforts in making these achievements possible and for their ongoing commitment to making a positive difference in the lives of our residents and the communities in which we operate. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ben."

            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Ben. Before I start, I'd like to give a big shout out to all the AvalonBay associates who are out there working hard to provide our customers with a high-quality apartment home and service experience. I'd like to thank you for your efforts with our customers and the performance you deliver for our shareholders. Moving to slide 7. Our strong Q3 revenue growth of 11.8% was primarily driven by higher lease rates, which increased 9.5% year-over-year, the reduced impact of concessions, which contributed 240 basis points and other more modest contributions from other rental revenue and underlying bad debt trends. As noted on the chart, rent relief was 140 basis-point headwind for the quarter as we recognized $5.7 million versus the $12.7 million from Q3 2021. Turning to slide 8. Same-store trends during the quarter remained quite strong relative to historical norms. Starting with chart 1, turnover increased a little more than we anticipated as we pushed through healthy rent increases, but was still well below pre-pandemic levels. As a result of the increased turnover, physical occupancy ticked down to 96%, but remained roughly 20 basis points above our typical experience during the quarter. Additionally, as noted in the 2 charts at the bottom of the slide, while our availability increased relative to the last few quarters, we realized a double-digit rent increase on the unit inventory we leased and occupied during the quarter, a very favorable outcome that sets us up well for 2023. Moving to slide 9. I thought I'd provide an overview of some of the key revenue drivers for our portfolio as we think ahead to 2023. Beginning with chart 1, given the very strong rent change we've experienced this year, we'll likely start in 2023 with built-in revenue growth of roughly 4%, the second highest level in our history, and more than 100 basis points stronger than our starting point of roughly 2.5% entering 2022. In addition to the baked-in revenue growth outlined in chart 1, our loss-to-lease is currently running at roughly 6% and is depicted in chart 2, providing plenty of opportunity to benefit from renewal rent increases as leases expire throughout 2023. Shifting to the bottom of the slide, chart 3, our collection rate from residence continues to improve. At the beginning of the year, bad debt was trending in the high 4% range but has declined by roughly 200 basis points as the years progressed. As eviction moratoria has expired and the courts are continuing to make progress processing new cases, we expect the overall downward trend to continue as we move into 2023, providing a tailwind for revenue growth. Of course, as indicated in chart 4, we'll likely experience immaterial amounts of rent relief in 2023 as compared to the $35 million we've recognized in 2022, presenting a headwind for \u201823 revenue growth. Now, I'll turn it over to Matt to address development. Matt? Yes. Nick, it's Sean. Happy to address that. And you are correct that more of the impact is being felt is our expectation in Q4 as compared to Q3 if you look at the road map that we have provided. But for the most part, when we did our [Technical Difficulty] forecast, we expected and I communicated on the last call that seasonality would return, but our expectation based on what we have seen thus far is it would be about half the normal rate that we typically see. And we started to see that begin to shift in August, kind of late August for us. It impacted sort of late August and moving into September and then continues to bleed into the fourth quarter. So, that's really how it played out. I mean, if you look at the rent change that we expected, July was pretty much spot on what we expected. But then, as you move through the balance of the last couple of months here, it has decelerated from what we anticipated, mainly on the move-in side. Renewals have held up relatively well. But on the move-in side it's decelerated, which corresponds with the adjustment in asking rents as you move through the season. So, that's how that played out. And in terms of markets, for the most part, there's really about three regions that are responsible for most of it is Northern California, the Pacific Northwest and to a somewhat lesser degree, the Mid-Atlantic. Those are really the primary three. Yes. Steve, it's Sean. Happy to take that one. So for the full year 2022, we expect our reported net bad debt to be roughly 1.7% which includes the benefit of our estimation of $36 million to $37 million in rent relief that we've recognized or will recognize throughout the full calendar year. If you strip out the impact of rent relief, underlying bad debt is associated with our resident base essentially started the year in the high-4% range and is expected to end the year at roughly 2.7%. So, if you look forward to 2023, the way to think about it is, at this point, we expect really immaterial amounts of rent relief, if any, for 2023. As a result, underlying bad debt trends for the full year 2023 would need to average essentially that 1.7% that I mentioned to have a neutral impact on revenue growth for the full year. And so, we certainly expect continued improvement in underlying bad debt trends as we move into 2023. But it's still early to provide a precise forecast. I'd say at this point, based on what we know, in terms of what's happening with eviction moratorium in L.A. as an example, expiring in February and how things will play out in the courts and in markets like L.A. It's probably more likely than not that net bad debt will be a modest headwind to 2023 revenue growth based on what we know today. Yes. Steve, nothing at this point, no. I mean, the trend that we talked about as we move through COVID, was the fewer number of adults per household. We looked at that carefully in the third quarter that sort of remains a tax. So, we're not seeing the behavioral elements as you talked about that relate to people feeling pinched if you want to describe it that way. I mean, new lease income for our residents moved in, in the third quarter was up 11% compared to last year move-ins in the third quarter, move-in values were up around 10%, 11%. So it sort of matches, things are kind of running equal. And then, the only other thing I'd say is we continue to see good movement into our markets in terms of what we call these big moves I mentioned in the past, which is people moving in from greater than 150 miles away. That was up roughly 20% in terms of volume in the third quarter as compared to kind of pre-COVID norms, solid trend in the urban environment, solid trend in the suburban job center environments. Same trend, but not as strong in some of the more outlined suburban areas. So, that trend continues, which I think is a function of a number of different things, but certainly, people being called back to the office on a more consistent basis, probably has something to do with that. Yes. That's not our practice overall. So, we didn't feel like there was necessarily the need to do that. And if you look at the breakout of the road map for the third quarter, the revenue where things came in relative to our expectations was $0.01, and that's it. So, we didn't feel like it was material enough to preempt the normal process that we go through. Anything specific, Jeff, just in terms of performance trends overall or...? Okay. Yes. So, that's helpful. So, yes, I mean what I would say is like on rent change, we provided rent change in the earnings release. And I highlighted in my prepared remarks, which was essentially 11% for the quarter. As you might expect given the recovery in the urban environment, was a little longer on the urban side, about 12.5% compared to suburban, which is around 10.2%. And then across the markets, I mean, the only thing that I would point out that I mentioned earlier is a little more weakness in the urban environments in both Northern California and Seattle as opposed to, say, New York City or urban Boston as an example. Other than that, things are about what you would expect in terms of rent income is moving up -- or excuse me, lease income is moving up with new move-ins, things of that sort. And then, as I mentioned, just a couple of moments ago that we are seeing more move-ins from 150 miles away into our urban job center and suburban job center environment as compared to maybe some of the more outlined suburban areas. Those are probably the three that are top of mind for me. Yes, we do. We track that -- and we [Technical Difficulty] all that kind of good stuff. So, a couple of things on turnover. First is the third quarter was the first quarter this year where turnover wasn't materially lower as compared to last year. So, if you look back at the data we provided in the earnings release attachments, on previous quarter turnover on a year-over-year basis, it was down pretty significantly anywhere from 500 to 800 basis points versus the third quarter, it was basically flat year-over-year. So, it was a little more turnover than we anticipated. And in terms of reasons, a little bit of an increase in terms of people moving out due to rent increases, not surprising given how much and we were pushing rents. And then, the other piece that really is out there is I talked about the underlying bad debt trend improving, which is a function of a number of variables. One of those is more evictions as we move through the court process or people who are just skipping out because they know they're getting to their court date. So, a little bit of a pickup there. Those are really the only two that had any kind of pickup in terms of reasons for move out. The others came down in terms of relocation, obviously came down as it relates to home and condo purchase as you might expect, things of that sort, all came down. Yes. That's usually anecdotal. We don't always have that data that we track it well. We track the ZIP code, so we have that kind of information. But in terms of what they're actually doing and the reasons behind it, it's kind of behavioral things and various things like that, that tend to be anecdotal as opposed to real data that you can count on. Yes. No. Good question, Adam. I think the right way to think about it is the comment that I made earlier in that when you look at new move-ins in the third quarter, for this year compared to last year, the household income associated with those move-ins is up around 11%. And if you look at the move-in value associated with those move-ins, it was up about 10%. So these, basically, people are kind of trading at a consistent level from -- if you think of it from a rent to income perspective. So, we have people moving in with that much higher income and our rents are up about that much. It sort of makes sense overall. Certainly, we have some people that are moving out, as I just mentioned, due to rent increase. Given the numbers we've been pushing through, that's not surprising. But we continue to source demand that is comfortable paying what we are expecting and their incomes appear to support it. Yes, good question. We certainly won't eat into everything, but I mean maybe a simple way to think about it is if you think about the lease expiration volume that we have typically in the fourth quarter, it's around 20% of our leases expire. Those folks will get renewal rent increases and that will impact the loss to lease. The third quarter is closer to 30% of our leases expire, 30%, 32%, and that is when seasonal -- the kind of seasonality of rents kick in. So typically, the most impactful quarter is as you're moving through the third quarter because of not only the heightened volume of lease expirations, but then you have rent seasonality kick in. The fourth quarter is typically much more moderate in terms of the impact on loss to lease as compared to the third quarter. Does that make sense? Sure. Why don't I give you a sense of maybe the top three or four categories just how to think about them a little bit. And so, for -- take property taxes, which obviously is the greatest percentage of our expense structure. This year, we're kind of putting in numbers here that are just under 2%. We don't expect a sort of 2% handle that we're experiencing in 2022 to be in place as we move into \u201823, \u201824. There certainly will be upward pressure due to rates and assessments as you have heard from others. Payroll, similar to 2022, should remain very constrained due to our innovation efforts, and you can see what that looks like on the expense attachment to the earnings release in terms of what \u201822 looks like, and then, maybe just a couple of others. Repairs and maintenance, certainly, there'll be some wage inflation from our contractors and a potential increase in turnover. And then utilities, there'll be some pressure on rates in the first half of \u201823, given the contract that we signed for procurement of utilities in the middle of \u201822. And there may be some pressure -- or will be some pressure from our bulk internet and smart access offering, but we also expect that profit to be substantial in terms of the growth next year, probably more than triple the level in \u201822 as we move into 2023. So, while there be some pressure on the OpEx side, there'll be a nice boost to NOI given the revenue contribution from that activity. So, those are kind of the top four in terms of maybe some color as to how to think about them. No, it's not. It's still positive. Yes. I mean, I don't know exactly what it's going to look like for the rest of the year. But certainly, that's a possibility to the extent that we see some weak environments there, for sure. Yes. Alex, it's Sean. Just to try to be clear, we expect it to be lower, independent of the historical norms. And the reason we had a belief is if you go back and look at the turnover that we experienced in Q1 and Q2 relative to last year as an example. The first quarter of this year, turnover was 35%. Last year, Q1 was 44%. Q2 this year was 46%. Last year, it was 50.8%. Q3 ended up being basically on top of last year. So, we had two quarters earlier this year, where we were pushing rents pretty aggressively that there was a pretty wide spread on a year-over-year basis. So we expect Q3 to continue that trend of being below what we experienced last year, even though we were continuing to push rents. And that was not the case. It was essentially on top of last year. So hopefully, that answers that question as it relates to turnover and our expectations. Yes. And one thing we should probably try to be clear about, Alex, is when we talked about weaker, weaker, it was just a little bit weaker than our expectations. The revenue miss was $0.01 on $600 million for the quarter. So, it's not a -- when you run the math, it's not a significant dollar amount here. And so, we're still seeing good growth in those markets. In the Mid-Atlantic, as an example, if you take a look at what we experienced in Q3 rent change, it was pushing 10%, California was 9%, Seattle was almost 12%. But things began to decelerate a little more quickly than we anticipated. So, I wouldn't -- I'd be careful about saying those are the weak markets like things are going south quickly type of approach as opposed to the rate of deceleration was just a little more than we anticipated in terms of rent change. But it's still -- in absolute terms, these are pretty healthy numbers, well above historical norms when you think about the long-term rent growth across our footprint. These numbers are pretty strong. So, that's the way I would think about it. But specific to the Mid-Atlantic, there's three major regions, the [Technical Difficulty] Northern Virginia and then the district. I'd say, the district maybe 1 or 2 pockets in Northern Virginia, probably have struggled the most, particularly D.C. where office utilization remains, I think, is the second lowest in the country at this point behind San Francisco, a lot of professional services jobs, government jobs. And so, the people haven't necessarily had the need to be in the office. We continue to see positive movement in that trend, but it's still not where it needs to be to really sort of push through and be in a position where we could see stronger results from the Mid-Atlantic overall, including D.C. So -- and if you look at just absolute job growth here of all of our regions, it's been the weakest this year. So, you have a combination of weaker job growth. And then for the jobs that you do have, not everybody has to be in the office, and we just need to see better trends in that data to see the market pick up even more. Yes."

            "name": "Ben Schall",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you everyone for joining us today, here with Kevin, Matt, Sean, and after our opening comments, we will open the lineup for questions. In many ways, Q3 continued our strong momentum from the first half of the year with significant year-over-year increases in our earnings and operating metrics. As referenced on slide 4 of our quarterly investor presentation, core FFO for the quarter increased 21% as compared to a year ago. Same-store revenue increased almost 12% from last year, and 2.2% sequentially compared to our strong Q2 figure. Before progressing further into the presentation, I wanted to emphasize a number of AvalonBay specific drivers of future earnings growth. First up and as Sean will describe more fully, we expect to head into 2023 with an earn-in above traditional levels. In short, just a simple roll through of our existing rent roll creates positive earnings momentum, which can then be further enhanced by our underlying loss-to-lease. There are then three other drivers of earnings growth, which we estimate should generate in the range of $200 million of incremental NOI over the next several years. The most significant of these drivers is the development projects we have underway, which we refer to as projects with yesterday's costs and today's rents. Our current lease-ups continue to outperform, currently yielding nearly 7%, and we expect our current development activity to deliver $130 million of incremental NOI upon stabilization, which Matt will cover further. The other two significant drivers are further margin improvement from our operating model initiatives, which we've targeted for $50 million of NOI uplift and expect to have delivered about 40% or $20 million of this NOI uplift to our bottom line by year-end and the return on our structured investment program as we build that book of business up to $300 million to $500 million. In a potentially recessionary environment, the $200 million of incremental earnings generated from these activities collectively serve as a ballast for our future earnings. Turning to slide 5. While our Q3 performance was strong, it was short of guidance. Q3 core FFO per share was $0.02 below guidance, and we reduced our full year core FFO per share figure by $0.07, updating our estimate of full year core FFO growth to 18.5%. For the full year, on the revenue side, while we contemplated the return of rent seasonality, the seasonal trend line has been slightly greater than historical norms. On the expense side, turnover has been slightly higher than we forecasted, leading to higher repairs and maintenance costs to turn apartments, and utility costs are projected to be higher. Slide 6 highlights how we've been actively adjusting our balance sheet and [Technical Difficulty] strategy during the year based on the changing capital markets environment. Based on the steps taken by Kevin and Joanne Lockridge and our Capital Markets team, our balance sheet is stronger than ever. Recently, we increased our line of credit by $500 million to $2.25 billion and extended the maturity date out to 2026. Additionally, we have an interest rate swap in place for our next $150 million of debt borrowings and our $500 million equity forward proactively addressed the bulk of development funding through the end of 2023. On the transaction front, we shifted our strategy earlier this year to a posture of selling assets first and locking in the cost of that capital before selectively deploying capital into acquisitions in our expansion markets, which given cap rate movements has worked to our benefit. As part of this shift, we also pivoted during the year from expecting to be a net buyer of approximately $275 million to being a net seller of $400 million or nearly $700 million total swing. In an environment where profit margins on new development are likely to come down and the costs associated with that incremental capital has increased, we've also reduced new development starts. For 2022, we reduced our starts from $1.15 billion to a projected $850 million. In 2023, while we haven't provided guidance regarding new starts, our expected start figure is trending lower than we previously anticipated as we use the flexibility we have with our development rights pipeline to manage our land contracts and the timing of potential starts. We will continue to make adjustments based on trends in rent and construction costs, the spread between potential development yields and underlying market cap rates with a continued target of 100 to 150 basis to spread and our cost of incremental capital with a laser focus on making the appropriate long-term value-creation decisions. And with that, I'll turn it to Sean to more fully discuss the operating environment and our approach. Thanks, Kevin. And quickly to summarize, we're pleased with our continued strong earnings and operating momentum with a number of AvalonBay specific earnings drivers in front of us. In this environment, we have and will continue to adjust our approaches to strengthen our position and to allow us to keep our focus on long-term value creation. We're confident that we are well positioned for a broad range of potential economic paths and to potentially step into opportunities based on dislocations in the marketplace. And I'll end by reiterating our thanks to the wider AvalonBay associate base for their commitments to our ESG leadership and their broader dedication to our mission of creating a better way to live. With that, I'll turn it to the operator to open the line for questions. Steve, this is Ben. I'd add -- that was well put by Matt. I'd add a couple of elements. This really gets into the underlying flexibility that we have in our development rights pipeline. So part of it is potential retrading land to today's values. The other part if maybe not the more significant part is with respect to timing, right? So it allows us to manage the timing of our pipeline, which potentially allows some of the normalization that you were getting at in your question about the trend lines on rents and construction costs. So, a good question, and one we've talked about from a strategic perspective. It is -- I'll make a couple of comments on it. One, as we've thought about the opportunities in our expansion markets and other reasons, we're headed to our expansion markets in addition to more and more of our type of customer and knowledge-based worker there, it allows us to take what we do well, including our development platform and have a wider playing field. So, that is part of the effort there. In terms of the percentage of where we are today towards where we'd like to get to, you're right, it has been in the sort of 4% to 5% range. And for a lot of last year, we were very actively looking to build up our development rights pipeline to take advantage of the opportunities. Now, in reality, right, when our cost of capital changes, right, we're going to change our return thresholds and we're going to change the level that we're pulling. So, longer term, right, we'd like to continue to grow our development book as a percentage of our business from where it is today, but we recognize in the near term that we're going to be more restrained given the broader economic environment. Jeff, the other area in terms of suburban versus urban and gets us to what we see as the general strength of our portfolio positioning is on the topic of supply, right? Two-thirds of our business is in the suburban coastal markets. Supply -- new supplies of [Technical Difficulty] stock has been in the range of 1.5%. And as we look out next year, that number is probably coming down even a little bit more. So, in a potentially softening environment or a recessionary environment, our belief is markets with lower supply are going to prove out to be more durable and more resilient. So, that's our 1.5% of stock. That's in our suburban markets. And supply is higher in our urban markets. The other third of our portfolio is obviously also higher in the Sunbelt markets, right? So, as we look out on overall portfolio positioning, we think we're in a relatively strong place from that perspective. John, the profits have come down. If you look back a year ago, we were running at development profits that were to tune of 50% because the spread between where we are developing to the underlying cap rates was out to 250 basis points. That's the type of arena. So, that has compressed. And what I would guide you to, as I mentioned before, is our focus on maintaining 100 to 150 basis points of spread between where we're developing and where underlying cap rates are. There can be and like would be certain deals that are slightly below that. But as a group, that's the approach. Sure. I would frame it just in the context of our overall initiatives of activating retail space at the bottom of our buildings. A couple of different components of that, one of which was we self-started our own small but self started own co-working program at a project out in California, which we call Second Space. The industrious relationship, which you referenced, is a pilot to further tap into their network of potential clients, as we think about our Second Space product. But it's an area where we're actively talking with multiple users, and we think it's somewhere we can help create some incremental value, particularly to our residents above by creating activated space at the ground floor. It's a -- I don't want to get too much into details that would give it the pilot nature, but it's a share -- it's more of a shared model as opposed to a traditional retail model. Thank you all for joining us today. I appreciate the dialogue and look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT soon."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Your host for today's conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Kyle, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC.  As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance.  And with that, I will turn the call over to Ben Schall, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Ben?\nBenjamin Schall: Thank you, Jason, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Kevin, Sean and I will share some prepared remarks, and Matt is with us as well for Q&A. I'll start by discussing our financial and operating performance as well as our latest approaches to capital allocation.  On operations, we had a very strong second quarter with core FFO of $2.43 per share, exceeding our prior guidance by $0.12 per share or more than 5% above expectations. This magnitude of outperformance is atypical, particularly since we increased Q2 guidance at the end of April and was driven by continued asking rent growth, above-average occupancy and favorable net bad debt.  As shown on Slide 4, core FFO increased roughly 23% during the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date core FFO growth up to 19%. And as Kevin will describe more fully, we're raising core FFO guidance for the year to $9.86 per share at the midpoint, an increase of $0.28 per share over our prior guidance. As we will highlight later during our remarks, there are a number of meaningful tailwinds that support our strong earnings guidance for the back half of the year and support continued growth going into next year, or if the macro environment were to erode in a way which impacts our operating fundamentals, that should serve as a ballast.  Switching over to capital allocation. Our balance sheet is as strong as it has ever been, providing strength in an uncertain macro environment and allowing us to maintain our focus on creating shareholder value over time and across cycles. We've also responded to the changing capital markets in certain ways. We issued a $500 million equity forward in April at $2.50 -- $250 a share, which we can draw down through the end of 2023 to fund our future growth.  As we communicated in Q1, we also shifted from being a net buyer to a net neutral trader of assets in 2022, as we continue to optimize the portfolio and rotate capital from our established regions into our expansion markets. We continue to selectively match dispositions with acquisitions at market cap rates, which we've seen widened by approximately 50 basis points in many markets.  Consistent with prior activity, our dispositions are generally of older assets with higher CapEx profiles in our established regions, which we're utilizing to fund acquisitions of newer assets in our expansion markets. And while we remain active on the development front, with $2.1 billion under construction and a $4.7 billion development rights pipeline, we have reduced our projected 2022 starts based on some project-specific delays. For new potential projects, we are focused on maintaining flexibility so that we can ramp up or down our overall 2023 development start volume, depending on how macro conditions evolve.  Before turning it to Sean, let me quickly provide some additional color on our Q2 revenue growth. Slide 5 provides a breakout of our 12.9% Q2 same-store revenue growth, with the vast majority coming from growth in lease rates as well as the reduced impact of concessions as compared to Q2 last year. Net bad debt also improved relative to last year with additional rent relief payments offsetting the change in underlying bad debt.  Turning to Slide 6. Net bad debt was a meaningful component of our outperformance relative to Q2 guidance, with rent relief payments via the federal government's emergency rental assistance programs continuing into May and June as compared to our prior expectations that these government funds would run dry earlier in Q2. And while net bad debt remains elevated, we are pleased to see improving resident payment behavior with underlying bad debt currently in the low 3% of revenue range, down from mid-4% in Q4 2021 and compared to 50 to 70 basis points historically.  And with that, I'll turn it to Sean to review the operating backdrop in more detail.\nSean Breslin: All right. Thanks, Ben. Turning to Slide 7. The strong revenue growth Ben noted was supported by very healthy trends in the business throughout the quarter. Turnover remained below historical norms, even though it ticked up in absolute terms in June, given normal seasonal patterns, but occupancy was above 96% each month of the quarter.  Additionally, like-term effective rent change trended up during the quarter and averaged roughly 14%, supported by healthy demand across all of our regions. Lastly, we started to see some improvement in noncollectible lease revenue, excluding rent relief, during the second quarter as residents who were chronically delinquent started moving out from communities, particularly in some of our more challenged markets like L.A. and New York. While we expect the number of delinquent accounts to continue to decline in the back half of 2022, the rate of improvement will likely be modest from month to month.  Moving to Slide 8. The outlook for the business remains quite positive. Asking rents continued to increase throughout the second quarter and are up more than 9% since the 1st of the year, supporting loss of lease of roughly 15% at quarter end. And with the continued trend of historically low availability and resident incomes growing in the double-digit percentage range, we're well positioned to capture higher rent levels as we move further into the second half of 2022 and look ahead to 2023.  Turning to Slide 9. Our lease-up portfolio continues to post very strong results. Leasing velocity exceeded 30 leases per month during the quarter at rents that were on average about $350 or 12% above initial projections. As a result, stabilized yields are projected to be in the mid-6% range on almost $700 million in business, producing significant value creation relative to underlying cap rates.  Now I'll turn it to Kevin to address our updated outlook for 2022 and the balance sheet. Kevin?\nKevin O'Shea: Thanks, Sean. On Slide 10, we provide a revised financial outlook for 2022. We now expect full year core FFO per share of 9 86 or a 19.4% increase over last year's earnings. If achieved, this would represent the company's strongest growth in full year earnings in over 2 decades. This also represents an increase of $0.28 relative to our expectations in April, reflecting continued strong revenue growth across our business.  Drilling down a bit further, this $0.28 increase represents $0.31 in higher same-store residential revenue, partially offset by a $0.03 decrease in other categories, as described on Page 5 of our earnings release. This $0.31 increase in same-store residential revenue is in turn driven primarily by higher-than-expected growth in lease rates and by lower-than-expected bad debt, with $0.09 of the increase having already been recognized in the second quarter and the remaining $0.22 divided roughly evenly over the third and fourth quarters.  As it relates to bad debt and rent relief, we expect underlying bad debt before the impact of rent relief to decline from 3.9% in the first half of the year to about 2.7% in the second half. We also expect rent relief to decline from the $28 million we recognized in the first half of the year to $7 million in the second half, nearly all of which is expected in the third quarter. As a result, we expect net bad debt will increase from 135 basis points in the first half of the year to 215 basis points in the second half for a full year rate of about 180 basis points.  Keep in mind that net bad debt for 2021 was 210 basis points, so the change in bad debt on a full year basis is projected to contribute roughly 30 basis points to revenue growth in 2022. Thus, for overall same-store portfolio, at the midpoint of our revised guidance, we now project same-store residential revenue year-over-year growth of 11.25%, same-store residential operating expense growth of 5% and same-store residential NOI growth of 14.25%. Finally, we expect to start about $850 million in new developments in 2022, down slightly from the $1.15 billion expected in their initial outlook as starts for a few planned developments have shifted into early 2023.  Turning to Slide 11. Nearly 90% of current development underway is already match funded with long-term debt and equity capital. Locking the cost of this investment capital helps ensure that these projects will provide earnings and NAV growth when they are completed and stabilized.  Turning to Slide 12. As we look ahead, our balance sheet remains exceptionally well positioned to provide financial strength and stability, while also giving us the flexibility to continue funding attractive growth opportunities across our investment platforms. In this regard, we enjoy low leverage with net debt-to-EBITDA of 4.9x, which is below our target range of 5x to 6x. Our interest coverage ratio in unencumbered NOI percentage are at record levels of 7x and 95%, respectively. And our debt maturities are well-laddered with a weighted average years to maturity of about 8.5 years.  And as shown on Slide 13, our liquidity position is excellent, with $1.3 billion in excess liquidity relative to our remaining unfunded commitments of about $400 million as of quarter end.  With that, I'll turn it back to Ben.\nBenjamin Schall: Thanks, Kevin. As we look forward, we wanted to emphasize a number of additional tailwinds, as described on Slide 14, that support continued value creation and our strong earnings outlook.  To start and focusing in on development, Slide 15 highlights the historical spread between our development yields and stabilized cap rates, a core measure of how we generate meaningful value for shareholders through our industry-leading development platform. With our strong balance sheet and match funding approach, we're able to ratchet down or ratchet up our start activity at particular points in time, but do so in a way that provides consistent incremental value creation and earnings growth.  On completion so far this year, projects at yesterday's cost and today's rents, we are realizing an exceptionally strong spread between stabilized yields and current cap rates of over 200 basis points, generating significant value creation and earnings growth. For projects in our development rights pipeline, we're seeing this spread range from 100 to 200 basis points based on our most current underwriting, which we believe continues to provide appropriate risk-adjusted returns.  In the near term, as shown on Slide 16, our developments underway are expected to provide meaningful incremental earnings with roughly $125 million of incremental NOI to come from these projects over the next 2 to 3 years.  Moving to Slide 17. And as we previously outlined, we are in the midst of transforming our operating platform with significant investments in innovation and technology that we expect to generate 200 basis points of margin improvement or $40 million to $50 million of NOI.  Slide 17 provides incremental disclosure on certain of these initiatives, including the projected progress year-by-year with $20 million of additional revenue associated with the rollout of bulk Internet, managed WiFi and smart home technology and an additional $20 million in expense savings to come from the digitization of a number of customer experiences, including self-touring, maintenance, renewals and others.  We also introduced our structured investment program last quarter, which is off to a solid start. As shown on Slide 18, we've closed our first 2 investments, providing preferred equity to third-party developers on new construction projects. By leveraging our intimate knowledge of development, construction and operations, we believe that we can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns on $300 million to $500 million of capital, a book of business we will build up over time and providing incremental earnings growth.  Before closing, I also want to highlight, as shown on Slide 19, our continued ESG leadership given the recent publication of our 11th Annual Corporate Responsibility Report. On the E, we are one of the first REITs to set numeric, science-based targets for emission reductions, and we're proud that we've achieved actual reductions through these initiatives, 30% reductions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and 20% reductions in Scope 3 emissions, so far. On the S, our investments in our people and culture, including advancing our inclusion and diversity initiatives, remain a priority, with progress being made and more to come. We also continue to invest in our local communities through volunteer time and direct donations, a key part of how AvalonBay associates connect around our evergreen culture, including our spirit of caring.  In closing, on Slide 20, with a summary of our key takeaways. We're very pleased with our operating results to date, have meaningfully lifted our earnings expectations for the year and believe that there are a number of tailwinds specific to AvalonBay that set the table for strong continued growth looking ahead.  And with that, I'll turn it to the operator to facilitate questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We take our first question from Nicholas Joseph with Citi.\nNicholas Joseph: Maybe starting on the transaction market, and I'm looking on Slide 15 here. Obviously, there's the pretty widespread between the development initial yields and the transaction market looks -- and I recognize these are annual numbers, but cap rates come down in 2022. So just curious what you've seen over the last 3 or 6 months in terms of movement in cap rates and asset values across your markets.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Nick, it's Matt. Yes, certainly, in the last couple of months, there's been a shift in the transaction market with the rise in rates. And so we are pretty active in the market, and so we've had some good -- it's changing quickly. So the first thing I'd say is nobody can be real sure, but the data that we -- points that we've gotten recently would suggest, as Ben had mentioned in his prepared remarks, cap rates are probably up, call it, 50 basis points, maybe a little more in some regions, a little less than others and depending on the asset type.  There are definitely deals which are just not transacting where they may have seen a more significant move, particularly if they were targeted more to highly levered buyers. But most of the assets that would be in our portfolio are more kind of institutional-grade type assets. It's probably been more in that range. NOIs continue to grow. So in terms of overall asset values, maybe down 5% to 10% because you're getting some lift in the numerator that offsets some of the increase in the denominator.\nNicholas Joseph: That's helpful. And then just as you start to execute on some of these structured investment program deals, how did the first few deals come about? What sort of competition are you seeing? Just kind of any color on at least the entrance into this market.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. Nick, it's Matt. I guess I can speak to that one as well. So the first 2 deals we have, one is actually in the East Bay in the San Francisco area and the other one is in Denver. And then we have a others working their way through the pipeline actually on the East Coast. So we're seeing a nice geographic mix. I mean it's typically local merchant, builder, developer sponsors. And we do think the deal flow, there is a lot of leverage there given our deep presence in our markets. So some of these are sites that we knew from kind of looking at them as land. Some of them, they certainly -- there's good deal flow from the brokerage community and folks we're talking to about asset acquisitions or asset dispositions.  The other thing we're seeing is pretty strong relationship alignment with first lenders. All these deals have obviously first construction lenders. And they really take heart in the fact that we're in there with them and such an experienced capital provider further up in the capital stack than they are, given our expertise in development and construction and operations. So we're looking to get repeat business from a pool of lenders. And I think the deal flow is probably increasing as capital gets a little harder to find. So we like our position going forward that we should be even more competitive.\nOperator: We take our next question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc capital Markets.\nAustin Wurschmidt: So I was wondering if you guys could provide where you expect your '23 earn-in to shape up at this point. And I'm just curious, given that we're starting at presumably a historically high earn-in entering year, you still got the sizable loss to lease in place today. I guess I'm trying to understand, if conditions do soften materially from here, I mean, what's the probability that you'd actually see revenue growth turn negative if, again, if things soften materially, and I recognize all recessions are different, but just using kind of historical data maybe as a little bit of -- to give some idea of what that downside risk could be.\nSean Breslin: Yes. Austin, this is Sean. I'll take that one. As it relates to the earn-in, there's still obviously a lot of leasing to do, a lot of transactions to execute between now and year-end. The guidance I give you is that coming into 2022, the earn-in that we had in place at the beginning of the year was about 2.5%. And so as you look forward to 2023, given the leases that we've executed thus far this year, what you could sort of expect based on the guidance we provided for the second half of the year that the earn-in going into 2023 would be well above where we started 2022.  So keep in mind that, obviously, it's one variable in the whole puzzle. There are some other factors that could be headwinds and/or tailwinds, including, obviously, the normalization of bad debt in terms of underlying collection rates should be a bit of a tailwind. The loss of rent relief from this year will be a bit of a headwind. So you've got to kind of keep all those things in mind as it relates to how the embedded growth kind of translates to total revenue growth when we get to next year.  And then in terms of your other question about kind of our loss to leases and what might have to happen, yes, I think you make a fair point that even if the macro environment continues to sour, there's still a lot of room between where rents are today and where rents would need to go to, particularly given how our leases expire throughout the year to end up in a position where you'd have negative revenue growth. It really would have to be -- I think I would probably characterize it as a pretty severe economic shock to really see that happen that quickly in terms of the whipsaw with a lot of cushion kind of between us and any kind of negative revenue growth. So that's how I'd describe that.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. That's helpful. And then just secondly, you guys had talked about a NAREIT 2023 starts in the $1.3 billion to $1.8 billion range sort of depending on the environment. Obviously, some deals got pushed into next year. So is that upside to the $1.3 billion, $1.8 billion? So could you provide an update there? And then just also curious how you're thinking about the additional debt capacity that you have today given leverage is below the low end of your range?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Sure, Austin. I'll speak to the -- this is Matt. I can speak to the development volume, and then maybe Kevin wants to talk to the debt part of the question. Yes, I mean, so our development starts this year are going to be less than what we had thought going into the year. And that's really just based on some deal-specific factors. So all else equal, that activity would roll into '23. And so -- and obviously, our development rights pipeline picked up this quarter to $4.7 billion, which is I think as large as it's ever been.  So what I would say is if the deals continue, and the economics on those deals continue to look attractive, we certainly could start anywhere from $1 billion to $2 billion next year depending on how those deals come together when we get final costs in. We're really focused on preserving flexibility based on if we do see changes there, but we certainly have that possibility. And of course, we have the equity forward. So we have a fair amount of that capital already raised, so to speak. But Kevin, do you want to speak to that?\nKevin O'Shea: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Austin, I mean I think your point is a good one. We -- I mean the first point I'd make is we enter the environment we're in and we're expecting to enter 2023 from a position of terrific strength from a balance sheet point of view. Leverage, as you pointed out, is below our target range of 5 to 6x. In a normal market environment, the combination of free cash flow, which is typically around $300 million a year and is around now and selling assets for retaining capital, which is usually between $400 million and $700 million.  And then on normal levels of EBITDA growth, leveraged EBITDA growth kind of adds another $300 million to $400 million, $500 million on top of that. So you end up with kind of having around $1.25 billion or more, give or take, in leverage-neutral funding capacity for investment, primarily development, in a typical year. And with tremendous amount of NOI and EBITDA growth that we're experiencing right now, you can -- you're correct to point out that we would have even more capacity beyond that, call it, $1.25 billion of leverage-neutral funding capacity in 2023 just by flexing up in terms of debt issuance.  Obviously, current rates today don't look attractive relative to where they were a year or so ago. Currently, if we were to do a 10-year debt, it would be in the low 4% range, given where the treasuries are right now. That is sort of reasonably attractive if you look back over the last 10 years. But most of the -- but if you look back over the, as you say, over the last 20 years, if you look back over the last 10 years, it's 4.25% unsecured debt cost for us would be relatively high. But it is reasonably attractive compared to development and development uses.  So I think as we look into 2023 and put together a capital plan, we've got lots of choices between free cash flow, ability to sell assets, the equity forward that Matt just pointed out and our ability to leverage up. But I think how much debt we take on will, at that time, be a little bit of a function of how attractive debt costs are relative to both development yields as well as what our sense is to the cost and other choices in terms of the other capital markets.\nBenjamin Schall: Austin, this is Ben. I'll add a couple of comments that speaks both to your question, Sean, on operating fundamentals and then also how we're looking forward next year in terms of development starts. And what I'd emphasize around our strength is also our portfolio positioning and particularly our orientation to the suburbs, right? With 2/3 of our portfolio in the suburban markets, we believe that's going to provide a level of durability that may not be seen in other markets. Demand drivers, our expectation is going to continue to be relatively strong there.  And then supply relative to national averages is definitely low. It's projected to be in the range of 1.5% of stock. So on the operating side, we think that provides us with some additional resiliency and durability going into next year. And then from a development perspective, as you've seen from us over the -- really over the last couple of years, the bulk of our new development activity will continue to be in the suburban markets.\nOperator: We move to the next question from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Sakwa: Sean, I was wondering if you could just provide a little color on where you're sending out renewal notices for, I guess, what you got in July and maybe August, September, and kind of what your thoughts are for the balance of the year?\nSean Breslin: Sure, Steve, happy to address that. I mean July, we were basically in the low double-digit range in terms of where the offers went out. And that remains relatively constant as we look forward over the next 60 to 90 days kind of in that low double-digit range. And keep in mind that as it relates to renewals, we are slightly more constrained than normal given some of the COVID overlay regulations that remain in place in markets like California, as an example. So there's more to come on renewals, but it's probably going to be in the next year before we're able to get all of it is the way I'd probably describe that to you, Steve.\nStephen Sakwa: Okay. And maybe just circling back to, I guess, to Page 15. We've gotten a couple of questions on the development. I'm just curious, as you sort of look at the major input costs, whether it's lumber in certain areas or steel and concrete, I just -- what are you seeing on the inflation front there? And I realize that you guys -- I guess the current development through the beneficiaries of higher rents with costs from 1 year or 2 ago, but the environment today to start in '23 is a little different. So how much have yields come in on kind of the future pipeline and I guess how are you thinking about costs moving into next year?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Sure, Steve. This is Matt. As it relates to cost inflation, it's still out there. It's still significant. It feels like we're at the top and then it may be starting to downshift. For sure, obviously, lumber prices are down. For sales starts, seem like they're coming off pretty quickly now. So I guess I'd say I'm guardedly optimistic that buyout will start to become a little more favorable. I don't think that means hard costs are necessarily going to drop. But the days of 1% per month increase is maybe behind us, maybe not in all markets, but definitely in some markets.  As it relates to how that affects the economics of our development book, our development rights pipeline today on today's rents and today's hard cost is running into kind of a typical mid-5% yield. And if you look at the developments that we're starting this year, that's probably around where they are as well, the 3 or 4 we've started so far and the 2 or 3 we expect to start in the second half year.  Compared to 2 years ago, that was probably high 5s. So it is probably down 30, 40 basis points, but that still provides a pretty strong spread. And I do think that those cap rates are probably representative of where they are today. Frankly, the development that we completed late last year, the cap rates were probably sub-4%, but we're always a little conservative in how we quote these things. So I'd say 4% cap's probably a good representation for our best guess as to where those deals would trade today if they were stabilized in the market.\nBenjamin Schall: And Steve, from a sensitivity standpoint, we emphasized this last quarter, but just to reiterate it again, as you think about hard cost increases, rent increases and NOI increases, roughly, if you're keeping pace with 10% construction cost increases and hard costs being 60% of our overall project cost, you need approximately 6% NOI uplift. And so if you get both of those in those levels, you're able to maintain yields at that 5.5% type of range that Matt referenced.\nOperator: We take our next question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: Could you guys talk about what you're seeing in your sort of more tech-oriented markets, if there have been any signs of the broader malaise that we are seeing everywhere reflect in the business? Any early reads around that?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Chandni, this is Sean. At this point, the answer is no. We're kind of reading in the media the same things you are in terms of particularly some of the start-ups trying to lean things out, some of the larger companies slowing the pace of hiring. But based on the demand that we're experiencing coming in the front door, it is not impacting the renter population in terms of their desire for the types of apartments that we offer.\nChandni Luthra: Understood. And my follow-up question, in the event of a recession, how would you view the relative positioning of development versus acquisitions if we go into a tougher economic backdrop?\nBenjamin Schall: Chandni, I'll start. This is Ben. Our acquisition activity, at least to date, and this is the expectation going forward, it could adjust if the market got further dislocated. But it's an approach really based on trading of assets, right, and the movement from selling of assets in our established regions and then reallocating that capital into our established regions. And it ties very much into the portfolio optimization initiatives that we've been focused on as well as our diversification initiatives. So that's the primary element.  On the development side, as we think about capital allocation there, at a high level, it's really a triangulation where we're thinking about what's the opportunity set, right? Matt talked about sort of the spreads that we need to maintain. So how do we think about a sufficient spread that is there and probably in the -- at the bottom end in that 100 to 150 basis point type of range to appropriately provide the return on that risk.  And then we're thinking about the -- what's -- the other component of it is how do you think about the relative attractiveness of that development and the other relative sources there. So we're triangulating those 2 dynamics along with our source of capital. And that will really continue to -- that's been our approach, and that will continue to be our approach as we think about our capital allocation choices going forward.\nChandni Luthra: Are there any lessons to take from the last financial crisis as we think about the relative positioning of those 2 areas of capital allocation?\nKevin O'Shea: In terms of acquisitions versus development?\nChandni Luthra: Yes.\nKevin O'Shea: Well, I mean I think probably the lessons we probably have taken is, first of all, always have a prepared balance sheet so you're positioned to be able to respond to the opportunities that emerge in the market. So in a normal operating environment, we typically enjoy developing, and that's our highest and best source of shareholder value creation. But obviously, in a dislocated market environment, you can see acquisition opportunities emerge in certain circumstances. As you saw us engage in, in 2020, there are opportunities that are pretty attractive from a standpoint of buying back our stock.  So that's part of the reason why you'll see, Chandni, we're operating at below our target level of leverage and with quite a bit of excess liquidity available to us. Because we need -- when there's more of a greater dispersion in macroeconomic environments that can unfold in front of you, you want to be prepared to be able to respond positively to the large majority of them. And so we're in a position to hunker down if we need to. But more likely, we're in a position to really act and use our capital strength in order to invest in whatever the opportunities that may emerge over the next year or so.\nSean Breslin: Chandni, one thing just to add to that. Keep in mind on the development book. And this is not just a reflection of our experience following the GFC, but prior downturns. As it relates to development, those typically are some very good times for us as it relates to new land deals, either renegotiating deals that we have, sourcing new land. And importantly, if there is a reset in construction costs, as Matt pointed out, that is a very good time to buy out jobs. You only buy it at once, you only build it once, you release it every year, so that tends to be a very good time for us to source opportunities and get them started. And then when they would mature and deliver, they tend to be very, very nice yields on that book of business. So that is one thing that is relevant to the development side of the equation.\nOperator: We take our next question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBradley Heffern: On the delayed starts, is there anything in common with those? Is there something that's specific to each of them individually? And I guess what's the likelihood that we'll see further delays next quarter from projects that are further out, et cetera?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Brad, it's Matt. No, I wouldn't say -- I mean the thing that's in common is just what we're seeing across our -- everywhere, really, which is just jurisdictions backed up. Honestly, even the design professionals backed up a little bit in terms of getting final permit drawings in and so on. So I think that's a general trend we're seeing across the space. And it probably is likely to continue. I think that we have started to factor that in as we think about kind of start activity and as we think about predevelopment schedules that things are taking a little longer to get through. So the deals that are teed up for the second half of the year starts, those are all tracking solidly, and I don't see anything at this point that would create any further delays in those.\nOperator: We take our next question from Alan Peterson with Green Street.\nAlan Peterson: Sean, can you remind us the magnitude of the year-over-year reduction in on-site headcount that's helping keep overall payroll costs only growing at 1% year-to-date? Are you guys anticipating any additional reductions over the next year?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Alan, Sean. So the numbers that I quoted is on -- and we parse it between office and maintenance. But on the office side of the house, in the second quarter, the headcount was down about 6%. On the maintenance side, it's about 4%. And then yes, as you look forward, Ben touched on it in his prepared remarks in terms of the benefit that we expect for the various initiatives that we have ongoing and the digital initiatives, in particular, that bucket of activity that you referenced will result in additional efficiencies at the site level, both on the office and the maintenance side, over the next couple of years.\nAlan Peterson: Perfect. And just one more on development philosophy question. Ben, you touched on the low end of the range for development economics to continue to pencil being roughly 100 to 150 basis points. Is there a scenario where that spread is tighter than 100 basis points where you would still start a new construction project?\nBenjamin Schall: It is possible. Yes, I mean, that's a general range so it is very dependent on our view on specific markets. It would be coming -- our approach would come from a position of are we creating the appropriate long-term value creation relative to the risk, right? So when you start to get down around that range, you're going to be asking yourself those tougher questions and make sure that you have a higher level of conviction around the value proposition.\nOperator: We take our next question from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: Kind of want to ask maybe a bit of a bigger picture question about kind of rent growth. If you think historically, right, kind of pre-COVID and long term, I think kind of 3% -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think kind of 3% rent growth typically per year is kind of a decent proxy to use. And obviously, we're in this high inflationary environment, and even with the year-over-year numbers, which kind of should cool off here, we're still kind of going to be on an elevated level on inflation basis kind of relative to historical. So kind of wondering what you guys think will kind of be a good kind of rent growth proxy to use? Is 3% still the right number? Or should that be higher? And kind of where do you think that might land when we kind of think about longer-term rent growth?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Adam, this is Sean. I'm happy to start, and anybody else can chime in. But I think the number that you're quoting, it is really a function of just underlying inflation in the economy. Over a long period of time, though, if you look at it, rents in our markets with our customer segments have grown faster than inflation. I think the number I recommend -- or recall is around 70 to 100 basis points or so, plus or minus above kind of headline inflation. Again, over a long, 40 years kind of time frame, there are times where those spreads compress and there are times when they widen. So I think it really is a function of how you want to think about the underlying inflation rate and therefore, what you might expect in terms of rental rate growth on a nominal basis across our markets, again, serving our segment. So that's, I think, how you need to think about it as opposed to in absolute number terms.\nAdam Kramer: That's really helpful. I appreciate the color there. Maybe just a quick follow-up on just kind of a guide in what it assumes for maybe second half blended lease growth or second half new lease rate growth. But then also kind of where you think -- and I know it's somewhat tough to predict that far out, but where do you kind of think new lease rate growth or blended growth may kind of end the year at, right? So you kind of have the number that the second half is based on, but maybe a lower number, different number where we may end the year. Just kind of thinking about kind of growth next year, right, and kind of back to those earlier earn-in questions.\nSean Breslin: Yes. Adam, good question. Essentially, what's built into our reforecast for the second half of the year is some deceleration in like term effective rent change primarily as a result of the comps from the second half of 2021. I think as I referenced earlier, if you look at what happened in 2021, we still had negative rent change through the second quarter. And then it quickly flipped to almost up 8% in the third quarter, so the comps get tougher. As you look into the second half, so our expectation is that you'll see a deceleration on average of roughly 150 basis points from the first half, effective rent change to the second half. That's sort of at a high level how I think about where it's going to trend as we move through the balance of the second half of the year.\nOperator: The next question is from Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRichard Anderson: Just following up on that last question. What about the like term sort of cadence for the second half is optics? Meaning, this year, you have this tough comp scenario that we don't normally have. In absolute dollars, are rents in November meaningfully lower than rents are today? Or are they -- is the pace of market rent growth just decelerating, but your actual rents are still above where they are today in your forecast?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Rich, good question. So to date, I've mentioned we've seen a nice run up in asking rents more than 9% since the beginning of the year. So the question you're really asking is maybe around seasonality in terms of what's likely to happen. We do expect some seasonality in the back half of the year. We haven't seen it yet. But in terms of the second half reforecast, what we have assumed is that the normal seasonal decline in that we should see in the absolute level of rents would be about half in 2022 as compared to sort of pre-COVID periods.  So if you remember last year, we didn't really see that, rents rose and then they sort of just flatlined the last 4 or 5 months of the year. For this year, we've assumed that they actually will decline, just at a more modest pace than pre-COVID periods would typically dictate. That's an assumption. We'll see if that's the case, but that's the assumption we have made so far for this year.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. And second question, back to the tech kind of headlines. What's better for you in terms of the multifamily business, tech hiring during the pandemic with no commitment to being anywhere near the office? So that's, I guess, a nice feeling, but I don't know how it affects multifamily since they can live in Nebraska if they wanted to. Or tech layoffs or at least hiring slowdowns, but now giving some leverage to employers to say, okay, well, if you want to essentially keep your job, you got to come back to the office at least some portion of the week. Is the latter a better scenario for you? Or is just the pure hiring -- accelerating hiring a better scenario for the market overall?\nSean Breslin: Yes. That's a multivariable question, Rich. And given we don't typically go through a pandemic, that's -- I'm not sure I can give you 100% certainty on that. Certainly, we have been through tech layoff cycles following the tech rec and such in the past, which were painful, as you know. In terms of...\nRichard Anderson: I'm sorry, Sean, I guess the question is layoffs sort of moves employer negotiating leverage back to the employer, and so more people in the office and then more people having to be near the office and so more people using multifamily is the essence of the question.\nSean Breslin: Yes. No, I agree with you on that. So I think -- sorry, I was going to head to it. Obviously, even if there is -- just as the employment base declines by some modest amount, whatever the number is, to the extent all of that employment is still concentrated within our markets where there are urban submarkets or our suburban job-centered markets, that is highly relevant to the demand for our portfolio. And just to give you an example, we have seen some meaningful reversion to any out migration. And if you look at our move-ins even in the second quarter for the same-store bucket, historically, in the second quarter, move-ins from greater than 150 miles away is around 10% to 11% of the move-in activity. It was almost 30% in the second quarter. So it's up 250% from normal levels.  And certainly, job-centered suburban, which is very favorable for us, and urban, which is less favorable as it's only 1/3 of the portfolio, but still relevant, we're seeing that trend come back as opposed to during the pandemic where it was -- there's a lot of out migration to various other markets. So that's a trend that has been in place for a couple of quarters and certainly accelerated very meaningfully in the second quarter. And hopefully, that trend will continue in the third quarter as employers do start pulling more people back into the office in those markets to benefit us.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We take our next question from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I saw on Slide 8 you had details about the level of your loss to lease and how it was growing from April, May and then into June. Curious, is that the normal dynamic that you see at that time of year? I'm just kind of thinking about -- just trying to think about like how extraordinary that 15% is these days?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Josh, this is Sean. In absolute terms, 15% is, to use your word, extraordinary, way above average. To the first question around, does it normally trend up during the second quarter? The answer is yes, just not normally at that kind of pace. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nJoshua Dennerlein: So even the pace of the growth is a lot higher than you would normally see as like a normal seasonality?\nSean Breslin: That is correct. And what I'd point you to, as I mentioned, rents being up more than 9% since the beginning of the year. Normally, that slope when you look at it from January to, call it, mid-July type range is weaker than that in an average year. It still trends up, just you wouldn't see that same change.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. And sorry, just one follow-up. Is that just because -- is the growth in the loss to lease really a function of just how fast rents have moved? Or is it also because there was like restrictions earlier in the year on being able to push some rate?\nSean Breslin: It's really the combination of the 2. So we're able to push rents hard. And on renewals, we can't capture all of it. So for people that are -- if they cap at a 10% rent increase and rents are up more than that, that spread will accrue to loss to lease, of course.\nOperator: The next question comes from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler.\nConnor Mitchell: I have two questions. First, just thinking about the general acquisition market. Has the pullback of levered buyers also extended to merchant developers? And has this given you guys some additional opportunity for acquisitions?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Conor, it's Matt. I would say, typically, the merchant builders, the buyer of those assets since their brand-new class assets is usually not a highly levered buyer. So there's probably been less of a pullback there than there has been in the value-add space, but there has been some pullback there. And particularly, there are some folks that want to sell early before maybe the lease-up is fully complete. So I think it does create an opportunity for us. And we do feel like that we are better positioned as a buyer going forward, there's less competition. And where for a seller, it's less about getting the absolute highest price as it is about certainty of execution in this environment, and that's something we offer. So I do think that it's going to lead to a more favorable buying opportunities for us.\nConnor Mitchell: Okay. Great. And then my second question is you guys have talked about capital allocation of acquisitions and development a couple of times. I was also just wondering how you guys think about your structured investment program. And if you might ramp that up, if you're hitting it on developments or if you wanted to speed up developments once again, if you would kind of carry the same level of the investments within the structured development program?\nBenjamin Schall: Connor, this is Ben. To a certain degree, we think about that as a separate business. It's $300 million to $500 million of finite capital, and we'll build that book of business up over the next couple of years. We may pull a little bit harder, a little bit less based on the environment. But I would expect a pretty consistent approach there to the fill out of that business.\nOperator: It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Ben Schall for any additional or closing comments.\nBenjamin Schall: Thank you, and thank you again for joining us today. We appreciate your support and engagement, and have a wonderful rest of the summer.\nOperator: And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matthew Birenbaum",
            "content": "Nick, it's Matt. Yes, certainly, in the last couple of months, there's been a shift in the transaction market with the rise in rates. And so we are pretty active in the market, and so we've had some good -- it's changing quickly. So the first thing I'd say is nobody can be real sure, but the data that we -- points that we've gotten recently would suggest, as Ben had mentioned in his prepared remarks, cap rates are probably up, call it, 50 basis points, maybe a little more in some regions, a little less than others and depending on the asset type.  There are definitely deals which are just not transacting where they may have seen a more significant move, particularly if they were targeted more to highly levered buyers. But most of the assets that would be in our portfolio are more kind of institutional-grade type assets. It's probably been more in that range. NOIs continue to grow. So in terms of overall asset values, maybe down 5% to 10% because you're getting some lift in the numerator that offsets some of the increase in the denominator. Yes. Nick, it's Matt. I guess I can speak to that one as well. So the first 2 deals we have, one is actually in the East Bay in the San Francisco area and the other one is in Denver. And then we have a others working their way through the pipeline actually on the East Coast. So we're seeing a nice geographic mix. I mean it's typically local merchant, builder, developer sponsors. And we do think the deal flow, there is a lot of leverage there given our deep presence in our markets. So some of these are sites that we knew from kind of looking at them as land. Some of them, they certainly -- there's good deal flow from the brokerage community and folks we're talking to about asset acquisitions or asset dispositions.  The other thing we're seeing is pretty strong relationship alignment with first lenders. All these deals have obviously first construction lenders. And they really take heart in the fact that we're in there with them and such an experienced capital provider further up in the capital stack than they are, given our expertise in development and construction and operations. So we're looking to get repeat business from a pool of lenders. And I think the deal flow is probably increasing as capital gets a little harder to find. So we like our position going forward that we should be even more competitive. Sure, Austin. I'll speak to the -- this is Matt. I can speak to the development volume, and then maybe Kevin wants to talk to the debt part of the question. Yes, I mean, so our development starts this year are going to be less than what we had thought going into the year. And that's really just based on some deal-specific factors. So all else equal, that activity would roll into '23. And so -- and obviously, our development rights pipeline picked up this quarter to $4.7 billion, which is I think as large as it's ever been.  So what I would say is if the deals continue, and the economics on those deals continue to look attractive, we certainly could start anywhere from $1 billion to $2 billion next year depending on how those deals come together when we get final costs in. We're really focused on preserving flexibility based on if we do see changes there, but we certainly have that possibility. And of course, we have the equity forward. So we have a fair amount of that capital already raised, so to speak. But Kevin, do you want to speak to that? Sure, Steve. This is Matt. As it relates to cost inflation, it's still out there. It's still significant. It feels like we're at the top and then it may be starting to downshift. For sure, obviously, lumber prices are down. For sales starts, seem like they're coming off pretty quickly now. So I guess I'd say I'm guardedly optimistic that buyout will start to become a little more favorable. I don't think that means hard costs are necessarily going to drop. But the days of 1% per month increase is maybe behind us, maybe not in all markets, but definitely in some markets.  As it relates to how that affects the economics of our development book, our development rights pipeline today on today's rents and today's hard cost is running into kind of a typical mid-5% yield. And if you look at the developments that we're starting this year, that's probably around where they are as well, the 3 or 4 we've started so far and the 2 or 3 we expect to start in the second half year.  Compared to 2 years ago, that was probably high 5s. So it is probably down 30, 40 basis points, but that still provides a pretty strong spread. And I do think that those cap rates are probably representative of where they are today. Frankly, the development that we completed late last year, the cap rates were probably sub-4%, but we're always a little conservative in how we quote these things. So I'd say 4% cap's probably a good representation for our best guess as to where those deals would trade today if they were stabilized in the market. Brad, it's Matt. No, I wouldn't say -- I mean the thing that's in common is just what we're seeing across our -- everywhere, really, which is just jurisdictions backed up. Honestly, even the design professionals backed up a little bit in terms of getting final permit drawings in and so on. So I think that's a general trend we're seeing across the space. And it probably is likely to continue. I think that we have started to factor that in as we think about kind of start activity and as we think about predevelopment schedules that things are taking a little longer to get through.

            "name": "Kevin O'Shea",
            "content": "Thanks, Sean. On Slide 10, we provide a revised financial outlook for 2022. We now expect full year core FFO per share of 9 86 or a 19.4% increase over last year's earnings. If achieved, this would represent the company's strongest growth in full year earnings in over 2 decades. This also represents an increase of $0.28 relative to our expectations in April, reflecting continued strong revenue growth across our business.  Drilling down a bit further, this $0.28 increase represents $0.31 in higher same-store residential revenue, partially offset by a $0.03 decrease in other categories, as described on Page 5 of our earnings release. This $0.31 increase in same-store residential revenue is in turn driven primarily by higher-than-expected growth in lease rates and by lower-than-expected bad debt, with $0.09 of the increase having already been recognized in the second quarter and the remaining $0.22 divided roughly evenly over the third and fourth quarters.  As it relates to bad debt and rent relief, we expect underlying bad debt before the impact of rent relief to decline from 3.9% in the first half of the year to about 2.7% in the second half. We also expect rent relief to decline from the $28 million we recognized in the first half of the year to $7 million in the second half, nearly all of which is expected in the third quarter. As a result, we expect net bad debt will increase from 135 basis points in the first half of the year to 215 basis points in the second half for a full year rate of about 180 basis points.  Keep in mind that net bad debt for 2021 was 210 basis points, so the change in bad debt on a full year basis is projected to contribute roughly 30 basis points to revenue growth in 2022. Thus, for overall same-store portfolio, at the midpoint of our revised guidance, we now project same-store residential revenue year-over-year growth of 11.25%, same-store residential operating expense growth of 5% and same-store residential NOI growth of 14.25%. Finally, we expect to start about $850 million in new developments in 2022, down slightly from the $1.15 billion expected in their initial outlook as starts for a few planned developments have shifted into early 2023.  Turning to Slide 11. Nearly 90% of current development underway is already match funded with long-term debt and equity capital. Locking the cost of this investment capital helps ensure that these projects will provide earnings and NAV growth when they are completed and stabilized.  Turning to Slide 12. As we look ahead, our balance sheet remains exceptionally well positioned to provide financial strength and stability, while also giving us the flexibility to continue funding attractive growth opportunities across our investment platforms. In this regard, we enjoy low leverage with net debt-to-EBITDA of 4.9x, which is below our target range of 5x to 6x. Our interest coverage ratio in unencumbered NOI percentage are at record levels of 7x and 95%, respectively. And our debt maturities are well-laddered with a weighted average years to maturity of about 8.5 years.  And as shown on Slide 13, our liquidity position is excellent, with $1.3 billion in excess liquidity relative to our remaining unfunded commitments of about $400 million as of quarter end.  With that, I'll turn it back to Ben. Sure. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Austin, I mean I think your point is a good one. We -- I mean the first point I'd make is we enter the environment we're in and we're expecting to enter 2023 from a position of terrific strength from a balance sheet point of view. Leverage, as you pointed out, is below our target range of 5 to 6x. In a normal market environment, the combination of free cash flow, which is typically around $300 million a year and is around now and selling assets for retaining capital, which is usually between $400 million and $700 million.  And then on normal levels of EBITDA growth, leveraged EBITDA growth kind of adds another $300 million to $400 million, $500 million on top of that. So you end up with kind of having around $1.25 billion or more, give or take, in leverage-neutral funding capacity for investment, primarily development, in a typical year. And with tremendous amount of NOI and EBITDA growth that we're experiencing right now, you can -- you're correct to point out that we would have even more capacity beyond that, call it, $1.25 billion of leverage-neutral funding capacity in 2023 just by flexing up in terms of debt issuance.  Obviously, current rates today don't look attractive relative to where they were a year or so ago. Currently, if we were to do a 10-year debt, it would be in the low 4% range, given where the treasuries are right now. That is sort of reasonably attractive if you look back over the last 10 years. But most of the -- but if you look back over the, as you say, over the last 20 years, if you look back over the last 10 years, it's 4.25% unsecured debt cost for us would be relatively high. But it is reasonably attractive compared to development and development uses.  So I think as we look into 2023 and put together a capital plan, we've got lots of choices between free cash flow, ability to sell assets, the equity forward that Matt just pointed out and our ability to leverage up. But I think how much debt we take on will, at that time, be a little bit of a function of how attractive debt costs are relative to both development yields as well as what our sense is to the cost and other choices in terms of the other capital markets. In terms of acquisitions versus development? Well, I mean I think probably the lessons we probably have taken is, first of all, always have a prepared balance sheet so you're positioned to be able to respond to the opportunities that emerge in the market. So in a normal operating environment, we typically enjoy developing, and that's our highest and best source of shareholder value creation. But obviously, in a dislocated market environment, you can see acquisition opportunities emerge in certain circumstances. As you saw us engage in, in 2020, there are opportunities that are pretty attractive from a standpoint of buying back our stock.  So that's part of the reason why you'll see, Chandni, we're operating at below our target level of leverage and with quite a bit of excess liquidity available to us. Because we need -- when there's more of a greater dispersion in macroeconomic environments that can unfold in front of you, you want to be prepared to be able to respond positively to the large majority of them. And so we're in a position to hunker down if we need to. But more likely, we're in a position to really act and use our capital strength in order to invest in whatever the opportunities that may emerge over the next year or so."

I'll start by discussing our financial and operating performance as well as our latest approaches to capital allocation.  On operations, we had a very strong second quarter with core FFO of $2.43 per share, exceeding our prior guidance by $0.12 per share or more than 5% above expectations. This magnitude of outperformance is atypical, particularly since we increased Q2 guidance at the end of April and was driven by continued asking rent growth, above-average occupancy and favorable net bad debt.  As shown on Slide 4, core FFO increased roughly 23% during the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date core FFO growth up to 19%. And as Kevin will describe more fully, we're raising core FFO guidance for the year to $9.86 per share at the midpoint, an increase of $0.28 per share over our prior guidance. As we will highlight later during our remarks, there are a number of meaningful tailwinds that support our strong earnings guidance for the back half of the year and support continued growth going into next year, or if the macro environment were to erode in a way which impacts our operating fundamentals, that should serve as a ballast.  Switching over to capital allocation. Our balance sheet is as strong as it has ever been, providing strength in an uncertain macro environment and allowing us to maintain our focus on creating shareholder value over time and across cycles. We've also responded to the changing capital markets in certain ways. We issued a $500 million equity forward in April at $2.50 -- $250 a share, which we can draw down through the end of 2023 to fund our future growth.  As we communicated in Q1, we also shifted from being a net buyer to a net neutral trader of assets in 2022, as we continue to optimize the portfolio and rotate capital from our established regions into our expansion markets. We continue to selectively match dispositions with acquisitions at market cap rates, which we've seen widened by approximately 50 basis points in many markets.  Consistent with prior activity, our dispositions are generally of older assets with higher CapEx profiles in our established regions, which we're utilizing to fund acquisitions of newer assets in our expansion markets. And while we remain active on the development front, with $2.1 billion under construction and a $4.7 billion development rights pipeline, we have reduced our projected 2022 starts based on some project-specific delays. For new potential projects, we are focused on maintaining flexibility so that we can ramp up or down our overall 2023 development start volume, depending on how macro conditions evolve.  Before turning it to Sean, let me quickly provide some additional color on our Q2 revenue growth. Slide 5 provides a breakout of our 12.9% Q2 same-store revenue growth, with the vast majority coming from growth in lease rates as well as the reduced impact of concessions as compared to Q2 last year. Net bad debt also improved relative to last year with additional rent relief payments offsetting the change in underlying bad debt.  Turning to Slide 6. Net bad debt was a meaningful component of our outperformance relative to Q2 guidance, with rent relief payments via the federal government's emergency rental assistance programs continuing into May and June as compared to our prior expectations that these government funds would run dry earlier in Q2. And while net bad debt remains elevated, we are pleased to see improving resident payment behavior with underlying bad debt currently in the low 3% of revenue range, down from mid-4% in Q4 2021 and compared to 50 to 70 basis points historically.  And with that, I'll turn it to Sean to review the operating backdrop in more detail. Thanks, Kevin. As we look forward, we wanted to emphasize a number of additional tailwinds, as described on Slide 14, that support continued value creation and our strong earnings outlook.  To start and focusing in on development, Slide 15 highlights the historical spread between our development yields and stabilized cap rates, a core measure of how we generate meaningful value for shareholders through our industry-leading development platform. With our strong balance sheet and match funding approach, we're able to ratchet down or ratchet up our start activity at particular points in time, but do so in a way that provides consistent incremental value creation and earnings growth.  On completion so far this year, projects at yesterday's cost and today's rents, we are realizing an exceptionally strong spread between stabilized yields and current cap rates of over 200 basis points, generating significant value creation and earnings growth. For projects in our development rights pipeline, we're seeing this spread range from 100 to 200 basis points based on our most current underwriting, which we believe continues to provide appropriate risk-adjusted returns.  In the near term, as shown on Slide 16, our developments underway are expected to provide meaningful incremental earnings with roughly $125 million of incremental NOI to come from these projects over the next 2 to 3 years.  Moving to Slide 17. And as we previously outlined, we are in the midst of transforming our operating platform with significant investments in innovation and technology that we expect to generate 200 basis points of margin improvement or $40 million to $50 million of NOI.  Slide 17 provides incremental disclosure on certain of these initiatives, including the projected progress year-by-year with $20 million of additional revenue associated with the rollout of bulk Internet, managed WiFi and smart home technology and an additional $20 million in expense savings to come from the digitization of a number of customer experiences, including self-touring, maintenance, renewals and others.  We also introduced our structured investment program last quarter, which is off to a solid start. As shown on Slide 18, we've closed our first 2 investments, providing preferred equity to third-party developers on new construction projects. By leveraging our intimate knowledge of development, construction and operations, we believe that we can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns on $300 million to $500 million of capital, a book of business we will build up over time and providing incremental earnings growth.  Before closing, I also want to highlight, as shown on Slide 19, our continued ESG leadership given the recent publication of our 11th Annual Corporate Responsibility Report. On the E, we are one of the first REITs to set numeric, science-based targets for emission reductions, and we're proud that we've achieved actual reductions through these initiatives, 30% reductions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and 20% reductions in Scope 3 emissions, so far. On the S, our investments in our people and culture, including advancing our inclusion and diversity initiatives, remain a priority, with progress being made and more to come. We also continue to invest in our local communities through volunteer time and direct donations, a key part of how AvalonBay associates connect around our evergreen culture, including our spirit of caring.  In closing, on Slide 20, with a summary of our key takeaways. We're very pleased with our operating results to date, have meaningfully lifted our earnings expectations for the year and believe that there are a number of tailwinds specific to AvalonBay that set the table for strong continued growth looking ahead.  And with that, I'll turn it to the operator to facilitate questions. Austin, this is Ben. I'll add a couple of comments that speaks both to your question, Sean, on operating fundamentals and then also how we're looking forward next year in terms of development starts. And what I'd emphasize around our strength is also our portfolio positioning and particularly our orientation to the suburbs, right? With 2/3 of our portfolio in the suburban markets, we believe that's going to provide a level of durability that may not be seen in other markets. Demand drivers, our expectation is going to continue to be relatively strong there.  And then supply relative to national averages is definitely low. It's projected to be in the range of 1.5% of stock. So on the operating side, we think that provides us with some additional resiliency and durability going into next year. And then from a development perspective, as you've seen from us over the -- really over the last couple of years, the bulk of our new development activity will continue to be in the suburban markets. And Steve, from a sensitivity standpoint, we emphasized this last quarter, but just to reiterate it again, as you think about hard cost increases, rent increases and NOI increases, roughly, if you're keeping pace with 10% construction cost increases and hard costs being 60% of our overall project cost, you need approximately 6% NOI uplift. And so if you get both of those in those levels, you're able to maintain yields at that 5.5% type of range that Matt referenced. Chandni, I'll start. This is Ben. Our acquisition activity, at least to date, and this is the expectation going forward, it could adjust if the market got further dislocated. But it's an approach really based on trading of assets, right, and the movement from selling of assets in our established regions and then reallocating that capital into our established regions. And it ties very much into the portfolio optimization initiatives that we've been focused on as well as our diversification initiatives. So that's the primary element.  On the development side, as we think about capital allocation there, at a high level, it's really a triangulation where we're thinking about what's the opportunity set, right? Matt talked about sort of the spreads that we need to maintain. So how do we think about a sufficient spread that is there and probably in the -- at the bottom end in that 100 to 150 basis point type of range to appropriately provide the return on that risk.  And then we're thinking about the -- what's -- the other component of it is how do you think about the relative attractiveness of that development and the other relative sources there. So we're triangulating those 2 dynamics along with our source of capital. And that will really continue to -- that's been our approach, and that will continue to be our approach as we think about our capital allocation choices going forward. It is possible. Yes, I mean, that's a general range so it is very dependent on our view on specific markets. It would be coming -- our approach would come from a position of are we creating the appropriate long-term value creation relative to the risk, right? So when you start to get down around that range, you're going to be asking yourself those tougher questions and make sure that you have a higher level of conviction around the value proposition. Connor, this is Ben. To a certain degree, we think about that as a separate business. It's $300 million to $500 million of finite capital, and we'll build that book of business up over the next couple of years. We may pull a little bit harder, a little bit less based on the environment. But I would expect a pretty consistent approach there to the fill out of that business. Thank you, and thank you again for joining us today. We appreciate your support and engagement, and have a wonderful rest of the summer."

            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Ben. Turning to Slide 7. The strong revenue growth Ben noted was supported by very healthy trends in the business throughout the quarter. Turnover remained below historical norms, even though it ticked up in absolute terms in June, given normal seasonal patterns, but occupancy was above 96% each month of the quarter.  Additionally, like-term effective rent change trended up during the quarter and averaged roughly 14%, supported by healthy demand across all of our regions. Lastly, we started to see some improvement in noncollectible lease revenue, excluding rent relief, during the second quarter as residents who were chronically delinquent started moving out from communities, particularly in some of our more challenged markets like L.A. and New York. While we expect the number of delinquent accounts to continue to decline in the back half of 2022, the rate of improvement will likely be modest from month to month.  Moving to Slide 8. The outlook for the business remains quite positive. Asking rents continued to increase throughout the second quarter and are up more than 9% since the 1st of the year, supporting loss of lease of roughly 15% at quarter end. And with the continued trend of historically low availability and resident incomes growing in the double-digit percentage range, we're well positioned to capture higher rent levels as we move further into the second half of 2022 and look ahead to 2023.  Turning to Slide 9. Our lease-up portfolio continues to post very strong results. Leasing velocity exceeded 30 leases per month during the quarter at rents that were on average about $350 or 12% above initial projections. As a result, stabilized yields are projected to be in the mid-6% range on almost $700 million in business, producing significant value creation relative to underlying cap rates.  Now I'll turn it to Kevin to address our updated outlook for 2022 and the balance sheet. Kevin? Yes. Austin, this is Sean. I'll take that one. As it relates to the earn-in, there's still obviously a lot of leasing to do, a lot of transactions to execute between now and year-end. The guidance I give you is that coming into 2022, the earn-in that we had in place at the beginning of the year was about 2.5%. And so as you look forward to 2023, given the leases that we've executed thus far this year, what you could sort of expect based on the guidance we provided for the second half of the year that the earn-in going into 2023 would be well above where we started 2022.  So keep in mind that, obviously, it's one variable in the whole puzzle. There are some other factors that could be headwinds and/or tailwinds, including, obviously, the normalization of bad debt in terms of underlying collection rates should be a bit of a tailwind. The loss of rent relief from this year will be a bit of a headwind. So you've got to kind of keep all those things in mind as it relates to how the embedded growth kind of translates to total revenue growth when we get to next year.  And then in terms of your other question about kind of our loss to leases and what might have to happen, yes, I think you make a fair point that even if the macro environment continues to sour, there's still a lot of room between where rents are today and where rents would need to go to, particularly given how our leases expire throughout the year to end up in a position where you'd have negative revenue growth. It really would have to be -- I think I would probably characterize it as a pretty severe economic shock to really see that happen that quickly in terms of the whipsaw with a lot of cushion kind of between us and any kind of negative revenue growth. So that's how I'd describe that. Sure, Steve, happy to address that. I mean July, we were basically in the low double-digit range in terms of where the offers went out. And that remains relatively constant as we look forward over the next 60 to 90 days kind of in that low double-digit range. And keep in mind that as it relates to renewals, we are slightly more constrained than normal given some of the COVID overlay regulations that remain in place in markets like California, as an example. So there's more to come on renewals, but it's probably going to be in the next year before we're able to get all of it is the way I'd probably describe that to you, Steve. Yes. Chandni, this is Sean. At this point, the answer is no. We're kind of reading in the media the same things you are in terms of particularly some of the start-ups trying to lean things out, some of the larger companies slowing the pace of hiring. But based on the demand that we're experiencing coming in the front door, it is not impacting the renter population in terms of their desire for the types of apartments that we offer. Chandni, one thing just to add to that. Keep in mind on the development book. And this is not just a reflection of our experience following the GFC, but prior downturns. As it relates to development, those typically are some very good times for us as it relates to new land deals, either renegotiating deals that we have, sourcing new land. And importantly, if there is a reset in construction costs, as Matt pointed out, that is a very good time to buy out jobs. You only buy it at once, you only build it once, you release it every year, so that tends to be a very good time for us to source opportunities and get them started. And then when they would mature and deliver, they tend to be very, very nice yields on that book of business. So that is one thing that is relevant to the development side of the equation. Yes. Alan, Sean. So the numbers that I quoted is on -- and we parse it between office and maintenance. But on the office side of the house, in the second quarter, the headcount was down about 6%. On the maintenance side, it's about 4%. And then yes, as you look forward, Ben touched on it in his prepared remarks in terms of the benefit that we expect for the various initiatives that we have ongoing and the digital initiatives, in particular, that bucket of activity that you referenced will result in additional efficiencies at the site level, both on the office and the maintenance side, over the next couple of years. Yes. Adam, this is Sean. I'm happy to start, and anybody else can chime in. But I think the number that you're quoting, it is really a function of just underlying inflation in the economy. Over a long period of time, though, if you look at it, rents in our markets with our customer segments have grown faster than inflation. I think the number I recommend -- or recall is around 70 to 100 basis points or so, plus or minus above kind of headline inflation. Again, over a long, 40 years kind of time frame, there are times where those spreads compress and there are times when they widen. So I think it really is a function of how you want to think about the underlying inflation rate and therefore, what you might expect in terms of rental rate growth on a nominal basis across our markets, again, serving our segment. So that's, I think, how you need to think about it as opposed to in absolute number terms. Yes. Adam, good question. Essentially, what's built into our reforecast for the second half of the year is some deceleration in like term effective rent change primarily as a result of the comps from the second half of 2021. I think as I referenced earlier, if you look at what happened in 2021, we still had negative rent change through the second quarter. And then it quickly flipped to almost up 8% in the third quarter, so the comps get tougher. As you look into the second half, so our expectation is that you'll see a deceleration on average of roughly 150 basis points from the first half, effective rent change to the second half. That's sort of at a high level how I think about where it's going to trend as we move through the balance of the second half of the year. Yes. Rich, good question. So to date, I've mentioned we've seen a nice run up in asking rents more than 9% since the beginning of the year. So the question you're really asking is maybe around seasonality in terms of what's likely to happen. We do expect some seasonality in the back half of the year. We haven't seen it yet. But in terms of the second half reforecast, what we have assumed is that the normal seasonal decline in that we should see in the absolute level of rents would be about half in 2022 as compared to sort of pre-COVID periods.  So if you remember last year, we didn't really see that, rents rose and then they sort of just flatlined the last 4 or 5 months of the year. For this year, we've assumed that they actually will decline, just at a more modest pace than pre-COVID periods would typically dictate. That's an assumption. We'll see if that's the case, but that's the assumption we have made so far for this year. Yes. That's a multivariable question, Rich. And given we don't typically go through a pandemic, that's -- I'm not sure I can give you 100% certainty on that. Certainly, we have been through tech layoff cycles following the tech rec and such in the past, which were painful, as you know. In terms of... Yes. No, I agree with you on that. So I think -- sorry, I was going to head to it. Obviously, even if there is -- just as the employment base declines by some modest amount, whatever the number is, to the extent all of that employment is still concentrated within our markets where there are urban submarkets or our suburban job-centered markets, that is highly relevant to the demand for our portfolio. And just to give you an example, we have seen some meaningful reversion to any out migration. And if you look at our move-ins even in the second quarter for the same-store bucket, historically, in the second quarter, move-ins from greater than 150 miles away is around 10% to 11% of the move-in activity. It was almost 30% in the second quarter. So it's up 250% from normal levels.  And certainly, job-centered suburban, which is very favorable for us, and urban, which is less favorable as it's only 1/3 of the portfolio, but still relevant, we're seeing that trend come back as opposed to during the pandemic where it was -- there's a lot of out migration to various other markets. So that's a trend that has been in place for a couple of quarters and certainly accelerated very meaningfully in the second quarter. And hopefully, that trend will continue in the third quarter as employers do start pulling more people back into the office in those markets to benefit us. Yes. Josh, this is Sean. In absolute terms, 15% is, to use your word, extraordinary, way above average. To the first question around, does it normally trend up during the second quarter? The answer is yes, just not normally at that kind of pace. So hopefully, that's helpful. That is correct. And what I'd point you to, as I mentioned, rents being up more than 9% since the beginning of the year. Normally, that slope when you look at it from January to, call it, mid-July type range is weaker than that in an average year. It still trends up, just you wouldn't see that same change. It's really the combination of the 2. So we're able to push rents hard. And on renewals, we can't capture all of it. So for people that are -- if they cap at a 10% rent increase and rents are up more than that, that spread will accrue to loss to lease, of course."

As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is been recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the remarks by the Company, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your host for today\u2019s conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Jay. And welcome to AvalonBay Communities first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that Forward-Looking Statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon\u2019s press release as well as in the Company\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today\u2019s discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ben Schall, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Ben.\nBenjamin Schall: Thanks, Jason. And thanks all for joining us on today\u2019s call. Matt and I will open with some prepared remarks and we are joined by Kevin and Sean for Q&A. Starting on Slide 4 of our presentation. Q1 was a very strong start to what we continue to expect to be a very strong year of operating results. Core FFO per share came in at $2.26, a 15.9% year-over-year increase and $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance. I will dive deeper into the drivers of that outperformance in a moment. On the capital allocation front, our industry leading development platform continues to drive meaningful earnings growth and value creation with a very robust 6.9% yield on developments completed this quarter. For the year, we are projecting about 700 million of completions at an average yield of 6.3%, which represents a substantial spread to current market cap rates. As we grow, we are also optimizing the portfolio through the selective sale of older, slower growth assets from our established regions. This quarter with 270 million of dispositions at a high 3% cap rate with the intention to then redeploy this capital primarily into acquisitions in our expansion markets. And in April, we executed on an equity board for $495 million as an expected source of capital to opportunistically draw down through the end of 2023, and locking in our cost of capital for future development activity at what we expect to be a creative spread. Turning to Slide 5. GAAP residential revenue increased 8.5% on a year-over-year basis led by about a 6% increase in effective lease rates and a 100 basis point improvement in net bad debt. On a cash basis, residential revenue increased almost 10%. As shown on Slide 6, the 8.5% GAAP revenue growth was 150 basis point greater than the 7% increase we assumed in Q1 guidance with lease rates and occupancy above our prior guidance and while still at elevated levels, better than expected bad debt and rent relief collections driving the bulk of the outperformance relative to our expectations. Portfolio performance has been supported by a number of tailwinds as detailed on Slide 7. Starting with Chart 1, we continue to see elevated move-ins from greater than 150 miles away, which speaks to a continued flow of residents back to our established markets and as particularly positive indicator for our urban and job centered suburban communities. In Chart 2, we also continue to see de-densification with less roommates and a desire for more space, leading to fewer adults per apartment, and as a driver of incremental demand across our portfolio. As rents continue to grow, they are supported by greater household income from new residents, which was up 12% in Q1 relative to the prior year period as shown on Chart 3. And finally on Chart 4, rent versus own economics, the monthly cost of renting versus the cost of owning a home materially favors renting in our markets with a difference of almost a $1000 per month, historically high level, and one which provides a meaningful cushion and support to our rent growth. As shown on Slide 8, this backdrop is translating into continued momentum like term effective rent change, which accelerated throughout Q1 and continued into April at 13.7%. Looking forward, our portfolio is positioned extremely well heading into the peak leasing season. As shown on Slide 9, occupancy remains strong and steady at about 96.5%. Annualized turnover means very low relative to historic figures and 30-day availability effectively the near-term inventory that is available for lease remains limited at less than 5% of our units. And while we continue to capture meaningful loss to lease as existing resident leases expire, our portfolio wide loss to lease remains high currently at 14%, which has been supported by a 4% increase in asking rates since the beginning of the year. Turning to Slide 10. We are making meaningful progress in the transformation of our operating platform, as we drive toward our goal of improving margins by 200 basis points or an additional 40 million to 50 million of NOI with approximately 10 million generated to-date. This slide highlights three of our many initiatives, including bulk internet and managed wifi, which is projected to ultimately deliver over 25 million of incremental annual NOI, smart home technology, which unlocks both operating efficiencies and revenue opportunities going forward. And third, our digital mobile maintenance platform, which will not only enhance our residents experience with us, but also deliver material value the enhanced operational efficiency. Before turning it to Matt, Slide 11 provides our updated full-year guidance with projected 16% core FFO growth, reflecting our strong momentum in Q1 and incorporating our increased outlook for same-store revenue and NOI growth. We have also updated our guidance to take into account a couple of factors. On the operating side, while core operating performance is quite strong, there continues to be some uncertainty about net bad debt in certain markets, particularly in Southern California and Alameda County and Northern California. And in some other markets, while eviction moratoria have expired, the core processes are moving slowly. As a result, some of the growth we are expecting in the back half of 2022 may get pushed in 2023, which we have assumed in our updated guidance. As it relates to our projected core FFO growth for the year, we have scaled back our assumption for acquisition activity for 2022, based on where we stand through today. As we keep a close eye on cap rates, fund flows and assess any shifts in the transaction markets. While we remain active, including another acquisition we recently put under contract, we update our guidance from being a net buyer in 2022 to an assumption of balancing acquisition volume with disposition volume before taking into account proceeds from Columbus circle. And with that, I will turn it over to Matt to go further into our development and capital allocation activities.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Great, thanks Ben. Turning to Slide 12. Our development activity continues to generate outstanding results. The five consolidated communities currently in lease up, which are widely dispersed across five different regions have rents which are currently $230 or 9% above proforma, which in turn is contributing to yield there are 40 basis points ahead of our initial expectations at 6.1%. With an estimated value on completion in excess of $1 billion and a cost basis of $690 million. This provides roughly $360 million in value creation for an exceptional profit margin of 52%. While hard costs are certainly trending up, there is plenty of room from March to compress from these elevated levels and still provide strong risk adjusted returns going forward. As we mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, our teams have also been very active in sourcing new development opportunities as shown on Slide 13. At the end of the first quarter, our development rights pipeline had grown to $4 billion up from $3.3 billion at the start of the year with new sites added in our expansion regions of Denver and Austin, as well as established regions in New England and Northern California. All of these new development rights are in suburban locations and with the total pipeline weighted 75% suburban and 25% urban, our stabilized portfolio will likely trend towards that mix over time as well. The chart in the lower right hand corner of this slide provides an illustration of how inflationary pressures on both NOIs and hard costs would typically flow through to development yield. This is an increasingly important issue in the current environment. Our development rights pipeline is underwritten to a current average yield or cost of roughly 5.5%. The chart shows how a change of plus or minus 10% to both hard costs and NOIs would impact that yield of holding all else constant, because hard costs represent 60% of total capital on news development with variances depending on the specific site. You can see that rising NOIs have roughly twice as much of an impact on yield as rising hard costs of a similar magnitude. As a reminder, we underwrite all of our development on current basis and typically do not trend either NOIs or costs. Even in the current environment with hard cost inflation running at a level, this gives us a measure of safety. This math suggests even if hard costs rise by 10% from current levels, the 5.5% yield can still be preserved with just a 6% increase in NOI Slide 14 provides a quick update on our progress in our expansion markets of Denver and Southeast Florida. We have been measured in our approach to building diversified portfolios in these regions, investing through a combination of acquisitions, funding local third-party developers and developing our own communities directly as we do in our established regions. This has allowed us to put together portfolios that we believe will be optimized for future revenue growth as well as initial investment return with strong locations in both urban and suburban submarkets in both regions. Critically, we are also focused on getting the products we want that will be well positioned to take advantage of demographic trends like the aging of the millennials and the increase in work from home as reflected in the larger-than-typical average unit size and young average asset age shown on the chart. We expect to follow a similar trajectory as we ramp up our investment activity in our newest expansion regions of North Carolina and Texas and make steady progress towards our goal of a 25% allocation to these expansion regions. Turning to Slide 17. We also launched a new investment vehicle in the first quarter, which we are calling our Structured Investment Program, or SIP. This is a mezzanine lending platform that provides short-term construction financing to local third-party developers in our established regions plus Denver and Florida with our position in the capital stack between the primary construction loan and the sponsor equity. The SIP provides another way for us to leverage our deep expertise in development, construction and operations to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders, and we expect to build this program to a $300 million to $500 million total investment level over the next few years. And with that, I will turn it back to Ben for some closing remarks.\nBenjamin Schall: Thanks, Matt. To wrap up and summarize key themes, Q1 was a strong start to the year with several tailwinds continuing to support our operating fundamentals, which are some of the strongest we have experienced and have us well positioned going into the peak leasing season. We continue to invest in our operating platform with the teams executing across a number of transformative initiatives over 2022, including both Wi-Fi, smart access and mobile maintenance. As you heard, we continue to lean into our development platform with lease-ups outperforming and generating meaningful earnings growth and value creation. We are also building our development rights pipeline now up to $4 billion, providing options on future value creation including significant investment in our established regions at accretive returns as well as a continued focus on optimizing the portfolio by growing in our expansion markets. And finally, we continue to look to tap our Company\u2019s strengths with our structured investment program being our latest offering by tapping into our development, construction and financial know-how to grow earnings and create value. With that, I will turn it to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will begin with Nicholas Joseph with Citi.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you very much. As you look at entering the structured investment program, how quickly do you expect to scale up to that $300 million to $500 million and how are you thinking about ladder in the deals and redemption timing?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Hey Nick, this is Matt. I guess I can take that one. I think it will take us a couple of years. It really will be dependent on the volume. The transaction market starts volume and kind of how our origination goes, but I would expect it is probably going to be two to three years before we get it up to that level. Then once you get to that level, these are typically three to five year investments. So each year, there is some redemptions, and hopefully, you are putting out some new money. So it is a ramp to get it there and then probably that is worth to keep it there.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks and then as you look to enter it, what were you thinking in terms of just the competition within this market and then are you going to have an option to buy or own throughout all of the deals?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. Thanks for that. So the second question, no, we do not expect to have an option to buy the deals, and we are trying to be very clear with the market and the sponsors that we are working with. For us, this is not a program that is about ultimately owning that real estate. It is a program that is about leveraging our expertise and our local market presence in these markets to generate good risk-adjusted returns during the duration of the investment. So we really are viewing it as a onetime investment. What was the first part of the question?\nNicholas Joseph: Competition.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Competition, sorry. Yes. There is competition. There is competition from some of our REIT peers as we are aware. Although I would say, I think that the market conditions are probably shifting in a way that is going to make this program more attractive going forward, as development capital maybe gets a little more challenging, as first loan proceeds start to get constrained. So we are pretty bullish. And the other thing is we have key relationships in all of these markets. And we have been in them for many years. And so we view it as really another way. We can work with a lot of folks that we have worked with in other capacities in the past, and it is kind of another sleeve of capital to it.\nBenjamin Schall: And Nick, if you think about us in our established markets, self-performing and being our own GC, right, we have come with a ton of daily on-the-ground knowledge that we think we can leverage here and do so in a competitive way as we think about risk-adjusted returns.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you.\nOperator: Now we will move to a question from Rich Hill with Morgan Stanley.\nRichard Hill: Hey good afternoon guys. I wanted to maybe circle back to the acquisition taking down guidance by about $0.05 from acquisition, but also square that to the recent equity raise. Just trying to understand, it seems like, if I\u2019m thinking about this correctly, using the equity raise to potentially fund development in the future but maybe taking a little bit of a pause on the acquisition market given the uncertainty with cap rates, is that sort of the right way to think about that? And if so, does it mean you are really taking a medium to long-term approach rather than trying to maximize returns over the near-term. And I say that in a complementary way, not in a negative way.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yes. Sure, Rich. This is Kevin. Maybe just with the first part of I think you are right with respect to all that, maybe to break it apart into two pieces. You are correct. Obviously, we did the equity forward $500 million of spend. Mentioned, our intention, at least at this point, is that while we can pull that down in one or more settlements from here through the end of 2023, our expectation is at this point that we are going to use that equity capital to draw down over the course of 2023 to fund development in 2023. So that is our current intention. So it is basically capital that we have earmarked at this point to fund future starts into 2023. As to kind of the first part of what you are referencing in terms of the change in the reforecast in acquisitions, you are correct. We increased overall expectations for core FFO for full-year by $0.03 to $9.58 at the midpoint. And as you can see on page four earnings release, there are a number of pluses and minuses that result net $0.03 change. And among the more notable changes are obviously an expectation for $0.11 increase in earnings from higher same-store NOI primarily driven from higher rental rates and to a lesser extent, from higher occupancy and rental repayments. And then second, as you pointed out, Rich, a $0.05 decrease in earnings from capital markets and transaction activity, which, in turn, when you kind of net the pluses and minuses in that category is driven by a decrease in forecasted acquisition activity based at least on where we stand today at this early point in the year. Of course, what we may do when acquisitions can change pretty quickly. That is a dynamic part of our budget and what we may be doing on the investment front. So Matt can certainly speak to that but at the moment, we pulled that down a little bit, which creates a little bit of a $0.05 decrease. And the other notable item is just a $0.03 decrease in earnings related to the flow through the compensation items. So that is sort of the other reconciliation of the reforecast for 2022, and the equity forward, to be clear, is not being pulled down in that model for 2022 because that is not our current expectations.\nBenjamin Schall: Rich, it is Ben. Just a couple more tidbits there. So on the acquisition side, as Kevin hit on, it is a reflection of where we stand today. We did narrow the box some earlier this year. We wanted to assess the market and obviously some macro dynamics happening there. And the assumption we pulled it down to is similar to what we had last year, which is sort of a balance between acquisitions and dispositions and we continue to think about it really as sort of trade capital and so capital that we can be looking to monetize out of our established regions and then redeploying that capital into our expansion markets.\nRichard Hill: And that is a good segue into my next question. At the risk of overstepping here, why wouldn\u2019t you accelerate dispositions? You have done a really good job of taking maybe older properties with higher CapEx spend, selling those at tight cap rates and rolling it into expansion markets. Why wouldn\u2019t you accelerate dispositions right now and maybe take that money and use it as, call it, dry powder?\nBenjamin Schall: Yes, I will start and then Matt can chime in. We were very active last year, had a lot of activity at the end of last year and are continuing to push there for some of the reasons that you hit on. Again, the bulk of our portfolio, we have got a lot of conviction around. It is performing well. So our movement as we think about optimizing the portfolio is a longer-term approach. So we are thinking about assets at a point in time, how do we think about value today versus value six months from today and why there could be some movement in cap rates, let\u2019s say. There is also very strong operating fundamentals that are going to help support asset values as we look forward.\nMatthew Birenbaum: I guess one thing I would just add to that, Rich, is it is also about the relative value between what we are buying and what we are selling. And I will say that changes - and we may be starting to see a little bit of a change in where values might be in the regions we are looking to buy in, and some of the regions we are looking to sell and maybe haven\u2019t been quite as in favor and that shift may be changing. So I actually think, looking forward that relative value proposition on the trade may look a little better than it is say in the first quarter of this year when we were being more cautious.\nRichard Hill: Thanks guys. That is it for me.\nOperator: We will now move to Stephen Sakwa with Evercore ISI.\nStephen Sakwa: Thanks, good afternoon. I was wondering, first, if we could just start on kind of the renewals that you are sending out for, I guess, either May, June, July and how those stacked up the first quarter in April.\nSean Breslin: Yes Steve it is Sean. In terms of committed renewal offers that have gone out, we are basically in the low teens, which is a little bit better than we originally expected when we contemplated the budget, probably maybe 150 bps or so higher than what we originally expected. So that is what is out now.\nStephen Sakwa: Okay. And Sean, are the take rates -- is there any change in kind of the attitude or acceptance from kind of consumer or once they shop the market realize it is kind of no better anywhere else, they kind of come back and sign?\nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean I think as what was reflected on the slide that Ben presented, as it relates to turnover, the acceptance rates on renewals as well as lease breaks, which typically account for about third of move-outs, both of those were down pretty materially. I mean, turnover is down, call it, 20% year-over-year, but it is down 15% to 16% compared to kind of pre-COVID norms when you look at Q4 and then again in Q1 of this year. So pricing power is strong for us. I think when people get a renewal offer and they go shop it, use your [indiscernible], they see that we are selling value. And there is transition costs. So if I\u2019m going to go out and it is going to pay roughly the same and then I have got moving costs or switching costs people are inclined just to stay where they are.\nStephen Sakwa: Right. That makes sense. Kevin, maybe one for you and if I missed it in here, I apologize. What is the assumption for bad debt or uncollectibles for the full-year today and kind of what was it? And just trying to compare that to 2021.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: So Steve, I will jump in here and Sean may want to add here a little bit. So in terms of overall bad debt on a percent of revenue basis, there is not a whole lot of change. Of course, there is two categories that feed into that number. But just to kind of give you a sense that for the full-year in our budget, we assume that uncollectible revenue overall would be about 270 basis points of the headwind - 270 basis points of revenue. And at this point, it is 264 basis points. So on a net basis, marginally better. But as you probably saw reflected, there is a bit of movement as we have seen in the first part of the year so far in some of those underlying pieces. And so underlying bad debt trends, delinquencies, if you will and a couple of our jurisdictions have trended worse such that overall, for the full-year, we expect that category to be a little bit worse over the course of the year. At the same time, we saw more rent relief payments in Q1, and we now expect to receive more rent payments overall for the full-year. And so kind of when you net that out over the full-year, overall, our reforecast for overall bad debt, taking into account rent relief and underlying bad debt trends, is roughly net neutral relative to our initial outlook with higher expected rent relief payments expected primarily in the front half of the year to be nearly offset by higher underlying bad debt projected primarily in the back of the year. Sean, do you want to add anything?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Steve, the only thing I would add just on your question for 2021 is the uncollectible revenue that we reported for 2021 was $2.1 million as compared to the current reforecast, as Kevin alluded to, is $2.64 million for 2022.\nStephen Sakwa: Got it. Okay. So it is a little bit of a headwind year-over-year. But you are saying within the 9% revenue growth, you have got about a 270 basis point, in effect, bad debt sort of headwind in the growth this year.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Correct. And the way I would probably think about it, Steve, is relative to our original budget, some markets are getting a little bit better. But given the delay in the eviction moratorium expiration, particularly throughout Los Angeles and elevated County in Northern California, we adjusted our outlook to reflect continuation of bad debt trends in those markets through 2022 and not seeing significant improvement until we get into 2023 and that is really what you kind of put through it. From a geography standpoint, that is where we expect a little more of a headwind than we maybe originally anticipated but as Kevin noted, a little more than offset by greater rent relation.\nStephen Sakwa: Great. And just one last question for Matt. Just on kind of the construction supply chain, just how is that sort of unfolding as you are looking to start new projects? Was that a lot more challenging today? Is it getting better? Just where are the bottlenecks? And what is that, maybe due to the risk of starts or how do you sort of manage that? And what should we expect? .\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes, Steve, I guess I would say construction inflation is definitely running hot. So costs are on the rise. This is where us being our general contractor really does help because we are able to go back to build on the relationships we have had over many years with a lot of our subcontractors and negotiate early agreements and sign build agreements. So we are doing what we can to stay in front of it. The supply chain issues and the actual availability issues. Those have probably got a little bit better over the last four or five months. So I haven\u2019t heard as much about that. I would say the bigger challenges have been just getting final permits through jurisdictions, in some cases, getting certificates of occupancy, final inspections from jurisdictions, getting the power company out there to set the meters. Those things probably haven\u2019t gotten better yet. So I think that is kind of slowing down, supplies extending out durations on construction jobs by a quarter or two in many cases. I\u2019m not talking about us so much as the industry as a whole. But for us - so a couple of starts that we thought we were going to start in the first half of the year, and we will probably get delayed a couple of months to the second half of the year, but that is really more about just kind of the delays in getting through the jurisdiction and get the final approval.\nStephen Sakwa: Great. Thanks that is it for me.\nOperator: We will now take a question from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great, thanks and good afternoon everybody. I was curious how the 4% increase in asking rates year-to-date is tracking relative to your expectation at the outset of the year and where you think that - where that could finish the year.\nSean Breslin: Yes, it is Sean. Good question. What I would say is that it is tracking a little bit ahead of what we anticipated and part of the reason why we looked at updating our reforecast, and outlook for the year was based on the trend that we were seeing, not only in asking rents, but what people were actually taking on renewals as well as what we are seeing on the movement side as well as the renewal offers that we have in the Q. I think, typically, what would happen if you look at our business historically, as you would see rents continue to rise, as we move through sort of the July maybe early August period and then decelerate in the back half of the year. As we talked about on the last quarter call, for 2021, things didn\u2019t really decelerate in terms of asking rents. It kind of just leveled off. We do believe that this year and was reflected in our outlook is that we start to see somewhat more normal seasonal patterns to see some deceleration in the back half of the year. But macroeconomic forces, et cetera, just the overall supply and demand dynamics in the housing market will really dictate kind of where things come out is because in the second half of the year I think we will have a better sense for that as we get to our second quarter call.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That makes sense. What does that imply based on your current expectation for how things will play out in a more seasonal pattern? What does that imply for that 14% loss to lease? How much of that do you draw down? And what are you left with entering 2023 based on the current guide?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Good question. I would say that one probably it is a little more challenging to answer sitting here in late April when we are talking about what it might be in January of 2023. So I would say, based on what we know today, it should be well above average, but trying to give you a range would be just too speculative at this point.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Okay. That is fair. And then just last one for me. I\u2019m curious, Kevin, has there been any change in terms of the amount of capital that you plan to source versus the 880 million that you initially outlined back in February, I believe and do you still expect the balance or the bulk of that to be through debt capital based on what we have seen - where we have seen rates move up into this point?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yes. Thanks, Austin. This is Kevin. So yes, I mean, the short answer is our capital plan has changed a little bit, not a lot. So you are correct. When we began the year, our initial outlook was for $880 million of external capital, most of which, at that time, was planned to be sourced for the issuance of unsecured debt. At this point, our current capital plan calls for just under $700 million of external capital. So we are down, call it, $200 million overall relative to our initial outlook. And of that nearly $700 million of external capital that we currently expect for the year, about half is expected to come through net disposition proceeds from sales of -- from pulp circle as well as a little bit of disposition only on dispositions, which is much more of a closer to a push, as been alluded to a moment ago and then the other half from newly unsecured debt against which we have $150 million of hedges in place at a forward starting swap rate of 1.37%, so about 150 basis points below where treasuries are today. And then just to kind of put that in perspective, what needs to still be sourced, of the $700 million of external capital, as you can see from our earnings materials, we sourced $270 million in Q1 versus a $95 million acquisition in Q1 for about one-fourth the anticipated external capital needs in Q1 with 3/4 left to go out here. And then just as a reminder, at the moment, as I mentioned ago, we do not plan, at this point anyway, on drawing down capital on the record in 2022, but rather to expect to do so in 2023 to [indiscernible] to the year.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And now we will take a question from Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs.\nChandni Luthra: Hi, thank you for taking my question. So you took down your high end of your guidance by a couple of pennies. Could you perhaps give us a little bit color as to what would get you to the high end versus the low end right now?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Chandni we had hard time hearing. This is Kevin.\nChandni Luthra: I\u2019m really sorry, my throat is really messed up. I can repeat.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: No, no, I think I have got it. I think you want to know what could drive us to the high end of our range of $9.7 versus the midpoint $9.58. I think the answer primarily is an increase in expected rental revenue received over the course of the year. There could be other signs, including acquisition activity and so forth, but they probably would be a smaller impact I mean up and down the P&L could be changed but anything that would drive us toward the high end of the range would be primarily driven by an expectation for much higher rental rate growth than we are currently seeing with the other known acquisitions as well.\nChandni Luthra: Got it. And then towards the low end, what would it take to get you there? Like what would have to kind of go wrong in that equation?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yes, it is probably the inverse of just kind of what I suggested. So something unexpected today that involves sort of a macroeconomic event that would cause a sharp, but unexpected decline in revenues over the course of the year. I guess analogous is sort of what we saw in 2020 with the pandemic is not in our expectation, but certainly, I guess, potentially within the realm of possibility.\nChandni Luthra: Understood. And then as a follow-up. So you are sending renewals right now in the low teens rate you mentioned earlier. At this point last year, perhaps there was obviously a lot of deal seekers that kind of got it into apartments that just given where the market was. Are you seeing any reversal from that standpoint where people no longer are able to afford especially those who previously did not level up on the apartments? I mean what are you seeing from the deal-seeking activity standpoint? Is it reversing?\nSean Breslin: Yes, this is Sean. Good question. I would say it is not changing materially in terms of behavior. If you look at people that are moving out for rent increase or some other financial reasons, it is up very modestly on a year-over-year basis and probably, importantly, the reason we are not experiencing that is wage growth has been quite robust. And if you look at wage growth, particularly across the occupations that are represented primarily by our residents, it is not uncommon to find high single-digit, low double-digit numbers out there for people in those sectors. And I think that is consistent, even with some of the movements that we are seeing that Ben referenced in his prepared remarks, where people that are moving in this quarter as opposed to the same quarter last year with incomes up 12%, 13% range. That is pretty good, especially in an environment where people are generally spending less from a discretionary income standpoint on various items. So, so far, there is not much stress in the system if that is kind of the main purpose of the question.\nChandni Luthra: Yes. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And the next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks for taking the question. Matt, I want to go back to your comments on just the development deliveries for the industry overall, not just AvalonBay. Are there any markets where these delays are particularly high right now where the operating results are just benefiting from a dearth of deliveries and you just see in a few quarters, we are going to be talking about just kind of a lot of deliveries dropped on to a market once some of these jurisdictional delays here? I\u2019m just trying to get an understanding of whether some of these operating results in certain markets are artificially high right now and there is going to be a shoe to drop?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. It is interesting, John. I don\u2019t know that it will suddenly correct and that there will be -- I think what is more likely to happen is you are going to see supply bleed in over a longer period of time. So it is going to extend out that delivery pipeline. It will get there eventually. So maybe gives those markets a little more time to absorb it, but people are starting just as much. So, a, I don\u2019t think it is going to change anytime soon to some of these issues, particularly when it is jurisdictions or it is utilities. Those are structural issues. Those types of entities don\u2019t suddenly go and hire a bunch of new people. So if you spend time in Austin today, for example, which is one of the markets that is got the most new supply coming in on the way, you\u2019ll hear all the developers and contractors talk about how a job that should take two years from start to finish is taking 2.5 to three. But there is tons of starts there. So I don\u2019t think - I think it is just going to extend out the delivery times in general. And among our markets, including our expansion markets, the two that I would say are probably both stretched that way are probably Denver and Austin. I don\u2019t know that -- there is a lot of supply in some other markets we are not in, that I have read about, but those are the two of the top and I would say where we are seeing the most in terms of those kind of pressures on the system, just not being able to keep up with the amount of supply not in terms of demand, in terms of deliveries and credit final inspections on all that.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Makes sense. And then final question just on Southeast Florida, 25% year-over-year revenue growth. I know it is just a few assets. Can you give me a sense for how much of this is really strong market fundamentals versus these acquisitions being previously undermanaged?\nSean Breslin: Yes, John, it is Sean. I would say it is a little bit of a blend of both. Certainly, the market fundamentals and pick stores that you want to use have been quite healthy with significant market rent growth as you move through, particularly the back half of 2021 that is currently being captured in early 2022. But I would say there is a couple of different assets out of that, again, small pools you referenced, that we felt had a compelling opportunity when we bought the asset in terms of how it is managed, whether it was how the parking garage is managed at one case, how the pricing was managed in terms of revenue management in another case that have probably given us a little bit of a lift. But I would say market fundamentals have been very robust and you would still see pretty robust numbers come out of Southeast Florida, maybe the high teens range or something like that, low 20s. It depends on sort of the management value add, if you want to all that.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Alright, great thank you.\nOperator: Now we will move to Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBradley Heffern: Hi everyone. I just wanted to go back to the acquisition guidance and make sure I understand the thought process there. Is it that you think prices will come down as higher rates flow through and you don\u2019t want to refer ahead of that? Are you concerned about the economic outlook and, therefore, like the rate growth assumptions? Is it just lower accretion given the higher cost of capital? I guess what are the key factors that are making you more defensive?\nBenjamin Schall: Brad, this is Ben. I will start, and Matt can provide more color. It is primarily just an updated snapshot of where we stand today and as part of that, as I mentioned before, we did get more selective, and that was to assess and sort of feel out whether there were going to be changes. There is obviously factors in the macro market, including rising rates and part of that is how much does that get offset or is there countervailing balance with fund flows, which continue to be very strong into the multifamily sector. So looking forward, we are hoping that there is opportunity, of a group, is going to be most impacted by higher rates, it is going to be those levered buyers, we are not that, and we are also able to take a long-term approach, with our investment thesis. So we are paying close attention. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are active in the market and are continuing to actively underwrite and pursue some acquisition opportunities.\nBradley Heffern: Yes. Okay, thanks for that. And then I guess you have this chart on de-densification in the deck. I\u2019m curious, is that something that you expect to be somewhat permanent or is it a sort of a COVID anomaly that will reverse people go back to work and need to double up again financially?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Brad, it is Sean. I mean the short answer is it is probably too early to tell, but I would say there are a number of macro factors that we see out there that could support this being maybe a little bit longer phenomenon in terms of maybe being more secular, I suppose just a cyclical issue. And certainly, people working from home and wanting to have more space or quiet space as opposed to - that might be doing something else, people spending a little bit more on housing in general, whether it is single-family, multifamily, and the thought of home has kind of been how you want to describe it, but a place where the spending more significant time, not only from a work standpoint but for other reasons. And I would just say just given the nature of the population and how we see things evolving demographically, a lot of the growth we have seen has been in single person households. And you can see that kind of playing through the people who are on that bubble maybe going through COVID, where they were just getting married and have kids, took time during COVID to say, okay, this is a good window for us to leave XYZ location to move somewhere else, so people coming back maybe more just singular nature and so in the future of that way for a longer period of time. So there is a number of different issues out there, you can quantify several others as well that would tend to lead you to a conclusion that this may be durable. But the short answer is we will know probably over the next few quarters that we continue to see that trend remain in place.\nBenjamin Schall: Brad, another theme that supporting it to want to emphasize is just the financial health of our resident, our customer. Think about job and wage growth. You think about savings, add on the factors that Sean referenced sort of the increasing importance of the home, definitely a feeling that that is going to create an additional stickiness as they look for quality home environments and more space.\nBradley Heffern: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Now moving to Rich Anderson with SMBC.\nRichard Anderson: Thanks. So I recognize your -.\nBenjamin Schall: Hey Rich you are very soft on the phone.\nRichard Anderson: My headset stopped working. So -- can you hear me now?\nBenjamin Schall: Okay.\nRichard Anderson: There are series of calls today. So recognize what you are doing on the acquisition side, sort of waiting to see how that market plays out. But if I were to extrapolate that conversation into development, obviously, there is no funding issues from your perspective. But at what point do you have your pulse on things? We got a GDP print in negative territory for the first quarter just today, obviously, inflation and the war escalating. A lot of things going on around us that could play a role in property values here at home. So I\u2019m just curious how is your perspective about expanding development obviously, you are doing that. But how could it change in the future and what factors are you looking at to say, well, maybe we should -- not perhaps to take a pause in development but introduce a little bit more caution. What factors are you looking for to come to that conclusion, even though it is not happening right now?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Hey Rich, it is Matt. I will take a shot at that one, and Ben may want to chime in, too. We are always very focused on risk management, and it is kind of built into our DNA. As I mentioned at the beginning that in my remarks, that we never trend, so we are always looking at things on a current spot basis. And we structure our deals where in the vast majority of cases, we are not closing on the land until we are very close to being renovated ground, if not, when we are breaking ground. So we are very mindful of that and what I would say is we have a lot of optionality. So today, we control a $4 billion development rights pipeline with a total investment of less than $300 million between the land on the balance sheet and the pursuit costs that are capitalized for land that we don\u2019t get. So that is pretty impressive to be able to control that much opportunity with the investment that we have, and so that gives us the ability to respond accordingly. So right now, the economics of development are very favorable. And we can provide that sensitivity table, because we have been getting some questions about that, well, you know what if hard costs keep going up. And the answer is if hard costs grow faster -- modestly faster than rents, still preserve the yield. At some point, obviously, that equation changes, and we are watching that every day. But I think we are -- and when we do start, we will match fund it. So if we are match funding it and if we are being careful on the risk mitigation upfront, basically, the way we think about it is we have options on a lot of good business, and we don\u2019t really have to make the decision until the quarter of the deal starts.\nBenjamin Schall: I would just add one thing to that and to Matt\u2019s comments. And that is -- as we do that, we bring a terrifically strong balance sheet to the equation, both from a leverage standpoint and a liquidity standpoint and a financial flexibility standpoint. As you know, from our earnings materials, our net debt-to-EBITDA is five times, which is at the low end of our target range of five to six times. Our unencumbered NOI is 95%, which is probably at an all-time high in the company\u2019s history. So we have plenty of flexibility to see quarters changing and I just circumstances should we need it so. And then likely that the need do so very low because we have got $2.5 billion of liquidity, when you look at our line of credit, our cash on hand and the equity forward. So again, to Matt\u2019s first point, we do bring that first hand to all parts of our business, but we also bring a strong balance sheet that gives plenty of firepower and flexibility.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. Great. And then my second quick question is and I asked this a couple of your peers already this week, see what you have to say. This is an environment that likes which we have not seen the ability to grow rents to the degree that we have. I wonder how you are looking to preserve this to extend the opportunity into 2023 and 2024 as opposed to just sort of taking the money and taking what the market has given you. Is there a way to take this gift of an environment and let it exist and extend the shelf life of it into 2023 beyond just the earn-in that you would normally get, maybe extend lease term or do something to capture this for a longer period of time? Is there any type of strategy in your wheelhouse that you are looking to do that type of thing?\nBenjamin Schall: Rich, I will start with a couple of items that are top of mind. And as you mentioned, obviously, fundamentals are very strong today. But looking at it on the medium term, there are other ways that we need to be focused, and we are focused on driving value and growing earnings. And so you are hearing from us our other focus area and themes, right, driving margin and driving NOI through our operating model transformation, that is one. Think about how do we optimize our portfolio over time, is another or selling off of slower growth higher CapEx assets, and then redeploying that capital into our expansion markets with newer assets that we think we have a better cash flow profile. And then the development pipeline is another area that we continue. Just tapping into that general development DNA is another part as we think about growing earnings. And an aspect of that is finding other avenues to allocate capital, other ways to grow earnings. And you saw that this quarter with our announcement around the structured investment program.\nSean Breslin: The one thing that I would add, Rich, is a couple of your specific questions, maybe just as a reminder is that as you look forward, while we are not providing a kind of guidance for 2023, there are still a number of factors that would -- if you kind of start to line them all up would give you a sense that 2023, absent significant macroeconomic shock of some kind should be a pretty good year and an above average year was the phrase I used earlier. Some of the things that I would point to are: one, we have mentioned what our forecast is for bad debt for this year, which is about rough numbers, 2.5%, 2.6%. That is normally 50 basis points or so. It is simple that we are going to unlock all of that versus just when as we move through this year into next year. And then in terms of the increases that we are seeing in rents today, they are pretty robust. But as we pointed out at the beginning of the call, in Ben\u2019s prepared remarks, we are seeing pretty good asking rent growth today, which is actually boosting loss to lease. And it sets us up as well as we move into 2023. And then the other piece I would say is there still are a couple of markets out there where we are somewhat constrained in terms of the renewal offers that we could send out due to these sort of COVID overlays and regulatory orders that are in place. So there is a few things out there that, absent anything else recurring in some of this esthetic environment, we have a pretty good outcome for 2023 is what I would say. So just keep those in mind.\nRichard Anderson: You got it. I will do that. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will now move to Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Just two questions first. On the rents that you guys are owed, I saw that nationally, you received about $14 million from the federal from treasury in the quarter. But just curious what the split is on AR balances, both that apply to California versus that fall under the federal program. And then two, within those mixes, how much is owed from existing residents versus owed by former residents and by saying that, our understanding is from yesterday\u2019s call is that the former residents in California need to participate in the process otherwise, the landlord doesn\u2019t get paid. So just sort of curious on the breakout of those.\nSean Breslin: Yes. So Alex, we probably need to get back to you with the level of detail that you are looking for and all the breakout between the different components. So we have got some of that in hand, but it might be better to address that offline in terms of the specific details. Kevin can provide a couple of comments to high level, but...\nAlexander Goldfarb: High level is fine. High level is fine.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yes, maybe just a response to your first question about where the money is coming from overall in terms of the emergency reassess programs from the beginning to wear through February. So with respect to receivables from 2020, 2021 and through February 2022, about two-third of the funds that we received has come from California. And then about - the next biggest chunk in 10% from Massachusetts.\nBenjamin Schall: Yes, Alex. So that is a high-level overview. In terms of the question about current versus former residents and stuff like that, why don\u2019t we get back to you? Jason can follow up with you on that one.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Great. Then the second question is, you guys talked pretty helpfully about the market rents and the demand for the product. But just sort of curious, your guidance for the second quarter is a little bit short of where the Street was expecting. Are there some offsets or some items that are coming up that give a little caution to the second quarter or is it just a matter of your view of how timing for the year and that the back half of the year is going to be materially stronger such that the overall guidance range basically stays the same when you look at the full-year guidance?\nSean Breslin: And Alex, said specifically about same-store core FFO, what metrics are you going to be specifically just so we are clear what you are asking about?\nAlexander Goldfarb: Just your core FFO guidance, the top end of your range is where the Street is. So I\u2019m just sort of curious if there were some things of caution or maybe some bad debt items or onetime items that the Street would have factored in that would have had value.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: So Alex, this is Kevin. I guess, first of all, it is impossible for me to reconcile our numbers against a dozen or so analyst numbers on some composite basis. As a group and individually, you all are free and should be free to sort of make your own forecast. I guess I would make a couple of points. First of all, with respect to Q1, we guided to a midpoint of $2.20 per share. We beat it by $0.06. The Street was at around $2.26, $2.27, which ended up being pretty close to accurate, but we certainly didn\u2019t guide the Street there. And so similarly, I guess, the Street may be around 9 63, 9 64 something for the full-year. We never guided the Street to that level. We guided into 9 55. And frankly, we try not to stand by the numbers trying to give you a lot of expression of where we think the year will shake out based on the assumptions that we have in place in the model today. And as things stand, as things play out based on the kind of business plan that we have just outlined in our updated forecast, we think the balance of risk 50/50 are around $9.55 per share, and that includes kind of the pain point of pulling back a little bit on acquisitions of $0.05. So having not done so, we would probably be at $9.63, so maybe that is one way to try to reconcile out to the $9.63. But beyond that, I actually don\u2019t know how to compare our assumptions versus composite of the Streets.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Actually Kevin that is super awesome, I appreciate that color. Thank you.\nOperator: Now we will hear from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Good. Hey everyone. I had a question on the structured investment program. I guess, how do you feel like that will influence your capital deployment preferences going forward and then also just curious why now for launching the program.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Josh, it is Matt. I don\u2019t think it will influence our capital deployment strategy. I think it is really more additive. It is just adding -- it is a way, as Ben was saying, to leverage our capabilities and our relationships and our presence in these markets to something else that will be accretive for the shareholders. So it is not displacing anything else in our capital plans. Why now? We have been in the market for a while now with our different program, our developer funding program, where we have been providing capital to other developers exclusively in our expansion regions. And as we have been doing that, we have learned some things. And one of the things we learned is that the expertise that we do bring is valued, it is valued by potential partners, it is valued by their developers, it is valued by lenders. And so we did see it as, again, a market opportunity to extend those capabilities. And frankly, I think it will be a better environment for placing these kind of investments going forward than it has been in the last couple of years when capital was incredibly cheap and easy. So if anything, I think we are probably in a better position to place this money in competitive terms as I look out over the next couple of years with rates starting to rise and capital maybe coming just a little bit more -.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Got it. And for the whether you do a mezz loan on preferred equity, are you targeting fixed or floating? I know you said like 9% to, I think, 11% kind of returns. But just curious if it will be fixed or floating.\nMatthew Birenbaum: I think our first couple of deals that we are looking at now and the one that we closed are fixed, but it is something we are talking about. And we are going to meet the market where the market is. And when short rates were so incredibly low, fixed was - I think probably the better way to go for the capital provider. If that shifts, that will shift with it.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Awesome. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Ben for any additional or closing remarks.\nBenjamin Schall: Thank you for joining us today and your questions. We look forward to our continued dialogue and seeing you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: And with that, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "Yes Steve it is Sean. In terms of committed renewal offers that have gone out, we are basically in the low teens, which is a little bit better than we originally expected when we contemplated the budget, probably maybe 150 bps or so higher than what we originally expected. So that is what is out now. Yes. I mean I think as what was reflected on the slide that Ben presented, as it relates to turnover, the acceptance rates on renewals as well as lease breaks, which typically account for about third of move-outs, both of those were down pretty materially. I mean, turnover is down, call it, 20% year-over-year, but it is down 15% to 16% compared to kind of pre-COVID norms when you look at Q4 and then again in Q1 of this year. So pricing power is strong for us. I think when people get a renewal offer and they go shop it, use your [indiscernible], they see that we are selling value. And there is transition costs. So if I'm going to go out and it is going to pay roughly the same and then I have got moving costs or switching costs people are inclined just to stay where they are. Yes, Steve, the only thing I would add just on your question for 2021 is the uncollectible revenue that we reported for 2021 was $2.1 million as compared to the current reforecast, as Kevin alluded to, is $2.64 million for 2022. Yes, it is Sean. Good question. What I would say is that it is tracking a little bit ahead of what we anticipated and part of the reason why we looked at updating our reforecast, and outlook for the year was based on the trend that we were seeing, not only in asking rents, but what people were actually taking on renewals as well as what we are seeing on the movement side as well as the renewal offers that we have in the Q. I think, typically, what would happen if you look at our business historically, as you would see rents continue to rise, as we move through sort of the July maybe early August period and then decelerate in the back half of the year. As we talked about on the last quarter call, for 2021, things didn't really decelerate in terms of asking rents. It kind of just leveled off. We do believe that this year and was reflected in our outlook is that we start to see somewhat more normal seasonal patterns to see some deceleration in the back half of the year. But macroeconomic forces, et cetera, just the overall supply and demand dynamics in the housing market will really dictate kind of where things come out is because in the second half of the year I think we will have a better sense for that as we get to our second quarter call. Yes. Good question. I would say that one probably it is a little more challenging to answer sitting here in late April when we are talking about what it might be in January of 2023. So I would say, based on what we know today, it should be well above average, but trying to give you a range would be just too speculative at this point. Yes, this is Sean. Good question. I would say it is not changing materially in terms of behavior. If you look at people that are moving out for rent increase or some other financial reasons, it is up very modestly on a year-over-year basis and probably, importantly, the reason we are not experiencing that is wage growth has been quite robust. And if you look at wage growth, particularly across the occupations that are represented primarily by our residents, it is not uncommon to find high single-digit, low double-digit numbers out there for people in those sectors. And I think that is consistent, even with some of the movements that we are seeing that Ben referenced in his prepared remarks, where people that are moving in this quarter as opposed to the same quarter last year with incomes up 12%, 13% range. That is pretty good, especially in an environment where people are generally spending less from a discretionary income standpoint on various items. So, so far, there is not much stress in the system if that is kind of the main purpose of the question. Yes, John, it is Sean. I would say it is a little bit of a blend of both. Certainly, the market fundamentals and pick stores that you want to use have been quite healthy with significant market rent growth as you move through, particularly the back half of 2021 that is currently being captured in early 2022. But I would say there is a couple of different assets out of that, again, small pools you referenced, that we felt had a compelling opportunity when we bought the asset in terms of how it is managed, whether it was how the parking garage is managed at one case, how the pricing was managed in terms of revenue management in another case that have probably given us a little bit of a lift. But I would say market fundamentals have been very robust and you would still see pretty robust numbers come out of Southeast Florida, maybe the high teens range or something like that, low 20s. It depends on sort of the management value add, if you want to all that. Yes, Brad, it is Sean. I mean the short answer is it is probably too early to tell, but I would say there are a number of macro factors that we see out there that could support this being maybe a little bit longer phenomenon in terms of maybe being more secular, I suppose just a cyclical issue. And certainly, people working from home and wanting to have more space or quiet space as opposed to - that might be doing something else, people spending a little bit more on housing in general, whether it is single-family, multifamily, and the thought of home has kind of been how you want to describe it, but a place where the spending more significant time, not only from a work standpoint but for other reasons. And I would just say just given the nature of the population and how we see things evolving demographically, a lot of the growth we have seen has been in single person households. And you can see that kind of playing through the people who are on that bubble maybe going through COVID, where they were just getting married and have kids, took time during COVID to say, okay, this is a good window for us to leave XYZ location to move somewhere else, so people coming back maybe more just singular nature and so in the future of that way for a longer period of time. So there is a number of different issues out there, you can quantify several others as well that would tend to lead you to a conclusion that this may be durable. But the short answer is we will know probably over the next few quarters that we continue to see that trend remain in place. The one thing that I would add, Rich, is a couple of your specific questions, maybe just as a reminder is that as you look forward, while we are not providing a kind of guidance for 2023, there are still a number of factors that would -- if you kind of start to line them all up would give you a sense that 2023, absent significant macroeconomic shock of some kind should be a pretty good year and an above average year was the phrase I used earlier.

So there is a few things out there that, absent anything else recurring in some of this esthetic environment, we have a pretty good outcome for 2023 is what I would say. So just keep those in mind. Yes. So Alex, we probably need to get back to you with the level of detail that you are looking for and all the breakout between the different components. So we have got some of that in hand, but it might be better to address that offline in terms of the specific details. Kevin can provide a couple of comments to high level, but...

            "name": "Matthew Birenbaum",
            "content": "Great, thanks Ben. Turning to Slide 12. Our development activity continues to generate outstanding results. The five consolidated communities currently in lease up, which are widely dispersed across five different regions have rents which are currently $230 or 9% above proforma, which in turn is contributing to yield there are 40 basis points ahead of our initial expectations at 6.1%. With an estimated value on completion in excess of $1 billion and a cost basis of $690 million. This provides roughly $360 million in value creation for an exceptional profit margin of 52%. While hard costs are certainly trending up, there is plenty of room from March to compress from these elevated levels and still provide strong risk adjusted returns going forward. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, our teams have also been very active in sourcing new development opportunities as shown on Slide 13. At the end of the first quarter, our development rights pipeline had grown to $4 billion up from $3.3 billion at the start of the year with new sites added in our expansion regions of Denver and Austin, as well as established regions in New England and Northern California. All of these new development rights are in suburban locations and with the total pipeline weighted 75% suburban and 25% urban, our stabilized portfolio will likely trend towards that mix over time as well. The chart in the lower right hand corner of this slide provides an illustration of how inflationary pressures on both NOIs and hard costs would typically flow through to development yield. This is an increasingly important issue in the current environment. Our development rights pipeline is underwritten to a current average yield or cost of roughly 5.5%. The chart shows how a change of plus or minus 10% to both hard costs and NOIs would impact that yield of holding all else constant, because hard costs represent 60% of total capital on news development with variances depending on the specific site. You can see that rising NOIs have roughly twice as much of an impact on yield as rising hard costs of a similar magnitude. As a reminder, we underwrite all of our development on current basis and typically do not trend either NOIs or costs. Even in the current environment with hard cost inflation running at a level, this gives us a measure of safety. This math suggests even if hard costs rise by 10% from current levels, the 5.5% yield can still be preserved with just a 6% increase in NOI Slide 14 provides a quick update on our progress in our expansion markets of Denver and Southeast Florida. We have been measured in our approach to building diversified portfolios in these regions, investing through a combination of acquisitions, funding local third-party developers and developing our own communities directly as we do in our established regions. This has allowed us to put together portfolios that we believe will be optimized for future revenue growth as well as initial investment return with strong locations in both urban and suburban submarkets in both regions. Critically, we are also focused on getting the products we want that will be well positioned to take advantage of demographic trends like the aging of the millennials and the increase in work from home as reflected in the larger-than-typical average unit size and young average asset age shown on the chart. We expect to follow a similar trajectory as we ramp up our investment activity in our newest expansion regions of North Carolina and Texas and make steady progress towards our goal of a 25% allocation to these expansion regions. Turning to Slide 17. We also launched a new investment vehicle in the first quarter, which we are calling our Structured Investment Program, or SIP. This is a mezzanine lending platform that provides short-term construction financing to local third-party developers in our established regions plus Denver and Florida with our position in the capital stack between the primary construction loan and the sponsor equity. The SIP provides another way for us to leverage our deep expertise in development, construction and operations to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders, and we expect to build this program to a $300 million to $500 million total investment level over the next few years. And with that, I will turn it back to Ben for some closing remarks. Hey Nick, this is Matt. I guess I can take that one. I think it will take us a couple of years. It really will be dependent on the volume. The transaction market starts volume and kind of how our origination goes, but I would expect it is probably going to be two to three years before we get it up to that level. Then once you get to that level, these are typically three to five year investments. So each year, there is some redemptions, and hopefully, you are putting out some new money. So it is a ramp to get it there and then probably that is worth to keep it there. Yes. Thanks for that. So the second question, no, we do not expect to have an option to buy the deals, and we are trying to be very clear with the market and the sponsors that we are working with. For us, this is not a program that is about ultimately owning that real estate. It is a program that is about leveraging our expertise and our local market presence in these markets to generate good risk-adjusted returns during the duration of the investment. So we really are viewing it as a onetime investment. What was the first part of the question? Competition, sorry. Yes. There is competition. There is competition from some of our REIT peers as we are aware. Although I would say, I think that the market conditions are probably shifting in a way that is going to make this program more attractive going forward, as development capital maybe gets a little more challenging, as first loan proceeds start to get constrained. So we are pretty bullish. And the other thing is we have key relationships in all of these markets. And we have been in them for many years. And so we view it as really another way. We can work with a lot of folks that we have worked with in other capacities in the past, and it is kind of another sleeve of capital to it. I guess one thing I would just add to that, Rich, is it is also about the relative value between what we are buying and what we are selling. And I will say that changes - and we may be starting to see a little bit of a change in where values might be in the regions we are looking to buy in, and some of the regions we are looking to sell and maybe haven't been quite as in favor and that shift may be changing. So I actually think, looking forward that relative value proposition on the trade may look a little better than it is say in the first quarter of this year when we were being more cautious. Yes, Steve, I guess I would say construction inflation is definitely running hot. So costs are on the rise. This is where us being our general contractor really does help because we are able to go back to build on the relationships we have had over many years with a lot of our subcontractors and negotiate early agreements and sign build agreements. So we are doing what we can to stay in front of it. The supply chain issues and the actual availability issues. Those have probably got a little bit better over the last four or five months. So I haven't heard as much about that. I would say the bigger challenges have been just getting final permits through jurisdictions, in some cases, getting certificates of occupancy, final inspections from jurisdictions, getting the power company out there to set the meters. Those things probably haven't gotten better yet. So I think that is kind of slowing down, supplies extending out durations on construction jobs by a quarter or two in many cases. I'm not talking about us so much as the industry as a whole. But for us - so a couple of starts that we thought we were going to start in the first half of the year, and we will probably get delayed a couple of months to the second half of the year, but that is really more about just kind of the delays in getting through the jurisdiction and get the final approval. Yes. It is interesting, John. I don't know that it will suddenly correct and that there will be -- I think what is more likely to happen is you are going to see supply bleed in over a longer period of time. So it is going to extend out that delivery pipeline. It will get there eventually. So maybe gives those markets a little more time to absorb it, but people are starting just as much. So, a, I don't think it is going to change anytime soon to some of these issues, particularly when it is jurisdictions or it is utilities. Those are structural issues. Those types of entities don't suddenly go and hire a bunch of new people. So if you spend time in Austin today, for example, which is one of the markets that is got the most new supply coming in on the way, you'll hear all the developers and contractors talk about how a job that should take two years from start to finish is taking 2.5 to three. But there is tons of starts there. So I don't think - I think it is just going to extend out the delivery times in general. And among our markets, including our expansion markets, the two that I would say are probably both stretched that way are probably Denver and Austin. I don't know that -- there is a lot of supply in some other markets we are not in, that I have read about, but those are the two of the top and I would say where we are seeing the most in terms of those kind of pressures on the system, just not being able to keep up with the amount of supply not in terms of demand, in terms of deliveries and credit final inspections on all that. Hey Rich, it is Matt. I will take a shot at that one, and Ben may want to chime in, too. We are always very focused on risk management, and it is kind of built into our DNA. As I mentioned at the beginning that in my remarks, that we never trend, so we are always looking at things on a current spot basis. And we structure our deals where in the vast majority of cases, we are not closing on the land until we are very close to being renovated ground, if not, when we are breaking ground. So we are very mindful of that and what I would say is we have a lot of optionality. So today, we control a $4 billion development rights pipeline with a total investment of less than $300 million between the land on the balance sheet and the pursuit costs that are capitalized for land that we don't get. So that is pretty impressive to be able to control that much opportunity with the investment that we have, and so that gives us the ability to respond accordingly. So right now, the economics of development are very favorable. And we can provide that sensitivity table, because we have been getting some questions about that, well, you know what if hard costs keep going up. And the answer is if hard costs grow faster -- modestly faster than rents, still preserve the yield. At some point, obviously, that equation changes, and we are watching that every day. But I think we are -- and when we do start, we will match fund it. So if we are match funding it and if we are being careful on the risk mitigation upfront, basically, the way we think about it is we have options on a lot of good business, and we don't really have to make the decision until the quarter of the deal starts. Josh, it is Matt. I don't think it will influence our capital deployment strategy. I think it is really more additive. It is just adding -- it is a way, as Ben was saying, to leverage our capabilities and our relationships and our presence in these markets to something else that will be accretive for the shareholders. So it is not displacing anything else in our capital plans. Why now? We have been in the market for a while now with our different program, our developer funding program, where we have been providing capital to other developers exclusively in our expansion regions. And as we have been doing that, we have learned some things. And one of the things we learned is that the expertise that we do bring is valued, it is valued by potential partners, it is valued by their developers, it is valued by lenders. And so we did see it as, again, a market opportunity to extend those capabilities. And frankly, I think it will be a better environment for placing these kind of investments going forward than it has been in the last couple of years when capital was incredibly cheap and easy. So if anything, I think we are probably in a better position to place this money in competitive terms as I look out over the next couple of years with rates starting to rise and capital maybe coming just a little bit more -. I think our first couple of deals that we are looking at now and the one that we closed are fixed, but it is something we are talking about. And we are going to meet the market where the market is. And when short rates were so incredibly low, fixed was - I think probably the better way to go for the capital provider. If that shifts, that will shift with it."

            "name": "Benjamin Schall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason. And thanks all for joining us on today's call. Matt and I will open with some prepared remarks and we are joined by Kevin and Sean for Q&A. Starting on Slide 4 of our presentation. Q1 was a very strong start to what we continue to expect to be a very strong year of operating results. Core FFO per share came in at $2.26, a 15.9% year-over-year increase and $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance. I will dive deeper into the drivers of that outperformance in a moment. On the capital allocation front, our industry leading development platform continues to drive meaningful earnings growth and value creation with a very robust 6.9% yield on developments completed this quarter. For the year, we are projecting about 700 million of completions at an average yield of 6.3%, which represents a substantial spread to current market cap rates. As we grow, we are also optimizing the portfolio through the selective sale of older, slower growth assets from our established regions. This quarter with 270 million of dispositions at a high 3% cap rate with the intention to then redeploy this capital primarily into acquisitions in our expansion markets. And in April, we executed on an equity board for $495 million as an expected source of capital to opportunistically draw down through the end of 2023, and locking in our cost of capital for future development activity at what we expect to be a creative spread. Turning to Slide 5. GAAP residential revenue increased 8.5% on a year-over-year basis led by about a 6% increase in effective lease rates and a 100 basis point improvement in net bad debt. On a cash basis, residential revenue increased almost 10%. As shown on Slide 6, the 8.5% GAAP revenue growth was 150 basis point greater than the 7% increase we assumed in Q1 guidance with lease rates and occupancy above our prior guidance and while still at elevated levels, better than expected bad debt and rent relief collections driving the bulk of the outperformance relative to our expectations. Portfolio performance has been supported by a number of tailwinds as detailed on Slide 7. Starting with Chart 1, we continue to see elevated move-ins from greater than 150 miles away, which speaks to a continued flow of residents back to our established markets and as particularly positive indicator for our urban and job centered suburban communities. In Chart 2, we also continue to see de-densification with less roommates and a desire for more space, leading to fewer adults per apartment, and as a driver of incremental demand across our portfolio. As rents continue to grow, they are supported by greater household income from new residents, which was up 12% in Q1 relative to the prior year period as shown on Chart 3. And finally on Chart 4, rent versus own economics, the monthly cost of renting versus the cost of owning a home materially favors renting in our markets with a difference of almost a $1000 per month, historically high level, and one which provides a meaningful cushion and support to our rent growth. As shown on Slide 8, this backdrop is translating into continued momentum like term effective rent change, which accelerated throughout Q1 and continued into April at 13.7%. Looking forward, our portfolio is positioned extremely well heading into the peak leasing season. As shown on Slide 9, occupancy remains strong and steady at about 96.5%. Annualized turnover means very low relative to historic figures and 30-day availability effectively the near-term inventory that is available for lease remains limited at less than 5% of our units. And while we continue to capture meaningful loss to lease as existing resident leases expire, our portfolio wide loss to lease remains high currently at 14%, which has been supported by a 4% increase in asking rates since the beginning of the year. Turning to Slide 10. We are making meaningful progress in the transformation of our operating platform, as we drive toward our goal of improving margins by 200 basis points or an additional 40 million to 50 million of NOI with approximately 10 million generated to-date. This slide highlights three of our many initiatives, including bulk internet and managed wifi, which is projected to ultimately deliver over 25 million of incremental annual NOI, smart home technology, which unlocks both operating efficiencies and revenue opportunities going forward. And third, our digital mobile maintenance platform, which will not only enhance our residents experience with us, but also deliver material value the enhanced operational efficiency. Before turning it to Matt, Slide 11 provides our updated full-year guidance with projected 16% core FFO growth, reflecting our strong momentum in Q1 and incorporating our increased outlook for same-store revenue and NOI growth. We have also updated our guidance to take into account a couple of factors. On the operating side, while core operating performance is quite strong, there continues to be some uncertainty about net bad debt in certain markets, particularly in Southern California and Alameda County and Northern California. And in some other markets, while eviction moratoria have expired, the core processes are moving slowly. As a result, some of the growth we are expecting in the back half of 2022 may get pushed in 2023, which we have assumed in our updated guidance. As it relates to our projected core FFO growth for the year, we have scaled back our assumption for acquisition activity for 2022, based on where we stand through today. As we keep a close eye on cap rates, fund flows and assess any shifts in the transaction markets. While we remain active, including another acquisition we recently put under contract, we update our guidance from being a net buyer in 2022 to an assumption of balancing acquisition volume with disposition volume before taking into account proceeds from Columbus circle. And with that, I will turn it over to Matt to go further into our development and capital allocation activities. Thanks, Matt. To wrap up and summarize key themes, Q1 was a strong start to the year with several tailwinds continuing to support our operating fundamentals, which are some of the strongest we have experienced and have us well positioned going into the peak leasing season. We continue to invest in our operating platform with the teams executing across a number of transformative initiatives over 2022, including both Wi-Fi, smart access and mobile maintenance. As you heard, we continue to lean into our development platform with lease-ups outperforming and generating meaningful earnings growth and value creation. We are also building our development rights pipeline now up to $4 billion, providing options on future value creation including significant investment in our established regions at accretive returns as well as a continued focus on optimizing the portfolio by growing in our expansion markets. And finally, we continue to look to tap our Company's strengths with our structured investment program being our latest offering by tapping into our development, construction and financial know-how to grow earnings and create value. With that, I will turn it to the operator for questions. And Nick, if you think about us in our established markets, self-performing and being our own GC, right, we have come with a ton of daily on-the-ground knowledge that we think we can leverage here and do so in a competitive way as we think about risk-adjusted returns. Rich, it is Ben. Just a couple more tidbits there. So on the acquisition side, as Kevin hit on, it is a reflection of where we stand today. We did narrow the box some earlier this year. We wanted to assess the market and obviously some macro dynamics happening there. And the assumption we pulled it down to is similar to what we had last year, which is sort of a balance between acquisitions and dispositions and we continue to think about it really as sort of trade capital and so capital that we can be looking to monetize out of our established regions and then redeploying that capital into our expansion markets. Yes, I will start and then Matt can chime in. We were very active last year, had a lot of activity at the end of last year and are continuing to push there for some of the reasons that you hit on. Again, the bulk of our portfolio, we have got a lot of conviction around. It is performing well. So our movement as we think about optimizing the portfolio is a longer-term approach. So we are thinking about assets at a point in time, how do we think about value today versus value six months from today and why there could be some movement in cap rates, let's say. There is also very strong operating fundamentals that are going to help support asset values as we look forward. Brad, this is Ben. I will start, and Matt can provide more color. It is primarily just an updated snapshot of where we stand today and as part of that, as I mentioned before, we did get more selective, and that was to assess and sort of feel out whether there were going to be changes. There is obviously factors in the macro market, including rising rates and part of that is how much does that get offset or is there countervailing balance with fund flows, which continue to be very strong into the multifamily sector. So looking forward, we are hoping that there is opportunity, of a group, is going to be most impacted by higher rates, it is going to be those levered buyers, we are not that, and we are also able to take a long-term approach, with our investment thesis. So we are paying close attention. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are active in the market and are continuing to actively underwrite and pursue some acquisition opportunities. Brad, another theme that supporting it to want to emphasize is just the financial health of our resident, our customer. Think about job and wage growth. You think about savings, add on the factors that Sean referenced sort of the increasing importance of the home, definitely a feeling that that is going to create an additional stickiness as they look for quality home environments and more space. Hey Rich you are very soft on the phone. Okay. I would just add one thing to that and to Matt's comments. And that is -- as we do that, we bring a terrifically strong balance sheet to the equation, both from a leverage standpoint and a liquidity standpoint and a financial flexibility standpoint. As you know, from our earnings materials, our net debt-to-EBITDA is five times, which is at the low end of our target range of five to six times. Our unencumbered NOI is 95%, which is probably at an all-time high in the company's history. So we have plenty of flexibility to see quarters changing and I just circumstances should we need it so. And then likely that the need do so very low because we have got $2.5 billion of liquidity, when you look at our line of credit, our cash on hand and the equity forward. So again, to Matt's first point, we do bring that first hand to all parts of our business, but we also bring a strong balance sheet that gives plenty of firepower and flexibility. Rich, I will start with a couple of items that are top of mind. And as you mentioned, obviously, fundamentals are very strong today. But looking at it on the medium term, there are other ways that we need to be focused, and we are focused on driving value and growing earnings. And so you are hearing from us our other focus area and themes, right, driving margin and driving NOI through our operating model transformation, that is one. Think about how do we optimize our portfolio over time, is another or selling off of slower growth higher CapEx assets, and then redeploying that capital into our expansion markets with newer assets that we think we have a better cash flow profile. And then the development pipeline is another area that we continue. Just tapping into that general development DNA is another part as we think about growing earnings. And an aspect of that is finding other avenues to allocate capital, other ways to grow earnings. And you saw that this quarter with our announcement around the structured investment program. Yes, Alex. So that is a high-level overview. In terms of the question about current versus former residents and stuff like that, why don't we get back to you? Jason can follow up with you on that one. Thank you for joining us today and your questions. We look forward to our continued dialogue and seeing you soon. Thank you."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Kevin O'Shea",
            "content": "Yes. Sure, Rich. This is Kevin. Maybe just with the first part of I think you are right with respect to all that, maybe to break it apart into two pieces. You are correct. Obviously, we did the equity forward $500 million of spend. Mentioned, our intention, at least at this point, is that while we can pull that down in one or more settlements from here through the end of 2023, our expectation is at this point that we are going to use that equity capital to draw down over the course of 2023 to fund development in 2023. So that is our current intention. So it is basically capital that we have earmarked at this point to fund future starts into 2023. As to kind of the first part of what you are referencing in terms of the change in the reforecast in acquisitions, you are correct. We increased overall expectations for core FFO for full-year by $0.03 to $9.58 at the midpoint. And as you can see on page four earnings release, there are a number of pluses and minuses that result net $0.03 change. And among the more notable changes are obviously an expectation for $0.11 increase in earnings from higher same-store NOI primarily driven from higher rental rates and to a lesser extent, from higher occupancy and rental repayments. And then second, as you pointed out, Rich, a $0.05 decrease in earnings from capital markets and transaction activity, which, in turn, when you kind of net the pluses and minuses in that category is driven by a decrease in forecasted acquisition activity based at least on where we stand today at this early point in the year. Of course, what we may do when acquisitions can change pretty quickly. That is a dynamic part of our budget and what we may be doing on the investment front. So Matt can certainly speak to that but at the moment, we pulled that down a little bit, which creates a little bit of a $0.05 decrease. And the other notable item is just a $0.03 decrease in earnings related to the flow through the compensation items. So that is sort of the other reconciliation of the reforecast for 2022, and the equity forward, to be clear, is not being pulled down in that model for 2022 because that is not our current expectations. So Steve, I will jump in here and Sean may want to add here a little bit. So in terms of overall bad debt on a percent of revenue basis, there is not a whole lot of change. Of course, there is two categories that feed into that number. But just to kind of give you a sense that for the full-year in our budget, we assume that uncollectible revenue overall would be about 270 basis points of the headwind - 270 basis points of revenue. And at this point, it is 264 basis points. So on a net basis, marginally better. But as you probably saw reflected, there is a bit of movement as we have seen in the first part of the year so far in some of those underlying pieces. And so underlying bad debt trends, delinquencies, if you will and a couple of our jurisdictions have trended worse such that overall, for the full-year, we expect that category to be a little bit worse over the course of the year. At the same time, we saw more rent relief payments in Q1, and we now expect to receive more rent payments overall for the full-year. And so kind of when you net that out over the full-year, overall, our reforecast for overall bad debt, taking into account rent relief and underlying bad debt trends, is roughly net neutral relative to our initial outlook with higher expected rent relief payments expected primarily in the front half of the year to be nearly offset by higher underlying bad debt projected primarily in the back of the year. Sean, do you want to add anything? Correct. And the way I would probably think about it, Steve, is relative to our original budget, some markets are getting a little bit better. But given the delay in the eviction moratorium expiration, particularly throughout Los Angeles and elevated County in Northern California, we adjusted our outlook to reflect continuation of bad debt trends in those markets through 2022 and not seeing significant improvement until we get into 2023 and that is really what you kind of put through it. From a geography standpoint, that is where we expect a little more of a headwind than we maybe originally anticipated but as Kevin noted, a little more than offset by greater rent relation. Yes. Thanks, Austin. This is Kevin. So yes, I mean, the short answer is our capital plan has changed a little bit, not a lot. So you are correct. When we began the year, our initial outlook was for $880 million of external capital, most of which, at that time, was planned to be sourced for the issuance of unsecured debt. At this point, our current capital plan calls for just under $700 million of external capital. So we are down, call it, $200 million overall relative to our initial outlook. And of that nearly $700 million of external capital that we currently expect for the year, about half is expected to come through net disposition proceeds from sales of -- from pulp circle as well as a little bit of disposition only on dispositions, which is much more of a closer to a push, as been alluded to a moment ago and then the other half from newly unsecured debt against which we have $150 million of hedges in place at a forward starting swap rate of 1.37%, so about 150 basis points below where treasuries are today. And then just to kind of put that in perspective, what needs to still be sourced, of the $700 million of external capital, as you can see from our earnings materials, we sourced $270 million in Q1 versus a $95 million acquisition in Q1 for about one-fourth the anticipated external capital needs in Q1 with 3/4 left to go out here. And then just as a reminder, at the moment, as I mentioned ago, we do not plan, at this point anyway, on drawing down capital on the record in 2022, but rather to expect to do so in 2023 to [indiscernible] to the year. Chandni we had hard time hearing. This is Kevin. No, no, I think I have got it. I think you want to know what could drive us to the high end of our range of $9.7 versus the midpoint $9.58. I think the answer primarily is an increase in expected rental revenue received over the course of the year. There could be other signs, including acquisition activity and so forth, but they probably would be a smaller impact I mean up and down the P&L could be changed but anything that would drive us toward the high end of the range would be primarily driven by an expectation for much higher rental rate growth than we are currently seeing with the other known acquisitions as well. Yes, it is probably the inverse of just kind of what I suggested. So something unexpected today that involves sort of a macroeconomic event that would cause a sharp, but unexpected decline in revenues over the course of the year. I guess analogous is sort of what we saw in 2020 with the pandemic is not in our expectation, but certainly, I guess, potentially within the realm of possibility. Yes, maybe just a response to your first question about where the money is coming from overall in terms of the emergency reassess programs from the beginning to wear through February. So with respect to receivables from 2020, 2021 and through February 2022, about two-third of the funds that we received has come from California. And then about - the next biggest chunk in 10% from Massachusetts. So Alex, this is Kevin. I guess, first of all, it is impossible for me to reconcile our numbers against a dozen or so analyst numbers on some composite basis. As a group and individually, you all are free and should be free to sort of make your own forecast. I guess I would make a couple of points. First of all, with respect to Q1, we guided to a midpoint of $2.20 per share. We beat it by $0.06. The Street was at around $2.26, $2.27, which ended up being pretty close to accurate, but we certainly didn't guide the Street there. And so similarly, I guess, the Street may be around 9 63, 9 64 something for the full-year. We never guided the Street to that level. We guided into 9 55. And frankly, we try not to stand by the numbers trying to give you a lot of expression of where we think the year will shake out based on the assumptions that we have in place in the model today. And as things stand, as things play out based on the kind of business plan that we have just outlined in our updated forecast, we think the balance of risk 50/50 are around $9.55 per share, and that includes kind of the pain point of pulling back a little bit on acquisitions of $0.05. So having not done so, we would probably be at $9.63, so maybe that is one way to try to reconcile out to the $9.63. But beyond that, I actually don't know how to compare our assumptions versus composite of the Streets."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your host for today\u2019s conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley: Well, thank you, operator, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon\u2019s press release as well as in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today\u2019s discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ben Schall, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Ben?\nBen Schall: Thank you, Jason. I am joined today by Kevin O\u2019Shea, our CFO; Matt Birenbaum, our Chief Investment Officer and Sean Breslin, our Chief Operating Officer. We'd like to start by thanking our 3,000 AvalonBay Associates for delivering exceptional results in 2023. Your efforts and dedication are what make it happen, and your commitment to our purpose and culture makes us who we are as an organization. Thank you. As a brief recap on last year, as shown on Slide four, we achieved 8.6% core FFO growth for the year, a testament to our ability to grow earnings through unique internal and external drivers. Through the proactive management of our assets, same-store revenue ended the year up 6.3%, and NOI increased by 6.2%. For external growth, our developments underway continue to outperform with $575 million of completions across six projects, delivering outside stabilized yields of 7.1%. We're particularly proud of the results from our operating model transformation, where we are delivering enhanced value to customers and driving meaningful efficiencies. As highlighted on Slide five, our operating initiatives exceeded expectations in 2023, delivering $19 million of incremental annual NOI to the bottom line, which was $7 million or almost 60% higher than anticipated. Moving to Slide six and capital allocation, remain nimble in 2023, having shifted to being a net seller during the year, with four dispositions from our established regions for $445 million, $275 million of which we'd redeployed into acquisitions in our expansion regions. We also started $800 million of profitable new development during the year, including $300 million of starts in the fourth quarter at an initial projected yield of 6.7%. We also continue to build our structured investment business this year, in which we provide preferred equity or mezzanine loans to third parties for new multifamily construction. We're well positioned to underwrite this business given our development and construction expertise and our live proprietary data and we're fortunate to be building this book of business in today's environment, reflecting today's rates and asset values. The commitments we made in 2022 and 2023, which now total $192 million, are set to deliver an uplift in earnings this year and going forward. Our balance sheet is as strong as it has ever been, with a key metric summarized on Slide seven, providing strength as we manage the business and flexibility as we consider creative opportunities that may arise during 2024. Among a set of peers with strong balance sheets, we continue to experience some of the tightest credit spreads among all REITs, providing a meaningful financial advantage. Slide eight highlights our strategic focus areas for 2024. These focus areas draw upon our foundational strengths as an organization, while also recognizing our commitment to continue to evolve and our areas we are confident will drive superior growth over a multi-year period. Front and center are the next steps in our operating model transformation. At our Investor Day, we raised our target for incremental annual NOI to come from our operating initiatives to $80 million, $55 million of NOI from Horizon 1, and $25 million from Horizon 2. Second, we will continue to drive differentiated growth from our development and construction leadership. The near-term focus is on execution of our projects underway, ensuring they deliver outsized value for shareholders and while new start economics are challenging in certain of our markets, this is the type of environment in which we've typically found some of our most attractive development opportunities. Third, as a continued multi-year approach, we have set a target of shifting 80% of the portfolio to the suburbs from 70% today, and set a target of having 25% of our portfolio in our expansion regions, up meaningfully from 8% today and given the cooling of fundamentals in the Sunbelt, we believe we can make this transition at a more attractive basis than we were able to a couple of years ago. We're also making significant and very creative investments in the existing portfolio this year, ranging from apartment renovations to the creation of new Accessory Dwelling Units, or ADUs in certain markets. Finally, and as a follow-up to my comments about our balance sheet, we are confident that there will be opportunities for us to both utilize our balance sheet capacity and bring our strategic capabilities to bear, be it operational, development, or by utilizing our scale to generate value for shareholders. As we assess the year ahead and moving to Slide nine, our baseline expectation is for a slowing economic environment this year. As we have in the past, we start with consensus estimates from the National Association for Business Economics, or NABE, which forecasts positive but very modest job growth in 2024 of 55,000 jobs per month. This muted growth tempers housing demand, while other factors such as rent versus own economics should serve as a balanced apartment demand, particularly in our established regions, where it is now $2,500 per month more expensive to buy than to rent. Nevertheless, given mixed signals and what we believe is higher uncertainty in the economy and capital markets, our approach is to remain nimble and be ready to proactively adjust based on how 2024 evolves. In an environment of uncertainty, one known factor is new multifamily supply. In our established regions, we expect new apartment deliveries of 1.6% of existing stock in 2024, and expect this figure to further decline to 1.4% in 2025. Importantly, these figures are in line with historical averages for these coastal markets, and this is quite a contrast with supply dynamics in the Sunbelt, which will have twice the level of supply and this elevated supply dynamic in the Sunbelt is expected to continue at least through 2025, simply a function of the reality that it generally takes two plus years to complete and stabilize a new development project and so as we assess 2024, we expect to be relatively well positioned given the stable demand and limited supply outlook in our established regions, but are forecasting a slower year of growth. I'll now turn it to Kevin to provide an overview of our guidance for the year and the building blocks of earnings growth.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Thanks, Ben. On Slide 11, we provide our operating and financial outlook for 2024. For the year, using the midpoint of guidance, we expect 1.4% growth in core FFO per share, driven by our same store portfolio and by stabilizing lease-up communities, partially offset by the impact of capital markets and transaction activity, as well as by slightly higher overhead costs. In our same-store residential portfolio, we expect revenue growth of 2.6% and NOI growth of 1.25% for the year and for our capital plan, we anticipate total capital uses of $1.4 billion in 2024, consisting of $1.1 billion in investment spend and $300 million in debt maturities. For our capital sources, we expect to benefit from nearly $400 million in projected free cash flow after dividends and to source $850 million in new capital, which we currently assume will be unsecured debt issued later this year. In this regard, thanks to our balance sheet strength and our A minus and A3 credit rating, we enjoy attractively priced debt today at around 5% on a 10-year unsecured debt that we can invest in development yielding in the mid-sixth range to support future earnings growth. We also project drawing upon $175 million or the $400 million in unrestricted cash on hand at yearend 2023, resulting in projected unrestricted cash at the end of this year of about $225 million. On Slide 12, we illustrate the components of our expected 1.4% growth in core FFO per share. We expect $0.15 per share of earnings growth to come from NOI growth in our same-store sources of growth with a $0.29 impact from capital markets in transaction activities. And with that summary of our outlook, I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss our operating business.\nSean Breslin: All right, thanks, Kevin. Turning to Slide 13, three primary drivers will support same-store revenue growth in 2024. First, embedded rent roll growth of 1%, down approximately 50 basis points from where it was at the end of Q3 2023, which is consistent with historical trends, plus incremental lease rate growth throughout the year. Second, an outsized contribution of roughly 80 basis points from the projected 13% increase in other rental revenue, which is derived from our operating initiatives and third, about a 60 basis point improvement in underlying bad debt from residents from 2.4% in 2023 to an expected 1.8% in 2024. The cumulative growth from those three primary drivers is expected to be partially offset by a 30 basis point headwind from the projected $6 million year-over-year reduction of rent relief and a modest drag from net concessions and economic occupancy. To provide a little more detail on underlying bad debt trends from residents, we're expecting a 60 basis point improvement year-over-year, our forecast reflects an underlying bad debt rate of roughly 1.6% at year-end 2024, which is still more than double our historical pre-COVID rate. Moving to Slide 14, we expect revenue growth in our established regions to be more than double that of our expansion regions, which is primarily a function of the substantially lower level of new supply in the established regions and within our established regions, we expect better demand supply fundamentals on the East Coast as compared to the West Coast. Southern California is expected to produce the strongest same-store revenue growth, which is primarily the result of a substantial improvement in underlying bad debt on a year-over-year basis. Transitioning to Slide 15 to address our operating model transformation, we're tremendously proud of our team's focus and efforts over the last couple years, which have produced approximately $27 million in incremental NOI. We expect to recognize another roughly $9 million benefit in our consolidated portfolio during 2024. The key drivers in 2024 include Avalon Connect, our bulk Internet and managed Wi-Fi deployments, along with smart access features. In addition, we expect an incremental benefit from our shift to a new organizational model, which reflects neighborhood staffing supported by centralized teams. While we have specific plans for 2024, our focus in these areas and others will continue to deliver additional value for associates, residents and shareholders for years to come. Turning to Slide 16 to address our same-store operating expense outlook, we expect roughly 340 basis points of organic expense growth, another approximately 140 basis points from profitable operating initiatives, and roughly 75 basis points from the expiration of various tax abatement programs in the portfolio, primarily in New York City. As it relates to our initiatives, the 140 basis point increase is driven by 170 basis points from our Avalon Connect offering, which I mentioned earlier, partially offset by reductions in payroll. As I've noted in the past, the deployment of our Avalon Connect offering, which will ultimately enhance portfolio NOI by more than $30 million, will pressure expense growth during the deployment period. We expect to be fully deployed by the end of 2024, so the operating expense impact will diminish materially as we move into 2025. So now I'll turn it over to Matt to address our capital allocation activity. Matt?\nMatt Birenbaum: All right, great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to Slide 17, we're planning another year of accretive activity across all of our various investment platforms in 2024. We expect to break ground on seven new developments, representing $870 million of investment at a weighted average yield in the mid-6% range, grow our SIP business by another $75 million with rates on new originations in excess of 12% and expand our investments in our existing portfolio that we discussed a bit at our Investor Day, where we see opportunity to further increase our activity to roughly $100 million at yields of roughly 10%. In the investment sales market, activity levels are still low, but most market participants do expect a gradual increase in transactions as the year progresses. Our plan is to access this market as part of our portfolio management strategy, selling assets in our established regions and redeploying that capital into acquisitions in our expansion regions. We expect this activity to be roughly neutral on both a volume and return basis, buying and selling in equal amounts and at equivalent yields. As Ben mentioned, the dynamics of this trading activity look to be more favorable in '24 than they might have been in the recent past, as some short-term operating challenges in our targeted expansion regions may present the opportunity to acquire assets significantly below replacement cost. Of course, the market for all of our investment activities is highly dynamic, and we are prepared to pivot and adjust our plan in response to potential changes in the macro environment as the year evolves. Turning to our existing development underway, Slide 18 details the impressive results that continue to be generated by our current lease-ups. The four development communities that had active leasing in Q4 are delivering rents $260 per month, or 8.4% above our initial underwriting, which is translating into a 20-basis point increase in yield. As a reminder, in general, the rents we quote on our developments are current market rents as of the time we break ground, and we do not trend or update these rents until we achieve significant actual leasing velocity close to completion of the project. While market rents certainly didn't grow as much in 2023 as in prior years, there is still some lift to come when we mark the rents to market on the $855 million of lease-ups we expect to open throughout the course of 2024. We estimate this increase at roughly 5% based on where market rents are today at these specific communities, which would provide those deals with about 30 basis points of increased yield as well. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben to wrap things up. Ben Schall Thanks, Matt. Slide 19 provides our key takeaways. We were very pleased with our execution in 2023 and expect to continue to be relatively well-positioned in a year of slower growth in 2024. We will continue to evolve and execute against our strategic focus areas, including harvesting tangible benefits from the investments we are making in the transformation of our operating model and on the capital front, we will remain nimble, adjusting to the environment as it unfolds, while also being on the lookout and ready to take advantage of accretive opportunities that may present themselves this year, opportunities where we can utilize our leading balance sheet and draw upon our unique strategic capabilities. With that, I'll turn it to the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of James Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Feldman: Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. So, I'd like to go back to Slide 14, and I was hoping you could talk us through what your blended rent outlook looks like in each of these regions or broken out by these regions and then if you could talk about how you think it might be different in the first half versus the back half of the year, just given the pace of supply coming online.\nSean Breslin: Yeah, Jamie, this is Sean. Why don't I give you the sort of blended rent change we expect across the portfolio for the year, so that we can talk about all the individual regions. That's a lot of data. We might want to do that offline, but in terms of the broader portfolio, our expectation is to deliver rent change of roughly 2% in 2024, which would reflect renewals at roughly 4% and new move-ins at essentially flat and as it relates to the first half versus the second half, if you think back to 2023, where we achieved 3.4% rent change, a good portion of that rent change, a stronger portion was in the first half of the year. So we do expect to see some acceleration in rent change, all else being equal in the second half of 2024 relative to the first half, assuming that obviously the economic environment is consistent with our expectations.\nJames Feldman: Okay, thank you for that. And then we appreciate the detailed buildup to your revenue and your expense side, but as you think about each of those buckets, where do you think there's the most variability? Where do you have the most opportunity to maybe push a little more? Where do you think you could pull back maybe on the spending side by the time yearend rolls around?\nSean Breslin: Yeah, no, good question. Taking them in the two pieces on the revenue side, obviously a significant driver is the macroeconomic environment and we provided and Ben referred to some of our assumptions. So we are expecting a slowdown given the roughly 2.7 million jobs that were produced in 2023 as compared to the current expectation for '24, being close to 700,000. So that's outside our control, but obviously we're well positioned to the extent things accelerate and we think we're also well positioned somewhat defensively given our portfolio if things deteriorate. So outside of that, I'd say what we would see is a more substantial improvement in bad debt would certainly be a tailwind. Over the last several months, bad debt rate from residents has sort of flattened out a bit and primarily as a result of what's been happening in the court system, residents that are behind getting free legal advice and things of that sort. So we started to see greater improvement in the court system in places like the greater New York region, parts of the mid Atlantic, etcetera, that would certainly give us a significant benefit outside of just the macroeconomic view and whether we were able to push rents harder or softer in the environment. On the expense side, a good portion of it is baked in terms of what we have. There's about two thirds of it are expected year-over-year increase is driven by number one utilities, which is really where our Avalon Connect offering comes through and that's a pretty embedded program we're on plan. We expect that to be where we thought it would be. Property taxes, there's a portion of that related to the pilots, but obviously to the extent assessments come in at different levels or rates throughout the portfolio during the year, that would certainly help us out. The rest of it is kind of ins and outs in different areas, and so I wouldn't expect a significant shift, but there are modest shifts from line item to line item that might move around with, payroll benefits and things like that.\nJames Feldman: Okay, yeah, very helpful. I guess lots to keep our eye on. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Kramer: Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. Just wondering in terms of kind of puts and takes, the $870 million development starts, just kind of what can maybe drive that to the high end? What would cause you to maybe pull back and maybe push some of that out to 2025? And if you think about kind of timing during the year, what's kind of the view on those starts in terms of when they may, just generally take place over the course of the year?\nMatt Birenbaum: Hey, sure, Adam. This is Matt. As it relates to the pace of development starts across the year, it is more back half loaded. I don't think that we maybe have any starts in Q1 or maybe one. So, we'll see how that develops across the course of the year. It really is idiosyncratic, though, based on the timing, permits, buyout of various projects. So, the things that might cause it to ramp up or down is really just changes to the deal economics. If rents accelerate or degrade more quickly than we expect in any particular submarket where we're planning to start a deal or if hard costs surprise us either to the good or the bad, that could cause us to either pull some deals forward and start more or conversely push some deals further out.\nBen Schall: Yeah, Adam, it's Ben. Just to reiterate, some of our key themes from prior conversations, and we remain very focused on the spread between our development yields and underlying market cap rates. That's the value we create, and we need to be appropriately compensated for the development risk and then the other component is obviously where we're raising the capital, both the source of it and the cost of that capital. So those are the higher level elements that we triangulate around, and then there's the deal specifics that Matt referred to.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thanks, guys and just on the January like term effective rent change, I guess the new rent specifically, and not asking you for kind of each of your markets individually, maybe just at a high level if you could display, I don't know if you want to kind of go through West Coast versus East Coast versus kind of Sunbelt, maybe just kind of general trends breaking down that January new lease number I think would be helpful.\nBen Schall: Yeah, why don't I give it to you by Coast. So on the East Coast, we're trending sort of in that low 2% range. The West Coast was modestly positive about 50 basis points, and the expansion region is essentially flat.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Sean, appreciate the same-store revenue growth guidance breakout between the established and expansion markets. I think you referenced that that's primarily supply driving the delta between those two projections, but I guess if you remove some of the bad debt improvement, some of the other initiatives and just focus more so on that lease rate growth piece, how do those two regions stack up versus one another?\nSean Breslin: Yeah, probably the best way to look at it is I refer you back to the slide that we showed the revenue decomposition there and first, what I would say is that reflects, more than 90% of our portfolio coming from the established regions at this point, but in terms of just broader demand supply fundamentals, we definitely expect much better performance out of our established regions, generally speaking. The one, question that we have, I'd say, that we think we've reflected appropriately is in Northern California, which has been weaker for us recently and I think it's just a question of how the job environment unfolds. We think we've modelled that appropriately, but if you look at that slide, you can kind of see what's happening in Northern California. It is not benefiting nearly as much as Southern California in terms of the bad debt contribution. So I think on par, it's a little more reflective of apples-to-apples with our expansion regions. So overall demand-supply much better in the established regions, maybe a little bit of a question around Northern Cal.\nAustin Wurschmidt: And then just, just focused on kind of the urban versus suburban, you continue to kind of talk about this strategic focus of shifting into more suburban markets and sort of a preferred incremental investment there. So what's sort of the expectation for lease rate growth when you look at those two, urban versus suburban, for the year? Thank you.\nBen Schall: Yeah, we haven't broken it out between urban and suburban in terms of the forecast. I can tell you in Q4, we certainly saw better growth out of our suburban portfolio, which was about 200 basis points. The urban portfolio was essentially flat. I did provide sort of the breakout in January as well from East and West, but in terms of urban, suburban, we've not traditionally broken that out. If you look at it on a blended basis, as I mentioned before, it was 2%. If you think across the markets, it's really kind of market specific is more the driver than urban, suburban in many cases. So for example, in the York metro area, we're expecting better growth out of this city and northern New Jersey, less growth really in Westchester, Long Island, Central Jersey. If you go to the Mid Atlantic, it's very different. We're expecting challenged growth in the district, but better growth in Northern Virginia and Suburban Maryland. On the West Coast, fortunately we don't have a lot in urban Seattle, but urban Seattle is pretty rough right now, I would say. More of our north and east side portfolio is performing much better and then generally down in the Bay Area, I think we're all familiar with the challenges in San Francisco. We certainly expect it to lag in a similar theme in LA. So I think you have to kind of go through each market individually to look at it, but that gives you hopefully some color by region.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Do you think that 200 basis points in the fourth quarter is a decent proxy for what you see moving forward in the call it medium term?\nBen Schall: Yeah, I probably wouldn't extrapolate that going forward right at this point. I think it's a good kind of point for where we were in Q4. We do expect based on what I just said, a lot of these suburban markets will hold up better in some of these specific regions, but I wouldn't necessarily count on it being a 200 basis point spread as you move through the full year.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Okay. It sounds like seasonality is a little bit of a factor. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi . Please proceed with your question.\nEric Wolfe: Hey, thanks. I think at your Investor Day you gave an estimate around 175 basis points of annual earnings contribution from your development pipeline. I was hoping you could just give an estimate for the contribution this year and if there's just anything that might be influencing more this year versus a typical year and if it's just going to kind of be maybe a bigger contribution in 2025 as you lease up the communities that are delivering.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yeah, sure. Eric, this is Kevin. It's a good question and perhaps one we're spending a little bit of time on. Up front, I'll give you the punchline and give you a couple of ways to think about the earnings accretion this year from development undergoing lease up that produces an estimate of about $0.18 of accretion per share this year, give or take, which equates to about 170 basis points of earnings growth in 2024, which is consistent with the typical level of earnings growth we get from development in most years and in line with the 150 basis point to 200 basis point earnings contribution to growth that we outlined at Investor Day last November. So maybe just before we begin, a couple of contextual comments, which won't surprise you, but might be helpful just for the broader audience. First, as you know, when you look at our investment in capital activity, we do have a broad set of investment uses, even if development is our primary use of capital, and we have multiple sources of capital. So as a result, since cash is fungible, attributing specific capital sources to specific capital uses to isolate a discrete earnings impact in a period-over-period basis requires making some reasonable estimates and assumptions. Second, as you know, since we substantially match fund our development starts with long-term capital when we start those projects, and we started the $1.6 billion or so of projects under lease up two to three years ago, the reality is that we sourced much of that capital two to three years ago. So third, when you kind of go back and look at the capital we've raised over the last, say, three years, you'd find that to fund the whole business, we raised $2.1 billion at a blended initial cost of 2.9% in '21, $1.5 billion in 2022 at a blended initial cost of 4.1%, and $1.4 billion last year at a blended initial cost of 4.6%. So some portion of the capital in those prior years was used to fund the $1.6 billion that began lease up last year and is being leased up this year as well. Obviously, we have another 850 [ph] that's in the plan for this year at kind of roughly around a 5% cost of capital, which is relevant as you look at sort of earnings growth and so forth for your modelling purposes, and the reality is that capital isn't going to be sourced to pay for the development that's already completed in lease up. And so, as you look at the $1.6 billion in lease up that currently is around a yield of about 6% and if you just conservatively just look at this from an economic point of view, which is sort of the first way to look at this, and say you have $1.6 billion development at a 6% yield, and say it was funded with some portion of the capital, the $3 billion that we raised over the last two years at call an average 4.4% initial cost, you've got about 160 basis points of spread accretion on that development, which translates into about $25.5 million of annualized profit or about $0.18 of annualized growth, which in turn equates to about 170 basis points of earnings growth on last year's core FFO. The reality is kind of using that way, and the reality is that the lease-up profitability started to feather in last year and this year, but that's probably the best way to look at the earnings contribution from the lease-up activity underway by matching it with the capital that we likely applied to it. But if you're looking instead at the earnings impact on a specific calendar year basis this year, for example, against last year, and you're looking at the $0.29 of headwind that we call out on Slide 12 from our capital markets transaction activity and our earnings deck, certainly that may be a little bit longer conversation. Happy to take it offline with you or anyone else, but I think the short answer there is of that $0.29, you can probably attribute about $0.18 of that to funding our investment activity after you subtract the $0.12 associated with the lower interest income this year, ignore the $0.08 from the SIP activity, and then take the $0.11 of financing and refinancing costs and ascribe, say $0.07 of that to the refinancing of $600 million of debt last year and the balance of $0.04 to investment activity. So what you're left with to derive that $0.18 is about $0.05 from share count, $0.05 from net dispo activity, $0.04 from lower capitalized interest expense, and then $0.04 of the $0.11 of refinancing costs and financing costs that you see there in that slide. So that's the way, another way to get at the $0.18 that can give you a sense of comfort that the one way or another what you're looking at is about 150 basis points to 200 basis points of earnings growth contribution from lease up activity this year.\nEric Wolfe: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just a quick one on the capitalized interest guidance. It looks like based on your guidance, the construction progress or development balance is going down by like $200 million. I'm just taking, what the interest is divided by your weighted average interest rate to get to that. But is that the right way to think about it and then I guess why would that balance be going down if it seems like spending is set to accelerate a little bit this year?\nBen Schall: Yeah, no, I think that is the right way to look at it. I don't know the exact number, but we have capitalized interest rate -- interest expense going down by $0.04, which is about $5 million year-over-year and it's at a blended capitalized interest rate of 3.5%. So I think it is going down by a couple $100 million and the reality is we have, and this is the natural ebb and flow of construction and progress. We have more completions this year than deals entering new construction. So that'll oscillate over time and it creates a little bit of a period over period volatility in the capitalized interest expense calculation, but that's just the nature of that. We don't -- we start projects when they're ready to go, not at a completely constant evenable -- even rateable basis over the course of the years and there's a little bit of CIP decline from '23 moving into '24.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon. First, just on a clarification, I think at the Investor Day, you had talked about an earn in of about 1.5% and I think now you're talking about an earn in of 1%. Is the difference strictly just moving from like a September 30 or Q3 to Q4? Or is there something else that kind of went on in that stat?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yeah, that's pretty much it, Steve. If you think about it, a lot of our growth comes through the first nine months of the year, including short-term premiums and other activity that happens in Q2. Excuse me, Q2 and Q3 and then traditionally, it sort of decelerates as you go through Q4 and land in January.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And maybe one for Matt on the development. You talked about the $870 million and the mid-sixes. And it looks like about a third of the starts are going to be in your expansion market. So just how are you sort of sizing that up, just given kind of the supply issues that we're facing in many of the expansion markets today and you've also benefited from basically conservative underwriting with no increase in rents, but rent growth is obviously slowing. So I guess, does the mid-sixes provide much upside going forward if rent growth is relatively flat over the next couple of years?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yeah, Steve, I would say, and as I kind of mentioned in my prepared remarks, there may be less upside. Historically, if you look back over a long period of time, we tend to deliver yields that are 20 basis points to 30 basis points higher than what our initial underwriting is because we don't trend. Now, in the last two years, when rents were rising in double-digit rates in 2021 and 2022, that 20 basis points, 30 basis points was more like 70 basis points or 80 basis points, but that's why now when you look at, say, the deals leasing up this year, they'll have some of that wind at their back, but it's probably back to that kind of 20 basis points to 30 basis points that's more typical. And that's why we feel like there's an adequate margin of safety in there because we're starting them on today's economics with that 100 basis points to 150 basis points spread to current cap rates that Ben referenced. So the two deals we're talking about in expansion regions or the third of the starts this year in the plan happen to be in North Carolina. I think one is in Raleigh, Durham and one is in the Charlotte area and so you have seen rents, market rents in those markets decline a little bit in '23. So based on today's rents, there is more supply coming there. There's obviously strong demand too, and we're investing over the long term. These are 20-year investments, but I would say that margin of safety would suggest that if you start those next year, they're not going to be in lease up for a year and a half, two years after that. We feel pretty confident that we'll be able to hit our NOI numbers, if not still get a little bit of lift.\nBen Schall: The part, Steve, I'd add to that is you think about this cohort of projects. Starts are definitely coming down this year for financing reasons, economic reasons, but deals that we can make sense of and that we can capitalize in an appropriate way have the potential to open up into a pretty nice pocket, pretty nice window when you look out three years from now. So tough to forecast a lot of other variables in there. And as you said, we're conservative in underwriting based on today's environment, but we do keep that in mind as well.\nSteve Sakwa: And just a quick clarification, the $870 million, is that mostly back halfway, did you think, in terms of start to the deliveries or kind of more late '25, maybe even into '26?\nBen Schall: Yeah, that's accurate, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I'm a little bit confused on the earn-in question. So I guess my first question is, can you just let us know how you define that? It's obviously a non-GAAP measure. It's a relatively new metric within this industry, but I thought that the earn-in was kind of locked in at the end of the year on leases you signed last year and what that contributes to revenue growth this year and it doesn't really quite move after that. Your lease growth rates didn't really change during the fourth quarter. So yeah, I'm just questioning how you define that?\nBen Schall: Yeah, John, I think it's footnoted on the slide, but just to be specific, when you start the year, it reflects essentially the rent roll or gross potential is a common term for the month of January relative to the average gross potential or rent roll that we had in place for 2023. So as I mentioned earlier in response to Steve's question, you tend to realize a substantial portion, if not all, of your rent roll growth in the first nine months of the year or so. It accelerates in the spring, peaks in the summer, and then starts to come down in the fall as a result of not only decelerating like-term rent change, but the mix from unlike-term rent change where you burn off short-term premiums and other things. So essentially, in Q4, you don't really see sequentially, if you think about it, any material growth occur during that period of time. So you might have eight months or nine months that you're up kind of an average of a point and a half, like as we were talking about, and the last two or three months is closer to zero and that's how you get closer to kind of the low ones. But we can certainly walk you through it in more detail offline if you like.\nJohn Kim: Yeah, absolutely. I think it's your peers don't define it the same way. So it's worth delving into a little bit. I'll do that offline.\nBen Schall: It's also probably a timing issue. We described the point and a half as kind of where we were spot basis at the end of Q3. I know some companies sort of estimate where they think they might be in January and provide that information on their calls. We tend to provide on a spot basis.\nJohn Kim: Okay. My second question is on your initiatives, including Avalon Connect and the capital spend you have on that. How much of that do you expense versus capitalize?\nBen Schall: For Avalon Connect specifically, the costs associated with those programs are essentially 100% expensed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey, guys. Appreciate all the color on how the Avalon Connect flows to the same-store expenses this year. Could you remind us how it's going to flow through the revenue line item this year and what kind of ramp you're assuming?\nBen Schall: Yeah. Josh, what I would do is refer you back to the slide on the revenue decomposition and that contribution of 80 basis points from other rental revenue. Almost all of it, not all of it, almost all of it is related to Avalon Connect driving other rental revenue up. There's also increasing trash fees and other things that are happening, but most of that increase is related to Avalon Connect.\nJoshua Dennerlein: So, I guess maybe on a quarterly basis, because it looks like one key of a big uptick, and then it kind of drops off. So, just kind of trying to figure out the quarterly cadence.\nBen Schall: Yeah. Why don't we get back to you on that as opposed to going quarter-by-quarter on the call, if that's okay. We'll ramp up as we move through the year, for sure and essentially what happens is, think about it as mirroring lease expirations, because we push that through at the apartment level as leases expire. So that's the way probably to think about how we'll bleed through quarter-to-quarter at a high level.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just curious on a breakdown for expense growth, kind of like, do the subcomponents like utilities, R&M. Could you provide just like your underlying projections for that?\nBen Schall: Yeah. Why don't I give you some high level commentary, since that's a lot of categories to go through on the call, but sort of high level things to think about here; property taxes, overall, we're expecting year-over-year growth sort of in the mid 4% range. A substantial portion of that is being driven by the phase-out of property tax abatement programs, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Insurance, we are expecting another year of kind of double digit growth in insurance, given what's happening in the market, which, we can certainly talk about if you like. As it relates to utilities, Avalon Connect, I just mentioned, we're expecting utilities as a category to be sort of in the low double digit range and again, almost all of that is related to Avalon Connect. Core utilities are actually quite modest in terms of growth rate and a couple others maybe to mention are on the payroll side. We've essentially got a merit increase of 4%. That's about 90% of payroll. Benefits are going up about 6%. So those two combined are 420 basis points, but we're picking up about 100 basis points from our payroll reductions. So that will net out in the low threes and then the only other thing of note I would say, really, that's a little unusual, is in our office operations category, it's accounting for 20 basis points, 25 basis points of total expense growth, really related to legal and eviction costs that were somewhat elevated last year. We expect them to be elevated a little bit more this year as we continue to process people who are non-paying residents. So those are some sort of high level comments. Hopefully those are helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern: Yeah, thanks, everybody. Can you just talk about how the start of the year has looked so far versus the kind of normal trends for demand, rent growth off the seasonal trough, etcetera?\nBen Schall: Yeah, happy to take that one, Brad, pretty much consistent with what we've outlined in terms of our outlook. And I would say relative to historical norms for January growth, it's modestly below. Sort of if you look at the change in asking rent in the month of January, say, for the five years pre-COVID as compared to this January, asking rents are trending up just at a slightly lower growth rate.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, got it. And then I know you get the blends already, but I was curious if you could give the underlying assumption for market rent growth across the portfolio in '24.\nBen Schall: Yeah, we're expecting average asking rent growth throughout the year to be sort of in that 2.25% to 2.5% range and actual rent change in the portfolio would be roughly 2%.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You use a macro scenario from NAI [ph] of like about it seems like 1% GDP growth and 55,000 jobs per month. How sensitive is the rent growth to kind of your underlying macro forecast? Like said, another way, if the economy is better, how much more rent growth can you get in 2024? Thank you.\nSean Breslin: Yeah, Michael, this is Sean. A little bit of a complex answer to that because it depends on a lot of assumptions. The things you would think about are how significantly different is it from our baseline forecast in terms of job and wage growth and where does it occur and when does it occur? So if we see acceleration, but it happens in August, it doesn't do a lot for us because we will have signed leases, through July, offers are out for August, September, October in some markets. So I would say it probably helps you as a better setup for 2025 if you saw that happen in the second half of the year. If we saw a significant acceleration in the macro environment in the next 60 days, as an example, beyond what we forecasted, that should play out better for us as we get into peak leasing season. I think you just have to remember that if silver market move in to market, kind of 30 days before they move in, as an example, but those renewal offers are in most markets from a regulatory standpoint, they're out 60 days to 90 days in advance and once it's out, you're not going back and saying, oops, sorry, I'm going to change rent and move it up.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. That's helpful. And then just based on current conditions, how far along do you think that we are in post-COVID recovery in the Northern California and Seattle regions?\nBen Schall: Yeah, good question. When I talk about it in the context of maybe rent basis, I would say Northern California is still a long ways to go. We have rents that are essentially asking rents today that are down roughly 10% from pre-COVID peak levels. That's primarily driven by San Francisco being 12%, 13% below peak, which is, that's a pretty significant number and what I would say is that while I think we're seeing some green shoots in San Francisco in terms of what's happening with, say AI as an example, there's a long ways to go in terms of getting the sort of quality of the built environment at a place where people are comfortable, office leaders, business leaders, kind of calling people back to the office and/or people wanting to migrate to the city and be able to feel comfortable with what they're doing. So I'd say there is a lag there. How long it takes to play out, I think these things take a fair bit of time when you're talking about quality of life issues, crime issues, things of that sort. So I don't think this is necessarily a couple quarter type of issue. I think there's several quarters, depending on the political will of what happens to actually see it sort of trend the right direction for us in a more meaningful way. In terms of Seattle, I think a couple of things to think about as it relates to Seattle. Seattle rent levels for us are up about 8% from pre-COVID peak levels, but it is a very bifurcated market. The urban core of Seattle, whether it's right downtown, stuff like Union, Capitol, etcetera are much more challenged because of not only the quality of life issues that I mentioned that you have in San Francisco also in play there, but there is a meaningful amount of supply being delivered more in '24 than was delivered in 2023, which will compound the issue versus if you're mainly suburban, north end, east side, you're much more well-positioned. That's where the majority of our assets are in Seattle.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Anderson with Wedbush. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Anderson: Thanks. Good afternoon. Sort of an open-ended question, but see if you can get a response out of you. New York Community Bank yesterday had its debacle. Former Signature Bank, both of them had multifamily as part of their problem in terms of own losses and whatnot. I think we have to distinguish between rent regulated and market rate, but still, and rent regulated is really what's causing the problem. But I'm curious if you're seeing anything new on the ground from your point of view. Perhaps this creates business, sort of growth opportunities for you, but are there operating disruptions that are happening in neighboring assets as a result of all this, just sort of bad operating behaviors and kind of a distress situation? Are you seeing anything along those lines that we should be concerned about from this banking perspective, lending perspective?\nBen Schall: Rich, we are not seeing significant distress in the system. You know, there obviously is the potential wave of maturities that's being highlighted by folks. For the most part, at least in our markets and the assets that we're spending time in and around, we're seeing lenders agree to extend out loans. We're seeing equity step in and put up more capital. Now, not all debt providers and equity providers are able to do that. So that does create the potential for some dislocation, but we're not necessarily seeing it of size. I'd say we're preparing to be ready to take advantage of it, but not seeing it at this point. Operationally, you know, the theme I would take you to is look back over, I don't know, this last cycle, last decade, world of capital being homogeneous. Capital is flowing to all types of players and generally is flowing at a similar cost to all types of players and so as we think about positioning going forward, there is an element of thinking about how we take advantage or step in opportunities for assets that are being operated by, less sophisticated players, players with less scale. And I'll kind of end on the theme of as we're thinking about the opportunity set out there, it is a combination of both places where we can bring our balance sheet to bear and bring our strategic capabilities to bear and we've spent a lot of time on our operating model transformation. It's got two impacts. It's one, it helps us drive internal growth, but we're also bringing those operational capabilities to our external growth.\nRich Anderson: Great, great color. Thanks for that, Ben. Second question for me, you mentioned, and we all know 2X the amount of supply in the Sunbelt versus your established regions and yet you're still predicting positive revenue growth in your expansion markets and I think it was said January new lease rent growth in the Sunbelt is flat, not even negative. Maybe I got that wrong, but nonetheless, it sounds resilient from a dollar's perspective, despite the supply. Is that a good way to look at it? Relatively resilient, I should say. And/or are you thinking, well, 2025 could be materially worse in the Sunbelt as sort of the supply picture builds on itself and starts to impact revenue maybe to a greater degree next year versus this year? Is that the way you kind of think about the Sunbelt today?\nSean Breslin: Yeah, Rich, this is Sean. But why don't we kind of parse the conversation into our portfolio versus the Sunbelt more broadly? What I indicated for our expansion regions in January is that blended rent change is essentially flat. If you were to parse that between move-ins and renewals, what you would see is that new move-ins are negative in the expansion regions down about 150 basis points as compared to kind of low to mid 3% sort of renewals. What I would tell you is that's primarily driven by some assets that we own in Charlotte in the South End, there are three assets that we acquired in that market a couple of years ago at a time where we loved the environment, great long-term neighbourhood, but we knew there was a fair amount of supply coming, sort of underwrote it that way. We're seeing the impact of that supply currently, as opposed to, say, Denver, where most of the pain and suffering is in the sort of urban core, much more significant pain and suffering given the volume of supply as compared to our broadly distributed portfolio across the suburban markets. So our portfolio, you kind of really, not a lot of assets. You really have to look region by region to understand it. What I would say more broadly about the Sunbelt, though, is certainly when you think about negative rent change playing through and what it does to revenue and NOI, the first thing that typically happens when you get into a much more competitive environment is people are starting to have weaker occupancy. We saw that happen in 2023 in terms of the leg down in occupancy, both in our established regions in the Sunbelt, but much more significant in the Sunbelt. That starts translating to much heavier discounting in terms of where people are marking their rents to try and occupy those units because some rent's better than none. That's what we've started to see in the last few months here and we'd expect that to continue as you roll through 2024 as those leases expire. So the most significant impact on both revenue and NOI would likely be, all else being equal, 2025 as you roll all those leases through the rent roll to that lower market rent. That's probably when you're going to see the most pronounced impact would be our view.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good afternoon. Two questions. First, maybe just continuing on with Rich's line of questioning, as you guys look to the Sunbelt, it looks like most of your product, I think, is more suburban. So is that is basically as you assess opportunities in the expansion markets, are you really just looking only at suburban or are you looking at urban and what I mean by that is it seems that a number of the urban markets in the Sunbelt have the same issues that we have in the urban coastal cities, meaning people don't necessarily need to live right next to the office or there may be life quality issues, etcetera. Whereas in the suburbs, it seems more fit for Avalon's development model and also closer to recreation and sort of a quote unquote, easier lifestyle, if you will. So just sort of curious how you're shaping out your Sunbelt strategy of urban versus suburban.\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure. Hey, Alex, it's Matt. I would generally tend to agree with you that we are very focused on suburban submarkets. We're focused on our acquisition efforts on suburban submarkets, which have less supply and/or product that is not priced at the very top of the market, because that's a price point we can't really access through new development, but we can access through acquisitions and also, we're also focused on garden product because it's simpler to operate and these are markets with higher property taxes and therefore lower operating margins and one thing that kind of helps counteract that a little bit is garden product, where at least you don't have some of the same operating cost overhang that you would have in, say, high rise assets. So we are we are tending to favor suburban submarkets and I think when you look at the portfolios we've got so far in the expansion regions, they are actually outperforming those markets as a whole because of the assets that we own in the submarkets that we owned and Sean mentioned maybe one of the bigger exceptions, which is the south end of Charlotte, but that's -- those are almost the only urban assets we've got so far that we've bought so far in the expansion regions.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay, and the second question is in the fourth quarter, it looks like you guys wrote off four development deals for $9 million in aggregate, but nothing changed in the pipeline that is the projects that are underway. So maybe just a little bit more color on it sounds like these deals were really in their infancy, but just maybe some color around what caused you to scotch these deals and where they may have been located.\nBen Schall: Yeah, sure, Alex. We did have elevated write offs in '23 in general, and I think that's just a reflection of the fact that we have been as we've been talking about adapting our pipeline to reflect the changes in the economic realities, as asset values have dropped and cap rates have increased. So we're generally very focused on risk management. We keep a close eye on capitalized pursuit costs in every one of our deals. And our risk management has actually been one of the keys to us being able to develop profitably across multiple cycles over, really our 30-year history as a public company, 35-year. The write-offs this past quarter, actually, there was one project in Denver actually was an Urban Denver kind of getting back to your first point. The other one was a public private deal in California, and we've had a number of those where, the economics have just changed sufficiently that we didn't necessarily see a path to in many cases, we are able to recut the deal and get a path to a revised deal that does make sense. In those particular cases, that wasn't the case. So we had to let those go, but I would also just taken a big step back here that if you look at our total book of development rights, we currently have land on the balance sheet of $199 million and we have another $67 million in capitalized pursuit costs. So that's $265 million in total and we're controlling opportunity to build about 11,000 units with that investment, which is pretty strong leverage on that pursuit capital and I think, compares favorably to a lot of other both public and private players in the space. So it's that's kind of where it sits today and I'd say that we've gotten through a lot of the deals that were underwater and when we look at our pipeline going forward, we feel pretty good about it.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Linda Sye [ph] with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Hi, thank you. With new rent growth in January at negative 1.9%, how much more negative with that trend and at what point might it turn positive if you're ending '24 flat?\nBen Schall: Yeah, good question. What I would say is seasonally, rents start to pick up in January. Rent growth typically accelerates asking rent growth, this is as you move through the spring and into the summer. So typically what you would see is this would be sort of the low point of the year, kind of December, January, and then things would improve from here. So certainly, I mentioned, we're talking about basically getting flat for the year. So, we've got several months here where it will continue to improve, flatten out and then probably as we get to Q4, you would see it come back down and go slightly negative again, which is not uncommon in this kind of an environment. So you start to see sort of positive numbers as you get into Q2 and Q3.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Thanks for that. And then on Avalon Connect with associated costs going away and revenues coming online, if you want to isolate the impact of that for NOI [ph], like how much would that benefit '25 NOI growth?\nBen Schall: Yeah, we're not providing any guidance as it relates to 2025 at this point. I did indicate what it was for 2024 as it relates to revenue and the impact on OpEx in my comments, my prepared remarks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey there, good afternoon. Two questions for me. First is a follow up on your comments earlier in San Fran, Seattle. Can you outline what your blended rent expectations for the two markets are this year? It seems like your client Seattle is creeping over into the east side and Bellevue, where you have more relative exposure while demand and pricing power still seems pretty evasive in San Fran and maybe some color on the level of concession you're offering as well as what you're seeing competitors offer in those markets. Thanks.\nSean Breslin: Yeah, Haendel, this is Sean. We haven't provided the market level detail for 2024, but thank you for some recent trend data. That's helpful. So for Q4 of 2023, Northern California overall blended rent change was down 2.8%, which is essentially down seven on new move ins and positive roughly 2.5% on renewals. In terms of Seattle, new move ins were down about 200 basis points and actually renewals were up about 200 basis points. I'm sorry, I misquoted that. The blended was 200 basis points. It was down one nine on new move ins and plus five nine on renewals and so we started to see a pickup in Seattle more recently, again, in that suburban kind of northeast east side sub markets, not downtown, which has been positive. People coming back to work from Microsoft and Amazon in particular having an impact on that and what I would say is we are more optimistic as it relates to what we expect in Seattle, given our portfolio in the Seattle market in 2024 as compared to Northern California for the reasons I mentioned earlier.\nHaendel St. Juste: Any color on the impact of supply in Bellevue and any color on the concessions?\nSean Breslin: Yeah, in terms of the supply, Bellevue has actually been holding up quite well. Most of our portfolio, if you think of it, we have North End, we have a pretty core portfolio in downtown Bellevue and then also in Redmond. Redmond has actually been a little bit softer with the supply as compared to Bellevue, but I think it's related to concessions overall across the portfolio is most of the concessions that we experienced in Q4. More than 50% came from the combination of Seattle and Northern California, more skewed to Northern California for us relative to Seattle and it really is a sub market by sub market discussion. I'd say the most competitive sub markets in Seattle are two to three months free and that's urban core assets in lease-up today and are really close competitors. In the Bay Area, maybe two months would be the high end in Q4 is what we've seen and that's tapered a little bit in January, but pretty similar. So it really is kind of sub market by sub market assessment as to what you see.\nHaendel St. Juste: I got it. Thank you for that. And last one, just speaking overall on the transaction market, I'm curious, how do you characterize your conversation of late with potential sellers and their cap rate IRR expectations with some hopeful distinction between coastal and the Sunbelt? I was at National Multihousing this week as well, and it seemed to be still a fairly wide bid ask spread with buyers sticking to their guns and some waiting to sell in the back of this year and hoping that lower interest rates would drive lower cap rates. So curious kind of how those conversations are going. Cap rate IRR expectations in any color on coastal versus Sunbelt. Thanks.\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure. Hey, Haendel, it's Matt. Yeah, there's still, I would agree, there's still pretty significant bid ask spread for many assets. We tend to describe it as a market of haves and have-nots and there are lots of assets that would fall into the have not category because those are only going to transact if the cap rate is significantly north of the debt rate and the buyer can get positive arbitrage and so that would be tertiary markets, that would be some out of favor sub markets and, I don't know if it's so much coastal versus Sunbelt as it is kind of primary markets versus secondary tertiary markets in terms of that distinction. There's still plenty of interest in certain Sunbelt markets for sure. The assets that are trading, there is money that seems anxious to get going and, what we're hearing anyway is the cap rate now has to at least be in the fives, and there's some debate about what the year one underwriting is, because in some markets, obviously, NOI is starting to decline. So that makes it a little tricky as well. But, I would expect you're going to start to see some transactions get signed up here in the next two months to three months at cap rates, maybe somewhere between five and five and a half. That's a pretty big range, but again, only for assets that are considered highly desirable.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Ben Schall for closing remarks.\nBen Schall: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today and we look forward to connecting with you over the coming months.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "All right, great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to Slide 17, we're planning another year of accretive activity across all of our various investment platforms in 2024. We expect to break ground on seven new developments, representing $870 million of investment at a weighted average yield in the mid-6% range, grow our SIP business by another $75 million with rates on new originations in excess of 12% and expand our investments in our existing portfolio that we discussed a bit at our Investor Day, where we see opportunity to further increase our activity to roughly $100 million at yields of roughly 10%. In the investment sales market, activity levels are still low, but most market participants do expect a gradual increase in transactions as the year progresses. Our plan is to access this market as part of our portfolio management strategy, selling assets in our established regions and redeploying that capital into acquisitions in our expansion regions. We expect this activity to be roughly neutral on both a volume and return basis, buying and selling in equal amounts and at equivalent yields. As Ben mentioned, the dynamics of this trading activity look to be more favorable in '24 than they might have been in the recent past, as some short-term operating challenges in our targeted expansion regions may present the opportunity to acquire assets significantly below replacement cost. Of course, the market for all of our investment activities is highly dynamic, and we are prepared to pivot and adjust our plan in response to potential changes in the macro environment as the year evolves. Turning to our existing development underway, Slide 18 details the impressive results that continue to be generated by our current lease-ups. The four development communities that had active leasing in Q4 are delivering rents $260 per month, or 8.4% above our initial underwriting, which is translating into a 20-basis point increase in yield. As a reminder, in general, the rents we quote on our developments are current market rents as of the time we break ground, and we do not trend or update these rents until we achieve significant actual leasing velocity close to completion of the project. While market rents certainly didn't grow as much in 2023 as in prior years, there is still some lift to come when we mark the rents to market on the $855 million of lease-ups we expect to open throughout the course of 2024. We estimate this increase at roughly 5% based on where market rents are today at these specific communities, which would provide those deals with about 30 basis points of increased yield as well. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben to wrap things up. Ben Schall Thanks, Matt. Slide 19 provides our key takeaways. We were very pleased with our execution in 2023 and expect to continue to be relatively well-positioned in a year of slower growth in 2024. We will continue to evolve and execute against our strategic focus areas, including harvesting tangible benefits from the investments we are making in the transformation of our operating model and on the capital front, we will remain nimble, adjusting to the environment as it unfolds, while also being on the lookout and ready to take advantage of accretive opportunities that may present themselves this year, opportunities where we can utilize our leading balance sheet and draw upon our unique strategic capabilities. With that, I'll turn it to the operator to open the line for questions. Hey, sure, Adam. This is Matt. As it relates to the pace of development starts across the year, it is more back half loaded. I don't think that we maybe have any starts in Q1 or maybe one. So, we'll see how that develops across the course of the year. It really is idiosyncratic, though, based on the timing, permits, buyout of various projects. So, the things that might cause it to ramp up or down is really just changes to the deal economics. If rents accelerate or degrade more quickly than we expect in any particular submarket where we're planning to start a deal or if hard costs surprise us either to the good or the bad, that could cause us to either pull some deals forward and start more or conversely push some deals further out. Sure. Hey, Alex, it's Matt. I would generally tend to agree with you that we are very focused on suburban submarkets. We're focused on our acquisition efforts on suburban submarkets, which have less supply and/or product that is not priced at the very top of the market, because that's a price point we can't really access through new development, but we can access through acquisitions and also, we're also focused on garden product because it's simpler to operate and these are markets with higher property taxes and therefore lower operating margins and one thing that kind of helps counteract that a little bit is garden product, where at least you don't have some of the same operating cost overhang that you would have in, say, high rise assets. So we are we are tending to favor suburban submarkets and I think when you look at the portfolios we've got so far in the expansion regions, they are actually outperforming those markets as a whole because of the assets that we own in the submarkets that we owned and Sean mentioned maybe one of the bigger exceptions, which is the south end of Charlotte, but that's -- those are almost the only urban assets we've got so far that we've bought so far in the expansion regions. Sure. Hey, Haendel, it's Matt. Yeah, there's still, I would agree, there's still pretty significant bid ask spread for many assets.

            "name": "Kevin O'Shea",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben. On Slide 11, we provide our operating and financial outlook for 2024. For the year, using the midpoint of guidance, we expect 1.4% growth in core FFO per share, driven by our same store portfolio and by stabilizing lease-up communities, partially offset by the impact of capital markets and transaction activity, as well as by slightly higher overhead costs. In our same-store residential portfolio, we expect revenue growth of 2.6% and NOI growth of 1.25% for the year and for our capital plan, we anticipate total capital uses of $1.4 billion in 2024, consisting of $1.1 billion in investment spend and $300 million in debt maturities. For our capital sources, we expect to benefit from nearly $400 million in projected free cash flow after dividends and to source $850 million in new capital, which we currently assume will be unsecured debt issued later this year. In this regard, thanks to our balance sheet strength and our A minus and A3 credit rating, we enjoy attractively priced debt today at around 5% on a 10-year unsecured debt that we can invest in development yielding in the mid-sixth range to support future earnings growth. We also project drawing upon $175 million or the $400 million in unrestricted cash on hand at yearend 2023, resulting in projected unrestricted cash at the end of this year of about $225 million. On Slide 12, we illustrate the components of our expected 1.4% growth in core FFO per share. We expect $0.15 per share of earnings growth to come from NOI growth in our same-store sources of growth with a $0.29 impact from capital markets in transaction activities. And with that summary of our outlook, I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss our operating business. Yeah, sure. Eric, this is Kevin. It's a good question and perhaps one we're spending a little bit of time on. Up front, I'll give you the punchline and give you a couple of ways to think about the earnings accretion this year from development undergoing lease up that produces an estimate of about $0.18 of accretion per share this year, give or take, which equates to about 170 basis points of earnings growth in 2024, which is consistent with the typical level of earnings growth we get from development in most years and in line with the 150 basis point to 200 basis point earnings contribution to growth that we outlined at Investor Day last November. So maybe just before we begin, a couple of contextual comments, which won't surprise you, but might be helpful just for the broader audience. First, as you know, when you look at our investment in capital activity, we do have a broad set of investment uses, even if development is our primary use of capital, and we have multiple sources of capital. So as a result, since cash is fungible, attributing specific capital sources to specific capital uses to isolate a discrete earnings impact in a period-over-period basis requires making some reasonable estimates and assumptions. Second, as you know, since we substantially match fund our development starts with long-term capital when we start those projects, and we started the $1.6 billion or so of projects under lease up two to three years ago, the reality is that we sourced much of that capital two to three years ago. So third, when you kind of go back and look at the capital we've raised over the last, say, three years, you'd find that to fund the whole business, we raised $2.1 billion at a blended initial cost of 2.9% in '21, $1.5 billion in 2022 at a blended initial cost of 4.1%, and $1.4 billion last year at a blended initial cost of 4.6%. So some portion of the capital in those prior years was used to fund the $1.6 billion that began lease up last year and is being leased up this year as well. Obviously, we have another 850 [ph] that's in the plan for this year at kind of roughly around a 5% cost of capital, which is relevant as you look at sort of earnings growth and so forth for your modelling purposes, and the reality is that capital isn't going to be sourced to pay for the development that's already completed in lease up. And so, as you look at the $1.6 billion in lease up that currently is around a yield of about 6% and if you just conservatively just look at this from an economic point of view, which is sort of the first way to look at this, and say you have $1.6 billion development at a 6% yield, and say it was funded with some portion of the capital, the $3 billion that we raised over the last two years at call an average 4.4% initial cost, you've got about 160 basis points of spread accretion on that development, which translates into about $25.5 million of annualized profit or about $0.18 of annualized growth, which in turn equates to about 170 basis points of earnings growth on last year's core FFO. The reality is kind of using that way, and the reality is that the lease-up profitability started to feather in last year and this year, but that's probably the best way to look at the earnings contribution from the lease-up activity underway by matching it with the capital that we likely applied to it. But if you're looking instead at the earnings impact on a specific calendar year basis this year, for example, against last year, and you're looking at the $0.29 of headwind that we call out on Slide 12 from our capital markets transaction activity and our earnings deck, certainly that may be a little bit longer conversation. Happy to take it offline with you or anyone else, but I think the short answer there is of that $0.29, you can probably attribute about $0.18 of that to funding our investment activity after you subtract the $0.12 associated with the lower interest income this year, ignore the $0.08 from the SIP activity, and then take the $0.11 of financing and refinancing costs and ascribe, say $0.07 of that to the refinancing of $600 million of debt last year and the balance of $0.04 to investment activity. So what you're left with to derive that $0.18 is about $0.05 from share count, $0.05 from net dispo activity, $0.04 from lower capitalized interest expense, and then $0.04 of the $0.11 of refinancing costs and financing costs that you see there in that slide. So that's the way, another way to get at the $0.18 that can give you a sense of comfort that the one way or another what you're looking at is about 150 basis points to 200 basis points of earnings growth contribution from lease up activity this year. Yeah, that's pretty much it, Steve. If you think about it, a lot of our growth comes through the first nine months of the year, including short-term premiums and other activity that happens in Q2. Excuse me, Q2 and Q3 and then traditionally, it sort of decelerates as you go through Q4 and land in January. Yeah, Steve, I would say, and as I kind of mentioned in my prepared remarks, there may be less upside. Historically, if you look back over a long period of time, we tend to deliver yields that are 20 basis points to 30 basis points higher than what our initial underwriting is because we don't trend. Now, in the last two years, when rents were rising in double-digit rates in 2021 and 2022, that 20 basis points, 30 basis points was more like 70 basis points or 80 basis points, but that's why now when you look at, say, the deals leasing up this year, they'll have some of that wind at their back, but it's probably back to that kind of 20 basis points to 30 basis points that's more typical. And that's why we feel like there's an adequate margin of safety in there because we're starting them on today's economics with that 100 basis points to 150 basis points spread to current cap rates that Ben referenced. So the two deals we're talking about in expansion regions or the third of the starts this year in the plan happen to be in North Carolina. I think one is in Raleigh, Durham and one is in the Charlotte area and so you have seen rents, market rents in those markets decline a little bit in '23. So based on today's rents, there is more supply coming there. There's obviously strong demand too, and we're investing over the long term. These are 20-year investments, but I would say that margin of safety would suggest that if you start those next year, they're not going to be in lease up for a year and a half, two years after that. We feel pretty confident that we'll be able to hit our NOI numbers, if not still get a little bit of lift."

            "content": "All right, thanks, Kevin. Turning to Slide 13, three primary drivers will support same-store revenue growth in 2024. First, embedded rent roll growth of 1%, down approximately 50 basis points from where it was at the end of Q3 2023, which is consistent with historical trends, plus incremental lease rate growth throughout the year. Second, an outsized contribution of roughly 80 basis points from the projected 13% increase in other rental revenue, which is derived from our operating initiatives and third, about a 60 basis point improvement in underlying bad debt from residents from 2.4% in 2023 to an expected 1.8% in 2024. The cumulative growth from those three primary drivers is expected to be partially offset by a 30 basis point headwind from the projected $6 million year-over-year reduction of rent relief and a modest drag from net concessions and economic occupancy. To provide a little more detail on underlying bad debt trends from residents, we're expecting a 60 basis point improvement year-over-year, our forecast reflects an underlying bad debt rate of roughly 1.6% at year-end 2024, which is still more than double our historical pre-COVID rate. Moving to Slide 14, we expect revenue growth in our established regions to be more than double that of our expansion regions, which is primarily a function of the substantially lower level of new supply in the established regions and within our established regions, we expect better demand supply fundamentals on the East Coast as compared to the West Coast. Southern California is expected to produce the strongest same-store revenue growth, which is primarily the result of a substantial improvement in underlying bad debt on a year-over-year basis. Transitioning to Slide 15 to address our operating model transformation, we're tremendously proud of our team's focus and efforts over the last couple years, which have produced approximately $27 million in incremental NOI. We expect to recognize another roughly $9 million benefit in our consolidated portfolio during 2024. The key drivers in 2024 include Avalon Connect, our bulk Internet and managed Wi-Fi deployments, along with smart access features. In addition, we expect an incremental benefit from our shift to a new organizational model, which reflects neighborhood staffing supported by centralized teams. While we have specific plans for 2024, our focus in these areas and others will continue to deliver additional value for associates, residents and shareholders for years to come. Turning to Slide 16 to address our same-store operating expense outlook, we expect roughly 340 basis points of organic expense growth, another approximately 140 basis points from profitable operating initiatives, and roughly 75 basis points from the expiration of various tax abatement programs in the portfolio, primarily in New York City. As it relates to our initiatives, the 140 basis point increase is driven by 170 basis points from our Avalon Connect offering, which I mentioned earlier, partially offset by reductions in payroll. As I've noted in the past, the deployment of our Avalon Connect offering, which will ultimately enhance portfolio NOI by more than $30 million, will pressure expense growth during the deployment period. We expect to be fully deployed by the end of 2024, so the operating expense impact will diminish materially as we move into 2025. So now I'll turn it over to Matt to address our capital allocation activity. Matt? Yeah, Jamie, this is Sean. Why don't I give you the sort of blended rent change we expect across the portfolio for the year, so that we can talk about all the individual regions. That's a lot of data. We might want to do that offline, but in terms of the broader portfolio, our expectation is to deliver rent change of roughly 2% in 2024, which would reflect renewals at roughly 4% and new move-ins at essentially flat and as it relates to the first half versus the second half, if you think back to 2023, where we achieved 3.4% rent change, a good portion of that rent change, a stronger portion was in the first half of the year. So we do expect to see some acceleration in rent change, all else being equal in the second half of 2024 relative to the first half, assuming that obviously the economic environment is consistent with our expectations. Yeah, no, good question. Taking them in the two pieces on the revenue side, obviously a significant driver is the macroeconomic environment and we provided and Ben referred to some of our assumptions. So we are expecting a slowdown given the roughly 2.7 million jobs that were produced in 2023 as compared to the current expectation for '24, being close to 700,000. So that's outside our control, but obviously we're well positioned to the extent things accelerate and we think we're also well positioned somewhat defensively given our portfolio if things deteriorate. So outside of that, I'd say what we would see is a more substantial improvement in bad debt would certainly be a tailwind. Over the last several months, bad debt rate from residents has sort of flattened out a bit and primarily as a result of what's been happening in the court system, residents that are behind getting free legal advice and things of that sort. So we started to see greater improvement in the court system in places like the greater New York region, parts of the mid Atlantic, etcetera, that would certainly give us a significant benefit outside of just the macroeconomic view and whether we were able to push rents harder or softer in the environment. On the expense side, a good portion of it is baked in terms of what we have. There's about two thirds of it are expected year-over-year increase is driven by number one utilities, which is really where our Avalon Connect offering comes through and that's a pretty embedded program we're on plan. We expect that to be where we thought it would be. Property taxes, there's a portion of that related to the pilots, but obviously to the extent assessments come in at different levels or rates throughout the portfolio during the year, that would certainly help us out. The rest of it is kind of ins and outs in different areas, and so I wouldn't expect a significant shift, but there are modest shifts from line item to line item that might move around with, payroll benefits and things like that. Yeah, probably the best way to look at it is I refer you back to the slide that we showed the revenue decomposition there and first, what I would say is that reflects, more than 90% of our portfolio coming from the established regions at this point, but in terms of just broader demand supply fundamentals, we definitely expect much better performance out of our established regions, generally speaking. The one, question that we have, I'd say, that we think we've reflected appropriately is in Northern California, which has been weaker for us recently and I think it's just a question of how the job environment unfolds. We think we've modelled that appropriately, but if you look at that slide, you can kind of see what's happening in Northern California. It is not benefiting nearly as much as Southern California in terms of the bad debt contribution. So I think on par, it's a little more reflective of apples-to-apples with our expansion regions. So overall demand-supply much better in the established regions, maybe a little bit of a question around Northern Cal. Yeah, Michael, this is Sean. A little bit of a complex answer to that because it depends on a lot of assumptions. The things you would think about are how significantly different is it from our baseline forecast in terms of job and wage growth and where does it occur and when does it occur? So if we see acceleration, but it happens in August, it doesn't do a lot for us because we will have signed leases, through July, offers are out for August, September, October in some markets. So I would say it probably helps you as a better setup for 2025 if you saw that happen in the second half of the year. If we saw a significant acceleration in the macro environment in the next 60 days, as an example, beyond what we forecasted, that should play out better for us as we get into peak leasing season. I think you just have to remember that if silver market move in to market, kind of 30 days before they move in, as an example, but those renewal offers are in most markets from a regulatory standpoint, they're out 60 days to 90 days in advance and once it's out, you're not going back and saying, oops, sorry, I'm going to change rent and move it up. Yeah, Rich, this is Sean. But why don't we kind of parse the conversation into our portfolio versus the Sunbelt more broadly? What I indicated for our expansion regions in January is that blended rent change is essentially flat. If you were to parse that between move-ins and renewals, what you would see is that new move-ins are negative in the expansion regions down about 150 basis points as compared to kind of low to mid 3% sort of renewals. What I would tell you is that's primarily driven by some assets that we own in Charlotte in the South End, there are three assets that we acquired in that market a couple of years ago at a time where we loved the environment, great long-term neighbourhood, but we knew there was a fair amount of supply coming, sort of underwrote it that way. We're seeing the impact of that supply currently, as opposed to, say, Denver, where most of the pain and suffering is in the sort of urban core, much more significant pain and suffering given the volume of supply as compared to our broadly distributed portfolio across the suburban markets. So our portfolio, you kind of really, not a lot of assets. You really have to look region by region to understand it. What I would say more broadly about the Sunbelt, though, is certainly when you think about negative rent change playing through and what it does to revenue and NOI, the first thing that typically happens when you get into a much more competitive environment is people are starting to have weaker occupancy. We saw that happen in 2023 in terms of the leg down in occupancy, both in our established regions in the Sunbelt, but much more significant in the Sunbelt. That starts translating to much heavier discounting in terms of where people are marking their rents to try and occupy those units because some rent's better than none. That's what we've started to see in the last few months here and we'd expect that to continue as you roll through 2024 as those leases expire. So the most significant impact on both revenue and NOI would likely be, all else being equal, 2025 as you roll all those leases through the rent roll to that lower market rent. That's probably when you're going to see the most pronounced impact would be our view. Yeah, Haendel, this is Sean. We haven't provided the market level detail for 2024, but thank you for some recent trend data. That's helpful. So for Q4 of 2023, Northern California overall blended rent change was down 2.8%, which is essentially down seven on new move ins and positive roughly 2.5% on renewals. In terms of Seattle, new move ins were down about 200 basis points and actually renewals were up about 200 basis points. I'm sorry, I misquoted that. The blended was 200 basis points. It was down one nine on new move ins and plus five nine on renewals and so we started to see a pickup in Seattle more recently, again, in that suburban kind of northeast east side sub markets, not downtown, which has been positive. People coming back to work from Microsoft and Amazon in particular having an impact on that and what I would say is we are more optimistic as it relates to what we expect in Seattle, given our portfolio in the Seattle market in 2024 as compared to Northern California for the reasons I mentioned earlier. Yeah, in terms of the supply, Bellevue has actually been holding up quite well. Most of our portfolio, if you think of it, we have North End, we have a pretty core portfolio in downtown Bellevue and then also in Redmond. Redmond has actually been a little bit softer with the supply as compared to Bellevue, but I think it's related to concessions overall across the portfolio is most of the concessions that we experienced in Q4. More than 50% came from the combination of Seattle and Northern California, more skewed to Northern California for us relative to Seattle and it really is a sub market by sub market discussion. I'd say the most competitive sub markets in Seattle are two to three months free and that's urban core assets in lease-up today and are really close competitors. In the Bay Area, maybe two months would be the high end in Q4 is what we've seen and that's tapered a little bit in January, but pretty similar. So it really is kind of sub market by sub market assessment as to what you see."

            "name": "Ben Schall",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason. I am joined today by Kevin O'Shea, our CFO; Matt Birenbaum, our Chief Investment Officer and Sean Breslin, our Chief Operating Officer. We'd like to start by thanking our 3,000 AvalonBay Associates for delivering exceptional results in 2023. Your efforts and dedication are what make it happen, and your commitment to our purpose and culture makes us who we are as an organization. Thank you. As a brief recap on last year, as shown on Slide four, we achieved 8.6% core FFO growth for the year, a testament to our ability to grow earnings through unique internal and external drivers. Through the proactive management of our assets, same-store revenue ended the year up 6.3%, and NOI increased by 6.2%. For external growth, our developments underway continue to outperform with $575 million of completions across six projects, delivering outside stabilized yields of 7.1%. We're particularly proud of the results from our operating model transformation, where we are delivering enhanced value to customers and driving meaningful efficiencies. As highlighted on Slide five, our operating initiatives exceeded expectations in 2023, delivering $19 million of incremental annual NOI to the bottom line, which was $7 million or almost 60% higher than anticipated. Moving to Slide six and capital allocation, remain nimble in 2023, having shifted to being a net seller during the year, with four dispositions from our established regions for $445 million, $275 million of which we'd redeployed into acquisitions in our expansion regions. We also started $800 million of profitable new development during the year, including $300 million of starts in the fourth quarter at an initial projected yield of 6.7%. We also continue to build our structured investment business this year, in which we provide preferred equity or mezzanine loans to third parties for new multifamily construction. We're well positioned to underwrite this business given our development and construction expertise and our live proprietary data and we're fortunate to be building this book of business in today's environment, reflecting today's rates and asset values. The commitments we made in 2022 and 2023, which now total $192 million, are set to deliver an uplift in earnings this year and going forward. Our balance sheet is as strong as it has ever been, with a key metric summarized on Slide seven, providing strength as we manage the business and flexibility as we consider creative opportunities that may arise during 2024. Among a set of peers with strong balance sheets, we continue to experience some of the tightest credit spreads among all REITs, providing a meaningful financial advantage. Slide eight highlights our strategic focus areas for 2024. These focus areas draw upon our foundational strengths as an organization, while also recognizing our commitment to continue to evolve and our areas we are confident will drive superior growth over a multi-year period. Front and center are the next steps in our operating model transformation. At our Investor Day, we raised our target for incremental annual NOI to come from our operating initiatives to $80 million, $55 million of NOI from Horizon 1, and $25 million from Horizon 2. Second, we will continue to drive differentiated growth from our development and construction leadership. The near-term focus is on execution of our projects underway, ensuring they deliver outsized value for shareholders and while new start economics are challenging in certain of our markets, this is the type of environment in which we've typically found some of our most attractive development opportunities. Third, as a continued multi-year approach, we have set a target of shifting 80% of the portfolio to the suburbs from 70% today, and set a target of having 25% of our portfolio in our expansion regions, up meaningfully from 8% today and given the cooling of fundamentals in the Sunbelt, we believe we can make this transition at a more attractive basis than we were able to a couple of years ago. We're also making significant and very creative investments in the existing portfolio this year, ranging from apartment renovations to the creation of new Accessory Dwelling Units, or ADUs in certain markets. Finally, and as a follow-up to my comments about our balance sheet, we are confident that there will be opportunities for us to both utilize our balance sheet capacity and bring our strategic capabilities to bear, be it operational, development, or by utilizing our scale to generate value for shareholders. As we assess the year ahead and moving to Slide nine, our baseline expectation is for a slowing economic environment this year. As we have in the past, we start with consensus estimates from the National Association for Business Economics, or NABE, which forecasts positive but very modest job growth in 2024 of 55,000 jobs per month. This muted growth tempers housing demand, while other factors such as rent versus own economics should serve as a balanced apartment demand, particularly in our established regions, where it is now $2,500 per month more expensive to buy than to rent. Nevertheless, given mixed signals and what we believe is higher uncertainty in the economy and capital markets, our approach is to remain nimble and be ready to proactively adjust based on how 2024 evolves. In an environment of uncertainty, one known factor is new multifamily supply. In our established regions, we expect new apartment deliveries of 1.6% of existing stock in 2024, and expect this figure to further decline to 1.4% in 2025. Importantly, these figures are in line with historical averages for these coastal markets, and this is quite a contrast with supply dynamics in the Sunbelt, which will have twice the level of supply and this elevated supply dynamic in the Sunbelt is expected to continue at least through 2025, simply a function of the reality that it generally takes two plus years to complete and stabilize a new development project and so as we assess 2024, we expect to be relatively well positioned given the stable demand and limited supply outlook in our established regions, but are forecasting a slower year of growth. I'll now turn it to Kevin to provide an overview of our guidance for the year and the building blocks of earnings growth. Yeah, Adam, it's Ben. Just to reiterate, some of our key themes from prior conversations, and we remain very focused on the spread between our development yields and underlying market cap rates. That's the value we create, and we need to be appropriately compensated for the development risk and then the other component is obviously where we're raising the capital, both the source of it and the cost of that capital. So those are the higher level elements that we triangulate around, and then there's the deal specifics that Matt referred to. Yeah, why don't I give it to you by Coast. So on the East Coast, we're trending sort of in that low 2% range. The West Coast was modestly positive about 50 basis points, and the expansion region is essentially flat. Yeah, we haven't broken it out between urban and suburban in terms of the forecast. I can tell you in Q4, we certainly saw better growth out of our suburban portfolio, which was about 200 basis points. The urban portfolio was essentially flat. I did provide sort of the breakout in January as well from East and West, but in terms of urban, suburban, we've not traditionally broken that out. If you look at it on a blended basis, as I mentioned before, it was 2%. If you think across the markets, it's really kind of market specific is more the driver than urban, suburban in many cases. So for example, in the York metro area, we're expecting better growth out of this city and northern New Jersey, less growth really in Westchester, Long Island, Central Jersey. If you go to the Mid Atlantic, it's very different. We're expecting challenged growth in the district, but better growth in Northern Virginia and Suburban Maryland. On the West Coast, fortunately we don't have a lot in urban Seattle, but urban Seattle is pretty rough right now, I would say. More of our north and east side portfolio is performing much better and then generally down in the Bay Area, I think we're all familiar with the challenges in San Francisco. We certainly expect it to lag in a similar theme in LA. So I think you have to kind of go through each market individually to look at it, but that gives you hopefully some color by region. Yeah, I probably wouldn't extrapolate that going forward right at this point. I think it's a good kind of point for where we were in Q4. We do expect based on what I just said, a lot of these suburban markets will hold up better in some of these specific regions, but I wouldn't necessarily count on it being a 200 basis point spread as you move through the full year. Yeah, no, I think that is the right way to look at it. I don't know the exact number, but we have capitalized interest rate -- interest expense going down by $0.04, which is about $5 million year-over-year and it's at a blended capitalized interest rate of 3.5%. So I think it is going down by a couple $100 million and the reality is we have, and this is the natural ebb and flow of construction and progress. We have more completions this year than deals entering new construction. So that'll oscillate over time and it creates a little bit of a period over period volatility in the capitalized interest expense calculation, but that's just the nature of that. We don't -- we start projects when they're ready to go, not at a completely constant evenable -- even rateable basis over the course of the years and there's a little bit of CIP decline from '23 moving into '24. The part, Steve, I'd add to that is you think about this cohort of projects. Starts are definitely coming down this year for financing reasons, economic reasons, but deals that we can make sense of and that we can capitalize in an appropriate way have the potential to open up into a pretty nice pocket, pretty nice window when you look out three years from now. So tough to forecast a lot of other variables in there. And as you said, we're conservative in underwriting based on today's environment, but we do keep that in mind as well. Yeah, that's accurate, Steve. Yeah, John, I think it's footnoted on the slide, but just to be specific, when you start the year, it reflects essentially the rent roll or gross potential is a common term for the month of January relative to the average gross potential or rent roll that we had in place for 2023. So as I mentioned earlier in response to Steve's question, you tend to realize a substantial portion, if not all, of your rent roll growth in the first nine months of the year or so. It accelerates in the spring, peaks in the summer, and then starts to come down in the fall as a result of not only decelerating like-term rent change, but the mix from unlike-term rent change where you burn off short-term premiums and other things. So essentially, in Q4, you don't really see sequentially, if you think about it, any material growth occur during that period of time. So you might have eight months or nine months that you're up kind of an average of a point and a half, like as we were talking about, and the last two or three months is closer to zero and that's how you get closer to kind of the low ones. But we can certainly walk you through it in more detail offline if you like. It's also probably a timing issue. We described the point and a half as kind of where we were spot basis at the end of Q3. I know some companies sort of estimate where they think they might be in January and provide that information on their calls. We tend to provide on a spot basis. For Avalon Connect specifically, the costs associated with those programs are essentially 100% expensed. Yeah. Josh, what I would do is refer you back to the slide on the revenue decomposition and that contribution of 80 basis points from other rental revenue. Almost all of it, not all of it, almost all of it is related to Avalon Connect driving other rental revenue up. There's also increasing trash fees and other things that are happening, but most of that increase is related to Avalon Connect. Yeah. Why don't we get back to you on that as opposed to going quarter-by-quarter on the call, if that's okay. We'll ramp up as we move through the year, for sure and essentially what happens is, think about it as mirroring lease expirations, because we push that through at the apartment level as leases expire. So that's the way probably to think about how we'll bleed through quarter-to-quarter at a high level. Yeah. Why don't I give you some high level commentary, since that's a lot of categories to go through on the call, but sort of high level things to think about here; property taxes, overall, we're expecting year-over-year growth sort of in the mid 4% range. A substantial portion of that is being driven by the phase-out of property tax abatement programs, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Insurance, we are expecting another year of kind of double digit growth in insurance, given what's happening in the market, which, we can certainly talk about if you like. As it relates to utilities, Avalon Connect, I just mentioned, we're expecting utilities as a category to be sort of in the low double digit range and again, almost all of that is related to Avalon Connect. Core utilities are actually quite modest in terms of growth rate and a couple others maybe to mention are on the payroll side. We've essentially got a merit increase of 4%. That's about 90% of payroll. Benefits are going up about 6%. So those two combined are 420 basis points, but we're picking up about 100 basis points from our payroll reductions. So that will net out in the low threes and then the only other thing of note I would say, really, that's a little unusual, is in our office operations category, it's accounting for 20 basis points, 25 basis points of total expense growth, really related to legal and eviction costs that were somewhat elevated last year. We expect them to be elevated a little bit more this year as we continue to process people who are non-paying residents. So those are some sort of high level comments. Hopefully those are helpful. Yeah, happy to take that one, Brad, pretty much consistent with what we've outlined in terms of our outlook. And I would say relative to historical norms for January growth, it's modestly below. Sort of if you look at the change in asking rent in the month of January, say, for the five years pre-COVID as compared to this January, asking rents are trending up just at a slightly lower growth rate. Yeah, we're expecting average asking rent growth throughout the year to be sort of in that 2.25% to 2.5% range and actual rent change in the portfolio would be roughly 2%. Yeah, good question. When I talk about it in the context of maybe rent basis, I would say Northern California is still a long ways to go. We have rents that are essentially asking rents today that are down roughly 10% from pre-COVID peak levels. That's primarily driven by San Francisco being 12%, 13% below peak, which is, that's a pretty significant number and what I would say is that while I think we're seeing some green shoots in San Francisco in terms of what's happening with, say AI as an example, there's a long ways to go in terms of getting the sort of quality of the built environment at a place where people are comfortable, office leaders, business leaders, kind of calling people back to the office and/or people wanting to migrate to the city and be able to feel comfortable with what they're doing. So I'd say there is a lag there. How long it takes to play out, I think these things take a fair bit of time when you're talking about quality of life issues, crime issues, things of that sort. So I don't think this is necessarily a couple quarter type of issue. I think there's several quarters, depending on the political will of what happens to actually see it sort of trend the right direction for us in a more meaningful way. In terms of Seattle, I think a couple of things to think about as it relates to Seattle. Seattle rent levels for us are up about 8% from pre-COVID peak levels, but it is a very bifurcated market. The urban core of Seattle, whether it's right downtown, stuff like Union, Capitol, etcetera are much more challenged because of not only the quality of life issues that I mentioned that you have in San Francisco also in play there, but there is a meaningful amount of supply being delivered more in '24 than was delivered in 2023, which will compound the issue versus if you're mainly suburban, north end, east side, you're much more well-positioned. That's where the majority of our assets are in Seattle. Rich, we are not seeing significant distress in the system. You know, there obviously is the potential wave of maturities that's being highlighted by folks. For the most part, at least in our markets and the assets that we're spending time in and around, we're seeing lenders agree to extend out loans. We're seeing equity step in and put up more capital. Now, not all debt providers and equity providers are able to do that. So that does create the potential for some dislocation, but we're not necessarily seeing it of size. I'd say we're preparing to be ready to take advantage of it, but not seeing it at this point. Operationally, you know, the theme I would take you to is look back over, I don't know, this last cycle, last decade, world of capital being homogeneous. Capital is flowing to all types of players and generally is flowing at a similar cost to all types of players and so as we think about positioning going forward, there is an element of thinking about how we take advantage or step in opportunities for assets that are being operated by, less sophisticated players, players with less scale. And I'll kind of end on the theme of as we're thinking about the opportunity set out there, it is a combination of both places where we can bring our balance sheet to bear and bring our strategic capabilities to bear and we've spent a lot of time on our operating model transformation. It's got two impacts. It's one, it helps us drive internal growth, but we're also bringing those operational capabilities to our external growth. Yeah, sure, Alex. We did have elevated write offs in '23 in general, and I think that's just a reflection of the fact that we have been as we've been talking about adapting our pipeline to reflect the changes in the economic realities, as asset values have dropped and cap rates have increased. So we're generally very focused on risk management. We keep a close eye on capitalized pursuit costs in every one of our deals. And our risk management has actually been one of the keys to us being able to develop profitably across multiple cycles over, really our 30-year history as a public company, 35-year. The write-offs this past quarter, actually, there was one project in Denver actually was an Urban Denver kind of getting back to your first point. The other one was a public private deal in California, and we've had a number of those where, the economics have just changed sufficiently that we didn't necessarily see a path to in many cases, we are able to recut the deal and get a path to a revised deal that does make sense. In those particular cases, that wasn't the case. So we had to let those go, but I would also just taken a big step back here that if you look at our total book of development rights, we currently have land on the balance sheet of $199 million and we have another $67 million in capitalized pursuit costs. So that's $265 million in total and we're controlling opportunity to build about 11,000 units with that investment, which is pretty strong leverage on that pursuit capital and I think, compares favorably to a lot of other both public and private players in the space. So it's that's kind of where it sits today and I'd say that we've gotten through a lot of the deals that were underwater and when we look at our pipeline going forward, we feel pretty good about it. Yeah, good question. What I would say is seasonally, rents start to pick up in January. Rent growth typically accelerates asking rent growth, this is as you move through the spring and into the summer. So typically what you would see is this would be sort of the low point of the year, kind of December, January, and then things would improve from here. So certainly, I mentioned, we're talking about basically getting flat for the year. So, we've got several months here where it will continue to improve, flatten out and then probably as we get to Q4, you would see it come back down and go slightly negative again, which is not uncommon in this kind of an environment. So you start to see sort of positive numbers as you get into Q2 and Q3. Yeah, we're not providing any guidance as it relates to 2025 at this point. I did indicate what it was for 2024 as it relates to revenue and the impact on OpEx in my comments, my prepared remarks. Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today and we look forward to connecting with you over the coming months."

Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your host for today\u2019s conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Rob, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon\u2019s press release as well as in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today\u2019s discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ben Schall, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Ben?\nBen Schall: Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. In keeping with our custom, we posted a presentation last night to accompany our earnings release. In addition to my opening comments, you will hear from Sean on our operating performance and revenue building blocks for 2024; from Matt on the significant earnings being generated by our development projects and lease-up; and from Kevin on the strength of our balance sheet. I want to start with my thanks to the AvalonBay team and our 3000-plus associates for delivering another strong quarter of financial performance and operating results. Particularly in the current environment of higher interest rates and uncertain cap rates, we are laser-focused on driving cash flow growth from our portfolio. The bottom line results from our operating model transformation led by our on-site and centralized teams and powered by our technology, revenue management and data science teams and proprietary systems continue to outpace expectations. Our strong operating performance also speaks to our portfolio positioning, which is 70% suburban and primarily in suburban coastal markets, which continue to benefit from a combination of steady demand and limited new supply. Turning to Slide 4 in the presentation. We grew core FFO by 6.4% in Q3, which was $0.06 ahead of our expectations. This outperformance was primarily driven by better-than-expected revenue growth, which positions us well, as we enter the traditional slower leasing season. As shown on the bottom of Slide 4, we have raised $855 million of capital this year at a 4.3% initial cost, which includes the drawdown of our $500 million equity forward, which we priced at $250 per share and with the remainder coming from asset sales that we've sold at an average cap rate of 4.7%. We completed three development projects in Q3, two in suburban submarkets in the Northeast and one in Miami at a 7.2% stabilized yield. As Matt will emphasize later, our lease-up communities continue to outperform our original expectations by a wide margin. These projects are funded with yesterday's capital, at yesterday's capital cost and are slated to generate outsized value creation and earnings for investors. We also started two projects this quarter, one in Princeton, New Jersey and one in South Miami, with projected yields in the mid-6% range. I will come back to our positioning on new development and capital allocation at the end of our prepared remarks. In Q3, we made $50 million of commitments under our structured investment program or SIP and feel fortunate to be building this book of business in today's environment with these new commitments generating an attractive 13% return. Slide five provides the breakdown of our Q3 revenue outperformance relative to guidance from the end of July with a 30 basis point uplift from higher-than-expected occupancy, 20 basis points from higher rates and 10 basis points from improving bad debt. Turning to slide six. We've exceeded and raised guidance three times this year. We now expect core FFO to grow 8.6% in 2023, which is 330 basis points above our initial expectations for the year. Same-store revenue growth expectations are up 130 basis points. Expenses are down slightly, leading to NOI growth of 6.3%. And with that, I'll turn it to Sean to comment on the favorable demand and supply drivers in our markets and provide a fuller operating update.\nSean Breslin: Thanks, Ben. As we start to look forward to 2024, I thought I'd provide some initial thoughts on two topics. First, I'd like to highlight a few macro factors that will support the performance of our portfolio in the coming year. And then second, share a few building blocks as it relates to the outlook for 2024 revenue growth specifically. Starting on slide seven, we believe our portfolio is well positioned as it relates to rental affordability, particularly as compared to other regions of the country and single-family for sale product. In Chart 1, you can see that rental affordability in our established regions is actually better than pre-pandemic levels, given the strong wage growth that's been experienced over the last few years. And in Chart 2, difference between the cost of owning the median-price home and median rent in our established regions has increased by roughly 10x if you look at the first three quarters of 2023 relative to the average during 2020, which certainly makes apartment living in a more attractive option in these regions. We've already seen the impact of this trend in multiple data points. For example, the volume of existing home sales in our established regions has declined by roughly 25% over the past year. And in our own portfolio, the percentage of move-outs to purchase a home has dipped below 10% this year well below the mid-teens long-term average. Moving to slide eight. Our portfolio is also relatively insulated from new supply particularly as compared to the Sunbelt. In our established regions, we expect new multifamily deliveries of approximately 1.5% of existing stock. And in the specific submarkets where we own assets, new supply is projected to be roughly 1% of stock. This bodes well for revenue growth in all market cycles, but is a particularly valuable attribute of our portfolio, if we experience a weaker economic environment during 2024. Transitioning to slide nine, I'd like to highlight four specific building blocks for 2024 revenue growth. First, the embedded growth in the rent roll from leases we've executed during 2023 stands at approximately 1.5%, which is above our long-term average at this point of the year. Second, our current loss to lease is roughly 2%, led by the East Coast at about 2.5%, while the West Coast and expansion regions trailed behind at approximately 1.5% and 70 basis points respectively. Third, we continue to drive incremental revenue from our operating model initiatives. For example, the September revenue from our Avalon Connect offering was about 40% greater than the average monthly revenue for the first nine months of the year and that monthly revenue run rate will continue to grow during the last two months of 2023 and throughout 2024. Lastly we're expecting a continued tailwind from the normalization of bad debt. During the first half of the year, underlying bad debt averaged approximately 2.7% as compared to the Q3 average of roughly 2% and we expect continued improvement as we move through 2024. The benefit from an improvement in underlying bad debt will be partially offset by the loss of rent relief we've recognized in 2023, but still be a net meaningful benefit for 2024. Taken together these building blocks should support healthy revenue growth during the upcoming year. So with that, I'll turn it over to Matt to address our lease-up activity and structured investment platform. Matt?\nMatt Birenbaum: All right. Thanks Sean. Turning to slide 10. Our lease-ups continue to deliver outstanding results, laying the foundation for strong future growth in both earnings and NAV. We have five development communities that had active leasing in Q3 and those five deals are leasing up at rents that are $485 per month or 17% above our initial underwriting. This in turn is driving a 90 basis point increase in the yield on these investments to 7.4% far above any estimate of current cap rates and even further above the cost of capital we sourced to fund these deals back when they broke ground several years ago. After a relatively light year of deliveries in 2023, we do expect to see a significant increase in our apartment completions in 2024, which will provide incremental NOI and FFO as these communities reach stabilization. Slide 11 provides an update on our structured investment program where we initiated two new investments last quarter and $52 million at an all-in average interest rate of 13%. As we've discussed on prior calls these are three to five-year investments where we provide capital to merchant builders that sits above the construction loan but below common equity in the capital structure. We're still early in the build up of this new line of business and expect it to continue to grow to roughly $400 million over the next few years, providing a nice tailwind to earnings growth as these dollars get invested and start earning a return. We're also fortunate that we're able to underwrite most of this business in today's more restrictive environment providing a strong risk-adjusted return particularly for the latest additions to the program. And with that I'll turn it over to Kevin. \nKevin O\u2019Shea: Thanks Matt. Turning to the next few slides. We continue to enjoy tremendous financial strength and flexibility both from a balance sheet and a liquidity perspective. Specifically from a balance sheet perspective as you can see on slide 12, we enjoy low leverage with net debt to EBITDA of 4.1 times, which is below our target range of five times to six times. Our interest coverage ratio and our unencumbered NOI percentage are at near record levels of 7.5 times and 95% respectively. Our debt maturities are well laddered with a weighted average years to maturity of 7.5 years. And our development underway is nearly 100% match-funded essentially with yesterday's lower cost of capital, which in turn helps ensure that these projects provide earnings and NAV growth when they are completed and stabilized. In addition from a liquidity perspective as shown on slide 13, we continue to maintain a high level of excess liquidity relative to our open commitments for development and structured investment products as of quarter end. Specifically we enjoy $1.5 billion of excess liquidity. And so as a result, we continue to enjoy tremendous financial strength and stability and the flexibility to pursue attractive growth opportunities that may emerge across our investment platforms in the coming months. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ben.\nBen Schall: All right. Thanks, Kevin. We have consistently maintained a strong balance sheet throughout cycles. And as a result, we are well prepared for the current environment. As we have shown over the past couple of years, we proactively adjusted our capital sourcing and capital allocation activities based on changes in the environment as emphasized on slide 14. We locked in our equity forward in early 2022 to pre-fund future development activity. We shifted in the second half of 2022 and in 2023 to be a net seller of assets with a portion of the proceeds being utilized to fund acquisitions as we reshape the portfolio and the balance to fund accretive development. And we have continued to be responsive in adjusting our development start activity, reducing starts last year and this year as our cost of capital changed. As we've emphasized, we are 95% match funded on our development underway, which means all of that capital has already been raised at an attractive initial cost and allows us to deliver projects in 2024 and 2025 that will generate significant earnings and value. On a go-forward basis, we have raised our return requirements on new development. For a standard development deal, our target return was in the low to mid-6s in the middle of the year and is in the mid- to high 6s today. These target returns are up over 100 basis points since last year with the goal of underwriting 100 to 150 basis points of spread between development yields and market cap rates. We expect to be in the lower development -- we expect to be in a lower development start environment in the coming quarters and with spreads at the tighter end of this range after a number of years of outsized development profit margins. And while in the current environment we're focused on maintaining our balance sheet strength, we do believe that we are well positioned given our low leverage, ample liquidity and unique strategic capabilities to capitalize on opportunities that might result from market dislocations. In the near term, while volumes are modest, we're able to deploy capital at double-digit returns through our SIP program. Slide 15 concludes our prepared remarks with our key takeaways. We continue to deliver strong operating results with tailwinds specific to our suburban coastal markets incremental NOI to come from our developments and lease-up and all supported by a fantastic balance sheet. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Wolfe: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you said that you raised your development yields, that's underwritten to be mid to high 6s. Just curious why you think that's the appropriate level? And what percentage of your future development pipeline with that criteria? So if you just take your rights pipeline and everything else what percentage would be started under that criteria?\nMatt Birenbaum: Hi, Eric. It's Matt. I guess I can speak to that one a little bit. As Ben mentioned, we're really trying to preserve that spread of 100 to 150 basis points between cap rates and development yields. And so mid to high six is a reflection of where we think. It's very hard to know where spot cap rates would be today. I think that we had a pretty good sense of where they were over the summer when transaction activity has started to pick up with the most current rise in rates. It's a little bit of a guess but if you think cap rates are maybe in the mid-5s then that would translate into development yields in the mid to high 6s to preserve that spread. It does vary by product type and by region of course. But -- so that's really kind of the thinking behind that. And as it relates to what percentage of the current book meets that threshold it's actually hard to say because things are moving around so much. And what we found is that until we have CDs permits in hand hard drawings to bid on the street we don't really know where hard costs are today. They are starting to come down but you don't necessarily realize that on an estimate that you really want to realize that when you're ready to go. So, what I would say is we have plenty of deals that do clear that hurdle. And indeed we just started two deals this quarter. We're in the mid-6s. And we have at least a couple more that could start over the next couple of quarters that we think are kind of in that position. We do have some that on the most current underwriting from six to 12 months ago will probably fall a little bit short of that. And in many of those cases, we're hoping that with some value engineering maybe some changes to the land economics with the landowner and changes in hard costs that by the time those deals are ready to go they will meet that.\nEric Wolfe: Understood. That's helpful. And then you gave some good detail on the building blocks for same-store revenue growth for next year. Obviously the one piece that's missing is just your expectation around what market rents will do. Then I know it's too early to provide that but I was just hoping you could give us a sense for the process that you go through in terms of figuring that out whether you're building up or down? And then sort of if you were to do it today if you just have a sense for what market rate growth would look like?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Eric it's Sean. Good question. Good crystal ball question I guess I'll characterize it as. But we sort of do two things. We have a macro view and then there's sort of a grassroots bottom-up approach. From a macro perspective in terms of providing commentary today, that's probably where it's been a time which is -- based on what we know today we would anticipate that from a demand standpoint things would decelerate as we move into 2024 just given what we've been seeing in terms of the expectation for slower job and wage growth and other potential headwinds as it relates to whether it's oil prices, obviously, interest costs, student loans, et cetera et cetera. There's a number of macro factors that appear to be more headwinds. We take a really good look at the native consensus forecast for a number of macroeconomic variables at multiple points throughout the year. But certainly when we get into January, the latest forecast helps drive our outlook for 2024 like it does for pretty much every calendar year. And we line that up with what we're seeing on the ground in terms of what actually is going to deliver as we rescrub our supply pipeline et cetera to try and estimate what affected market rent growth would be based on the algorithms we use. So, it really is again a sort of macro top-down as well as a bottoms-up approach depending on the variables that you're looking at. In terms of today it's hard to provide an estimate other than as I mentioned we would expect a softer demand environment in 2024 as compared to 2023 based on the current sort of consensus outlook for macro variables.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Thank you. So, more near-term I guess has the moderation in lease rate growth been partly strategic as you sought to backfill some of the occupancy you lost around midyear? And then you've just kind of continued to build occupancy into the softer part of the leasing season. Or is this more related to the pockets of softness across the portfolio like in Northern California, it looks like and then also in some of your expansion markets?\nSean Breslin: Yeah. Austin good question, I'd say, it's kind of a mix of those answers frankly. At the early part of the third quarter, I would say it was more a reflection of our efforts to build occupancy which was successful in a number of markets. Combined with I'd say one or two places that continue to remain saw often even a little softer as we got to the end of the third quarter. And that was certainly important to Northern California is the primary region where we experienced that. So really a combination of two things as it relates to what you saw in rent change through the quarter as well as into October.\nAustin Wurschmidt: And then just on the external growth side or just investment side. I mean, how are you feeling about the size of the development pipeline? And based on what you do know today do you think that -- as those deliveries and completions kind of pick up next year are you going to be able to maintain the size of the pipeline in 2024? Or do you think your dollars in dry powder are better spent on new acquisitions just -- given the risk reward profile and some of your strategic goals of getting into those expansion markets?\nBen Schall: Austin, I'll start with that. It's Ben. So on the developments we have underway we do have strong conviction that those are going to continue to create meaningful earnings and value. And we obviously got good visibility there on when they're going to be delivering. And as we head into 2024 and 2025 do expect a fairly significant ramp-up of that activity. It may not be quite at the same outperformance levels that we've seen over the last year but still expecting strong performance out of that pool. As we think about new capital and the decision-making process there on the development side I think we've been very clear. We want to make sure if we're going to undertake new development that there's a sufficient profit margin relative to underlying market cap rates another way of saying we want to make sure there's sufficient profit margin to where we could buy an asset. And in today's environment there's, been opportunities in both. There are certain markets and certain projects that we've been able to structure for new development where we're able to obtain sufficient spreads and there are other markets and you saw this in some of our acquisition activity over the last quarter to, as an example in Dallas where we're able to buy assets below replacement cost and start to build the portfolio in those markets. So it's a multifaceted approach. We're fortunate in that we have multiple levels to grow overtime. And as we've emphasized what's on us as a team to make sure that we continue to stay flexible in that approach and change our approaches depending on what's happening in the market environment as well as what's happening with our cost of capital.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. I wanted to ask on leasing trends in some of your markets, specifically Northern California which looks like the lease growth rates kind of nosedived in September and October. And that diverged from Seattle which is a similar market in terms of tech job growth where you saw an improvement. But can you just discuss the demand picture? And why there was such a difference in performance in those two markets?\nSean Breslin: Yeah. John its Sean. Good question. There's, a couple of different answers to that. So, first, as it relates to what you saw in Seattle which also occurred by the way in the Mid-Atlantic and Denver is that we're starting to get into a period particularly as we get further into the fourth quarter here where the comps are easier on a year-over-year basis. And that's a reflection of the step-up that you saw in rent change in those three regions in a more meaningful way particularly in Seattle as you may have noticed. Whereas in Northern California most concentrated in San Francisco, I would say, which is only 30% of our current portfolio. Things did soften more so particularly as we got to sort of mid-September into October and that's what's reflected in the rent change, you saw as it continue to tick down through the quarter and then more meaningfully into October. And I think there's a couple of things there. One is San Francisco just to pick on it since everyone seems to like to lately it's -- there's a number of different headwinds there as I think we're all well aware of probably not the best time of the year to be seeing some elevated demand there. It's just not the case. And there's not really a great reason for people to be coming back to the office at this point still. So fundamentals have remained weak and they did get weaker as we moved through the quarter into October. So trying to know exactly what's underneath that other than weaker demand overall. It's hard to be precise, but I'd say, we did not see the same level of weakness in Seattle and you combine that with the year-over-year comp in Seattle and that's why you saw the uptick there. So Seattle is still not strong. But on a relative basis compared to last year for example there was a lot of short-term leasing activity throughout the year and then burned off in the third quarter. Put more pressure on rates at the end of Q3 and Q4. We didn't have a lot of that short-term demand in 2023, and therefore, the year-over-year compensation is easier. So not to get too far into the weeds, but that's some insight into what you saw in a place like Seattle as compared to Northern Cal.\nJohn Kim: That's very helpful. My second question is on bad debt, which you discussed has improved this year and is likely to be a tailwind in 2024 earnings. My question is how much of an improvement can you see from the 2.1% pre-resident relief funds that you got this quarter? And in particular Southeast Florida was surprisingly your worst-performing market in bad debt. And I was wondering if you could provide some commentary on that.\nSean Breslin : Sure. So on the first question as it relates to bad debt, so 2023 if you look at the beginning of the year to sort of where we're trending today just sort of rough justice there's about 100-basis-point improvement in underlying bad debt roughly 3% down to sort of trending around 2% today. We've seen improvement across almost all regions Florida kind of being the outlier as you noted. But I think what we've seen in 2023, there was meaningful improvement in a market like Southern California, which started the year at roughly 6% and now we're below 3%. As compared to some other regions has certainly improved, but it improved at a more modest rate. So as we look forward to 2024, I think the expectation for continued improvement is there, but it may be at a slightly lower rate than what we experienced in 2023 given the meaningful improvement that we experienced in Southern California. And now we're down to some regions like New York as an example where things are moving a little more slowly. So the pace of improvement throughout 2024 may be slightly lower than what we experienced throughout 2023 if that makes sense. But the other thing to keep in mind is that we will have some meaningful improvement but it will be partially offset by the loss of rent relief that's going to be call it, roughly $7 million that we're not expecting to recognize in 2024 that we did recognize in 2023. So these are some of the building blocks as it relates to bad debt that hopefully are helpful. As it relates to Florida specifically, what I would tell you is where we've seen elevated bad debt, and frankly, it's been beyond our expectations. It's really been in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, the West Palm Beach market has held up kind of where we would have expected it would have been, but it has been elevated in the other two markets beyond what our expectation was.\nJohn Kim: Great. Thank you.\nBen Schall: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Kramer: Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. Wondering where you're sending out lease renewals for -- after November and December at?\nBen Schall: Yeah, Adam, we sent them out at 6% for November, December, which is relatively consistent with what we quoted for where we were for the 2 months of Q3 on the last call. We have seen in some markets a little more degradation in terms of the committed offer to realization, but it's still within sort of the 150 to 200 basis point range what we're seeing renewals come in at 4% to 4.5%, depending on the more recent time period you're looking at.\nAdam Kramer: Got it. Helpful. Yeah. And then maybe just another quick one. Just remind us kind of where -- or in the most recent quarter, where what the percent of move-outs to buy a home was?\nBen Schall: Yeah. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, has been trending below 10% all year. It's about 9.5% in Q3. I think we're roughly 9% for Q2. So it has been trending down. As I mentioned, the long-term average is kind of in the mid-teens, and it's been as high as the sort of high teens kind of pre-GFC.\nAdam Kramer: Great. And maybe just one last quick one for me, if that's okay, which is just on the bad debt kind of progression and not ask me for kind of a specific time frame or number necessarily. But if you think about kind of the recovery path back to pre-COVID levels, first of all, I guess, is that kind of the goal to kind of -- or is it achievable, I guess, to kind of get all the way back to pre cover levels? And then kind of what's the rough kind of time frame for getting back there?\nBen Schall: Yeah. Good question. In terms of pre-COVID levels, which are typically call it, 50, 60 basis points for us, the question is whether it's going to be a new normal or not. I think probably the industry expectation is given various regulatory changes that have occurred in most markets across the country that it might be ideal to get back to 50, 60 basis points, maybe 70, 80 is more realistic. I don't think we really know yet. And in terms of the time to get there, certainly, what I would say is I don't believe we'll get back to full stabilization by the end of 2024. I would expect it to carry into 2025. And what we really need to see is a little more movement as it relates to cases moving through the courts, particularly in markets like Maryland, D.C. and the Greater New York region. As I mentioned earlier, we've seen significant progress in Southern California. 6% bad debt down sub-3% now. We haven't seen anything like that in terms of percentage improvement in some of the other regions I just mentioned.\nAdam Kramer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the -- just the delinquent tenant conversation. As you work through the backlog, evictions and long-term delinquent units, do you expect a meaningful acceleration in repair and maintenance costs next year?\nBen Schall: Yeah. Good question, John. We can. We have seen some of that this year as reflected in what we've posted in terms of cost because there's yeah, just greater damage in the units. And obviously, you might do billing damage receipts back to the resident, but then you're pretty much immediately writing it off because you're not collecting it. So I would say that, that has been elevated this year, and I would expect that along with legal and eviction costs to also remain elevated in 2024. It may not be a significant growth rate from 2023 to 2024 but it should remain elevated in both categories.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Sean, one market level question. Can you just give us a color \u2013 some color on the large sequential revenue decline in D.C. proper this past quarter? \nSean Breslin: Yes, D.C. proper there's a number of issues there. As it relates to primarily, what you've got is sort of a seasonal issue. We have probably three assets there that have exposure to the student population near AU or other universities. And so you typically see that occur sequentially during that quarter and then it bounces back in Q4. That's the most meaningful component. There are other miscellaneous things as it relates to supply and number of submarket and other things that you could overlay on top of that but by far the sequential change for the student population is the most meaningful one.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Our next question is from James Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJames Feldman: Great. Thank you. I guess for my first question, can you just talk more about the acquisitions both in the quarter and the October acquisition? I guess, what I'd love to hear about is how distressed were the sellers \u2013 how much did pricing move before you decided to buy the assets? Just any color on what the market looks like in pricing?\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure. It's Matt. I'll speak to that one. So again, just taking a step back here we sold $445 million worth of assets this year including one \u2013 our last dispo, which will close at the end \u2013 close next week. And those were at a kind of a blended average cap rate in the high 4s. And those were kind of sold and priced throughout the year better pricing earlier in the year, softer pricing later in the year. We bought three assets for about $275 million, all in the last 60 days. Those cap rates were more like mid-4s. And I would say in no cases where the seller distressed. One of those cases we did assume some debt, which probably gave a little boost to the price. So \u2013 and all of those assets, if we \u2013 if they were to price in today's market would certainly price at a higher cap rate than that I don't know how much higher. But same with the dispose. And again what happened is we pivoted to being a net seller of assets so we sell first. And in many cases we're holding some of those proceeds for a 10/31 exchange and that's informing kind of our appetite on the buy side. So we were net sellers of $200 million or really more like $230 million after you factor in the assumed debt in terms of the cash proceeds we realized from it. The other thing I'd say is when you think about what we bought versus what we sold, it is a good illustration of what we're doing with our portfolio allocation. We sold the four assets out of our established regions they were on average 25 years old. We sold them at an average price of $450000 a unit and the average rents on those assets was $3300 a month. The three assets we bought were in Dallas and in the Greater Charlotte area. In all three cases, there are assets where we are able to add value through our operating platform in many cases. It's part of getting to operating scale in those regions. So we think that \u2013 while the cap rate is the mid-4s the yield is more like a 5. Between some value add, we're doing a little bit of light value-add with washer dryers and some hard surface flooring, but a lot of it is just bringing it onto our operating platform, as we get economies of scale in those regions. And those three assets on average are seven years old. We paid on average $245,000 a door, which is below today's replacement cost as Ben mentioned and average rent of $1,700. So a much more affordable price point which we think has a much better growth profile.\nJames Feldman: Okay. Thank you for that. I mean M&A commented this morning that they're seeing developers cut rents, so that they can get occupancy up and get assets ready for sale, if they're having debt maturities. So I guess, sticking with kind of the distressed line of questioning, I mean do you think that's coming your way in your expansion markets? And then similarly, as you think about the SIP book over the next few years, I know you mentioned $400 million, but do you think this environment helps you accelerate that? And do you have a view on maybe what you could do over the next 12 months? And what kind of yields?\nBen Schall: Jamie, it's Ben. I'll step in. We're not seeing distress at this point. We do expect there to be some dislocation that comes through the system. And on the buying side, a couple of different areas in which we're hunting. One is what Matt talked about places where we can be adding to the density of our portfolio assets and nearby, other assets places where we can add incremental value by bringing the operating initiative activity over to our acquisitions, so that's very much top of mind. Another potential pool and we've been staying close to potential opportunities here are deals and lease-up that maybe are coming up against nearer term loan maturities. What we've been seeing there to date is situations where equity capital is putting more equity into those deals, effectively recapitalizing them and/or lenders who are agreeing to extend out those loans. And so, what you're finding is the borrowers and lenders are agreeing to say extend, it out you get the step-up in the interest rate not going to be a lot of cash flow generated off of the asset, but better to extend there, get the asset fully leased then monetize it, at least for the types of assets in the markets that we're looking to acquire in. Now, that won't be the case right for all types of equity. There's going to be equity that doesn't have the ability to put in more capital and it won't be the case for all types of lenders, right? There's only certain profiles of lenders that can extend out. So, it's an area that we are staying close to. Quickly on kind of two other areas of opportunity, one on the land side. So our developers as Matt talked about today are actively reworking our existing pipeline, recutting deals, restriking deals. We're also out looking for new land opportunities. And the current capital environment and our expectations for what that capital environment will be over the next year, we expect to see opportunities there. Apparently, there's going to be less competition from merchant builders in those markets. So, it'll be selective, but that could be a fruitful area. And then the third area of opportunity is providing capital to the third-party developers. And we have two programs there, DFP and SIP. We'll be selective. But for sure, in terms of the quality of sponsor, that's approaching us the quality of the real estate that they have under control and the return profile of those deals, all of that is enhanced in this environment. And so that's another place that we can deploy capital accretively.\nJames Feldman: So, on the SIP, do you have a sense of how much you can deploy over the next year or so?\nBen Schall: So, in the SIP, it's -- we have a target of building that book of business up to $300 million to $500 million over a couple of year period. Given the financing markets, it is tough for deals to pencil, but there are some that do. We are very selective. These are deals we're underwriting not to own them, but to be comfortable owning them if we need to. And in places where we can get a 13% return; we think that's a pretty attractive source of capital. So it's an area of focus. I wouldn't necessarily say it's an area we're looking to accelerate activity. We want to build that book up in a measured way over the next couple of years.\nJames Feldman: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. My first question is on customer behavior. Can you provide a little color on traffic, the percentage of people looking to move out to buy homes? And just if you're seeing anything about residents doubling up. And related to that, I believe it seems like a long time ago but November, December of 2022 was particularly weak and then it rebounded in -- early in 2023. So how are you thinking about the last three months? Do you expect the trajectory to repeat as it did last year, or should we see some better growth in the fourth quarter here on the easier comparisons? Thank you.\nSean Breslin: Yeah Michael, it's Sean. I'll take those. So in terms of customer behavior, I'd say the trends we've seen this year have remained relatively consistent. As I mentioned earlier in response to a question in my prepared remarks move-outs to purchase a home is well, well-below long-term averages sub-10% and has been below there for some time now. So not surprising given everything you're experiencing in the single-family for sale market in terms of run up in values and REITs and now the slowing market, et cetera people not terribly inclined to purchase a home and renting is not only more affordable but if you're a risk-off mode you may not want to consider it anyways. Nothing else notable I would say in terms of customer behavior at this point in time. As you noted, the year-over-year comp does get easier as we proceed further into Q4. So a little bit of that as I mentioned in October as it relates to the uptick in rent change in the Mid-Atlantic, Denver and Seattle regions. And we do expect rent change to somewhat stabilize as we look at November and December. And while it won't be anything that's super terrific in terms of a significant rebound as an example, it should be more stable than what we experienced last year based on what we know today. \nMichael Goldsmith: Thanks for that. And my follow-up question is related to taxes. The New York City tax burn off was a significant factor in the real estate tax. What's the expected impact going forward? And how should we think about real estate tax for the expansion markets versus the coastal markets?\nSean Breslin: Yeah. Good question. As it relates to property taxes, which are about 35% of our expense structure we do expect another elevated year of tax pressure in 2024, most of it related to the expiration of those tax abatement programs that we experienced this year. And the level of impact next year will be relatively similar to 2023. As it relates to tax rate, or just tax growth in the Sunbelt or our expansion regions versus the saves regions independent of the exploration of the tax abatement programs. Certainly I would expect more pressure in the expansion regions and the Sunbelt in general given the significant run-up in values that they have experienced over the last three years relative to the established regions. I think that's pretty clear. There's always a lag effect. So the question is just, which market, which submarket tax jurisdiction et cetera, but certainly expect more pressure in those regions as compared to our established regions, which is still the majority of our portfolio.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thanks for that, and good luck in the fourth quarter.\nSean Breslin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hey, guys. I appreciate the disclosure on the two new product starts 6s. And then also how you're kind of doing that with the projects in lease-up right now to 90 basis point higher spread. Just trying to...\nBen Schall: Hey, Josh we're getting a lot of feedback on the call.\nJoshua Dennerlein: [Technical Difficulty] I am sorry.\nBen Schall: Why don\u2019t you dial and we will get you back in the line.\nJoshua Dennerlein: That\u2019s okay. I am sorry. [Technical Difficulty]\nBen Schall: Joshua, if you could call back in \u2013 there is still static \u2013 line to the next participants, Okay.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Thanks. I just want to circle back on the development. So are you guys planning development starts in the fourth quarter, or is it up in the air? It sounded like Matt you had some things that would pencil on that high six maybe seven range. But I'm just not sure if you actually were starting anything in the fourth quarter. And if we think about 2024 starts would those most likely be back half weighted to give yourself some time to kind of see how the economy plays out here?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes Steve yes we may well start a deal in the fourth quarter that would be on similar economics to the Q3 starts. Again we're 95% match funded on development underway today. So if we have deals that we think make sense we think we do have some room there. So I wouldn't be surprised if we have a similar level of start activity in Q4 to Q3 maybe whether it's one or two deals I don't know. When we think about 2024 I think you're probably right. It probably is more back half weighted based on kind of how the capital markets evolve and kind of our access to and pricing of new capital that would fund that business. But we've been in a again for us if we track to roughly $800 million in starts this year or maybe a little bit under that that would be a pretty light year for us and certainly lighter than what we expected going into the year which was the same last year. So we're at a pretty modest level of starts volume relative to our kind of long-run capacity and averages and that's a response to what we're seeing in the markets but I don't think we would view that as a significant level.\nSteve Sakwa: Got it. And then just secondly on expenses they've come in a little bit better than what you originally guided, but still kind of elevated in the six-plus range. Just as you think about the puts and takes into next year how do you maybe see expenses trending? What might be a little bit better and what overall might be still headwinds into next year?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Steve, it's Sean. I can take that one. I mean we do expect 2024 to be another somewhat elevated year primarily due to a few factors I can touch on. One I mentioned earlier property taxes which is about 35% of our expense structure. We do expect it to grow at an elevated rate due to the expiration of those tax abatement programs that I mentioned previously. The pilot burden in 2024 the burn-off there is relatively similar to 2023 before we see it begin to step down in 2025. Utilities, which is about 12% of the expense structure the continued implementation of our AvalonConnect offering which is a profitable endeavor. We're expecting kind of $25 million of incremental NOI from that program, but it is a burden on OpEx growth as it's being implemented and we do expect that to be continuing through 2024 as well. And then two other sort of pressure points really are going to be insurance even though it's only 5% of OpEx. It's still a difficult market. We'll be trying to mitigate that pressure through the use of our captive and other strategies to help offset it relative to market growth rate, but it's still may be elevated relative to sort of normal trends. And then the last one is the repairs and maintenance and legal costs, which I mentioned earlier is a result of continuing to move out sort of the nonpaying residents and puts pressure on turn costs legal and eviction cost et cetera. Some of that will be offset by continued benefits from the initiatives particularly on the payroll side of things. But certainly, we won't be able to offset all those other macro trends that we'd see occurring in 2024 similar to 2023.\nSteve Sakwa: So not to maybe put words in your mouth Sean but it sounds like the 6.3 I don't want to call it a run rate but it doesn't sound like there's a lot of nonrecurring that would really burn down. It sounds like expenses could be kind of in that ballpark for next year or maybe a little bit better but elevated I guess relative to history?\nSean Breslin: Yes. I think the elevated relative to history is the operative statement there. I think that's appropriate. There may be a little bit of relief in some areas. Like in utilities we should have some better contracts in 2024 relative to 2023. But we still do have the AvalonConnect offering. Again, it's profitable but moving through the year. So I think your phrase is generally in the ballpark.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Connor Mitchell with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nConnor Mitchell: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the time. So my first question you guys talked about distressed deals in the environment a little bit. So, I guess, I was just wondering when you guys approach distressed deals taking over private deals how does it compare for the underwriting of those deals versus your internal underwriting? Are the assumptions similar, or do you guys have to make a lot of adjustments? And maybe also that can relate to the SIP program you were discussing earlier about how you underwrite those in the case you have to take over projects?\nMatt Birenbaum : I guess, I can try and take that one. It's -- we underwrite everything more or less the same which is we develop our own view of what we think the NOI is going to be and where we think the asset value would be. And so in the SIP frequently almost always the sponsor will provide a projection of NOI that we think is overly optimistic. And again, we have a lot of data that we can leverage to do good underwriting in these programs and the fact that we own and operate assets and have real rent rolls and everything else in all of these markets is one reason why we think that this is an appropriate place for us to invest and a prudent way and leverage our capabilities and our proprietary data. So we get their underwriting. We kind of -- I won't say we throw in the trash but we do our own underwriting. And based on that we come up with our own view of where we think the NOI would be for that asset very similar to, if it was an asset we were developing. And then we build in a margin of safety on that when we think about how high we're willing to lend in the capital stack under the expectation that again we're going to be paid back out of an asset sale in the back end. And we are prepared to step in at our lender basis. And have the view that if we have to step in at our lender basis, because they can pay us back that would not be a bad outcome for us from an investment point of view the basis we would be in that asset. So there are some assets we just wouldn't lend on, because we wouldn't be prepared. We wouldn't want to own them really under almost at any price. So that's one of our screens in the SIP. As it relates to acquisitions or development, it's kind of the same. We'll just look at where we think the deal should underwrite. And based on that we'll formulate a view of what we think is worth and make an offer and see if we can tie it up.\nSean Breslin: One maybe just to add one thing, I'm not sure this is exactly where you were going but we do try to apply what we think is sort of a market-based underwriting given our standards. Matt was mentioning earlier, we may be buying a deal of what we think is -- we'll pick a number of 4.5 cap five cap 5.5 cap, above when we bring it on our operating platform we made use of 50, 60, 70 basis points from our own sort of operating platform. We would not underwrite the benefit of it being on our platform and have that reflected in the value of the asset. It would be based on sort of a standalone asset with sort of market-based underwriting with our scrutiny of it if that's where you're going.\nConnor Mitchell: Yeah. I appreciate that. That's great color. And then my second question and apologies, if you guys have already mentioned this, but how much of the improved earnings outlook is driven by developments versus operations?\nKevin O'Shea: I mean in terms of -- Connor, are you talking about the third quarter update relative to the midyear reforecast? Do you have a page in our earnings release that we'll detail that for you and it is on Page 5? And you can see there that as you recall our midyear reforecast for core FFO for the year was $10.56. It's now $10.63 so $0.07, increase. If you kind of go down the line there you can see that $0.04 comes from improved same-store residential revenue $0.01 from improved same-store residential OpEx and then there are some puts and takes in terms of overhead and other that get you the additional $0.02 there.\nConnor Mitchell: Appreciate it. That's all for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern: Yeah. Thanks. So you guys reported a negative 80-basis-point newly spread in October. I'm curious how that compares to normal for this time of year and just generally how things are progressing versus the normal pre-COVID seasonality?\nSean Breslin: Yeah, Brad, good question. I don't know if there's a normal per se for October. But I mean generally what I would describe for rent growth throughout the year is that a typical seasonal bell curve. We typically see rents went up from January to July or August a 7% range or an average year and then they decelerate down by 4% or 5%. For this year, if you look at it sort of on average point-to-point from January through year-end you might see effective market rent growth in the 2.5% range somewhere in that ballpark. And what I would say in general about what we've seen in the back half of this year is slightly less seasonality across most markets with one exception being Northern California that has been more seasonal than normal relative to its history.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then I think in the prepared remarks you talked about hard costs and said that you're not really seeing cost savings in bids, but you expect to see them when they actually start going? Can you give us some color of where you think real hard costs in real life have actually gone?\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure Brad it's Matt. I guess I'll speak to that a little bit. It is very regional. So, where we've seen hard costs come down say compared to this time last year, we've seen it a little bit here in the Mid-Atlantic maybe 5%. We've seen it in Boston maybe to a little bit more significant degree 5% to 10%. And I think we are starting to see it in Northern California, where it's just been very, very soft for a while now. We have not yet seen it in Seattle. We haven't yet seen it -- maybe a little bit in Austin but costs went up so much there that it's not I would say super meaningful yet. So, we haven't necessarily seen it as much in the Sunbelt markets yet Denver, Southeast Florida, but we think that it's coming there. And I would caveat that by saying for us and others that's what I was saying before. The best data is where you have a deal that's ready to go and you really can hard bid it. And we don't have deals that were hard bidding in every region at this very moment. So, it's hard to tell until you're at that place. So, we're getting kind of discrete data points. And where we have them it's very helpful because we do think again kind of like with the rents that gives us a little bit of an informational advantage to have a real sense for what's going on in real time. But it really does vary based on the regional dynamics within each region.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Anderson: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just a question on expansion market and the process to getting in there. The word was used staying flexible about an hour ago. And I'm wondering does the methodical way by what you're growing there offer you -- is that what's the word keeping you informed I guess and allowing you to pivot one direction or another. Or if you had a chance to do it perfectly in one fell swoop and everyone would stand up and applaud the transaction if you could get there all at once tomorrow would you do that? So, how committed are you? And a related part of that question is how is the Sunbelt performing not so much relative to the urban coastal areas where everyone knows that. But how is it performing relative to your expectations? And is it getting is it even more interesting to you even though it's underperforming relative to other areas of the country at the present time?\nBen Schall: Hey Rich it's Ben. Let me make a couple of comments. First in terms of our long-term framework of moving 25% of our portfolio to our expansion markets that remains. Primary drivers of that; one the recognition that our core customer our knowledge-based worker is in a more dispersed set of markets. And second we can take what we do well bring it to those markets in order to generate incremental value for shareholders. In terms of pacing and timing, we are seeing softness. We're starting to see some dislocation in our expansion regions and we see it as a potential opportunity. It's an opportunity to potentially be buying assets below replacement cost which we have started to do and in a development market that maybe has less players in it or players that don't have the same access to capital or the same cost of capital that we do to be able to selectively step into some attractive development opportunities there. There could be -- you fast forward I don't think it's today where we'd be looking to accelerate our movement given where our cost of capital is, but there could be an environment at some point over the next couple of years where something more substantial does present itself and that could make -- that could at that point be the right risk-adjusted return decision. So it's on our radar. We're continuing to grow through our own development through acquisitions and funding of third-party developers and we'll keep our eyes out for larger opportunities as well.\nRich Anderson: A follow-up question is to Kevin perhaps. The 4.1 times leverage the target of 5% to 6% I mean, how do you ever get to that target anytime soon given the rate environment? And maybe one way is debt assumption, which was a part of a transaction you mentioned earlier. Is there any realistic lift to 4.1 in this environment, or could there be transactions here or there where you add debt at reasonable costs through your transaction activities? Thanks.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Sure. Rich, again, it's Kevin. So I appreciate the comment. It's an interesting question. We discuss and debate internally here. As you point out we are 4.1 times net debt-to-EBITDA levered relative to a five times to six times target range which is sort of a -- it's been a long-term target range that we've had for more than a decade, which speaks to sort of a normalized environment. If you look at 4.1 times, it's benefited from cash. If the cash weren't there we'd be kind of in mid-4s just as a further contextual comment. But more broadly, if you look back at the last four years or so, I don't think anyone would agree we've been in a normalized environment from the pandemic and its effects as it's moved through. And as you think about how things have played out this year we are at that low four times leverage level in part because of our capital decisions over the last few years. And this year's capital plan where we've essentially will have paid off about $750 million of debt this year and brought in about $750 million of new and recycled equity from the equity forward and the net disposition activity that's deleveraging and not necessarily reflective of a normal year but -- so this wouldn't have been our capital plan normally but it has proven to be the right capital plan for this year. And what that does is it gives us financial flexibility to deal with an uncertain and volatile capital markets environment liquidity and strength to deal with an environment where we may wish to be patient in terms of additional capital formation given the recent rise in debt rates. And I guess to the point that you're getting at it also gives us leverage capacity. To the extent we wish to seize upon certain investment opportunities whether they are in our established markets or in our expansion markets that we view as attractive where we can bring the strength of our balance sheet to bear and potentially rely on a greater than normal level of debt that may be attractive relative to those opportunities and lean into the balance sheet and generate some growth in that regard. So we are certainly willing and able to get to that five times to six times leverage in the right circumstances. I will note that there are sometimes when we've gotten there in less than desirable circumstances such as three years ago in the pandemic when -- we actually were 5.4 times net debt to leverage EBITDA in Q3 of 2020, but that's sort of preparing the balance sheet for a downturn. So given where we are it's a low leverage level, but we think it's appropriately, so because it gives us strength to deal with potential challenges that could happen ahead as well as strength to deal with potential opportunities that we hope will be in front of us. \nRich Anderson: Okay. Great color. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the color earlier on the renewals for October, November color on October new lease rates. But I didn't catch if you did provide them your expectations for new lease rates into the year-end. So maybe some color there on then what would that imply for a full year 2024 earning? Thank you.\nSean Breslin: Yes. It's Sean. Just -- I didn't provide specific insight into the expectation for new move-in lease rates in Q4. The one data point we did provide is that renewal offers went out in the 6% range. And similar to what we've been seeing in the last few months, I would expect them to settle sort of in, call it, 150 to 200 basis points dilution off of that, so kind of 4% range maybe 4.25%. One thing to keep in mind that I mentioned earlier is the comps do get a little bit easier in November and December, and that's why in markets like the Mid-Atlantic Denver and Seattle you saw an uptick in rent change in October. So all else being equal we expect sort of relatively, I'll call it, stable glide path through year-end as it relates to lease rates. The earn-in -- we provided kind of a snapshot of the earn-in on the slides that we presented or posted last night at about 1.5. My expectation based on what I know today is that may soften a little bit between now and year-end but haven't necessarily put a number to it yet.\nHaendel St. Juste: Thanks for that. Can you give us an update on the loss of lease in the portfolio and perhaps where it has in Lewis?\nSean Breslin: Yes, that was posted on the slide as well. We recorded loss to lease roughly 2% led by the East Coast markets north of 2 and then the West Coast and expansion regions trailing roughly 1.5 points and around 70 basis points in the expansion regions.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Thank you. And then last one and then apologies if you want to touch on this, but are there any markets that you commented that you're seeing an acceleration in concessions or perhaps more aggressive lease-up for merchant developers?\nSean Breslin: Yes. The one market I mentioned a couple of times earlier that has been softening more recently is Northern California, most notably San Francisco but to a lesser extent San Jose as well.\nHaendel St. Juste: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi. Good afternoon. I guess a question on the expansion region loss lease of 70 basis points, which is maybe better than you would think given all the concern about supply growth in some of these markets. Is any one market driving that positive loss to lease? And do you think space markets could be a positive attributor to your same-store revenue growth next year?\nSean Breslin: Yes, good question. I'd say, what -- where it's coming from for the most part is a blend of Southeast Florida and what we've experienced a little bit, that's going to be coming online in the Texas market where it's a more challenging environment is in Charlotte, which as you may have noted the expansion region rent change is negative. That is effective with the Charlotte market. Three assets. In the south end of Charlotte, there's a lot of supply coming online there. It's a great submarket. We love the submarket. When we bought the assets, we knew there would be a fair amount of supply in the first two or three years of ownership, which is what we're experiencing today, but we believe we acquired them at good values. So it's probably a little too early to tell you what 2024 is going to look like there specifically. But anything that's coming through will probably be Texas and maybe a little bit in Southeast Florida and really not much if anything. And we might even be in a gain deli situation in Charlotte.\nAnthony Powell: All right. Thank you.\nBen Schall: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey, guys. I'm back. Hopefully, you can hear me now.\nBen Schall: Yes\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay, good. So just my question I just was curious because it looks like you're underwriting the new starts at a mid-6s, but you're achieving call it mid-7s on your stuff and current lease up? Just kind of what would get us up to that mid-7s going forward, or is there just some kind of element of conservatism built in?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes, Josh it's Matt. So the way we underwrite is we don't trend anything. So the reason why the current lease-ups are exceeding pro forma by so much, by 90 basis points is -- I mean basically, it's got to be one or two things. It's either rent growth between the time we started construction and the time, we leased it up which -- that is what it is in the current situation. Or in some cases, we were just too conservative in our initial underwriting. And even without market rent growth the offering that we put out there, got a bigger premium to the comps than what we had underwritten because we're pretty conservative in general. So when you think about the deals we're starting now and you ask where are they going to stabilize two to three years from now, when they lease up, the reason why they might outperform we might get a little bit of hard cost savings, that's certainly possible based on what I was saying although, we tend to buy it out pretty quickly. Or it could be rent less between now and then, or it could be just kind of a more favorable response from the market. So on average, over the long run, we tend to outperform by more like 20 to 30 basis points. So that's pretty consistent, but it will vary based on where we are in the cycle.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Interesting. And then I'm not sure if I missed it, but did you guys disclose October occupancy? I know you put out the right growth.\nSean Breslin: I don't believe we did, but we're trending in the same general range in terms of economic occupancy kind of in that 95.7% range or so.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the time. \nSean Breslin: Take care.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ben Schall for closing comments.\nBen Schall: Thank you and thank you, everyone for joining us today. We look forward to connecting further with you in November. Talk soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

            "name": "Matt Birenbaum",
            "content": "All right. Thanks Sean. Turning to slide 10. Our lease-ups continue to deliver outstanding results, laying the foundation for strong future growth in both earnings and NAV. We have five development communities that had active leasing in Q3 and those five deals are leasing up at rents that are $485 per month or 17% above our initial underwriting. This in turn is driving a 90 basis point increase in the yield on these investments to 7.4% far above any estimate of current cap rates and even further above the cost of capital we sourced to fund these deals back when they broke ground several years ago. After a relatively light year of deliveries in 2023, we do expect to see a significant increase in our apartment completions in 2024, which will provide incremental NOI and FFO as these communities reach stabilization. Slide 11 provides an update on our structured investment program where we initiated two new investments last quarter and $52 million at an all-in average interest rate of 13%. As we've discussed on prior calls these are three to five-year investments where we provide capital to merchant builders that sits above the construction loan but below common equity in the capital structure. We're still early in the build up of this new line of business and expect it to continue to grow to roughly $400 million over the next few years, providing a nice tailwind to earnings growth as these dollars get invested and start earning a return. We're also fortunate that we're able to underwrite most of this business in today's more restrictive environment providing a strong risk-adjusted return particularly for the latest additions to the program. And with that I'll turn it over to Kevin. Hi, Eric. It's Matt. I guess I can speak to that one a little bit. As Ben mentioned, we're really trying to preserve that spread of 100 to 150 basis points between cap rates and development yields. And so mid to high six is a reflection of where we think. It's very hard to know where spot cap rates would be today. I think that we had a pretty good sense of where they were over the summer when transaction activity has started to pick up with the most current rise in rates. It's a little bit of a guess but if you think cap rates are maybe in the mid-5s then that would translate into development yields in the mid to high 6s to preserve that spread. It does vary by product type and by region of course. But -- so that's really kind of the thinking behind that. And as it relates to what percentage of the current book meets that threshold it's actually hard to say because things are moving around so much. And what we found is that until we have CDs permits in hand hard drawings to bid on the street we don't really know where hard costs are today. They are starting to come down but you don't necessarily realize that on an estimate that you really want to realize that when you're ready to go. So, what I would say is we have plenty of deals that do clear that hurdle. And indeed we just started two deals this quarter. We're in the mid-6s. And we have at least a couple more that could start over the next couple of quarters that we think are kind of in that position. We do have some that on the most current underwriting from six to 12 months ago will probably fall a little bit short of that. And in many of those cases, we're hoping that with some value engineering maybe some changes to the land economics with the landowner and changes in hard costs that by the time those deals are ready to go they will meet that. Sure. It's Matt. I'll speak to that one. So again, just taking a step back here we sold $445 million worth of assets this year including one \u2013 our last dispo, which will close at the end \u2013 close next week. And those were at a kind of a blended average cap rate in the high 4s. And those were kind of sold and priced throughout the year better pricing earlier in the year, softer pricing later in the year. We bought three assets for about $275 million, all in the last 60 days. Those cap rates were more like mid-4s. And I would say in no cases where the seller distressed. One of those cases we did assume some debt, which probably gave a little boost to the price. So \u2013 and all of those assets, if we \u2013 if they were to price in today's market would certainly price at a higher cap rate than that I don't know how much higher. But same with the dispose. And again what happened is we pivoted to being a net seller of assets so we sell first. And in many cases we're holding some of those proceeds for a 10/31 exchange and that's informing kind of our appetite on the buy side. So we were net sellers of $200 million or really more like $230 million after you factor in the assumed debt in terms of the cash proceeds we realized from it. The other thing I'd say is when you think about what we bought versus what we sold, it is a good illustration of what we're doing with our portfolio allocation. We sold the four assets out of our established regions they were on average 25 years old. We sold them at an average price of $450000 a unit and the average rents on those assets was $3300 a month. The three assets we bought were in Dallas and in the Greater Charlotte area. In all three cases, there are assets where we are able to add value through our operating platform in many cases. It's part of getting to operating scale in those regions. So we think that \u2013 while the cap rate is the mid-4s the yield is more like a 5. Between some value add, we're doing a little bit of light value-add with washer dryers and some hard surface flooring, but a lot of it is just bringing it onto our operating platform, as we get economies of scale in those regions. And those three assets on average are seven years old. We paid on average $245,000 a door, which is below today's replacement cost as Ben mentioned and average rent of $1,700. So a much more affordable price point which we think has a much better growth profile. Yes Steve yes we may well start a deal in the fourth quarter that would be on similar economics to the Q3 starts. Again we're 95% match funded on development underway today. So if we have deals that we think make sense we think we do have some room there. So I wouldn't be surprised if we have a similar level of start activity in Q4 to Q3 maybe whether it's one or two deals I don't know. When we think about 2024 I think you're probably right. It probably is more back half weighted based on kind of how the capital markets evolve and kind of our access to and pricing of new capital that would fund that business. But we've been in a again for us if we track to roughly $800 million in starts this year or maybe a little bit under that that would be a pretty light year for us and certainly lighter than what we expected going into the year which was the same last year. So we're at a pretty modest level of starts volume relative to our kind of long-run capacity and averages and that's a response to what we're seeing in the markets but I don't think we would view that as a significant level. I guess, I can try and take that one. It's -- we underwrite everything more or less the same which is we develop our own view of what we think the NOI is going to be and where we think the asset value would be. And so in the SIP frequently almost always the sponsor will provide a projection of NOI that we think is overly optimistic. And again, we have a lot of data that we can leverage to do good underwriting in these programs and the fact that we own and operate assets and have real rent rolls and everything else in all of these markets is one reason why we think that this is an appropriate place for us to invest and a prudent way and leverage our capabilities and our proprietary data. So we get their underwriting. We kind of -- I won't say we throw in the trash but we do our own underwriting. And based on that we come up with our own view of where we think the NOI would be for that asset very similar to, if it was an asset we were developing. And then we build in a margin of safety on that when we think about how high we're willing to lend in the capital stack under the expectation that again we're going to be paid back out of an asset sale in the back end. And we are prepared to step in at our lender basis. And have the view that if we have to step in at our lender basis, because they can pay us back that would not be a bad outcome for us from an investment point of view the basis we would be in that asset. So there are some assets we just wouldn't lend on, because we wouldn't be prepared. We wouldn't want to own them really under almost at any price. So that's one of our screens in the SIP. As it relates to acquisitions or development, it's kind of the same. We'll just look at where we think the deal should underwrite. And based on that we'll formulate a view of what we think is worth and make an offer and see if we can tie it up. Sure Brad it's Matt. I guess I'll speak to that a little bit. It is very regional. So, where we've seen hard costs come down say compared to this time last year, we've seen it a little bit here in the Mid-Atlantic maybe 5%. We've seen it in Boston maybe to a little bit more significant degree 5% to 10%. And I think we are starting to see it in Northern California, where it's just been very, very soft for a while now. We have not yet seen it in Seattle. We haven't yet seen it -- maybe a little bit in Austin but costs went up so much there that it's not I would say super meaningful yet. So, we haven't necessarily seen it as much in the Sunbelt markets yet Denver, Southeast Florida, but we think that it's coming there. And I would caveat that by saying for us and others that's what I was saying before. The best data is where you have a deal that's ready to go and you really can hard bid it. And we don't have deals that were hard bidding in every region at this very moment. So, it's hard to tell until you're at that place. So, we're getting kind of discrete data points. And where we have them it's very helpful because we do think again kind of like with the rents that gives us a little bit of an informational advantage to have a real sense for what's going on in real time. But it really does vary based on the regional dynamics within each region. Yes, Josh it's Matt. So the way we underwrite is we don't trend anything. So the reason why the current lease-ups are exceeding pro forma by so much, by 90 basis points is -- I mean basically, it's got to be one or two things. It's either rent growth between the time we started construction and the time, we leased it up which -- that is what it is in the current situation. Or in some cases, we were just too conservative in our initial underwriting. And even without market rent growth the offering that we put out there, got a bigger premium to the comps than what we had underwritten because we're pretty conservative in general. So when you think about the deals we're starting now and you ask where are they going to stabilize two to three years from now, when they lease up, the reason why they might outperform we might get a little bit of hard cost savings, that's certainly possible based on what I was saying although, we tend to buy it out pretty quickly. Or it could be rent less between now and then, or it could be just kind of a more favorable response from the market. So on average, over the long run, we tend to outperform by more like 20 to 30 basis points. So that's pretty consistent, but it will vary based on where we are in the cycle."

            "name": "Kevin O'Shea",
            "content": "Thanks Matt. Turning to the next few slides. We continue to enjoy tremendous financial strength and flexibility both from a balance sheet and a liquidity perspective. Specifically from a balance sheet perspective as you can see on slide 12, we enjoy low leverage with net debt to EBITDA of 4.1 times, which is below our target range of five times to six times. Our interest coverage ratio and our unencumbered NOI percentage are at near record levels of 7.5 times and 95% respectively. Our debt maturities are well laddered with a weighted average years to maturity of 7.5 years. And our development underway is nearly 100% match-funded essentially with yesterday's lower cost of capital, which in turn helps ensure that these projects provide earnings and NAV growth when they are completed and stabilized. In addition from a liquidity perspective as shown on slide 13, we continue to maintain a high level of excess liquidity relative to our open commitments for development and structured investment products as of quarter end. Specifically we enjoy $1.5 billion of excess liquidity. And so as a result, we continue to enjoy tremendous financial strength and stability and the flexibility to pursue attractive growth opportunities that may emerge across our investment platforms in the coming months. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ben. I mean in terms of -- Connor, are you talking about the third quarter update relative to the midyear reforecast? Do you have a page in our earnings release that we'll detail that for you and it is on Page 5? And you can see there that as you recall our midyear reforecast for core FFO for the year was $10.56. It's now $10.63 so $0.07, increase. If you kind of go down the line there you can see that $0.04 comes from improved same-store residential revenue $0.01 from improved same-store residential OpEx and then there are some puts and takes in terms of overhead and other that get you the additional $0.02 there. Sure. Rich, again, it's Kevin. So I appreciate the comment. It's an interesting question. We discuss and debate internally here. As you point out we are 4.1 times net debt-to-EBITDA levered relative to a five times to six times target range which is sort of a -- it's been a long-term target range that we've had for more than a decade, which speaks to sort of a normalized environment. If you look at 4.1 times, it's benefited from cash. If the cash weren't there we'd be kind of in mid-4s just as a further contextual comment. But more broadly, if you look back at the last four years or so, I don't think anyone would agree we've been in a normalized environment from the pandemic and its effects as it's moved through. And as you think about how things have played out this year we are at that low four times leverage level in part because of our capital decisions over the last few years. And this year's capital plan where we've essentially will have paid off about $750 million of debt this year and brought in about $750 million of new and recycled equity from the equity forward and the net disposition activity that's deleveraging and not necessarily reflective of a normal year but -- so this wouldn't have been our capital plan normally but it has proven to be the right capital plan for this year. And what that does is it gives us financial flexibility to deal with an uncertain and volatile capital markets environment liquidity and strength to deal with an environment where we may wish to be patient in terms of additional capital formation given the recent rise in debt rates. And I guess to the point that you're getting at it also gives us leverage capacity. To the extent we wish to seize upon certain investment opportunities whether they are in our established markets or in our expansion markets that we view as attractive where we can bring the strength of our balance sheet to bear and potentially rely on a greater than normal level of debt that may be attractive relative to those opportunities and lean into the balance sheet and generate some growth in that regard. So we are certainly willing and able to get to that five times to six times leverage in the right circumstances. I will note that there are sometimes when we've gotten there in less than desirable circumstances such as three years ago in the pandemic when -- we actually were 5.4 times net debt to leverage EBITDA in Q3 of 2020, but that's sort of preparing the balance sheet for a downturn. So given where we are it's a low leverage level, but we think it's appropriately, so because it gives us strength to deal with potential challenges that could happen ahead as well as strength to deal with potential opportunities that we hope will be in front of us."

            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "Thanks, Ben. As we start to look forward to 2024, I thought I'd provide some initial thoughts on two topics. First, I'd like to highlight a few macro factors that will support the performance of our portfolio in the coming year. And then second, share a few building blocks as it relates to the outlook for 2024 revenue growth specifically. Starting on slide seven, we believe our portfolio is well positioned as it relates to rental affordability, particularly as compared to other regions of the country and single-family for sale product. In Chart 1, you can see that rental affordability in our established regions is actually better than pre-pandemic levels, given the strong wage growth that's been experienced over the last few years. And in Chart 2, difference between the cost of owning the median-price home and median rent in our established regions has increased by roughly 10x if you look at the first three quarters of 2023 relative to the average during 2020, which certainly makes apartment living in a more attractive option in these regions. We've already seen the impact of this trend in multiple data points. For example, the volume of existing home sales in our established regions has declined by roughly 25% over the past year. And in our own portfolio, the percentage of move-outs to purchase a home has dipped below 10% this year well below the mid-teens long-term average. Moving to slide eight. Our portfolio is also relatively insulated from new supply particularly as compared to the Sunbelt. In our established regions, we expect new multifamily deliveries of approximately 1.5% of existing stock. And in the specific submarkets where we own assets, new supply is projected to be roughly 1% of stock. This bodes well for revenue growth in all market cycles, but is a particularly valuable attribute of our portfolio, if we experience a weaker economic environment during 2024. Transitioning to slide nine, I'd like to highlight four specific building blocks for 2024 revenue growth. First, the embedded growth in the rent roll from leases we've executed during 2023 stands at approximately 1.5%, which is above our long-term average at this point of the year. Second, our current loss to lease is roughly 2%, led by the East Coast at about 2.5%, while the West Coast and expansion regions trailed behind at approximately 1.5% and 70 basis points respectively. Third, we continue to drive incremental revenue from our operating model initiatives. For example, the September revenue from our Avalon Connect offering was about 40% greater than the average monthly revenue for the first nine months of the year and that monthly revenue run rate will continue to grow during the last two months of 2023 and throughout 2024. Lastly we're expecting a continued tailwind from the normalization of bad debt. During the first half of the year, underlying bad debt averaged approximately 2.7% as compared to the Q3 average of roughly 2% and we expect continued improvement as we move through 2024. The benefit from an improvement in underlying bad debt will be partially offset by the loss of rent relief we've recognized in 2023, but still be a net meaningful benefit for 2024. Taken together these building blocks should support healthy revenue growth during the upcoming year. So with that, I'll turn it over to Matt to address our lease-up activity and structured investment platform. Matt? Yes, Eric it's Sean. Good question. Good crystal ball question I guess I'll characterize it as. But we sort of do two things. We have a macro view and then there's sort of a grassroots bottom-up approach. From a macro perspective in terms of providing commentary today, that's probably where it's been a time which is -- based on what we know today we would anticipate that from a demand standpoint things would decelerate as we move into 2024 just given what we've been seeing in terms of the expectation for slower job and wage growth and other potential headwinds as it relates to whether it's oil prices, obviously, interest costs, student loans, et cetera et cetera. There's a number of macro factors that appear to be more headwinds. We take a really good look at the native consensus forecast for a number of macroeconomic variables at multiple points throughout the year. But certainly when we get into January, the latest forecast helps drive our outlook for 2024 like it does for pretty much every calendar year. And we line that up with what we're seeing on the ground in terms of what actually is going to deliver as we rescrub our supply pipeline et cetera to try and estimate what affected market rent growth would be based on the algorithms we use. So, it really is again a sort of macro top-down as well as a bottoms-up approach depending on the variables that you're looking at. In terms of today it's hard to provide an estimate other than as I mentioned we would expect a softer demand environment in 2024 as compared to 2023 based on the current sort of consensus outlook for macro variables. Yeah. Austin good question, I'd say, it's kind of a mix of those answers frankly. At the early part of the third quarter, I would say it was more a reflection of our efforts to build occupancy which was successful in a number of markets. Combined with I'd say one or two places that continue to remain saw often even a little softer as we got to the end of the third quarter. And that was certainly important to Northern California is the primary region where we experienced that. So really a combination of two things as it relates to what you saw in rent change through the quarter as well as into October. Yeah. John its Sean. Good question. There's, a couple of different answers to that. So, first, as it relates to what you saw in Seattle which also occurred by the way in the Mid-Atlantic and Denver is that we're starting to get into a period particularly as we get further into the fourth quarter here where the comps are easier on a year-over-year basis. And that's a reflection of the step-up that you saw in rent change in those three regions in a more meaningful way particularly in Seattle as you may have noticed. Whereas in Northern California most concentrated in San Francisco, I would say, which is only 30% of our current portfolio. Things did soften more so particularly as we got to sort of mid-September into October and that's what's reflected in the rent change, you saw as it continue to tick down through the quarter and then more meaningfully into October. And I think there's a couple of things there. One is San Francisco just to pick on it since everyone seems to like to lately it's -- there's a number of different headwinds there as I think we're all well aware of probably not the best time of the year to be seeing some elevated demand there. It's just not the case. And there's not really a great reason for people to be coming back to the office at this point still. So fundamentals have remained weak and they did get weaker as we moved through the quarter into October. So trying to know exactly what's underneath that other than weaker demand overall. It's hard to be precise, but I'd say, we did not see the same level of weakness in Seattle and you combine that with the year-over-year comp in Seattle and that's why you saw the uptick there. So Seattle is still not strong. But on a relative basis compared to last year for example there was a lot of short-term leasing activity throughout the year and then burned off in the third quarter. Put more pressure on rates at the end of Q3 and Q4. We didn't have a lot of that short-term demand in 2023, and therefore, the year-over-year compensation is easier. So not to get too far into the weeds, but that's some insight into what you saw in a place like Seattle as compared to Northern Cal. Sure. So on the first question as it relates to bad debt, so 2023 if you look at the beginning of the year to sort of where we're trending today just sort of rough justice there's about 100-basis-point improvement in underlying bad debt roughly 3% down to sort of trending around 2% today. We've seen improvement across almost all regions Florida kind of being the outlier as you noted. But I think what we've seen in 2023, there was meaningful improvement in a market like Southern California, which started the year at roughly 6% and now we're below 3%. As compared to some other regions has certainly improved, but it improved at a more modest rate. So as we look forward to 2024, I think the expectation for continued improvement is there, but it may be at a slightly lower rate than what we experienced in 2023 given the meaningful improvement that we experienced in Southern California. And now we're down to some regions like New York as an example where things are moving a little more slowly. So the pace of improvement throughout 2024 may be slightly lower than what we experienced throughout 2023 if that makes sense. But the other thing to keep in mind is that we will have some meaningful improvement but it will be partially offset by the loss of rent relief that's going to be call it, roughly $7 million that we're not expecting to recognize in 2024 that we did recognize in 2023. So these are some of the building blocks as it relates to bad debt that hopefully are helpful. As it relates to Florida specifically, what I would tell you is where we've seen elevated bad debt, and frankly, it's been beyond our expectations. It's really been in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, the West Palm Beach market has held up kind of where we would have expected it would have been, but it has been elevated in the other two markets beyond what our expectation was. Yes, D.C. proper there's a number of issues there. As it relates to primarily, what you've got is sort of a seasonal issue. We have probably three assets there that have exposure to the student population near AU or other universities. And so you typically see that occur sequentially during that quarter and then it bounces back in Q4. That's the most meaningful component. There are other miscellaneous things as it relates to supply and number of submarket and other things that you could overlay on top of that but by far the sequential change for the student population is the most meaningful one. Yeah Michael, it's Sean. I'll take those. So in terms of customer behavior, I'd say the trends we've seen this year have remained relatively consistent. As I mentioned earlier in response to a question in my prepared remarks move-outs to purchase a home is well, well-below long-term averages sub-10% and has been below there for some time now. So not surprising given everything you're experiencing in the single-family for sale market in terms of run up in values and REITs and now the slowing market, et cetera people not terribly inclined to purchase a home and renting is not only more affordable but if you're a risk-off mode you may not want to consider it anyways. Nothing else notable I would say in terms of customer behavior at this point in time. As you noted, the year-over-year comp does get easier as we proceed further into Q4. So a little bit of that as I mentioned in October as it relates to the uptick in rent change in the Mid-Atlantic, Denver and Seattle regions. And we do expect rent change to somewhat stabilize as we look at November and December. And while it won't be anything that's super terrific in terms of a significant rebound as an example, it should be more stable than what we experienced last year based on what we know today. Yeah. Good question. As it relates to property taxes, which are about 35% of our expense structure we do expect another elevated year of tax pressure in 2024, most of it related to the expiration of those tax abatement programs that we experienced this year. And the level of impact next year will be relatively similar to 2023. As it relates to tax rate, or just tax growth in the Sunbelt or our expansion regions versus the saves regions independent of the exploration of the tax abatement programs. Certainly I would expect more pressure in the expansion regions and the Sunbelt in general given the significant run-up in values that they have experienced over the last three years relative to the established regions. I think that's pretty clear. There's always a lag effect. So the question is just, which market, which submarket tax jurisdiction et cetera, but certainly expect more pressure in those regions as compared to our established regions, which is still the majority of our portfolio. Thank you. Yes, Steve, it's Sean. I can take that one. I mean we do expect 2024 to be another somewhat elevated year primarily due to a few factors I can touch on. One I mentioned earlier property taxes which is about 35% of our expense structure. We do expect it to grow at an elevated rate due to the expiration of those tax abatement programs that I mentioned previously. The pilot burden in 2024 the burn-off there is relatively similar to 2023 before we see it begin to step down in 2025. Utilities, which is about 12% of the expense structure the continued implementation of our AvalonConnect offering which is a profitable endeavor. We're expecting kind of $25 million of incremental NOI from that program, but it is a burden on OpEx growth as it's being implemented and we do expect that to be continuing through 2024 as well. And then two other sort of pressure points really are going to be insurance even though it's only 5% of OpEx. It's still a difficult market. We'll be trying to mitigate that pressure through the use of our captive and other strategies to help offset it relative to market growth rate, but it's still may be elevated relative to sort of normal trends. And then the last one is the repairs and maintenance and legal costs, which I mentioned earlier is a result of continuing to move out sort of the nonpaying residents and puts pressure on turn costs legal and eviction cost et cetera. Some of that will be offset by continued benefits from the initiatives particularly on the payroll side of things. But certainly, we won't be able to offset all those other macro trends that we'd see occurring in 2024 similar to 2023. Yes. I think the elevated relative to history is the operative statement there. I think that's appropriate. There may be a little bit of relief in some areas. Like in utilities we should have some better contracts in 2024 relative to 2023. But we still do have the AvalonConnect offering. Again, it's profitable but moving through the year. So I think your phrase is generally in the ballpark. One maybe just to add one thing, I'm not sure this is exactly where you were going but we do try to apply what we think is sort of a market-based underwriting given our standards. Matt was mentioning earlier, we may be buying a deal of what we think is -- we'll pick a number of 4.5 cap five cap 5.5 cap, above when we bring it on our operating platform we made use of 50, 60, 70 basis points from our own sort of operating platform. We would not underwrite the benefit of it being on our platform and have that reflected in the value of the asset. It would be based on sort of a standalone asset with sort of market-based underwriting with our scrutiny of it if that's where you're going. Yeah, Brad, good question. I don't know if there's a normal per se for October. But I mean generally what I would describe for rent growth throughout the year is that a typical seasonal bell curve. We typically see rents went up from January to July or August a 7% range or an average year and then they decelerate down by 4% or 5%. For this year, if you look at it sort of on average point-to-point from January through year-end you might see effective market rent growth in the 2.5% range somewhere in that ballpark. And what I would say in general about what we've seen in the back half of this year is slightly less seasonality across most markets with one exception being Northern California that has been more seasonal than normal relative to its history. Yes. It's Sean. Just -- I didn't provide specific insight into the expectation for new move-in lease rates in Q4. The one data point we did provide is that renewal offers went out in the 6% range. And similar to what we've been seeing in the last few months, I would expect them to settle sort of in, call it, 150 to 200 basis points dilution off of that, so kind of 4% range maybe 4.25%. One thing to keep in mind that I mentioned earlier is the comps do get a little bit easier in November and December, and that's why in markets like the Mid-Atlantic Denver and Seattle you saw an uptick in rent change in October. So all else being equal we expect sort of relatively, I'll call it, stable glide path through year-end as it relates to lease rates. The earn-in -- we provided kind of a snapshot of the earn-in on the slides that we presented or posted last night at about 1.5. My expectation based on what I know today is that may soften a little bit between now and year-end but haven't necessarily put a number to it yet. Yes, that was posted on the slide as well. We recorded loss to lease roughly 2% led by the East Coast markets north of 2 and then the West Coast and expansion regions trailing roughly 1.5 points and around 70 basis points in the expansion regions. Yes. The one market I mentioned a couple of times earlier that has been softening more recently is Northern California, most notably San Francisco but to a lesser extent San Jose as well. Yes, good question. I'd say, what -- where it's coming from for the most part is a blend of Southeast Florida and what we've experienced a little bit, that's going to be coming online in the Texas market where it's a more challenging environment is in Charlotte, which as you may have noted the expansion region rent change is negative. That is effective with the Charlotte market. Three assets. In the south end of Charlotte, there's a lot of supply coming online there. It's a great submarket. We love the submarket. When we bought the assets, we knew there would be a fair amount of supply in the first two or three years of ownership, which is what we're experiencing today, but we believe we acquired them at good values. So it's probably a little too early to tell you what 2024 is going to look like there specifically. But anything that's coming through will probably be Texas and maybe a little bit in Southeast Florida and really not much if anything. And we might even be in a gain deli situation in Charlotte. I don't believe we did, but we're trending in the same general range in terms of economic occupancy kind of in that 95.7% range or so. Take care."

            "name": "Ben Schall",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. In keeping with our custom, we posted a presentation last night to accompany our earnings release. In addition to my opening comments, you will hear from Sean on our operating performance and revenue building blocks for 2024; from Matt on the significant earnings being generated by our development projects and lease-up; and from Kevin on the strength of our balance sheet. I want to start with my thanks to the AvalonBay team and our 3000-plus associates for delivering another strong quarter of financial performance and operating results. Particularly in the current environment of higher interest rates and uncertain cap rates, we are laser-focused on driving cash flow growth from our portfolio. The bottom line results from our operating model transformation led by our on-site and centralized teams and powered by our technology, revenue management and data science teams and proprietary systems continue to outpace expectations. Our strong operating performance also speaks to our portfolio positioning, which is 70% suburban and primarily in suburban coastal markets, which continue to benefit from a combination of steady demand and limited new supply. Turning to Slide 4 in the presentation. We grew core FFO by 6.4% in Q3, which was $0.06 ahead of our expectations. This outperformance was primarily driven by better-than-expected revenue growth, which positions us well, as we enter the traditional slower leasing season. As shown on the bottom of Slide 4, we have raised $855 million of capital this year at a 4.3% initial cost, which includes the drawdown of our $500 million equity forward, which we priced at $250 per share and with the remainder coming from asset sales that we've sold at an average cap rate of 4.7%. We completed three development projects in Q3, two in suburban submarkets in the Northeast and one in Miami at a 7.2% stabilized yield. As Matt will emphasize later, our lease-up communities continue to outperform our original expectations by a wide margin. These projects are funded with yesterday's capital, at yesterday's capital cost and are slated to generate outsized value creation and earnings for investors. We also started two projects this quarter, one in Princeton, New Jersey and one in South Miami, with projected yields in the mid-6% range. I will come back to our positioning on new development and capital allocation at the end of our prepared remarks. In Q3, we made $50 million of commitments under our structured investment program or SIP and feel fortunate to be building this book of business in today's environment with these new commitments generating an attractive 13% return. Slide five provides the breakdown of our Q3 revenue outperformance relative to guidance from the end of July with a 30 basis point uplift from higher-than-expected occupancy, 20 basis points from higher rates and 10 basis points from improving bad debt. Turning to slide six. We've exceeded and raised guidance three times this year. We now expect core FFO to grow 8.6% in 2023, which is 330 basis points above our initial expectations for the year. Same-store revenue growth expectations are up 130 basis points. Expenses are down slightly, leading to NOI growth of 6.3%. And with that, I'll turn it to Sean to comment on the favorable demand and supply drivers in our markets and provide a fuller operating update. All right. Thanks, Kevin. We have consistently maintained a strong balance sheet throughout cycles. And as a result, we are well prepared for the current environment. As we have shown over the past couple of years, we proactively adjusted our capital sourcing and capital allocation activities based on changes in the environment as emphasized on slide 14. We locked in our equity forward in early 2022 to pre-fund future development activity. We shifted in the second half of 2022 and in 2023 to be a net seller of assets with a portion of the proceeds being utilized to fund acquisitions as we reshape the portfolio and the balance to fund accretive development. And we have continued to be responsive in adjusting our development start activity, reducing starts last year and this year as our cost of capital changed. As we've emphasized, we are 95% match funded on our development underway, which means all of that capital has already been raised at an attractive initial cost and allows us to deliver projects in 2024 and 2025 that will generate significant earnings and value. On a go-forward basis, we have raised our return requirements on new development. For a standard development deal, our target return was in the low to mid-6s in the middle of the year and is in the mid- to high 6s today. These target returns are up over 100 basis points since last year with the goal of underwriting 100 to 150 basis points of spread between development yields and market cap rates. We expect to be in the lower development -- we expect to be in a lower development start environment in the coming quarters and with spreads at the tighter end of this range after a number of years of outsized development profit margins. And while in the current environment we're focused on maintaining our balance sheet strength, we do believe that we are well positioned given our low leverage, ample liquidity and unique strategic capabilities to capitalize on opportunities that might result from market dislocations. In the near term, while volumes are modest, we're able to deploy capital at double-digit returns through our SIP program. Slide 15 concludes our prepared remarks with our key takeaways. We continue to deliver strong operating results with tailwinds specific to our suburban coastal markets incremental NOI to come from our developments and lease-up and all supported by a fantastic balance sheet. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions. Austin, I'll start with that. It's Ben. So on the developments we have underway we do have strong conviction that those are going to continue to create meaningful earnings and value. And we obviously got good visibility there on when they're going to be delivering. And as we head into 2024 and 2025 do expect a fairly significant ramp-up of that activity. It may not be quite at the same outperformance levels that we've seen over the last year but still expecting strong performance out of that pool. As we think about new capital and the decision-making process there on the development side I think we've been very clear. We want to make sure if we're going to undertake new development that there's a sufficient profit margin relative to underlying market cap rates another way of saying we want to make sure there's sufficient profit margin to where we could buy an asset. And in today's environment there's, been opportunities in both. There are certain markets and certain projects that we've been able to structure for new development where we're able to obtain sufficient spreads and there are other markets and you saw this in some of our acquisition activity over the last quarter to, as an example in Dallas where we're able to buy assets below replacement cost and start to build the portfolio in those markets. So it's a multifaceted approach. We're fortunate in that we have multiple levels to grow overtime. And as we've emphasized what's on us as a team to make sure that we continue to stay flexible in that approach and change our approaches depending on what's happening in the market environment as well as what's happening with our cost of capital. Yeah. Yeah, Adam, we sent them out at 6% for November, December, which is relatively consistent with what we quoted for where we were for the 2 months of Q3 on the last call. We have seen in some markets a little more degradation in terms of the committed offer to realization, but it's still within sort of the 150 to 200 basis point range what we're seeing renewals come in at 4% to 4.5%, depending on the more recent time period you're looking at. Yeah. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, has been trending below 10% all year. It's about 9.5% in Q3. I think we're roughly 9% for Q2. So it has been trending down. As I mentioned, the long-term average is kind of in the mid-teens, and it's been as high as the sort of high teens kind of pre-GFC. Yeah. Good question. In terms of pre-COVID levels, which are typically call it, 50, 60 basis points for us, the question is whether it's going to be a new normal or not. I think probably the industry expectation is given various regulatory changes that have occurred in most markets across the country that it might be ideal to get back to 50, 60 basis points, maybe 70, 80 is more realistic. I don't think we really know yet. And in terms of the time to get there, certainly, what I would say is I don't believe we'll get back to full stabilization by the end of 2024. I would expect it to carry into 2025. And what we really need to see is a little more movement as it relates to cases moving through the courts, particularly in markets like Maryland, D.C. and the Greater New York region. As I mentioned earlier, we've seen significant progress in Southern California. 6% bad debt down sub-3% now. We haven't seen anything like that in terms of percentage improvement in some of the other regions I just mentioned. Yeah. Good question, John. We can. We have seen some of that this year as reflected in what we've posted in terms of cost because there's yeah, just greater damage in the units. And obviously, you might do billing damage receipts back to the resident, but then you're pretty much immediately writing it off because you're not collecting it. So I would say that, that has been elevated this year, and I would expect that along with legal and eviction costs to also remain elevated in 2024. It may not be a significant growth rate from 2023 to 2024 but it should remain elevated in both categories. Jamie, it's Ben. I'll step in. We're not seeing distress at this point. We do expect there to be some dislocation that comes through the system. And on the buying side, a couple of different areas in which we're hunting. One is what Matt talked about places where we can be adding to the density of our portfolio assets and nearby, other assets places where we can add incremental value by bringing the operating initiative activity over to our acquisitions, so that's very much top of mind. Another potential pool and we've been staying close to potential opportunities here are deals and lease-up that maybe are coming up against nearer term loan maturities. What we've been seeing there to date is situations where equity capital is putting more equity into those deals, effectively recapitalizing them and/or lenders who are agreeing to extend out those loans. And so, what you're finding is the borrowers and lenders are agreeing to say extend, it out you get the step-up in the interest rate not going to be a lot of cash flow generated off of the asset, but better to extend there, get the asset fully leased then monetize it, at least for the types of assets in the markets that we're looking to acquire in. Now, that won't be the case right for all types of equity. There's going to be equity that doesn't have the ability to put in more capital and it won't be the case for all types of lenders, right? There's only certain profiles of lenders that can extend out. So, it's an area that we are staying close to. Quickly on kind of two other areas of opportunity, one on the land side. So our developers as Matt talked about today are actively reworking our existing pipeline, recutting deals, restriking deals. We're also out looking for new land opportunities. And the current capital environment and our expectations for what that capital environment will be over the next year, we expect to see opportunities there. Apparently, there's going to be less competition from merchant builders in those markets. So, it'll be selective, but that could be a fruitful area. And then the third area of opportunity is providing capital to the third-party developers. And we have two programs there, DFP and SIP. We'll be selective. But for sure, in terms of the quality of sponsor, that's approaching us the quality of the real estate that they have under control and the return profile of those deals, all of that is enhanced in this environment. And so that's another place that we can deploy capital accretively. So, in the SIP, it's -- we have a target of building that book of business up to $300 million to $500 million over a couple of year period. Given the financing markets, it is tough for deals to pencil, but there are some that do. We are very selective. These are deals we're underwriting not to own them, but to be comfortable owning them if we need to. And in places where we can get a 13% return; we think that's a pretty attractive source of capital. So it's an area of focus. I wouldn't necessarily say it's an area we're looking to accelerate activity. We want to build that book up in a measured way over the next couple of years. Hey, Josh we're getting a lot of feedback on the call. Why don't you dial and we will get you back in the line. Joshua, if you could call back in \u2013 there is still static \u2013 line to the next participants, Okay. Hey Rich it's Ben. Let me make a couple of comments. First in terms of our long-term framework of moving 25% of our portfolio to our expansion markets that remains. Primary drivers of that; one the recognition that our core customer our knowledge-based worker is in a more dispersed set of markets. And second we can take what we do well bring it to those markets in order to generate incremental value for shareholders. In terms of pacing and timing, we are seeing softness. We're starting to see some dislocation in our expansion regions and we see it as a potential opportunity. It's an opportunity to potentially be buying assets below replacement cost which we have started to do and in a development market that maybe has less players in it or players that don't have the same access to capital or the same cost of capital that we do to be able to selectively step into some attractive development opportunities there. There could be -- you fast forward I don't think it's today where we'd be looking to accelerate our movement given where our cost of capital is, but there could be an environment at some point over the next couple of years where something more substantial does present itself and that could make -- that could at that point be the right risk-adjusted return decision. So it's on our radar. We're continuing to grow through our own development through acquisitions and funding of third-party developers and we'll keep our eyes out for larger opportunities as well. Sure. Yes Thank you and thank you, everyone for joining us today. We look forward to connecting further with you in November. Talk soon."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following remarks by the company, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your host for today\u2019s conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Doug, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon\u2019s press release as well as in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, this press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today\u2019s discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I will turn the call over to Ben Schall, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities, for his remarks. Ben?\nBen Schall: Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will start with an overview of our outperformance in Q2, speak to the limited new supply in our markets as compared to most other markets and then provide additional color on our guidance raise, our second raise of the year. Sean will speak to our underlying market fundamentals, including the progress we are making on bad debt and provide a further update on our operating model initiatives, which are exceeding expectations. And then Matt will highlight the continued outperformance of our new projects in lease-up and summarize our recent transaction activity, including the sale of three assets at a 4.7% cap rate. Our balance sheet is as strong as it has ever been with total liquidity of $3 billion, and Kevin is also here with us for Q&A. Turning to Slide 4 in the presentation that we posted yesterday. We achieved second quarter core FFO of $2.66 per share, which equates to a 9.5% growth as compared to last year and which is $0.07 per share higher than the Q2 guidance that we provided in April. I\u2019ll speak more to the underlying drivers of that outperformance in a second. We completed two new developments this quarter and started one new project. And as a reminder, early in Q2, we completed the exercise of our $500 million equity forward, capital we raised at $245 per share and has subsequently been investing safely at rates in the low 5% range. In terms of our outperformance in Q2, it was primarily revenue-driven with same-store revenue growing 6.3% or 110 basis points higher than we had anticipated, as shown on Slide 5. Lease rates and other rental revenue were modestly favorable to our prior guidance, partially offset by slightly lower occupancy. The most significant driver of the favorable variance was underlying bad debt, where we have been successful as our landlord rights have been reinstituted of getting back and re-leasing apartments that were previously generating no revenue. As we look forward, we continue to expect our portfolio, which is two thirds located in suburban coastal markets, to benefit from significantly less competitive new supply coming online than in the Sunbelt and other parts of the country. Slide 6 shows the magnitude of this differential, where starts in our established regions have remained stable over time, while Sunbelt starts have increased 50% since 2020. The ramification of this activity is that in 2023, new apartment deliveries will be almost 4% of existing stock in the Sunbelt as compared to only 1.5% of stock in our established regions. And this meaningful differential was set to continue in 2024. Moving to Slide 7. We are raising our full year guidance for core FFO to $10.56 per share, which equals a 7.9% increase over 2022. As a reminder, we increased guidance by $0.10 in April to $10.41 per share, which was attributed primarily to Q1 outperformance and the earnings benefit of accelerating our equity forward. The second increase of an additional $0.15 per share incorporates our outperformance in Q2 and reflects our latest revenue and expense forecast for the year, including improved expectations for bad debt. As part of this updated guidance, we have increased our same-store revenue growth expectation of 6%, kept expense growth constant at 6.5%, and the resulting same-store NOI growth outlook of 6% is up 175 basis points at the midpoint. For bad debt, we are now assuming underlying bad debt of 2.3% for 2023, an improvement of approximately 50 basis points from our initial estimates. As it relates to operating expenses, while the midpoint of our guidance remains the same, we expect lower payroll costs driven by our innovation efforts and lower repair and maintenance and property tax expenses to be offset by higher legal, eviction and bad debt costs as we reclaim apartments from nonpaying residents. The further breakdown of the increase from $10.31 to $10.41 and now to $10.56 per share is shown on Slide 8, with $0.14 coming from same-store NOI. We also continue to adjust our capital allocation approach based on the changing external environment. While our developments in lease-up continue to perform exceptionally well, we have raised our acquired returns on new development starts given our increased cost of capital and focused on maintaining 100 to 150 basis points of spread between underlying market cap rates and our projected development. Based on these factors and as part of our guidance update, we have reduced our expected level of starts in 2023 to 775 million from 875 million. On the transaction side, as part of our portfolio repositioning, we continue to take the tack of selling assets first, locking in that cost of capital and then pursuing acquisitions in our expansion markets. Given this cadence and given that we are remaining selective on the acquisitions that we pursue, our guidance now assumes that we\u2019ll be net sellers of assets this year with expected dispositions exceeding acquisitions by roughly $200 million. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it to Sean.\nSean Breslin: All right thanks, Ben. Continuing to Slide 9 to address recent portfolio trends. We\u2019ve experienced a steady improvement in underlying bad debt primarily due to nonpaying residents leaving our communities. In Q1, underlying bad debt was about 20 basis points better than we anticipated. In Q2, that favorable spread grew to approximately 65 basis points and represented an underlying rate of 2.3%, which was roughly 70 basis points better than Q1. The elevated volume of nonpaying residents moving out, which is certainly a favorable trend, led to an increase in turnover and modest decline in physical occupancy. Based on what we\u2019re currently experiencing, we expect a continued steady flow of move-outs associated with nonpaying residents over the next few quarters, which will further reduce underlying bad debt. As I\u2019ve noted in the past, our historical bad debt range is 50 to 70 basis points. So based on the Q2 rate of 2.3%, we\u2019re still approximately 170 basis points away from reaching what we might consider normal levels, which bodes well for revenue growth in future quarters. Moving to Slide 10 to address our updated revenue guidance, we increased the midpoint of our same-store residential revenue growth outlook of 100 basis points to 6%, which is supported by three primary drivers. The first is better-than-expected underlying bad debt, which is projected at a full year rate of 2.3% versus our original outlook of 2.8% and consists of 2.7% from the first half of the year and roughly 2% in the second half of the year. The second is a higher-than-projected average rental rate, which is primarily based on what we\u2019ve already achieved through July combined with the rent growth we expect to realize for the balance of the year. And the third is an increased contribution from our innovation efforts, which is helping to drive our projected 16.5% increase in other income for the full year. We expect economic occupancy to be modestly below our original expectations, trending in the mid-95% range in the back half of the year as we continue to recover homes from nonpaying residents. All our established regions are projected to perform at or above the high end of our original revenue growth estimate except for Seattle, which is projected to be modestly above the midpoint. Additionally, our East Coast portfolio is projected to outperform our West Coast portfolio by approximately 200 basis points for the full year 2023. Transitioning to Slide 11, we continue to make meaningful progress related to our reimagined operating model. As we indicated at the beginning of the year, we expected an incremental NOI benefit of approximately $11 million in 2023, which is on top of the roughly $11 million we realized in 2022. Currently, we expect to exceed our original 2023 objective by $4.8 million for a total incremental benefit of almost $16 million for the full year. The material drivers of the positive variance include the faster deployment and resident adoption of our technology services offering and the accelerated realization of staffing efficiency resulting from digitalizing customer-related processes. I\u2019d like to thank our operating and technology teams for their continued effort to drive our reimagined operating model and look forward to sharing more about the next iteration of it in future quarters. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Matt to address development.\nMatt Birenbaum: All right. Thanks, Sean. Turning to Slide 12, our lease-up communities continue to deliver outstanding results, laying the foundation for strong future growth in both earnings and NAV. We have five development communities that had active leasing in Q2, and those five deals are delivering with rents that are $520 per month or 18% above our initial underwriting. This, in turn, is driving a 70 basis points increase in the yield on these investments to 6.6%, well above current cap rates in the mid- to high 4% range and even further above the low 4% cost of capital we source to fund these deals when they started construction, consistent with our match funding strategy. Looking ahead, we expect to start leasing on an additional six communities before the end of the year, many of which are positioned to exceed our initial projections by a significant margin as well. As shown on Slide 13, with most of our development communities still early in lease-up or yet to open, we have clear visibility into a substantial future earnings growth stream from this book of business. Over the next six quarters, we expect to deliver an additional 3,600 homes, which are entirely match funded today, and which will drive incremental NOI growth and NAV creation on completion. To provide some additional insight into the transaction market, a summary of our recent disposition activity is shown on Slide 14. While we were able to close on three asset sales in the past few months, transaction activity is still relatively muted with total sales volumes off roughly 70% from 2022 levels. In general, cap rates on the assets that are selling tend to be below prevailing debt rates, although there are also listings that are not proceeding to closing due to a bid ask spread between seller and buyer. We were pleased with the results on these transactions and we\u2019ll look to redeploy a portion of the proceeds into some limited acquisition activity in our expansion regions as we resume our portfolio trading and continue to make progress on our long-term strategic portfolio allocation goal of a 25% weighting to our expansion markets. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ben.\nBen Schall: Thanks Matt. To wrap up, I want to thank our 3,000 AvalonBay associates for their efforts and dedication and delivering very strong results in the first half of 2023. As an organization, we have also incorporated our ESG activities into much of what we do, and I\u2019m proud that we are delivering on these initiatives with tangible and measurable progress across all of our key ESG metrics as shown on Slide 15. And as more fully described in our 12th annual ESG report, which we issued last Monday. Our final Slide number 16 summarizes our key takeaways for a very successful quarter. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator to facilitate questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Good afternoon. It\u2019s actually Nick Joseph here with Eric. So we saw the news that you were released from the RealPage litigation and it sounded like from other participants that this kind of case typically takes many years. I was wondering if you could kind of walk through the rationale that you provided that got you released and I guess, dismissed without prejudice. And then is this the end of it or are there other related cases that are still outstanding that involve Avalon?\nBen Schall: Yes, thanks Nick. And for the wider group, what Nick\u2019s referring to was the legal update that we provided in our earnings release yesterday. And as you pointed out, we are pleased we\u2019ve been dismissed from that class action lawsuit. Nick, at this point, given its ongoing litigation in the wider industry, we can\u2019t make any additional comments above what we included in our disclosure in the earnings release. The filings in the case are public. They\u2019re out there, the extent that you or others want research the matter further.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And is that the only case or were there other, I know there were a handful of kind of related cases. Is this \u2013 was this everything?\nBen Schall: We were dismissed from the consolidation of the class action lawsuits.\nEric Wolfe: Great. It\u2019s Eric. Just a quick one on development, I think that I know you mentioned that this year you were seeing a little bit less accretion from developments versus history just with less developments delivering. Just curious historically, how much accretion have you generated per year from development and would you expect to get back to that in 2024?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Hey Eric, it\u2019s Matt. I guess, I can speak to that one a little bit and then I don\u2019t know if Kevin wants to talk to the longer term trend there, but I mean, probably the easiest way to think about it is that as that slide showed, we\u2019re looking at 3,600 deliveries over the next six quarters. That\u2019s about 200 deliveries a quarter and that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, 200 deliveries a month. And that is probably double the pace of what we\u2019ve done over the last year or so. So, we\u2019re going to be getting twice as many apartments that we\u2019re going to be bringing online and ultimately generating NOI out of it.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Hi Eric. Thanks for that. This is Kevin I mean, obviously the level of accretion is a function of the volume of activity that we have underway and start and complete and the relative spread relative to our cost of capital. And so you kind of \u2013 you can look historically what that has been if we\u2019re \u2013 historically we\u2019ve often started at our current size level, maybe a billion and a half, maybe a touch less. We certainly aren\u2019t doing that this year as you know. But at that run rate at 150 basis points spread that generates, probably about 150 basis points or so, give or take of incremental core FFO growth per year. Obviously that moves around as things are delivered and as volumes change and spreads change, but that\u2019s just one way to think about that.\nEric Wolfe: That\u2019s helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Hey, good afternoon. As it pertains to lease rate growth trends, can you share a little bit more detail around how new lease rate growth trended in the second quarter to get to the 2.8% July? And then for renewals, how big is the spread been between asking rates and take rates? Because I think I recall in recent months you were sending out notices in the 7% range and it seems like maybe the take has come down a bit. Thanks.\nSean Breslin: Yes. Austin, this is Sean. Happy to talk through that a little bit. First on your second comment as it relates to renewals, the spreads do move around throughout the year and throughout various cycles. And so when we originally talked about offers kind of going out the 7% range and where we ultimately settled, you\u2019re talking about spreads that are within normal tolerances, typically 150 basis points or so. Sometimes a little bit less, sometimes a little bit more. I\u2019d say July was slightly wider. Q2 is slightly narrower. So I think we\u2019re in the relevant range as it relates to renewals, given the knowledge that it does move around depending on specific market conditions as the year evolves. As it relates to the first part of your question as it relates to move in lease rates we did provide a breakout for the quarter as it relates to move-ins versus renewals, which is at the footnote on the bottom of that attachment. And as it relates to how that\u2019s trending going forward, what I\u2019d say is that we were pushing pretty hard on rate through the first two quarters of the year. As we started to get back more inventory from those non-paying resident homes, we started to see the new move-in side begin to tick down, which is really what started to reflect in July, which was coming in at 2.8% for new move-ins as compared to what we experienced during the second quarter. So that\u2019s where we started to see a little bit of softness. But in terms of sort of baking the red roll for the full year and how it carries forward into 2024, I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape based on what we realized through June and even July, frankly, even though we did see some deceleration on the move-ins \u2013 new move-ins side of particular in July.\nAustin Wurschmidt: And so just unpacking that as it relates to the guidance, you \u2013 I think you said your rent growth assumption in 2023 was revised hire to reflect the growth route by, but the back half lease rate growth, is that unchanged to versus the original guidance? I guess can you just share what that revised rent growth assumption is for the year?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Here\u2019s how I describe it is we expect the average lease rate for the portfolio for the full year to be about 70 basis points higher than originally anticipated. Most of that is the result of what we have already achieved in terms of the expirations that we had through the month of July that are then cumulatively carrying forward through the balance of the year and our original outlook, we talked about the fact that we expected some modest deceleration in rent change as we moved through the back half of the year that\u2019s still the base case assumption for us, but what we\u2019ve realized through the first seven months of the year has been strong and will carry us forward through the balance of the year and that\u2019s how you get to that 70 basis point higher average lease rate for the full year.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the detail.\nSean Breslin: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Kramer: Hey guys, just wanted to ask about bad debt. Look, I think Slide 9 does really good job kind of giving the monthly trends. But it looks like July, what wasn\u2019t disclosed. But I think given the commentary and kind of the occupancy, the physical occupancy disclosure in the bottom left of that slide, it looks like that kind of fell in July. And just wondering if I should kind of read that as a sign of, hey, look a bad debt it kind of continued to trend lower in July or maybe some \u2013 I\u2019m missing something there and kind of extrapolating the occupancy into a bad debt read.\nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean we haven\u2019t provided July bad debt data just yet because it hasn\u2019t been fully closed out. We provided some preliminary estimates for July as it relates to rent change and things of that sort, which is what was included. So I think what probably is the easiest way to think about this is first half our underlying bad debt rate was 2.7%. In the second half, we expect it to be 2%, which reflects 2.2% in Q3 and dropping down to 1.9% in Q4. As it relates to occupancy, occupancy is correlated with the change in bad debt as we see skip and evict activity throughout the portfolio. So where we are for the second half of the year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks is an expectation that economic occupancy will average roughly 95.5%, which is modestly below our original expectation, but is congruent with the fact that we are getting back more non-paying resident units that we anticipated that\u2019s flowing through the turnover into occupancy but is also helping bad debt. So the two are correlated and so the expectation is again kind of mid-95s for economic occupancy in the second half based on our forecasted receipt of those non-paying units in the second half.\nAdam Kramer: That\u2019s super helpful. Really appreciate that. And just maybe on kind of I guess a little bit of a follow-up to Austin\u2019s question, but just on the new move-in like term effective rent change, it looks like a bit of a decel [ph] I think the 2Q number is really strong, a little bit of a decal going into July. Is that a year-over-year kind of comp issue? Is that a mix issue just with which leases kind of came up in the month? Is there maybe something else that\u2019s kind of driving that, that decel?\nSean Breslin: Yes. I think the primary driver is what I was referencing as it relates to Austin\u2019s questions, which is, we pushed hard on rate as it related to the first two quarters of the year. As you may recall, the eviction moratorium for LA expired at the end of March. So as we processed cases, we started to see more availability come into the portfolio in the latter part of the second quarter. And therefore, we started to ease on rates to then prompt more velocity in terms of leasing velocity of those incremental units. And so what you\u2019re seeing on the new move-in side in particular is in places like LA as an example, where there is more inventory coming back to market. As we get into July, we wanted to push that inventory through the system, get it turned, get it released, get it occupied before we get into the slower and softer frankly fall winter seasons. So that pressure on new move-in specifically is to help spur leasing velocity to absorb more inventory than normal as a result of those non-paying units coming back to us.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Thanks again for the time, really appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Thank you. On your bad debt, I just wanted to clarify is the 2% in the second half of the year on a gross basis or net of the resident relief funds you may expect to get. And then how long do you think it takes to get to a more normalized level? I think you mentioned 50 to 75 \u2013 50 to 70 basis points was kind of normalized.\nBen Schall: Yes. John, the 2% I mentioned is the underlying bad debt, ignoring the impact of rent relief, so to clarify that one. And then in terms of duration, I mean, it\u2019s a good question. We essentially process about, call it, 1,400 skips and evicts the first half of the year. Our expectation is for roughly similar pace, maybe slightly more on the second half. And but based on the number of outstanding accounts that we have at this point in time and the pace of activity, particularly in a state like New York, which is moving more slowly. I do expect it to carry through into at least, I\u2019d say, the first half of 2024. And then as you start to get to the back half of 2024 and 2025, I would expect to see normalization based on the pace we\u2019ve experienced thus far.\nJohn Kim: Okay, great. Thank you. Second question is on operating expense, I think you mentioned lower property taxes as part of your expectations for the second half of the year. Is that related to Washington state or are there other markets that are driving the lower taxes?\nBen Schall: Yes, Washington state is a big chunk of it, John.\nJohn Kim: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alan Peterson with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nAlan Peterson: Hey guys, thanks for the time. Sean, maybe a little bit more of a longer term question for you. You guys are ahead on a lot of the operation initiatives, particularly on the labor efficiency side. Does that start limiting the opportunity set in 2024? And if possible, could you quantify what the margin expansion opportunity is in the portfolio if it were fully optimized?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Good questions. So as it relates to the operating initiatives, when I talk about them first more holistically. At this point, based on what we have projected for 2023, we\u2019ll be about halfway through our plan as it relates to achieving about $15 million in incremental NOI with the balance of that to come through 2024 and into 2025. Beyond that, there are other things that we\u2019re investing in that we haven\u2019t talked about in significant detail as it relates to the use of AI, which you started several years ago and have been in R&D mode and other areas of the business, some other automation efforts and various other things that will help drive additional value NOI to the portfolio, which we would \u2013 we will be happy to talk about as we get further along with those. But I would say, as of right now, if you think about what\u2019s coming in the way of NOI assume there\u2019s another roughly $25 million or so to come as it relates to 2024 and 2025. That\u2019s kind of the high level summary where I\u2019d leave it, that includes more than just the staffing side of it. That includes all of it, that\u2019s underway at the moment.\nAlan Peterson: Appreciate that. And then just transitioning to the transaction market, Matt, across the conversations you\u2019re having with owners and brokers, are you expecting more distressed opportunities to appear within your established markets or in your expansion regions today?\nMatt Birenbaum: There\u2019s not a lot of distress that we\u2019re seeing out there yet in multi of any kind, honestly. I think if it shows \u2013 my guess is, it would be more likely to show up in some of our expansion regions where people were buying maybe with short-term value add business plans, where maybe they were borrowing short-term floating rate debt, thinking they were going to invest some money and improvements get a rent roll pop and then flip the deal out. So that business plan is not working for folks the way it had been. So there could be some pressure there or some kind of larger portfolios that people may have bought at a higher leverage point. There was just more of that transaction activity happening in the Sunbelt than in our coastal region. So maybe that means there\u2019s more opportunity there if some of that goes sideways, but it\u2019s pretty speculative.\nAlan Peterson: Appreciate that. Thanks for the time, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanket Agrawal with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSanket Agrawal: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my question. So as you saw that you guys brought development starts down by $100 million, so we just wanted some color on that. Like does it fall through the next year or like, did you guys cancel on couple of projects regarding that?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Hey, it\u2019s Matt. I\u2019ll speak to that one. Yes, it was really just one project that honestly, the returns got a little too tight relative to what\u2019s happened with cost of capital and asset values. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it as it relates to next year. We have a pretty robust pipeline, so we think we have the opportunity to increase our starts activity next year if things go the way we hope they will. So that was really just a deal specific situation there.\nBen Schall: Overall, this is \u2013 I just \u2013 this is Ben, just to add a couple of comments on our framework here. Overall, like you\u2019ve seen from us the last couple of years, the discipline that we\u2019ve had both around adjusting our capital allocation approaches based on the changing external environment, including our cost to capital, and then also a discipline around maintaining the spreads that we want between underlying market cap rates and our stabilized development yield. So when you hear Matt talk about a deal that we\u2019re moving from the system, that\u2019s us having those hard conversations to make sure that we feel like there\u2019s sufficient value being created for shareholders.\nSanket Agrawal: That sounds right. And I had a follow-up to that. Like we were talking a couple of guys on the private side and they said that developers have pulled back on the development team. Do you guys see the same things on the ground? Are you guys pulling back on development side or something like that?\nMatt Birenbaum: I think if you\u2019re talking about kind of personnel and overhead, we have seen a lot of the private merchant builders start to cut back in some markets, particularly the markets where start activity had been really elevated, some of the really hot markets. We have not been in that position. Fortunately, again, we\u2019ve had a relatively measured pace of start activity really for the last three or four years relative to our long-term kind of averages. And we\u2019re across a number of different markets and a lot of our markets honestly are less volatile. And so if you look at actually where our starts are heavier right now, at this moment, it tends to be in some of those northeastern markets where things didn\u2019t run up quite as hot and they\u2019re more steady kind of in a more stable environment as well. So we\u2019re not seeing those same kind of overhead pressures.\nSanket Agrawal: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. Sticking with that last comment about the northeast markets, I mean, you\u2019ve been particularly well positioned in both northeast markets and suburban the last couple years. How long do you think that outperformance of those markets can continue? And what are you watching that\u2019ll continue to give you confidence in that situation?\nBen Schall: Jamie, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments. As we think about the prospects for the various markets, and particularly our established regions versus the Sunbelt markets, the supply dynamics in our minds are going to continue to be a factor and a factor at this point into 2025. And that\u2019s just simply a function of start activity, the time it takes to then complete those deals and then the lease up of that activity coming through the system. So this will be something in our minds. And particularly if we are faced with an environment of flat or softening demand, the reality is those markets and sub-markets with higher level of supplies in our minds are going to face a softening operating environment.\nJamie Feldman: But I guess \u2013 yes, I mean that\u2019s helpful in terms of the data to watch. But like northeast has been incredibly strong versus other regions. What do you \u2013 what gives you confidence that it\u2019s going to continue? Or do you think like it does start to revert to mean at some point?\nBen Schall: I think we feel fairly confident on the demand and supply dynamics in our suburban coastal markets and that includes the northeast. On the demand side, there are elements of rent versus owning economics today, which stay very prevalent. And to some degree are \u2013 if you look at the rent versus own spreads, the northeast has some of the highest levels there. It could be $1000 more a month to own a home versus rent a home given where you see home prices go and borrowing costs run. And those are markets where it\u2019s very difficult to build new single family supply, right, once that part of the process starts back up. So yes, I think we \u2013 that\u2019s a factor gives us confidence. And then as you think about kind of reversions to long-term means, the northeast and other suburban coastal markets just haven\u2019t had the run-up that we\u2019ve seen in other markets. So there\u2019s an underlying stability there that also gives us confidence.\nSean Breslin: Jamie, one thing I would just add to that to give a specific example, if you think of Boston, which is a market that we\u2019ve been in for a very long time, very active developer. Certainly, there have been very good demand drivers there as it relates to a number of different industries, highly educated workforce, good income levels. Our predominantly suburban portfolio is pretty supply protected. Most of those towns have fulfilled their 40B affordable requirements. So there\u2019s not a lot of developments in the pipeline. That\u2019s the kind of environment where we can be successful in development, but also our existing portfolio is pretty insulated as it relates to exposure to supply and tends to produce solid growth. So that\u2019s a good example of one of those markets. If you think of New Jersey, parts of New Jersey, we\u2019re the first development going in, in 30 years. So while it may not have the growth rate on a stabilized basis that is as attractive as some West Coast markets when they\u2019re really moving along, the additional yield on that development and the total returns are quite attractive. So we\u2019ll continue to allocate capital there. So those are a couple of good examples as to why we think those markets are attractive.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. That\u2019s great. Very helpful color. And then you talked about having, I think you said the best balance sheet in your history, $3 billion of liquidity. The SIP activity was relatively light in the quarter. It sounds like from your comments on the Q&A that you\u2019re not seeing a lot of distressed activity out there. Just how do you think about putting capital -- more capital to work in that SIP book? And can you talk about the actual transaction you did during the quarter? Or what\u2019s in the pipeline? Maybe that will give us a sense of where distress might be coming? Or am I reading too much into that?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes, sure. This is Matt. I can speak to that. And I would say the SIP business is not a distressed business. Basically, we are lending to developers who are building multifamily assets, very similar to the multifamily assets that we build and own and operate. And we\u2019re just providing capital between the first mortgage construction loan and their equity. And where there\u2019s been distress is in the lending world. And so the amount of proceeds they can get off that first construction loan are lower than they would have been a year or two ago. And therefore, they either have to put in more equity or borrow a little bit more money from somebody else. So in that sense, what we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s changed is, we\u2019re going lower down the capital stack. So we\u2019re lending from maybe 50% to 75% cost instead of 60% to 85% cost like we would have been doing a year or two ago. And we are happy with the fact that we\u2019re just building that book of business today, and so we can underwrite it in today\u2019s environment. The deal that we just closed on is a suburban garden community in Charlotte, actually fairly near the DFP deal that we started construction on in the first quarter, north of Charlotte. And that\u2019s with a sponsor who is really first-class sponsor who actually have a DFP deal working with as well that we hope to start next year. So it\u2019s a repeat business situation. And that\u2019s pretty representative of the type of business that we\u2019re looking for. That rate is kind of 12-ish, yield is around 13, a little bit more higher than 13. Just given the fees involved, that would have been 10 as opposed to 12 or 13 if it had been a year or two ago. So we are seeing a lot of inbound inquiries on that program. The challenge is finding deals that underwrite, just given kind of where asset values are relative to replacement cost. And that\u2019s part of what we\u2019re seeing in terms of developers finding it much more difficult to put their capital stack together, which ultimately is slowing start activity. But the good news is, we have our pick of the litter and really top quality sites and sponsors. The challenge is finding deals that underwrite because we\u2019re not really bending in terms of the quality of the underlying collateral and how high it will go in the capital stack to lend against it.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. Have you set a limit on how much you\u2019d want to do that, assuming or did come your way, whether it\u2019s a balance sheet or anything else?\nMatt Birenbaum: Our long-term goal is to have that plan be a $300 million to $500 million book of business and build that up over the course of several years. I think today, we\u2019re at a little bit less than $100 million in commitments total. So, we\u2019ve got room to run there.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Dennerlein: Hey guys, thanks for the time. [Technical Difficulty] what\u2019s driving the thinking behind that decision?\nBen Schall: Josh, you cut in and out on the question. Can you repeat that, please?\nJosh Dennerlein: Yes, sorry. You mentioned in your opening remarks, you\u2019re now a net seller in guide. What\u2019s driving the thinking behind becoming a net seller this year?\nBen Schall: Part of it\u2019s just been our approach and we made this shift last year to selling first the market. There\u2019s uncertainty there. There\u2019s not a lot of capital that\u2019s in play. So we wanted to take some assets to market, execute on those, lock into that cost to capital and then make the decisions around how we\u2019re going to redeploy that capital. We are remaining pretty selective today in terms of our new buying activity. And part of that is, while to Matt\u2019s point, we\u2019re not expecting distress. Our view is that over the next six months to 12 months, there likely will be a greater set of motivated sellers and potentially in our growth areas, in our expansion markets that could be particularly true. If you take a softening operating environment and combine that with a capital environment where capital is less abundant that could provide some attractive opportunities for a platform and a balance sheet like ours.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. Appreciate that color. And then for guidance, what are you guys assuming for new lease rate growth in the back half of this year? Does it turn negative at any point on 4Q?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Josh. This is Sean. We didn\u2019t provide specific guidance as it relates to new lease rate growth, excuse me. Well, we did say at the beginning of the year, which I would just reaffirm now, is that we did expect to see solid rate growth for the first half, which we have realized, and then begin to see some modest deceleration and blended effective rent change in the back half of the year. And I think that\u2019s appropriate at this point in time in terms of where we are and what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the inventory come back to us from some of the [indiscernible] I think that\u2019s appropriate.\nJosh Dennerlein: Thanks, Sean.\nSean Breslin: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey, good afternoon. So two questions. First just going back to the RealPage, Ben is \u2013 are you guys totally out of any RealPage related litigation or is this just the consolidated? I\u2019m just, sorry, just want to get clarification. Is this just a consolidated case or are there other litigations that you guys are still party of related to this RealPage?\nBen Schall: There are no other litigations related to the RealPage that we\u2019re aware of that we have not been dismissed from.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay, thank you for that. Second question is on your outperformance of the developments, I\u2019m assuming a lot of this is based on your land basis. So as you look at your, the options that you\u2019ve struck on your development land pipeline, how many more years do you think that you\u2019ll have above average development returns based on how much rents have moved? Just sort of curious, is this just a one or two year phenomena? Or do you think this could be several years where your developments are outpacing traditional because of where you bought the land versus where rents are now?\nMatt Birenbaum: Hey, Alex. It\u2019s Matt. Really the outperformance that we\u2019re talking about is relative to our pro forma when we start the job. So the land price is already baked in there. It\u2019s really about the rents and the fact that we had rents run up pretty significantly over the last two years, at a pace particularly in some of these locations, again, some of these suburban coastal locations that were well above trend. We don\u2019t trend rents in the first place. So whenever we quote a yield, it\u2019s the yield as if, it\u2019s at today\u2019s NOI, today\u2019s cost, and then we don\u2019t remarket until we\u2019ve leased at least roughly 20%. So it is a little bit of a unique moment in time in the sense that we started those jobs. The hard costs were good because we bought them out kind of at the trough, if you will really maybe in front of when some of the hard cost inflation that we\u2019ve seen kicked in. But we enjoyed it on the rent side. So the going in yield on those, the underwritten yield I think was maybe a 5.9% and the rent growth has driven it to a 6.6%, so that\u2019s the 70 basis points of outperformance. When you look at the deals, the next six deals to start lease up as I mentioned, those deals also should have a pretty significant lift because again, there was a nice runup in rents between when we started them and when we\u2019re going to start leasing them. So we still should beat pro forma on those, maybe not by as much, but by a nice margin. And then when you start thinking about the deals that we\u2019re going to start in the next however many quarters, there it\u2019s more about just is it a good land basis? And is it a good hard cost basis? And are those underwriting to an initial 5.8, 5.9 [ph]? No, we\u2019re now looking for mid-6s typically, given what\u2019s happened to the cost of capital.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. Thank you.\nBen Schall: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, good morning, everyone. Matt, can you talk about how construction costs have trended of late? And what you\u2019re underwriting for increases in the future when you\u2019re underwriting new deals?\nMatt Birenbaum: Sure. I guess to the second part, how we think about the future, again, we tend to look at everything on a spot basis, so today\u2019s NOI, today\u2019s hard costs. Now there are some deals that we have in our system, which we signed up in the last couple of years that are thin at today\u2019s hard cost. And so in some cases, we are making the decision to continue to invest modestly in those deals to get them ready to go to see what happens to hard cost by that time because the reality of it is, it\u2019s very difficult to know where hard costs are until you actually have a deal ready to bid and subcontractors see that it\u2019s real. Ideally, there\u2019s even some demo or something going on so that, everybody is constantly asking them if I had a job to build today, what would it cost, but that\u2019s different than I do have a job ready to go today. I have the permits in hand; give me your best number. So what we\u2019ve seen is in some markets, particularly again, some of those markets that maybe didn\u2019t see quite the same excesses in terms of subcontractor capacity, again, particularly in the Northeast \u2013 suburban Northeast, where a lot of our dev starts are, we have seen costs come back maybe 5% to 10% and we\u2019ve enjoyed some buyout savings on some of our more recent starts. And so once we bought that out, then that is reflected in the way we underwrite the next deal in that region. There are other regions where hard costs, it seems like they\u2019re flattening out, but they haven\u2019t fallen yet, particularly some of the regions that saw \u2013 were just really struggling to keep up with all of the demand and all of the elevated start activity over the last couple of years. I would put Austin in that category. I\u2019d put Denver into that category. I\u2019d actually put Seattle into that category, where we saw hard costs run up a lot and have not yet come back to us. And so we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re certainly hoping that they do. We\u2019re seeing start activity start to slow down in those regions, but that may take a while before that plays through.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe for Sean; you say in the slides that two-thirds of the increase in turnover in the second quarter was driven by recapturing the delinquent homes? What\u2019s the other one-third and is there anything unusual in there?\nSean Breslin: Yes. No, good question, Brad. Nothing terribly unusual kind of it\u2019s a mess here and there across different categories, but nothing that stands out as sort of oh, there\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s something going on as it relates to relocation or things of that sort. Home condo purchase is still less than 10%, which is a historic low for us. So there\u2019s not much else in there other than sort of the normal stuff, family status, roommate changes, nothing else material I\u2019d say.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thanks.\nBen Schall: Yes.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks all for taking my questions. On Slide 10, you show the performance of the rent growth in different markets, and what\u2019s clear is that the expansion regions are kind of at the lower end of where you initially projected compared to pretty much every other market is at the higher end. So when you think about the expansion markets, does this \u2013 the fact that it kind of ended up being kind of at the lower end of your initial projection, change your view on the rate of expansion? Or how quickly you want to move there? And just your thoughts about diversifying the portfolio overall? Thanks.\nBen Schall: Yes. Thanks, Michael. I\u2019ll make a couple of comments. One, reaffirm our goal of moving 25% of our portfolio to the expansion regions over a period of five or six years. We\u2019ve talked before about some of the drivers behind that, too, just quickly to call out. One, our core customer, the knowledge-based worker, we recognize is in a more dispersed set of markets today than they have been in the past. And second, just think about an expanded playing field to take what we do well across operations, development to those new markets in order to create value for our shareholders. In terms of kind of pace and execution, goes to my comment earlier in the call, could be an opportunity here where there are some attractive \u2013 more attractive opportunities for us to enter into those markets, given some operating softening and given there\u2019s not a lot of other institutional capital that\u2019s active today. And so we\u2019ll continue to be selective, but I think we\u2019ll have the choice of what we want to own. On the acquisition side, we\u2019ve been tending to focus recently on assets that we think are going to complement our development portfolio in those markets. And so it\u2019s had us looking at acquisitions that are generally a little bit older in nature, lower in density, lower in price point with a particular focus on micro locations that we expect to have more limited supply coming. And then on the development side and gets in the land and the conversation we\u2019re having around construction costs, our hope is construction costs will start to come down. There are merchant builders who were accumulating large portfolios of land, and we are starting to see some of those deals come back. And so selectively, and I talked about this last quarter, we \u2013 in Boston and a recent deal in Florida, we\u2019ve been able to take land back at 30% to 40% from where it traded a year ago. So those are the types of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at, but this is a longer-term vision, and we remain focused on moving in that direction.\nMichael Goldsmith: That\u2019s very helpful detail. And my follow-up question is just on the performance of the suburban versus urban, are you seeing any differences in terms of how the tenant is reacting or kind of how the consumer is positioned in these markets and how that has translated to the results in those two different types of regions? Thanks.\nSean Breslin: Yes. Good question. And nothing unusual in terms of underlying trends that indicate any significant movement. I mean, we may \u2013 that may be different over the next two, three quarters. We are hearing more about people being called back to the office. Obviously, the Amazon announcement, which would have some impact on the \u2013 not only urban portion of downtown Seattle, but also urban Bellevue, where they have a large campus. So I think it\u2019s probably not a broader urban, suburban trend other than as it relates to where people are going to work. If it\u2019s a suburban job center location versus an urban building, that would be something that in the future may shift things a little bit one direction or another, but it\u2019s a little too early to tell.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you. Good luck in the back half.\nBen Schall: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good afternoon. Just a question on some of the markets, where you\u2019re getting back the apartments. You mentioned New York is one where it\u2019s moving a bit slower. Are there any other markets where you\u2019re seeing either delays or obstacles in getting back units?\nSean Breslin: I\u2019d say New York is really a little bit the outlier at the moment in terms of the processing of cases, whether it\u2019s Long Island or city or Westchester, it\u2019s just moving \u2013 everything is moving more slowly. The backlog is significant, but it\u2019s also significant in L.A., and L.A. seems to be moving along a little faster. So those are really the two markets and maybe to a lesser extent, a similar phenomenon is in the District of Columbia. We\u2019re seeing things move more slowly. So I\u2019d say New York is probably the outlier to the slow end followed by DC in terms of what\u2019s going on. The rest of them is sort of just chipping along.\nAnthony Powell: Got it. Thanks. And maybe a more basic question. When a tenant skips or is evicted, are they eligible for a new market rate apartment? I\u2019m wondering where these people are going and if we\u2019re going to see like lower demand overall for apartments given the elevated activity in this area across the industry in the past few months.\nSean Breslin: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. Different companies use different types of screening criteria, so I can\u2019t really speak to the market specifically on that subject. That really is something that from an industry perspective, you acquire a lot of conversations in terms of how people screen their applicants to make that decision.\nAnthony Powell: Are you seeing any more doubling up at any time as maybe some tenants who are living apartments have to live with roommates or anything like that in your portfolio?\nSean Breslin: Not any significant trends. That actually went the opposite direction through COVID. And we haven\u2019t seen a significant trend indicate people are doubling up.\nAnthony Powell: All right. Thank you.\nSean Breslin: Yes, you\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to hand it back to Mr. Schall for closing remarks.\nBen Schall: All right. Well, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Sean. Turning to Slide 12, our lease-up communities continue to deliver outstanding results, laying the foundation for strong future growth in both earnings and NAV. We have five development communities that had active leasing in Q2, and those five deals are delivering with rents that are $520 per month or 18% above our initial underwriting. This, in turn, is driving a 70 basis points increase in the yield on these investments to 6.6%, well above current cap rates in the mid- to high 4% range and even further above the low 4% cost of capital we source to fund these deals when they started construction, consistent with our match funding strategy. Looking ahead, we expect to start leasing on an additional six communities before the end of the year, many of which are positioned to exceed our initial projections by a significant margin as well. As shown on Slide 13, with most of our development communities still early in lease-up or yet to open, we have clear visibility into a substantial future earnings growth stream from this book of business. Over the next six quarters, we expect to deliver an additional 3,600 homes, which are entirely match funded today, and which will drive incremental NOI growth and NAV creation on completion. To provide some additional insight into the transaction market, a summary of our recent disposition activity is shown on Slide 14. While we were able to close on three asset sales in the past few months, transaction activity is still relatively muted with total sales volumes off roughly 70% from 2022 levels. In general, cap rates on the assets that are selling tend to be below prevailing debt rates, although there are also listings that are not proceeding to closing due to a bid ask spread between seller and buyer. We were pleased with the results on these transactions and we'll look to redeploy a portion of the proceeds into some limited acquisition activity in our expansion regions as we resume our portfolio trading and continue to make progress on our long-term strategic portfolio allocation goal of a 25% weighting to our expansion markets. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ben. Yes. Hey Eric, it's Matt. I guess, I can speak to that one a little bit and then I don't know if Kevin wants to talk to the longer term trend there, but I mean, probably the easiest way to think about it is that as that slide showed, we're looking at 3,600 deliveries over the next six quarters. That's about 200 deliveries a quarter and that's \u2013 I'm sorry, 200 deliveries a month. And that is probably double the pace of what we've done over the last year or so. So, we're going to be getting twice as many apartments that we're going to be bringing online and ultimately generating NOI out of it. There's not a lot of distress that we're seeing out there yet in multi of any kind, honestly. I think if it shows \u2013 my guess is, it would be more likely to show up in some of our expansion regions where people were buying maybe with short-term value add business plans, where maybe they were borrowing short-term floating rate debt, thinking they were going to invest some money and improvements get a rent roll pop and then flip the deal out. So that business plan is not working for folks the way it had been. So there could be some pressure there or some kind of larger portfolios that people may have bought at a higher leverage point. There was just more of that transaction activity happening in the Sunbelt than in our coastal region. So maybe that means there's more opportunity there if some of that goes sideways, but it's pretty speculative. Yes. Hey, it's Matt. I'll speak to that one. Yes, it was really just one project that honestly, the returns got a little too tight relative to what's happened with cost of capital and asset values. So I wouldn't read too much into it as it relates to next year. We have a pretty robust pipeline, so we think we have the opportunity to increase our starts activity next year if things go the way we hope they will. So that was really just a deal specific situation there. I think if you're talking about kind of personnel and overhead, we have seen a lot of the private merchant builders start to cut back in some markets, particularly the markets where start activity had been really elevated, some of the really hot markets. We have not been in that position. Fortunately, again, we've had a relatively measured pace of start activity really for the last three or four years relative to our long-term kind of averages. And we're across a number of different markets and a lot of our markets honestly are less volatile. And so if you look at actually where our starts are heavier right now, at this moment, it tends to be in some of those northeastern markets where things didn't run up quite as hot and they're more steady kind of in a more stable environment as well. So we're not seeing those same kind of overhead pressures. Yes, sure. This is Matt. I can speak to that. And I would say the SIP business is not a distressed business. Basically, we are lending to developers who are building multifamily assets, very similar to the multifamily assets that we build and own and operate. And we're just providing capital between the first mortgage construction loan and their equity. And where there's been distress is in the lending world. And so the amount of proceeds they can get off that first construction loan are lower than they would have been a year or two ago. And therefore, they either have to put in more equity or borrow a little bit more money from somebody else. So in that sense, what we're seeing that's changed is, we're going lower down the capital stack. So we're lending from maybe 50% to 75% cost instead of 60% to 85% cost like we would have been doing a year or two ago. And we are happy with the fact that we're just building that book of business today, and so we can underwrite it in today's environment. The deal that we just closed on is a suburban garden community in Charlotte, actually fairly near the DFP deal that we started construction on in the first quarter, north of Charlotte. And that's with a sponsor who is really first-class sponsor who actually have a DFP deal working with as well that we hope to start next year. So it's a repeat business situation. And that's pretty representative of the type of business that we're looking for. That rate is kind of 12-ish, yield is around 13, a little bit more higher than 13. Just given the fees involved, that would have been 10 as opposed to 12 or 13 if it had been a year or two ago. So we are seeing a lot of inbound inquiries on that program. The challenge is finding deals that underwrite, just given kind of where asset values are relative to replacement cost. And that's part of what we're seeing in terms of developers finding it much more difficult to put their capital stack together, which ultimately is slowing start activity. But the good news is, we have our pick of the litter and really top quality sites and sponsors. The challenge is finding deals that underwrite because we're not really bending in terms of the quality of the underlying collateral and how high it will go in the capital stack to lend against it. Our long-term goal is to have that plan be a $300 million to $500 million book of business and build that up over the course of several years. I think today, we're at a little bit less than $100 million in commitments total. So, we've got room to run there. Hey, Alex. It's Matt. Really the outperformance that we're talking about is relative to our pro forma when we start the job. So the land price is already baked in there. It's really about the rents and the fact that we had rents run up pretty significantly over the last two years, at a pace particularly in some of these locations, again, some of these suburban coastal locations that were well above trend. We don't trend rents in the first place. So whenever we quote a yield, it's the yield as if, it's at today's NOI, today's cost, and then we don't remarket until we've leased at least roughly 20%. So it is a little bit of a unique moment in time in the sense that we started those jobs. The hard costs were good because we bought them out kind of at the trough, if you will really maybe in front of when some of the hard cost inflation that we've seen kicked in. But we enjoyed it on the rent side. So the going in yield on those, the underwritten yield I think was maybe a 5.9% and the rent growth has driven it to a 6.6%, so that's the 70 basis points of outperformance. When you look at the deals, the next six deals to start lease up as I mentioned, those deals also should have a pretty significant lift because again, there was a nice runup in rents between when we started them and when we're going to start leasing them. So we still should beat pro forma on those, maybe not by as much, but by a nice margin. And then when you start thinking about the deals that we're going to start in the next however many quarters, there it's more about just is it a good land basis? And is it a good hard cost basis? And are those underwriting to an initial 5.8, 5.9 [ph]? No, we're now looking for mid-6s typically, given what's happened to the cost of capital. Sure. I guess to the second part, how we think about the future, again, we tend to look at everything on a spot basis, so today's NOI, today's hard costs. Now there are some deals that we have in our system, which we signed up in the last couple of years that are thin at today's hard cost. And so in some cases, we are making the decision to continue to invest modestly in those deals to get them ready to go to see what happens to hard cost by that time because the reality of it is, it's very difficult to know where hard costs are until you actually have a deal ready to bid and subcontractors see that it's real. Ideally, there's even some demo or something going on so that, everybody is constantly asking them if I had a job to build today, what would it cost, but that's different than I do have a job ready to go today. I have the permits in hand; give me your best number. So what we've seen is in some markets, particularly again, some of those markets that maybe didn't see quite the same excesses in terms of subcontractor capacity, again, particularly in the Northeast \u2013 suburban Northeast, where a lot of our dev starts are, we have seen costs come back maybe 5% to 10% and we've enjoyed some buyout savings on some of our more recent starts. And so once we bought that out, then that is reflected in the way we underwrite the next deal in that region. There are other regions where hard costs, it seems like they're flattening out, but they haven't fallen yet, particularly some of the regions that saw \u2013 were just really struggling to keep up with all of the demand and all of the elevated start activity over the last couple of years. I would put Austin in that category. I'd put Denver into that category. I'd actually put Seattle into that category, where we saw hard costs run up a lot and have not yet come back to us. And so we'll see. We're certainly hoping that they do. We're seeing start activity start to slow down in those regions, but that may take a while before that plays through."

            "content": "Hi Eric. Thanks for that. This is Kevin I mean, obviously the level of accretion is a function of the volume of activity that we have underway and start and complete and the relative spread relative to our cost of capital. And so you kind of \u2013 you can look historically what that has been if we're \u2013 historically we've often started at our current size level, maybe a billion and a half, maybe a touch less. We certainly aren't doing that this year as you know. But at that run rate at 150 basis points spread that generates, probably about 150 basis points or so, give or take of incremental core FFO growth per year. Obviously that moves around as things are delivered and as volumes change and spreads change, but that's just one way to think about that."

            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "All right thanks, Ben. Continuing to Slide 9 to address recent portfolio trends. We've experienced a steady improvement in underlying bad debt primarily due to nonpaying residents leaving our communities. In Q1, underlying bad debt was about 20 basis points better than we anticipated. In Q2, that favorable spread grew to approximately 65 basis points and represented an underlying rate of 2.3%, which was roughly 70 basis points better than Q1. The elevated volume of nonpaying residents moving out, which is certainly a favorable trend, led to an increase in turnover and modest decline in physical occupancy. Based on what we're currently experiencing, we expect a continued steady flow of move-outs associated with nonpaying residents over the next few quarters, which will further reduce underlying bad debt. As I've noted in the past, our historical bad debt range is 50 to 70 basis points. So based on the Q2 rate of 2.3%, we're still approximately 170 basis points away from reaching what we might consider normal levels, which bodes well for revenue growth in future quarters. Moving to Slide 10 to address our updated revenue guidance, we increased the midpoint of our same-store residential revenue growth outlook of 100 basis points to 6%, which is supported by three primary drivers. The first is better-than-expected underlying bad debt, which is projected at a full year rate of 2.3% versus our original outlook of 2.8% and consists of 2.7% from the first half of the year and roughly 2% in the second half of the year. The second is a higher-than-projected average rental rate, which is primarily based on what we've already achieved through July combined with the rent growth we expect to realize for the balance of the year. And the third is an increased contribution from our innovation efforts, which is helping to drive our projected 16.5% increase in other income for the full year. We expect economic occupancy to be modestly below our original expectations, trending in the mid-95% range in the back half of the year as we continue to recover homes from nonpaying residents. All our established regions are projected to perform at or above the high end of our original revenue growth estimate except for Seattle, which is projected to be modestly above the midpoint. Additionally, our East Coast portfolio is projected to outperform our West Coast portfolio by approximately 200 basis points for the full year 2023. Transitioning to Slide 11, we continue to make meaningful progress related to our reimagined operating model. As we indicated at the beginning of the year, we expected an incremental NOI benefit of approximately $11 million in 2023, which is on top of the roughly $11 million we realized in 2022. Currently, we expect to exceed our original 2023 objective by $4.8 million for a total incremental benefit of almost $16 million for the full year. The material drivers of the positive variance include the faster deployment and resident adoption of our technology services offering and the accelerated realization of staffing efficiency resulting from digitalizing customer-related processes. I'd like to thank our operating and technology teams for their continued effort to drive our reimagined operating model and look forward to sharing more about the next iteration of it in future quarters. So with that, I'll turn it over to Matt to address development. Yes. Austin, this is Sean. Happy to talk through that a little bit. First on your second comment as it relates to renewals, the spreads do move around throughout the year and throughout various cycles. And so when we originally talked about offers kind of going out the 7% range and where we ultimately settled, you're talking about spreads that are within normal tolerances, typically 150 basis points or so. Sometimes a little bit less, sometimes a little bit more. I'd say July was slightly wider. Q2 is slightly narrower. So I think we're in the relevant range as it relates to renewals, given the knowledge that it does move around depending on specific market conditions as the year evolves. As it relates to the first part of your question as it relates to move in lease rates we did provide a breakout for the quarter as it relates to move-ins versus renewals, which is at the footnote on the bottom of that attachment. And as it relates to how that's trending going forward, what I'd say is that we were pushing pretty hard on rate through the first two quarters of the year. As we started to get back more inventory from those non-paying resident homes, we started to see the new move-in side begin to tick down, which is really what started to reflect in July, which was coming in at 2.8% for new move-ins as compared to what we experienced during the second quarter. So that's where we started to see a little bit of softness. But in terms of sort of baking the red roll for the full year and how it carries forward into 2024, I think we're in pretty good shape based on what we realized through June and even July, frankly, even though we did see some deceleration on the move-ins \u2013 new move-ins side of particular in July. Yes. Here's how I describe it is we expect the average lease rate for the portfolio for the full year to be about 70 basis points higher than originally anticipated. Most of that is the result of what we have already achieved in terms of the expirations that we had through the month of July that are then cumulatively carrying forward through the balance of the year and our original outlook, we talked about the fact that we expected some modest deceleration in rent change as we moved through the back half of the year that's still the base case assumption for us, but what we've realized through the first seven months of the year has been strong and will carry us forward through the balance of the year and that's how you get to that 70 basis point higher average lease rate for the full year. Yes. Yes. I mean we haven't provided July bad debt data just yet because it hasn't been fully closed out. We provided some preliminary estimates for July as it relates to rent change and things of that sort, which is what was included. So I think what probably is the easiest way to think about this is first half our underlying bad debt rate was 2.7%. In the second half, we expect it to be 2%, which reflects 2.2% in Q3 and dropping down to 1.9% in Q4. As it relates to occupancy, occupancy is correlated with the change in bad debt as we see skip and evict activity throughout the portfolio. So where we are for the second half of the year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks is an expectation that economic occupancy will average roughly 95.5%, which is modestly below our original expectation, but is congruent with the fact that we are getting back more non-paying resident units that we anticipated that's flowing through the turnover into occupancy but is also helping bad debt. So the two are correlated and so the expectation is again kind of mid-95s for economic occupancy in the second half based on our forecasted receipt of those non-paying units in the second half. Yes. I think the primary driver is what I was referencing as it relates to Austin's questions, which is, we pushed hard on rate as it related to the first two quarters of the year. As you may recall, the eviction moratorium for LA expired at the end of March. So as we processed cases, we started to see more availability come into the portfolio in the latter part of the second quarter. And therefore, we started to ease on rates to then prompt more velocity in terms of leasing velocity of those incremental units. And so what you're seeing on the new move-in side in particular is in places like LA as an example, where there is more inventory coming back to market. As we get into July, we wanted to push that inventory through the system, get it turned, get it released, get it occupied before we get into the slower and softer frankly fall winter seasons. So that pressure on new move-in specifically is to help spur leasing velocity to absorb more inventory than normal as a result of those non-paying units coming back to us. Yes. Good questions. So as it relates to the operating initiatives, when I talk about them first more holistically. At this point, based on what we have projected for 2023, we'll be about halfway through our plan as it relates to achieving about $15 million in incremental NOI with the balance of that to come through 2024 and into 2025. Beyond that, there are other things that we're investing in that we haven't talked about in significant detail as it relates to the use of AI, which you started several years ago and have been in R&D mode and other areas of the business, some other automation efforts and various other things that will help drive additional value NOI to the portfolio, which we would \u2013 we will be happy to talk about as we get further along with those. But I would say, as of right now, if you think about what's coming in the way of NOI assume there's another roughly $25 million or so to come as it relates to 2024 and 2025. That's kind of the high level summary where I'd leave it, that includes more than just the staffing side of it. That includes all of it, that's underway at the moment. Jamie, one thing I would just add to that to give a specific example, if you think of Boston, which is a market that we've been in for a very long time, very active developer. Certainly, there have been very good demand drivers there as it relates to a number of different industries, highly educated workforce, good income levels. Our predominantly suburban portfolio is pretty supply protected. Most of those towns have fulfilled their 40B affordable requirements. So there's not a lot of developments in the pipeline. That's the kind of environment where we can be successful in development, but also our existing portfolio is pretty insulated as it relates to exposure to supply and tends to produce solid growth. So that's a good example of one of those markets. If you think of New Jersey, parts of New Jersey, we're the first development going in, in 30 years. So while it may not have the growth rate on a stabilized basis that is as attractive as some West Coast markets when they're really moving along, the additional yield on that development and the total returns are quite attractive. So we'll continue to allocate capital there. So those are a couple of good examples as to why we think those markets are attractive. Yes, Josh. This is Sean. We didn't provide specific guidance as it relates to new lease rate growth, excuse me. Well, we did say at the beginning of the year, which I would just reaffirm now, is that we did expect to see solid rate growth for the first half, which we have realized, and then begin to see some modest deceleration and blended effective rent change in the back half of the year. And I think that's appropriate at this point in time in terms of where we are and what we're seeing in terms of the inventory come back to us from some of the [indiscernible] I think that's appropriate. Yes. Yes. No, good question, Brad. Nothing terribly unusual kind of it's a mess here and there across different categories, but nothing that stands out as sort of oh, there's a \u2013 there's something going on as it relates to relocation or things of that sort. Home condo purchase is still less than 10%, which is a historic low for us. So there's not much else in there other than sort of the normal stuff, family status, roommate changes, nothing else material I'd say. Yes. Good question. And nothing unusual in terms of underlying trends that indicate any significant movement. I mean, we may \u2013 that may be different over the next two, three quarters. We are hearing more about people being called back to the office. Obviously, the Amazon announcement, which would have some impact on the \u2013 not only urban portion of downtown Seattle, but also urban Bellevue, where they have a large campus. So I think it's probably not a broader urban, suburban trend other than as it relates to where people are going to work. If it's a suburban job center location versus an urban building, that would be something that in the future may shift things a little bit one direction or another, but it's a little too early to tell. I'd say New York is really a little bit the outlier at the moment in terms of the processing of cases, whether it's Long Island or city or Westchester, it's just moving \u2013 everything is moving more slowly. The backlog is significant, but it's also significant in L.A., and L.A. seems to be moving along a little faster. So those are really the two markets and maybe to a lesser extent, a similar phenomenon is in the District of Columbia. We're seeing things move more slowly. So I'd say New York is probably the outlier to the slow end followed by DC in terms of what's going on. The rest of them is sort of just chipping along. Yes, it's a good question. Different companies use different types of screening criteria, so I can't really speak to the market specifically on that subject. That really is something that from an industry perspective, you acquire a lot of conversations in terms of how people screen their applicants to make that decision. Not any significant trends. That actually went the opposite direction through COVID. And we haven't seen a significant trend indicate people are doubling up. Yes, you're welcome."

            "name": "Ben Schall",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will start with an overview of our outperformance in Q2, speak to the limited new supply in our markets as compared to most other markets and then provide additional color on our guidance raise, our second raise of the year. Sean will speak to our underlying market fundamentals, including the progress we are making on bad debt and provide a further update on our operating model initiatives, which are exceeding expectations. And then Matt will highlight the continued outperformance of our new projects in lease-up and summarize our recent transaction activity, including the sale of three assets at a 4.7% cap rate. Our balance sheet is as strong as it has ever been with total liquidity of $3 billion, and Kevin is also here with us for Q&A. Turning to Slide 4 in the presentation that we posted yesterday. We achieved second quarter core FFO of $2.66 per share, which equates to a 9.5% growth as compared to last year and which is $0.07 per share higher than the Q2 guidance that we provided in April. I'll speak more to the underlying drivers of that outperformance in a second. We completed two new developments this quarter and started one new project. And as a reminder, early in Q2, we completed the exercise of our $500 million equity forward, capital we raised at $245 per share and has subsequently been investing safely at rates in the low 5% range. In terms of our outperformance in Q2, it was primarily revenue-driven with same-store revenue growing 6.3% or 110 basis points higher than we had anticipated, as shown on Slide 5. Lease rates and other rental revenue were modestly favorable to our prior guidance, partially offset by slightly lower occupancy. The most significant driver of the favorable variance was underlying bad debt, where we have been successful as our landlord rights have been reinstituted of getting back and re-leasing apartments that were previously generating no revenue. As we look forward, we continue to expect our portfolio, which is two thirds located in suburban coastal markets, to benefit from significantly less competitive new supply coming online than in the Sunbelt and other parts of the country. Slide 6 shows the magnitude of this differential, where starts in our established regions have remained stable over time, while Sunbelt starts have increased 50% since 2020. The ramification of this activity is that in 2023, new apartment deliveries will be almost 4% of existing stock in the Sunbelt as compared to only 1.5% of stock in our established regions. And this meaningful differential was set to continue in 2024. Moving to Slide 7. We are raising our full year guidance for core FFO to $10.56 per share, which equals a 7.9% increase over 2022. As a reminder, we increased guidance by $0.10 in April to $10.41 per share, which was attributed primarily to Q1 outperformance and the earnings benefit of accelerating our equity forward. The second increase of an additional $0.15 per share incorporates our outperformance in Q2 and reflects our latest revenue and expense forecast for the year, including improved expectations for bad debt. As part of this updated guidance, we have increased our same-store revenue growth expectation of 6%, kept expense growth constant at 6.5%, and the resulting same-store NOI growth outlook of 6% is up 175 basis points at the midpoint. For bad debt, we are now assuming underlying bad debt of 2.3% for 2023, an improvement of approximately 50 basis points from our initial estimates. As it relates to operating expenses, while the midpoint of our guidance remains the same, we expect lower payroll costs driven by our innovation efforts and lower repair and maintenance and property tax expenses to be offset by higher legal, eviction and bad debt costs as we reclaim apartments from nonpaying residents. The further breakdown of the increase from $10.31 to $10.41 and now to $10.56 per share is shown on Slide 8, with $0.14 coming from same-store NOI. We also continue to adjust our capital allocation approach based on the changing external environment. While our developments in lease-up continue to perform exceptionally well, we have raised our acquired returns on new development starts given our increased cost of capital and focused on maintaining 100 to 150 basis points of spread between underlying market cap rates and our projected development. Based on these factors and as part of our guidance update, we have reduced our expected level of starts in 2023 to 775 million from 875 million. On the transaction side, as part of our portfolio repositioning, we continue to take the tack of selling assets first, locking in that cost of capital and then pursuing acquisitions in our expansion markets. Given this cadence and given that we are remaining selective on the acquisitions that we pursue, our guidance now assumes that we'll be net sellers of assets this year with expected dispositions exceeding acquisitions by roughly $200 million. And with that, I'll turn it to Sean. Thanks Matt. To wrap up, I want to thank our 3,000 AvalonBay associates for their efforts and dedication and delivering very strong results in the first half of 2023. As an organization, we have also incorporated our ESG activities into much of what we do, and I'm proud that we are delivering on these initiatives with tangible and measurable progress across all of our key ESG metrics as shown on Slide 15. And as more fully described in our 12th annual ESG report, which we issued last Monday. Our final Slide number 16 summarizes our key takeaways for a very successful quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to facilitate questions. Yes, thanks Nick. And for the wider group, what Nick's referring to was the legal update that we provided in our earnings release yesterday. And as you pointed out, we are pleased we've been dismissed from that class action lawsuit. Nick, at this point, given its ongoing litigation in the wider industry, we can't make any additional comments above what we included in our disclosure in the earnings release. The filings in the case are public. They're out there, the extent that you or others want research the matter further. We were dismissed from the consolidation of the class action lawsuits. Yes. John, the 2% I mentioned is the underlying bad debt, ignoring the impact of rent relief, so to clarify that one. And then in terms of duration, I mean, it's a good question. We essentially process about, call it, 1,400 skips and evicts the first half of the year. Our expectation is for roughly similar pace, maybe slightly more on the second half. And but based on the number of outstanding accounts that we have at this point in time and the pace of activity, particularly in a state like New York, which is moving more slowly. I do expect it to carry through into at least, I'd say, the first half of 2024. And then as you start to get to the back half of 2024 and 2025, I would expect to see normalization based on the pace we've experienced thus far. Yes, Washington state is a big chunk of it, John. Overall, this is \u2013 I just \u2013 this is Ben, just to add a couple of comments on our framework here. Overall, like you've seen from us the last couple of years, the discipline that we've had both around adjusting our capital allocation approaches based on the changing external environment, including our cost to capital, and then also a discipline around maintaining the spreads that we want between underlying market cap rates and our stabilized development yield. So when you hear Matt talk about a deal that we're moving from the system, that's us having those hard conversations to make sure that we feel like there's sufficient value being created for shareholders. Jamie, I'll make a couple of comments. As we think about the prospects for the various markets, and particularly our established regions versus the Sunbelt markets, the supply dynamics in our minds are going to continue to be a factor and a factor at this point into 2025. And that's just simply a function of start activity, the time it takes to then complete those deals and then the lease up of that activity coming through the system. So this will be something in our minds. And particularly if we are faced with an environment of flat or softening demand, the reality is those markets and sub-markets with higher level of supplies in our minds are going to face a softening operating environment. I think we feel fairly confident on the demand and supply dynamics in our suburban coastal markets and that includes the northeast. On the demand side, there are elements of rent versus owning economics today, which stay very prevalent. And to some degree are \u2013 if you look at the rent versus own spreads, the northeast has some of the highest levels there. It could be $1000 more a month to own a home versus rent a home given where you see home prices go and borrowing costs run. And those are markets where it's very difficult to build new single family supply, right, once that part of the process starts back up. So yes, I think we \u2013 that's a factor gives us confidence. And then as you think about kind of reversions to long-term means, the northeast and other suburban coastal markets just haven't had the run-up that we've seen in other markets. So there's an underlying stability there that also gives us confidence. Josh, you cut in and out on the question. Can you repeat that, please? Part of it's just been our approach and we made this shift last year to selling first the market. There's uncertainty there. There's not a lot of capital that's in play. So we wanted to take some assets to market, execute on those, lock into that cost to capital and then make the decisions around how we're going to redeploy that capital. We are remaining pretty selective today in terms of our new buying activity. And part of that is, while to Matt's point, we're not expecting distress. Our view is that over the next six months to 12 months, there likely will be a greater set of motivated sellers and potentially in our growth areas, in our expansion markets that could be particularly true. If you take a softening operating environment and combine that with a capital environment where capital is less abundant that could provide some attractive opportunities for a platform and a balance sheet like ours. There are no other litigations related to the RealPage that we're aware of that we have not been dismissed from. Sure. Yes. Yes. Thanks, Michael. I'll make a couple of comments. One, reaffirm our goal of moving 25% of our portfolio to the expansion regions over a period of five or six years. We've talked before about some of the drivers behind that, too, just quickly to call out. One, our core customer, the knowledge-based worker, we recognize is in a more dispersed set of markets today than they have been in the past. And second, just think about an expanded playing field to take what we do well across operations, development to those new markets in order to create value for our shareholders. In terms of kind of pace and execution, goes to my comment earlier in the call, could be an opportunity here where there are some attractive \u2013 more attractive opportunities for us to enter into those markets, given some operating softening and given there's not a lot of other institutional capital that's active today. And so we'll continue to be selective, but I think we'll have the choice of what we want to own. On the acquisition side, we've been tending to focus recently on assets that we think are going to complement our development portfolio in those markets. And so it's had us looking at acquisitions that are generally a little bit older in nature, lower in density, lower in price point with a particular focus on micro locations that we expect to have more limited supply coming. And then on the development side and gets in the land and the conversation we're having around construction costs, our hope is construction costs will start to come down. There are merchant builders who were accumulating large portfolios of land, and we are starting to see some of those deals come back. And so selectively, and I talked about this last quarter, we \u2013 in Boston and a recent deal in Florida, we've been able to take land back at 30% to 40% from where it traded a year ago. So those are the types of opportunities that we're looking at, but this is a longer-term vision, and we remain focused on moving in that direction. Thank you. All right. Well, thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you soon."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the AvalonBay Communities First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Your host for today\u2019s conference call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Doug and welcome to AvalonBay Communities\u2019 first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. As a reminder, this call may contain forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday\u2019s afternoon\u2019s press release as well as in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ben Schall, Chairman and CEO and President of AvalonBay for his remarks. Ben?\nBen Schall: Thanks, Jason. In terms of key themes for this quarter, I will start by reviewing our strong start to the year and describe why we believe our suburban coastal portfolio is particularly well-positioned. Sean will discuss our operating performance and relative strength as we enter the peak leasing season. Matt will comment on the evolving development market and detail the differentiated earnings stream that our developments currently underway set to provide. And Kevin will review our strong financial position and highlight the advancements at our industry-leading centralized service center we utilize to drive revenue and operating efficiencies. Turning to our presentation, starting on Page 4, we continue to meaningfully grow earnings in Q1 with core FFO increasing 13.7%. A significant part of this uplift is related to the roll-through of leases signed last year. We also continue to grow rents during Q1 with like-term effective rent change of 4.1%. For the quarter, we exceeded core FFO guidance by $0.05, with the $0.01 of revenue primarily attributable to better-than-expected collection rates from residents, $0.03 due to lower operating expenses and $0.01 related to interest income and other items. In early April, we drew down the proceeds of our equity forward, which we entered into about a year ago, at the spot price of $255 per share. A couple of items to highlight here. First, the additional cost of this $500 million of capital is in the low-4% range. As was originally intended, we\u2019ve allocated this capital to development projects underway, which are projected to generate development yields of 6% or more. So when we talk about funding our underway development at yesterday\u2019s capital cost, this almost 200 basis point spread is what we\u2019re referring to and leads to significant value creation for shareholders as these projects stabilize. The second aspect of the drawdown of the equity forward is unique to the current environment in which we can earn outsized returns on cash. We weren\u2019t originally planning to draw down the equity forward until Q4 of this year, but we executed it now and have invested the cash at 5%-plus interest rates with extremely strong banking partners. On a net basis, the incremental income on this cash is projected to increase 2023 core FFO by approximately $0.03 per share, after factoring in the incremental shares outstanding. We, in turn, increased our full year core FFO guidance by $0.10 to $10.41 per share at the midpoint. The breakdown is as follows: $0.02 in revenue with the $0.01 from Q1 and then an additional $0.01 in Q2 based on slightly better rental rates. There\u2019s an assumed $0.02 improvement for operating expenses for the full year, which includes the $0.03 from Q1, partially offset by $0.01 higher OpEx in the second half of the year. And then $0.06 of additional core FFO, primarily from the interest income on the equity forward proceeds as well as other cash management and slightly updated assumptions related to the transaction timing. We do not adjust our same-store guidance ranges at this point, and we\u2019ll reevaluate those as part of our more fulsome midyear we forecast. Turning to Page 5 regarding market fundamentals. Occupancy and rent trends in our established regions are experiencing less volatility than in the Sunbelt regions. Part of this is a reversion to long-term trend lines. There are also underlying demand factors providing greater stability in our established regions and two are worth noting. First, rent-to-income ratios are generally in line with traditional levels. As noted in Chart 3, effective market rents in our established regions have grown about 10% over the past 3 years with income levels more than keeping pace with rent growth. And second, with limited single-family home inventory and higher interest costs, the economics of renting are considerably more favorable than buying a home in our markets. The near-term supply picture also bodes well for the performance of our suburban coaster portfolio. As shown on Page 6, our established regions have meaningfully less new supply coming online this year, estimated at 1.6% of stock as compared to Sunbelt markets at 3.6%. And as shown on the right-hand side of this page, when we look at supply that is directly competing with our portfolio, levels are even lower, at 1.4% of stock overall and only 1.2% of stock in our suburban markets, which comprises roughly two-thirds of our portfolio. In terms of our portfolio allocation objectives, we do still want to shift 25% of our portfolio to our expansion regions over time in order to diversify and optimize our longer-term growth profile. So that has not changed. And in the near term, the relative trade of selling assets in our established regions to acquire assets in the expansion regions could be more attractive to us than it has been, allowing us to more profitably reposition our portfolio for future growth. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it to Sean for more specifics on the operating backdrop.\nSean Breslin: All right. Thanks, Ben. Continuing with Slide 7 to address market trends, effective rents in the East and West are up about 10% from pre-COVID levels but took very different paths to get to the same point. Rents on the West Coast, which have historically been more volatile than the East, declined sharply in 2020 escalated significantly in 2021 and the first half of 2022 and then softened consistent with seasonal norms in the back half of 2022. Rents on the East Coast experienced a more modest decline through COVID and have grown steadily since Q1 2021 with very modest seasonality in the back half of 2022. And consistent with historical norms, both coast posted positive sequential monthly rent growth during the first quarter. From a year-over-year growth rate perspective, the West Coast continued to decelerate during Q1 and while the East Coast shows signs of stabilization, bolstered by slightly better growth in absolute rent levels since the beginning of the year. Moving to Slide 8 to address trends in our same-store portfolio. Key performance indicators were healthy during Q1 and remained so heading into the prime leasing season. Our availability was in the low-5% range during the quarter. Turnover, which was relatively stable during the quarter, was lower than Q4 2022 as the volume of residents leaving our communities to purchase a home declined by roughly 25% sequentially and about one-third year-over-year. Occupancy increased about 30 basis points from Q4. And as noted in Chart 4 on Slide 8 and also in our earnings release, Brent change improved from 3.7% in January to 4.9% in April. Additionally, our portfolio average asking rent has increased about 3.5% since the beginning of the year, up 4% on the East and about 3% on the West and is slightly ahead of our original expectation. Also, renewal offers from May and June went out at roughly 7%. I\u2019ll turn it over to Matt to address development now. Matt?\nMatt Birenbaum: Alright. Great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to Slide 9, our lease-ups continue to deliver outstanding results, laying the foundation for strong future growth in both earnings and NAV. We currently have 4 development communities that had active leasing in Q1, all of which started construction early in the pandemic, before rents had started to rise meaningfully. As a general rule, we do not update our projected rents on lease-ups until we open for business and start to gain leasing velocity, at which point, we mark those rents to current market levels. For these four deals, we have seen an increase of $485 per month or 17% above our initial underwriting. This in turn is driving a 70 basis points increase in the yield on these investments to 6.7%, well above current cap rates and even further above the cost of the capital we source to fund these deals, back when they broke ground consistent with our match funding approach. Looking ahead, we expect to start leasing on an additional 7 communities before the end of the year. We have not yet marked the rents on these projects to current market, but in general, the locations in which they\u2019re located have seen similar increases in market rent since we started construction, providing a great opportunity for further lift in their results as well. As shown on Slide 10, with most of our communities \u2013 development communities still early in lease up or yet to open, we realized just $10 million of the total projected $142 million in NOI from the entire development booked in Q1. This leaves over $130 million of incremental NOI to come as these assets complete construction stabilize. And as for the prior slide, that total NOI figure is also likely understated, given only 4 of those 18 total projects have been marked to market today. Turning to Slide 11, as we look to future development starts, we are certainly starting to see shifts in the development market in response to the Fed tightening of the past several quarters. Among our competitors, many planned projects are being postponed or abandoned as third-party financing becomes scarce and cut. And some of these drop-laying contracts are starting to come back to the market with much lower pricing expectations. We\u2019ve already been able to take advantage of several of these situations with recent additions to our development rights pipeline, and we do expect to see more as the market adjusts. The slowdown in starts in turn is starting to impact the construction market, where we are finally starting to see some retraction in subcontractor trade pricing after 3 years of outsized increases. An environment where capital is scarce and certainty of execution becomes more critical, both to land sellers and subcontractors, plays well to our strengths as both the developer and the general contractor. And we have traditionally seen some of our most profitable investment opportunities when these more challenging cyclical conditions have prevailed. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin for an update on the balance sheet and the CCC.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Thanks, Matt. Turning to Slide 12, as we look ahead, our balance sheet remains exceptionally well positioned to provide financial strength and stability while also giving us the flexibility to continue funding attractive growth opportunities across our investment platforms. In this regard, we enjoy low leverage with net debt-to-EBITDA of 4.6x, which is below our target range of 5x to 6x. Our interest coverage ratio and unencumbered NOI percentage are at near record levels at 6.9x and 95%, respectively. And our debt maturities are well laddered, with weighted average years to maturity of about 8 years. In addition, as disclosed in our release, we also enjoyed tremendous liquidity of about $2.8 billion today, with no borrowings under our $2.25 billion unsecured credit facility and an additional $0.5 billion from just having settled our equity forward that we originated a year ago. As a result, we don\u2019t need to tap the capital markets for an extended time, and we are well positioned to lean into our balance sheets to take advantage of future investment opportunities that may emerge in our markets over time. On Slide 13, we highlight our recently announced agreement to provide back-office financial administrative support to Gables Residential\u2019s portfolio of 25,000 apartment homes from our centralized customer care center, which we established in 2007 to create operating and scale efficiencies and supporting our own portfolio while enhancing our resident customer experience. At the outset, I want to acknowledge the efforts of the entire AvalonBay team that brought this business relationship to Gables across the finish line. We highlight this achievement for several reasons. First, because we are genuinely excited to be able to extend these services to a highly respected multifamily company such as Gables and to its residents; second, because this agreement demonstrates the appeal of the innovative capabilities that we\u2019ve created in the 16 years since we established the CCC; and third, because we have embarked on extending those capabilities in a way that allows us to create additional value for AvalonBay shareholders by offering to support services to other institutional multifamily owners now and in the future. As a reminder, we are not offering property management services under our agreement with Gables, nor do we intend to do so. As all business and operational decisions related to AvalonBay\u2019s and Gables\u2019 portfolios will continue to be managed separately by each company, rather we are providing back-office financial administrative support to Gables . And then finally, from an economic and guidance perspective, while we are not disclosing the specific terms of our agreement for confidentiality reasons, the near-term earnings accretion from this agreement is relatively modest and was included in our initial outlook given back in February 2023. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ben for closing comments.\nBen Schall: Alright. Thanks, Kevin. Page 14 summarizes our key takeaways and focus areas. We\u2019re pleased with our start to the year expect our portfolio to outperform as we look ahead; and also mindful that these are the types of environments, particularly in an environment in which capital is generally less abundant in the industry, to selectively take advantage of opportunities in order to create value for shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll now ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. It\u2019s actually Nick Joseph here with Eric. Kevin, you mentioned the agreement announced last week with Gables. I recognize you can\u2019t talk too much on the specific terms of that. But if you could talk more broadly about, is this a one-off deal? Are you looking to scale this business? What sort of margin and economics could you derive from it? And then I know this is in the third-party management contract, but would that be of interest as well for other property owners?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Sure. Thanks Nick. I\u2019ll start and others, Ben or Sean may want to chime in. In terms of the go-forward view of this, we\u2019re certainly excited to have this agreement in place. And without getting into the specifics of the economics, I mean, the impact is, at the moment, fairly modest, if you just think about the relative size of our business and our main value creators outside of operations and development and so forth. But we are excited to have it in a place that is accretive. There are, from a contribution point of view, healthy margins, for sure, that make this worth the while. As to the future potential, we\u2019re certainly hopeful and inspired to do more business like this, but we are not proactively looking for that new business right now. We\u2019ve just completed this transaction, of course, with Gables. So \u2013 but we do hope looking ahead to be able to do more business like this over the time. And we think it does make sense for us to do it because over time, because it allows us to scale and more fully invest over time and an important capability that allows us to further differentiate ourselves from our peers. So there\u2019s a lot more I could go into there, but maybe I\u2019ll just pause there. And I don\u2019t know if Sean or Ben have anything else to add.\nBen Schall: Yes. I think as well, but I\u2019ll add a couple of things, and thanks for the question, Nick. I would connect for you this step as the kind of next continued evolution, both of our operating model journey but as well as the role that the CCC and centralized services are planned for us. And so part of the appeal, in addition to the revenue and profit opportunity with Gables, we are increasingly handling more services, at least in part and at a centralized way. And this relationship allows us to make continued investments. Think about technology, process people that we think can then accrue to the larger platform here at AvalonBay. So it\u2019s a nice next step in our overall operating model journey and we\u2019re excited for this first step and potentially future clients going forward.\nEric Wolfe: Hey, it\u2019s Eric. Maybe just a follow-up there, you said that the initial sort of impact was included in guidance and wasn\u2019t, frankly, that large. I guess how many units would you sort of have to manage before it would become a sort of more material part of your earnings stream? And then just to make sure that I understand the last part of your answer, I think you are effectively saying that you can sort of invest in your platform, invest in technology and even though that the financial contribution above that might not be that big, you are effectively allocating those costs to other parties. Is that the right way to think about it or did I misunderstand that?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yes, Eric, let me kind of take a stab at it a little bit. I can\u2019t really give you, I mean, an answer what number of units would have to be under this kind of an arrangement for it to be material. It probably depends on what you think is material, I guess, to some degree. I think the way we look at it is from a slightly different perspective, not the immediate financial impact, but it\u2019s kind of been alluded to what this sort of thing does for us to continue our journey to create the leading operating platform in the business. And so we\u2019re in our 17th year with this experience. And I think that we\u2019re pointing this out probably for two reasons. One, to your question about what this can do, the more you do this for not only yourself but for others, the more you can reinvest in that business create a better platform in and of itself over time, that even draw, for our own sake, when we started, we weren\u2019t at our current size of, whatever, 80,000 apartment homes when we started this in 2007, we were quite a bit smaller. And it has gotten better itself over time. We\u2019ve really fine-tuned and honed the CCC so that it\u2019s substantially better than it was even back in 2007 and 2010 and has done a number of things you can see on the slide here for us over time. I mean one thing it did is when we had the Archstone transaction, we were able to add 20,000 units in 30 days. So that bespoke that speaks to sort of the ability to scale quickly when you\u2019ve got that capability centralized in-house. And the other reason why we think it\u2019s worth highlighting for you, apart from the fact that it is a relatively modest financial significance today, is the fact that a highly respected institutional multifamily owner, such as Gables, by entering the screen with us after its own due diligence on us and our center does provide external validation of the strength and the economic value of the capabilities we\u2019ve created at the CCC over the past 16 years. And we think that\u2019s something that\u2019s worth emphasizing to our investors, given the increasing importance of generating alpha in our operating platform through innovation, which we\u2019re continuing to do across the entire business at this point.\nEric Wolfe: Thanks for all the detail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: They were pretty back-end loaded for you guys this year. I am just curious given Matt\u2019s comments about costs starting to come down, but the economy is potentially weakening and rent growth is slowing, how those potential starts are kind of shaping up for you? And what I guess are you looking for higher hurdle rates today and maybe in the back half of the year than you were say 6 months ago?\nMattBirenbaum: Sure. Hey, Steve, it\u2019s Matt. Yes, so our target yield or going in initial return on new development has been rising really over the last year as we saw cap rates rise and cost of capital rise, both debt and equity. So our target yields were probably in the mid-5s, mid- to high 5s last year. And now they\u2019re kind of in the mid-6s, low to mid-6s, depending on the geography and the risk associated with the deal. So our start activity for the year is as the \u2013 it is probably a little more back half weighted just by the way the \u2013 as time goes by, we\u2019re going to see more buyout savings on our hard costs. So in some \u2013 that probably plays to our advantage a little bit. And we can play that a little more aggressively given that we act as our own general contractor, 90% of our development, which is a little different than I think many others. So \u2013 but when I look at our development starts that are slated for this year, that\u2019s about where the yields are. They are probably in the low 6s. And you have to kind of look at the geographic mix and the risk profile of those deals to kind of weigh the profitability of each one, which is what we do. But again, we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in saying we\u2019re continuing to look for that 100 to 150 basis point spread on new starts. And frankly, the stuff that we started last year and the year before, the spreads are well wider than that, which was kind of highlighted on the slide.\nSteve Sakwa: Yes, I guess maybe to ask it maybe a little differently. I guess what risk or what probability would you put that you don\u2019t hit the starts number for a host of reasons? Or do you feel reasonably confident that costs are coming your way and even if rent growth slows a little bit, that you\u2019re still able to kind of achieve the returns you need to kind of put that \u2013 put those starts into the ground?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: I feel I\u2019m pretty confident about it. When I look at the starts for the year, we started one in the first quarter. We have one that we\u2019ve just started. It will be a second quarter start, a third one where we have all of our final budgets, and it\u2019s been approved through our investment committee. So that\u2019s 3 of the 7 rate starts we have planned for the year. And when I look at it, the other ones, I\u2019m feeling pretty confident that we should track that, unless something very unexpected happens.\nBen Schall: Steve, maybe a little bit more to your question about how is our development approach changing. And we do have a fairly fulsome development rights pipeline. And Matt\u2019s talking about our near-term starts, which are fairly baked at this point. But the next set of deals, right, in that pipeline over the next couple of years, part of what we\u2019re going through right now is very effectively reworking those deals, right, to reflect today\u2019s environment. And given what\u2019s happening with some of our competitors, some of the formerly active developers there, sellers are starting to increasingly acknowledge that the environment has changed. And so that\u2019s leading to land repricing, that\u2019s leading to more attractive terms. It\u2019s allowing us to control high-quality real estate, relatively limited upfront costs. So, all those dynamics continue to run in our direction.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay, great. And then maybe just one question for Sean. On \u2013 you talked about, I guess, the renewals going out around 7%. And I know you don\u2019t provide a split between new and renewals and you kind of just provide the blend. And April was a nice uptick. I guess given that we\u2019re going in the spring leasing season, how \u2013 I guess, how much confidence do you have that kind of the May and June numbers might look like April? Could they be better? And I guess what markets are you seeing the most strength and weakness?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Steve, good questions. Maybe I\u2019ll provide a little of a high-level commentary as it relates to renewals versus new move-ins and a little bit about trends. But in the first quarter, what I\u2019d say is if you look at the blend there, renewals were kind of in the high 5s, and new move-ins were sort of in the mid-2% range. And then in April, renewals were sort of in the mid-5s, but new move-in, just given the seasonality of rents, has kind of moved up into the mid-4s, just to give you some perspective there. And our expectation is that consistent with what we talked about on the first quarter call, that we would see the best rent change kind of in the first quarter, and then it would begin to decelerate. But that\u2019s dependent upon what happens with growth and asking rents as we move through the year. So our expectation is still consistent with what we communicated in Q1, is that we would see Q1 perform well, and then we would start to see some moderation, both in rent change and in overall rental revenue growth. And that\u2019s still the expectation. And part of that, you got to have to keep in mind is on a year-over-year basis, the headwind associated with the reduction in rent relief becomes far material as you get into the second and third quarter, and that will create some moderation from a rental revenue growth perspective. But as it relates to rent change, based on what we know today, I would say, as you get further into the second quarter, we would expect that to begin to moderate more so than what obviously we saw in the first quarter.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks, everybody. Going back to Gables for a minute, I guess, I\u2019m curious what sort of precipitated the discussions with Gables? And whether or not you pursued any other potential portfolios to add to the CCC platform? And while understanding you\u2019re not handling the property management, could we see these partnerships lead to a feeder for future acquisitions?\nBen Schall: Yes, Austin. On the first piece, short version of it, there were some existing relationships across the firms, which sort of started the conversations. We then went through a pilot with Gables on a smaller portion of this portfolio to test it, both for them and for us. And on the heels of that, we both decided to proceed given the benefits that were being realized. And then to your last piece, no, this is not an acquisition type of approach or angle here. This is much more focused on operational benefits.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Understood. And then going back to development, I recall some tables you provided over time showing kind of IRRs on development. And certainly, recall coming out of the GFC, there were some really attractive returns over time. So given what\u2019s going on with the availability of bank financing, the more attractive land and input costs, I guess, it seems like a unique opportunity today. So how are you thinking about ramping development as quickly as you can to maybe capitalize on what\u2019s going on today?\nMatt Birenbaum: Austin, it\u2019s Matt. I can speak to that a little bit, and Ben maybe want to as well. But \u2013 so the good news is we have a \u2013 we\u2019re controlling a lot of really good real estate right now for very modest upfront investment. So we\u2019ve kind of been operating the platform in anticipation of a potential opportunity emerging like this really for the last couple of years. And we\u2019ve added quite a lot to our pipeline over the last year or 2. We\u2019re controlling, I think, 40 or 41 potential deals with pretty modest land on our balance sheet. I think it was $180 million. At the end of the quarter, the total investment, including capitalized pursuit cost, is only around $235 million or $240 million. So we have \u2013 and a lot of those options are not yet at the point where we have to make a decision about are we going to close? Are we going to \u2013 as Ben mentioned, there are some conversations going on with some sellers about these deals were struck in a different environment. So I think we\u2019re well positioned. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s quite there yet. It\u2019s not like development economics are screening value yet. We kind of have to see where asset values settle out, and that\u2019s the other side of this, is what\u2019s going on in the transaction market, which is still pretty muted deal volumes. But we do have the ability to ramp it up if we see that emerging kind of later this year, particularly when we look to next year. The other thing is, as I mentioned, we are starting to see the moderation in hard costs, particularly in some markets where start volume has come down. There are other markets where that\u2019s coming, but it\u2019s not here quite yet. So we\u2019re watching that very closely every day. And that\u2019s the other opportunity that we will see. There are some markets where we think it\u2019s going to come down more. There is other markets where it\u2019s going to take a little more time. But over \u2013 particularly the next 4 or 5 months, as we have more deals out in the market actively bidding, we will have a much better sense for where hard costs are going. Because what we\u2019re finding today is if you have a job that you\u2019re going to start in a year and you\u2019re showing preliminary drawns, you\u2019re not getting particularly attractive pricing. But if you have a job that\u2019s truly ready to go, you\u2019ve got a permit in hand, subcontractors can see some early site work and they have a hole in their production schedule, that\u2019s when you\u2019re seeing the more aggressive bid.\nBen Schall: Two areas I\u2019d emphasize, One, just on the point of our relatively limited land holdings, when you look across our peer set, our landholding numbers is below a number of our peers, despite kind of our ability to execute at higher development levels throughout cycles. So we\u2019ve got some room in there. The second part is in an environment right now, we recognize we need to be selective about that. But in places, it could be markets we know really well, have nearby operating communities, places where we can bring our platform into, we\u2019re finding opportunities there in our expansion markets for some high-quality land deals that are falling out of contract, ability to step in. And yes, there have been a couple of situations where land is getting repriced at 30% to 35%, where it was priced 9 months ago. If we can step in and control that land with relatively limited cost to look out a couple of years, and we think that will accrue some significant benefits.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Thanks for all the detail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Kramer: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. I just wanted to ask about bad debt. It looks like 500 basis points on kind of a gross basis in the quarter. Just wondering \u2013 I know you have a really helpful kind of market-by-market breakdown there. So just wondering kind of how you\u2019re thinking about gross bad debt over the next few quarters? And is there a chance that this could be kind of abate \u2013 some sort of a tailwind going into next year if this does return to \u2013 maybe it doesn\u2019t return all the way to kind of normal pre-COVID levels, right, but just you give some year-over-year improvements on that number?\nSean Breslin: Sure, Adam. This is Sean. Just a couple of comments on that. First, as it relates to bad debt during the quarter, the sort of uncollectible portion from our residents, as we think about a sort of underlying bad debt, came in at around 3%, which is about 22 basis points better than what we anticipated. And that\u2019s the $0.01 that Ben basically spoke about in terms of what we picked up in the first quarter. Moving forward, for the balance of the year, we\u2019re expecting Q2 through Q4 to average roughly 2.7%, starting at about 3% in Q2 and then sort of trending down throughout the year in terms of that underlying sort of bad debt percentage. So that\u2019s how the sort of trajectory looks as you move forward. Different markets are doing different things. We saw some nice improvement in New York \u2013 the Greater New York region in the first quarter. It was responsible for about half the variance in the quarter, about third in Southern Cal and then kind of sprinkled across the other markets as well. So overall, we were pleased with what we saw in the first quarter, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily make for a trend just yet, and we will be able to revisit that mid-year once we have a better sense for how things are playing out as we move through the second quarter as well.\nAdam Kramer: Great. That\u2019s really helpful, and I appreciate the clarification around the 300 basis points. I was wrong on my higher number there. I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up. Is there a chance that you can kind of have a \u2013 I guess, kind of more of a one-time in nature, but kind of a benefit from residents who kind of true up, right? Who not only kind of pay current on rent but also pay prior periods that they had, that they were delinquent on and hadn\u2019t paid? Is it possible you can kind of see a one-time benefit from that?\nSean Breslin: Adam, what I\u2019d say is anything is possible. I don\u2019t think that is probable based on the resident behavior we have seen thus far. So I would not anticipate that. To the extent that we, all of a sudden, cash started ringing in from people who haven\u2019t paid, that\u2019s not necessarily what we\u2019ve expected in our guidance, it would be a bump. But I would not expect that as a likely outcome.\nAdam Kramer: Got it. Really helpful, guys. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chandni Luthra with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nChandni Luthra: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Could you talk about concessions? What are you seeing across your markets, particularly on the West Coast and perhaps even on your expansion markets? And how has the trend been in the last 19 days? Have things gone worse? Thanks.\nSean Breslin: Sure, Chandni. This is Sean. Happy to answer that. First, in terms of Q1 activity, across all the leases we signed in the quarter, which was about 16,000 leases, the average concession is less than $200. So very, very modest. Obviously, more concentrated in certain places. What I would tell you is about 30% of the concession volume that we experienced in the quarter in terms of leases that were captured were spread across Seattle and the Bay Area, particularly in San Francisco. So that\u2019s where most of the volume is, frankly. But if you look at concessions over the last few weeks, just to give you a little more recent data, less than 10% of the transactions that we\u2019re executing are seeing a concession. And again, it\u2019s more concentrated in those two areas, San Francisco and the Pacific Northwest, where in those markets, you\u2019re 30%, 40%, 45% of the leases, depending on submarket or getting some type of a concession. So those are the two places where we\u2019re focused on at the most in terms of moving volume, but it\u2019s not a significant issue elsewhere.\nChandni Luthra: Noted. And then as a follow-up, last quarter, you laid out cap rates in the mid- to high-4s range. What are you seeing right now? And at what levels would you think that it would become appealing enough for you to dive in?\nMatt Birenbaum : Yes. This is Matt. I guess, I\u2019ll speak to that one. So what we\u2019ve said of cap rates and then our own trading activity, I think what we\u2019re seeing is that there is a bifurcated market. There are a lot of assets that are not trading. Those that are, I would kind of put them into two buckets, kind of the haves and the have nots. The haves, which is highly desirable assets in locations, either markets or submarkets that are on a lot of investors\u2019 lists. For growth, those assets are still trading in the mid-4s cap rates. I think, in fact, I would have \u2013 if you\u2019d asked me 90 days ago, I probably would have said high 4s, but \u2013 and we do have some assets actively in the market today that hopefully will close during Q2, and we have at least one that\u2019s in that haves category, I would say, that\u2019s probably more of a mid-4 cap rate. Now when I say cap rate, I\u2019m not necessarily talking about the yield. I\u2019m talking about kind of the market convention, the way they report a cap rate, which includes a management fee and a CapEx allowance and the buyer\u2019s property taxes. The other side of the equation is the assets that maybe have a little bit less of a interest that have a less deep pool of bidders. And there, the have nots, you might have one or two that are seriously interested. And there, I\u2019d say cap rates are probably more like low 5s. And so call that range anywhere from 4.5 to 5.25. And we may have an asset or two that\u2019s in that latter category as well that\u2019s currently working in the market. As it relates to our own asset trading activity, our plan for the year was to be net neutral. But to \u2013 really, we started last year saying, we were going to sell first and buy seconds. So that to the extent we\u2019re trading out of assets in our established regions into our expansion regions, we would know what the cap rate and pricing was on the asset that we were selling, which in turn would inform our appetite on the buy side. So now we do have a couple of dispositions that are in process. And so we are going to be looking here over the next quarter or two to reinvest that capital into potentially some acquisitions in the expansion regions. So we would expect \u2013 I don\u2019t know if anything is going to close on the acquisition side in Q2, but it is our plan to kind of resume that forward trading.\nChandni Luthra: Appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Pawlowski: Thanks for the time. I just wanted to follow-up on the conversation around the state of the development market and the bullets you lay out on Page 11 of the investor deck. Ben, I know you threw out like a 30% to 35% reduction in land value comps. Is that representative of the market right now? And like is the volume of these broken sites meaningful right now? Or we\u2019re just getting started on the repricing?\nBen Schall: I think we are still early. There are more sellers than less who are actually willing to give current contracts to the time, right, extend out and see where it heads. But we are starting to see some situations where deals are breaking. And the two situations I was referring to had buyers who are relatively motivated. And when they are looking at on the landscape, this goes to Matt\u2019s comments about our ability to execute our \u2013 that we don\u2019t need to rely on construction financing, right, to execute projects today, those buyers are going to own the margin, look to somebody like AvalonBay to contract to \u2013 contract with. So that\u2019s \u2013 yes, I\u2019d say that\u2019s the kind of the general environment. Our expectation is that there is more to come. Starts are \u2013 we\u2019re expecting to be down substantially this year. And a big part of underlying all of this is you look out at the private market environment and the merchant builders who have been very prolific, their ability to get capital for new construction deals is just very challenging. And the cost of that capital has also expanded out significantly, right? So on a relative basis, this is one of the parts that we\u2019re starting to see. While our cost of capital has gone up or in our cost of debt borrowing has obviously gone up from the 2% range to 5% range, the private market players, if they can get construction financing, those senior mortgages are at 7.5% to 8.5% now, right? And that\u2019s before putting on some preferred equity or mezz and that\u2019s before getting to equity, right? So our relative advantage in a period like this, we think, is we\u2019re relatively well positioned. And so selectively, we\u2019re going to start stepping into some of these types of opportunities.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. On that point, I\u2019m just curious if you guys have any internal theories on why we haven\u2019t seen a more precipitous falloff in permitting and start activity? I mean the credit markets have been volatile for a while, and they have been tightening for a while. And I know they are down a little bit more in your markets. But I\u2019m just curious if you got to have any internal views on why we haven\u2019t seen the relief yet in the permitting and starts data.\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes, John, it\u2019s Matt. It\u2019s \u2013 I ask Craig Thomas, my Head of Market Research, that question every month when the permit numbers come out. It is a little bit of a head scratcher. I mean, I think in the fourth quarter, a lot of that was probably capital that was committed and have been lined up. And then a lot of the start \u2013 a lot of the permit and even start activity I\u2019ve come to learn is not kind of what we would think of as our product, as much of half of it is other things. Affordable housing production is actually running pretty high right now. There was a lot of one-time money through some of the COVID relief funds, which has gotten out there. So that could be inflating it a bit. But \u2013 and in some cases, people may be pulling permits and then getting bids and not liking the numbers they are seeing. But it is a little bit of a head scratcher, I would agree with you.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. \nJamie Feldman: Great. Thank you. I guess as you think about potential acquisition opportunities, do you think there could be some portfolios or platforms out there for acquisition? Or do you think it will be kind of singles and doubles on the land side or on the asset side?\nMatt Birenbaum: Hi, Jamie, it\u2019s Matt. I would expect, it\u2019s probably more of the latter. Usually, portfolio transactions, unless somebody has some kind of \u2013 unless they bought a portfolio and put a lot of short-term debt on it all, which would be pretty unusual, our portfolio \u2013 usually sellers selling portfolios, it\u2019s more opportunistic. And those things happen when there is an abundance of capital. And go back 3, 4 years, there was kind of a portfolio premium. Today, you talked about \u2013 I think, on the last call, there is a portfolio discount just given the capital markets. So we haven\u2019t heard of anything like that. And I guess I\u2019d be a little surprised.\nJamie Feldman: Okay, thank you. And then as you think about the suburban versus urban assets, whether it\u2019s the April data or your views on what\u2019s to come in spring leasing, any thoughts on how they are performing versus each other and versus your expectations? And what we can see going forward \u2013 expect going forward?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Jim, it\u2019s Sean. What I would say is that, yes, generally, things were in line. The rent change that we experienced in Q1, that\u2019s gave out 10 basis points better than what we anticipated. And if you double click through that and look at urban and suburban, again, very, very nominal variances. Certainly, as we move forward, particularly if we get into an environment that is weaker from an economic standpoint, we do feel very good about our suburban coastal portfolio, given the exposure, new supply is quite a bit less than what we are anticipating in urban environments. So, I would say, kind of as expected right now. But as you look forward, depending on how the environment unfolds, we would probably pivot more towards suburban assets outperforming.\nJamie Feldman: Suburban assets outperforming?\nSean Breslin: Yes.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. Alright. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Hi. Thank you. I know you talked a little bit about Gables already, but I was wondering how big you think this revenue opportunity could be as far as offering this kind of office \u2013 back-office support functions for other operators?\nBen Schall: John, yes, we haven\u2019t sized it yet at this point. We went through the pilot, as I described. We want to get to our first third-party client fully implemented. We get a little bit further out. We will start thinking about the profile of additional clients and even further down the road, thinking about where it could come, but we are not at that stage yet.\nJohn Kim: Okay. And where do you see the most attractive opportunities, whether it\u2019s the broken deals that you talked about in the presentation versus mezz or other ground-up developments?\nBen Schall: Yes. I will hit maybe on three areas, and Matt can add in because he and his teams are living and breathing this. First is the development side, which we talked about. Second is on acquisitions, and this gets into \u2013 we do think our relative trade, selling out of the established regions and into the expansion regions, is more attractive today. We have got a couple of assets now that hopefully, we will sell over the next couple of months. And so when we look to deploy that capital, the types of situations we can be looking at are could be deals in lease up, right, which are harder to finance for most buyers today, could be a place where we can bring our platform to bear for a particular reason, nearby asset. But generally, in this type of environment we are not doing a ton of buying and selling. On the buy side, we are going to be looking for places where we can add and create some incremental yield on those acquisitions over the first couple of years. And then the third category that I would highlight goes broadly to the theme in a world of capital is less abundant. We believe opportunities will present themselves to us. But it also makes our capital more attractive, right. So, you think about our programs, the developer funding program, our structured investment program. And we look out over that book of business, and we think we have the ability, stronger sponsors, stronger quality real estate, better returns. So, that\u2019s another place where we can selectively put capital to create value.\nJohn Kim: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Dennerlein: Yes. Hi everyone. Thanks for the question. Kind of go back to the opening remarks about the development pipeline and how you don\u2019t mark to market the yield until they are impacted lease-up, does that imply that the potential uplift from the seven projects that haven\u2019t gotten to lease up yet, but will go into it later this year, not included in the guidance range?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. This is Matt. The guidance for the year, most of those deals are going to really impact earnings in \u201824 and \u201825 because they are not going to start leasing until later this year. So, we do have lease-up budgets on those deals, which is reflected in the guidance, which does reflect higher rents than kind of what\u2019s shown on the development attachment, but the real lift there isn\u2019t \u201823, it\u2019s \u201824.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And then one follow-up to that, the 70 basis uplift for that, you said projects you have currently with updated projections, is that a fair uplift at this point for those seven projects?\nMatt Birenbaum: I would say that, that was kind of the point of included in the slide, yes, that if the 17% uplift in rent is roughly comparable to what we have seen across our entire same-store book over that time, if that \u2013 if those seven lease-ups experience similar kind of rent growth to kind of what we have seen broadly over that time period. And yes, I mean we would be expecting to see the yields on those deals rise by like roughly similar amount.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. And then you mentioned \u2013 like if you could start a project today, you are seeing good construction pricing bids versus like a few had something that might not start for a year, you are not seeing that. What\u2019s driving that dynamic?\nMatt Birenbaum: I think it\u2019s just certainty. I mean when you ask somebody to give you a price on a deal you are not going to start for a year, it\u2019s just \u2013 they are just giving you an estimate number. It\u2019s not \u2013 you can\u2019t take that number to the bank. Anyway, you don\u2019t even \u2013 you don\u2019t have final construction drawing. So, you are not contracting at that number. It\u2019s more of an allowance. And so it\u2019s natural for people to say, \u201cWell, here is where I did the last job at.\u201d When you have a job that\u2019s ready to go and it\u2019s like, I need your guys on site in 90 days, that\u2019s when some subcontractors are busy and don\u2019t need the business. And we will give you a \u2013 we will not give you a number that\u2019s any better than the number they would have given you 90 days ago. But there are others where, as I have said, maybe they were working on five jobs, they only see two coming up, they have availability, and they are essentially willing to lean into their margins, which got very inflated over the last couple of years when all these subcontractors were stretched beyond their capacity.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey. Good afternoon. A couple of quick ones for me. I guess first a question on the equity that you pulled from your forward and investing with the bank at the 5%, how much is that? Can you request to withdraw it at any time at your option? And what\u2019s the longer term plan for that capital? Is it ultimately earmarked for development funding, or would you also consider acquisitions or other DFP? Thanks.\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Yes, sure, Handel. This is Kevin. Well, the amount that we pulled down the equity for was $490 million. And so roughly speaking, that\u2019s the amount that we incrementally invested, and we did so. And latter time deposits with banking partners that are very highly rated, known to us, part of our credit facility syndicate. And so \u2013 and the latter-time deposits are essentially mapped to when we think we will be pulling that capital down or need the cash in order to reinvest into development. So, that\u2019s how we have structured that set of the cash investment activity so far. So \u2013 and we would retain liquidity to fund development from that source as well as liquidity on our line of credit, so we \u2013 of $2.25 billion, where there is nothing drawn. So, we have plenty of ability to respond to new opportunities that may justify an earlier deployment of cash, either from the cash is \u2013 the cash we have invested or from our line of credit.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Thanks Kevin. That\u2019s helpful. Ben, maybe one for you. For those of us who followed AvalonBay for some time, the recent changes you have made entering the mezz lending business still being deeper into third-party services and even a more proactive cash management strategy, capitalizing on the environment to generate some incremental FFO that you outlined. I guess I am curious, how should we be interpreting these changes and what they suggest for Avalon\u2019s longer term strategy as you evolve the platform? Curious what else you are considering, what else top of mind as you have to get the company forward? And then how did you think about the trade-offs for perhaps growing the revenue, but maybe adding a bit of complexity and maybe a lower multiple as well? Thank you.\nBen Schall: Yes. I appreciate that. I would start by emphasizing, I mean this is about this executive team, right. So, we are the ones setting the course for this business over the coming years, and we are looking for ways to continue to drive earnings, profit and ways to differentiate that we think can lead to long-term value creation. A number of the recent announcements, including the DFP and SIP, there have been versions of this that have existed, elements that we are working on. And so we have decided as a team, in certain areas, where we think we can accelerate that activity. And so you have seen that come. In terms of our strategic focus areas, we have communicated this externally and continue to emphasize it internally. First is our operating model transformation and driving margin and value to customers through that. Second is optimizing our portfolio as we grow. And part of that is our movement to the expansion markets and also looking to prune assets out of our established regions. Third is leveraging our development DNA in new ways. And so that gets into our programs like our DFP and our SIP. We don\u2019t talk a lot on this call, but particularly for certain investors, it matters and for associates and increasing our residents, our leadership in ESG. And then the fifth one, we always drive home, and this is what\u2019s special about here is people and culture. So, that\u2019s what \u2013 those are what are driving us as we look ahead and I believe will create outperformance for us.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hey. Good afternoon. So, two questions here. First, on the expansion market, can you just remind us where you are targeting urban versus suburban? Just from some of your peers we have spoken and then speaking to the private operators in the Sunbelt, it definitely seems like the supply competition is much more concentrated in the urban areas, whereas those out in the suburbs tend to be less impacted. So, just sort of curious, as you look at the Sunbelt, how you are framing out your exposure?\nMatt Birenbaum: Yes. Hey Alex, it\u2019s Matt. So, we don\u2019t necessarily start with a particular kind of goal in mind. Really what we are looking for is the best risk-adjusted return. And we are taking it as an opportunity in these expansion regions to construct a portfolio from the ground up. And what we found over the last couple of years as we have started our investment there, that we felt like the supply/demand fundamentals and the pricing of the assets was just more attractive in the suburbs. So, if you look at our Denver portfolio, the assets we bought there, they have all been suburban assets. We did develop the one deal in RiNo to a very high development yield. But \u2013 so we are going to supplement and ultimately have a diversified portfolio. But we tend to be finding better value in the suburbs, not just better supply-demand fundamentals, but also better pricing until recently, probably higher cap rates as well. So, same thing in Southeast Florida, if you look at where we bought in Southeast Florida, it has tended to be more we bought in Voka [ph]. We bought in Margao. We just recently bought a couple of different assets in Broward County. So, we have tended to find better value there. And we are very mindful of that as we invest. We may develop a little bit in urban areas, if we find a really strong opportunity, but a lot of our development pipeline is also suburban right now. In Denver, we have the one deal under construction in Westminster, and then we have one deal in Governor\u2019s Park, which is more of an urban submarket. But these Sunbelt markets, in the first place is not as much. They are not as urban in the first place. So, I don\u2019t know that there is an urban submarket in all of Raleigh, Durham, in the Downtown Raleigh. And we are not looking at that. So \u2013 and in Charlotte, all of our development has been in the suburbs. We did buy the portfolio in the South kind \u2013 which is kind of the one urban submarket there that is very, very dynamic. So, I would say that\u2019s the exception. But generally speaking, you are right, it may be a little bit of a different strategy than the way some others have pursued it. And it\u2019s also kind of just more of the way the lifestyle is in a lot of the Sunbelt metros. They just \u2013 they don\u2019t necessarily have the same transit orientation. They don\u2019t have the concentration of employment. And a lot of the reason people are moving there is frankly to have more space and have more of that suburban stuff, so.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. The second question is, just given what\u2019s going on in the insurance market, are you seeing more of \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say opportunity, but are you seeing that it\u2019s financially better for you to take on more self-insuring your portfolio to reduce the cost, or maybe, especially as you partner with developers where you guys are self-insuring more, to try and mitigate some of the pretty \u2013 the sizable premium jumps or the ability or inability to get certain carriers or reinsurers?\nKevin O\u2019Shea: Alex, this is Kevin. Maybe I will just respond strictly to the insurance aspects of this, and then may Ben or Matt may want to respond to the development implications. But you are spot on with respect to highlighting the self-insurance aspects and really the relative strength of well-capitalized REITs and particularly, residential REITs that absorb this risk as opposed to passing on to commercial tenants. So, having that capability to self-insure has been a helpful thing in recent years as the insurance market has become increasingly challenging. I am not going to get too specific about what\u2019s going on with those property renewal now, because we renew on May 15th, so we are actually in the market for that. But we have, in the past, I would say, 7 years or 8 years, used our wholly-owned regulated captive insurance company in order to be strategic in these property renewals, to mitigate bearing the full impact of market increases in property insurance premiums, to the extent individual insurers have become inefficient in their pricing. And so that has helped keep our insurance costs in the property program to a far lower than market rate of growth. And so for example, last year, total insurance costs, which properties have the biggest piece, grew then by 4% to 5% last year. We do expect a higher level of growth this year in the property program. But as we look at this year\u2019s renewal, we\u2019re likely to be willing to take on more self-retained risk through our captive in order to mitigate inefficient pricing from some of the market participants should that be necessary.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ami Probandt with UBS. Please proceed with your question. \nAmi Probandt: Hi. So turnover was up from the 2022 lows, but remains low on a historic basis. Wondering over the next couple of years, do you think we trend back toward a more historic level? Or has demand shifted in a way where turnover could remain below the historic level?\nSean Breslin: Ami, this is Sean. Good question. Obviously, somewhat speculative in nature in terms of what happens. I mean the one thing I would say is that we continue to remain in a relatively tight housing market overall. If you look at the sort of aggregation of multifamily, single-family, etcetera and the ability for people to access the kind of inventory they want, may be more limited, particularly on the single-family side, maybe condos, townhomes, et cetera, in the last couple of years. That does not seem to be likely to correct. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably the one macro factor that may put some cap on sort of churn and people that would typically 13%, 14%, 15% that might go buy a home, this past quarter, that was less than 10%. And that\u2019s not likely to get better in the near-term given the financing market, but also just the production in terms of what\u2019s actually being put on the ground. So that\u2019s one factor that may kind of keep a lid on things here for the next several quarters.\nAmi Probandt: Okay. Great. And then another quick one. How do yields on the projects and the developer funding program compare with AvalonBay development yields?\nMatt Birenbaum: Hey, Ami, this is Matt. They are \u2013 the way we think about that program is basically we\u2019re allocating the risk differently than on our own development. And so consequently, the target returns are also allocated differently. Our target is for the yield to be roughly halfway between an acquisition and a development. What we found so far, and the few we\u2019ve done is that it\u2019s been higher than that. So the way I would think about it is the yield on those deals is probably going to be 30, 40 basis points less than the yield on if we\u2019ve done the development ourselves, but still probably at least 50, 60 basis points north of where an acquisition yield would be, if not more.\nAmi Probandt: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Powell: Hi, good afternoon. Broader question, I guess, on the Governor of New York\u2019s housing proposal that is stalled now in the Senate and the House there, that would have expanded zoning for multifamily in the suburbs. Was that an opportunity for you to develop? Or was that more supply? And how do you view those kinds of, I guess, initiatives nationwide going forward?\nMatt Birenbaum: I would have \u2013 this is Matt. I think \u2013 and Ben and Sean may want to weigh in as well. It\u2019s really interesting to see these states try to engage in that dialogue about. But one of the things that has really led to the supply constraints that have in turn led to really an underproduction of housing has been local control. And that is a bit of a third rail politically in California, in New York and other states. So it\u2019s interesting to see the state legislatures try to chip away at it. I think you\u2019re right, it\u2019s both, right? It would be an opportunity for us as a developer. If it was really effective in the long run, it might lower the long-term rent growth trajectory of some of those markets. Frankly, from a public policy point of view, that\u2019s kind of would be the point of it. What we\u2019ve seen so far, at least in California, has been every time there is been something that, in theory, would have opened up more sites to development, there is been something else on the other side that\u2019s come with it that has made it a bit of a poison pill. So it has been very difficult to actually effectuate. They say they\u2019ll allow multifamily in your transit, but then they are saying it has to be prevailing wage, construction cost, which is a 20%, 30% premium. And so economically, it doesn\u2019t work. Or they\u2019ll open it up in certain sites, but they need 20%, 25% affordable. And again, you can\u2019t afford the going price for land and make that economics work. So the one place we\u2019ve seen it truly be effective so far has been with the smaller program in California, the ADU accessory dwelling unit. We actually have over 100 of those currently in our pipeline, where we can just add two, three, four, five, six, seven apartments in kind of underutilized storage or parking areas at existing communities and not have to go through its zoning process. So that\u2019s not going to move the needle kind of on the prominent macro level, but that\u2019s one small program we have been able to take advantage of.\nBen Schall: And then maybe just to add kind of \u2013 yes, the higher level regulatory dynamics are influencing our portfolio allocation decisions. It\u2019s been a part of the reason why over the last number of years, we\u2019ve been moving more and more to a suburban-oriented portfolio. And if you see where we\u2019re allocating capital, we\u2019re two-thirds suburban today, probably headed towards three quarters there. It\u2019s influenced our move to the expansion regions, right, at a minimum to diversify away from regulatory environments. And then the reality is, at a more local level based on some of the steps of certain municipalities. And effectively, the bar is higher for allocating new capital there and it\u2019s playing into how we\u2019re shifting capital around our portfolio and within our regions.\nAnthony Powell: Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d like to hand the call back to Ben Schall for closing remarks.\nBen Schall: Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your support and look forward to speaking with you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Matt Birenbaum",
            "content": "Alright. Great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to Slide 9, our lease-ups continue to deliver outstanding results, laying the foundation for strong future growth in both earnings and NAV. We currently have 4 development communities that had active leasing in Q1, all of which started construction early in the pandemic, before rents had started to rise meaningfully. As a general rule, we do not update our projected rents on lease-ups until we open for business and start to gain leasing velocity, at which point, we mark those rents to current market levels. For these four deals, we have seen an increase of $485 per month or 17% above our initial underwriting. This in turn is driving a 70 basis points increase in the yield on these investments to 6.7%, well above current cap rates and even further above the cost of the capital we source to fund these deals, back when they broke ground consistent with our match funding approach. Looking ahead, we expect to start leasing on an additional 7 communities before the end of the year. We have not yet marked the rents on these projects to current market, but in general, the locations in which they're located have seen similar increases in market rent since we started construction, providing a great opportunity for further lift in their results as well. As shown on Slide 10, with most of our communities \u2013 development communities still early in lease up or yet to open, we realized just $10 million of the total projected $142 million in NOI from the entire development booked in Q1. This leaves over $130 million of incremental NOI to come as these assets complete construction stabilize. And as for the prior slide, that total NOI figure is also likely understated, given only 4 of those 18 total projects have been marked to market today. Turning to Slide 11, as we look to future development starts, we are certainly starting to see shifts in the development market in response to the Fed tightening of the past several quarters. Among our competitors, many planned projects are being postponed or abandoned as third-party financing becomes scarce and cut. And some of these drop-laying contracts are starting to come back to the market with much lower pricing expectations. We've already been able to take advantage of several of these situations with recent additions to our development rights pipeline, and we do expect to see more as the market adjusts. The slowdown in starts in turn is starting to impact the construction market, where we are finally starting to see some retraction in subcontractor trade pricing after 3 years of outsized increases. An environment where capital is scarce and certainty of execution becomes more critical, both to land sellers and subcontractors, plays well to our strengths as both the developer and the general contractor. And we have traditionally seen some of our most profitable investment opportunities when these more challenging cyclical conditions have prevailed. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kevin for an update on the balance sheet and the CCC. Sure. Hey, Steve, it's Matt. Yes, so our target yield or going in initial return on new development has been rising really over the last year as we saw cap rates rise and cost of capital rise, both debt and equity. So our target yields were probably in the mid-5s, mid- to high 5s last year. And now they're kind of in the mid-6s, low to mid-6s, depending on the geography and the risk associated with the deal. So our start activity for the year is as the \u2013 it is probably a little more back half weighted just by the way the \u2013 as time goes by, we're going to see more buyout savings on our hard costs. So in some \u2013 that probably plays to our advantage a little bit. And we can play that a little more aggressively given that we act as our own general contractor, 90% of our development, which is a little different than I think many others. So \u2013 but when I look at our development starts that are slated for this year, that's about where the yields are. They are probably in the low 6s. And you have to kind of look at the geographic mix and the risk profile of those deals to kind of weigh the profitability of each one, which is what we do. But again, we've been pretty consistent in saying we're continuing to look for that 100 to 150 basis point spread on new starts. And frankly, the stuff that we started last year and the year before, the spreads are well wider than that, which was kind of highlighted on the slide. Austin, it's Matt. I can speak to that a little bit, and Ben maybe want to as well. But \u2013 so the good news is we have a \u2013 we're controlling a lot of really good real estate right now for very modest upfront investment. So we've kind of been operating the platform in anticipation of a potential opportunity emerging like this really for the last couple of years. And we've added quite a lot to our pipeline over the last year or 2. We're controlling, I think, 40 or 41 potential deals with pretty modest land on our balance sheet. I think it was $180 million. At the end of the quarter, the total investment, including capitalized pursuit cost, is only around $235 million or $240 million. So we have \u2013 and a lot of those options are not yet at the point where we have to make a decision about are we going to close? Are we going to \u2013 as Ben mentioned, there are some conversations going on with some sellers about these deals were struck in a different environment. So I think we're well positioned. I wouldn't say it's quite there yet. It's not like development economics are screening value yet. We kind of have to see where asset values settle out, and that's the other side of this, is what's going on in the transaction market, which is still pretty muted deal volumes. But we do have the ability to ramp it up if we see that emerging kind of later this year, particularly when we look to next year. The other thing is, as I mentioned, we are starting to see the moderation in hard costs, particularly in some markets where start volume has come down. There are other markets where that's coming, but it's not here quite yet. So we're watching that very closely every day. And that's the other opportunity that we will see. There are some markets where we think it's going to come down more. There is other markets where it's going to take a little more time. But over \u2013 particularly the next 4 or 5 months, as we have more deals out in the market actively bidding, we will have a much better sense for where hard costs are going. Because what we're finding today is if you have a job that you're going to start in a year and you're showing preliminary drawns, you're not getting particularly attractive pricing. But if you have a job that's truly ready to go, you've got a permit in hand, subcontractors can see some early site work and they have a hole in their production schedule, that's when you're seeing the more aggressive bid. Yes. This is Matt. I guess, I'll speak to that one. So what we've said of cap rates and then our own trading activity, I think what we're seeing is that there is a bifurcated market. There are a lot of assets that are not trading. Those that are, I would kind of put them into two buckets, kind of the haves and the have nots. The haves, which is highly desirable assets in locations, either markets or submarkets that are on a lot of investors' lists. For growth, those assets are still trading in the mid-4s cap rates. I think, in fact, I would have \u2013 if you'd asked me 90 days ago, I probably would have said high 4s, but \u2013 and we do have some assets actively in the market today that hopefully will close during Q2, and we have at least one that's in that haves category, I would say, that's probably more of a mid-4 cap rate. Now when I say cap rate, I'm not necessarily talking about the yield. I'm talking about kind of the market convention, the way they report a cap rate, which includes a management fee and a CapEx allowance and the buyer's property taxes. The other side of the equation is the assets that maybe have a little bit less of a interest that have a less deep pool of bidders. And there, the have nots, you might have one or two that are seriously interested. And there, I'd say cap rates are probably more like low 5s. And so call that range anywhere from 4.5 to 5.25. And we may have an asset or two that's in that latter category as well that's currently working in the market. As it relates to our own asset trading activity, our plan for the year was to be net neutral. But to \u2013 really, we started last year saying, we were going to sell first and buy seconds. So that to the extent we're trading out of assets in our established regions into our expansion regions, we would know what the cap rate and pricing was on the asset that we were selling, which in turn would inform our appetite on the buy side. So now we do have a couple of dispositions that are in process. And so we are going to be looking here over the next quarter or two to reinvest that capital into potentially some acquisitions in the expansion regions. So we would expect \u2013 I don't know if anything is going to close on the acquisition side in Q2, but it is our plan to kind of resume that forward trading. Yes, John, it's Matt. It's \u2013 I ask Craig Thomas, my Head of Market Research, that question every month when the permit numbers come out. It is a little bit of a head scratcher. I mean, I think in the fourth quarter, a lot of that was probably capital that was committed and have been lined up. And then a lot of the start \u2013 a lot of the permit and even start activity I've come to learn is not kind of what we would think of as our product, as much of half of it is other things. Affordable housing production is actually running pretty high right now. There was a lot of one-time money through some of the COVID relief funds, which has gotten out there. So that could be inflating it a bit. But \u2013 and in some cases, people may be pulling permits and then getting bids and not liking the numbers they are seeing. But it is a little bit of a head scratcher, I would agree with you. Hi, Jamie, it's Matt. I would expect, it's probably more of the latter. Usually, portfolio transactions, unless somebody has some kind of \u2013 unless they bought a portfolio and put a lot of short-term debt on it all, which would be pretty unusual, our portfolio \u2013 usually sellers selling portfolios, it's more opportunistic. And those things happen when there is an abundance of capital. And go back 3, 4 years, there was kind of a portfolio premium. Today, you talked about \u2013 I think, on the last call, there is a portfolio discount just given the capital markets. So we haven't heard of anything like that. And I guess I'd be a little surprised. Yes. This is Matt. The guidance for the year, most of those deals are going to really impact earnings in \u201824 and \u201825 because they are not going to start leasing until later this year. So, we do have lease-up budgets on those deals, which is reflected in the guidance, which does reflect higher rents than kind of what's shown on the development attachment, but the real lift there isn't \u201823, it's \u201824. I would say that, that was kind of the point of included in the slide, yes, that if the 17% uplift in rent is roughly comparable to what we have seen across our entire same-store book over that time, if that \u2013 if those seven lease-ups experience similar kind of rent growth to kind of what we have seen broadly over that time period. And yes, I mean we would be expecting to see the yields on those deals rise by like roughly similar amount. I think it's just certainty. I mean when you ask somebody to give you a price on a deal you are not going to start for a year, it's just \u2013 they are just giving you an estimate number. It's not \u2013 you can't take that number to the bank. Anyway, you don't even \u2013 you don't have final construction drawing. So, you are not contracting at that number. It's more of an allowance. And so it's natural for people to say, \u201cWell, here is where I did the last job at.\u201d When you have a job that's ready to go and it's like, I need your guys on site in 90 days, that's when some subcontractors are busy and don't need the business. And we will give you a \u2013 we will not give you a number that's any better than the number they would have given you 90 days ago. But there are others where, as I have said, maybe they were working on five jobs, they only see two coming up, they have availability, and they are essentially willing to lean into their margins, which got very inflated over the last couple of years when all these subcontractors were stretched beyond their capacity. Yes. Hey Alex, it's Matt. So, we don't necessarily start with a particular kind of goal in mind. Really what we are looking for is the best risk-adjusted return. And we are taking it as an opportunity in these expansion regions to construct a portfolio from the ground up. And what we found over the last couple of years as we have started our investment there, that we felt like the supply/demand fundamentals and the pricing of the assets was just more attractive in the suburbs. So, if you look at our Denver portfolio, the assets we bought there, they have all been suburban assets. We did develop the one deal in RiNo to a very high development yield. But \u2013 so we are going to supplement and ultimately have a diversified portfolio. But we tend to be finding better value in the suburbs, not just better supply-demand fundamentals, but also better pricing until recently, probably higher cap rates as well. So, same thing in Southeast Florida, if you look at where we bought in Southeast Florida, it has tended to be more we bought in Voka [ph]. We bought in Margao. We just recently bought a couple of different assets in Broward County. So, we have tended to find better value there. And we are very mindful of that as we invest. We may develop a little bit in urban areas, if we find a really strong opportunity, but a lot of our development pipeline is also suburban right now. In Denver, we have the one deal under construction in Westminster, and then we have one deal in Governor's Park, which is more of an urban submarket. But these Sunbelt markets, in the first place is not as much. They are not as urban in the first place. So, I don't know that there is an urban submarket in all of Raleigh, Durham, in the Downtown Raleigh. And we are not looking at that. So \u2013 and in Charlotte, all of our development has been in the suburbs. We did buy the portfolio in the South kind \u2013 which is kind of the one urban submarket there that is very, very dynamic. So, I would say that's the exception. But generally speaking, you are right, it may be a little bit of a different strategy than the way some others have pursued it. And it's also kind of just more of the way the lifestyle is in a lot of the Sunbelt metros. They just \u2013 they don't necessarily have the same transit orientation. They don't have the concentration of employment. And a lot of the reason people are moving there is frankly to have more space and have more of that suburban stuff, so. Hey, Ami, this is Matt. They are \u2013 the way we think about that program is basically we're allocating the risk differently than on our own development. And so consequently, the target returns are also allocated differently. Our target is for the yield to be roughly halfway between an acquisition and a development. What we found so far, and the few we've done is that it's been higher than that. So the way I would think about it is the yield on those deals is probably going to be 30, 40 basis points less than the yield on if we've done the development ourselves, but still probably at least 50, 60 basis points north of where an acquisition yield would be, if not more. I would have \u2013 this is Matt. I think \u2013 and Ben and Sean may want to weigh in as well. It's really interesting to see these states try to engage in that dialogue about. But one of the things that has really led to the supply constraints that have in turn led to really an underproduction of housing has been local control. And that is a bit of a third rail politically in California, in New York and other states. So it's interesting to see the state legislatures try to chip away at it. I think you're right, it's both, right? It would be an opportunity for us as a developer. If it was really effective in the long run, it might lower the long-term rent growth trajectory of some of those markets. Frankly, from a public policy point of view, that's kind of would be the point of it. What we've seen so far, at least in California, has been every time there is been something that, in theory, would have opened up more sites to development, there is been something else on the other side that's come with it that has made it a bit of a poison pill. So it has been very difficult to actually effectuate. They say they'll allow multifamily in your transit, but then they are saying it has to be prevailing wage, construction cost, which is a 20%, 30% premium. And so economically, it doesn't work. Or they'll open it up in certain sites, but they need 20%, 25% affordable. And again, you can't afford the going price for land and make that economics work. So the one place we've seen it truly be effective so far has been with the smaller program in California, the ADU accessory dwelling unit. We actually have over 100 of those currently in our pipeline, where we can just add two, three, four, five, six, seven apartments in kind of underutilized storage or parking areas at existing communities and not have to go through its zoning process. So that's not going to move the needle kind of on the prominent macro level, but that's one small program we have been able to take advantage of."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Turning to Slide 12, as we look ahead, our balance sheet remains exceptionally well positioned to provide financial strength and stability while also giving us the flexibility to continue funding attractive growth opportunities across our investment platforms. In this regard, we enjoy low leverage with net debt-to-EBITDA of 4.6x, which is below our target range of 5x to 6x. Our interest coverage ratio and unencumbered NOI percentage are at near record levels at 6.9x and 95%, respectively. And our debt maturities are well laddered, with weighted average years to maturity of about 8 years. In addition, as disclosed in our release, we also enjoyed tremendous liquidity of about $2.8 billion today, with no borrowings under our $2.25 billion unsecured credit facility and an additional $0.5 billion from just having settled our equity forward that we originated a year ago. As a result, we don't need to tap the capital markets for an extended time, and we are well positioned to lean into our balance sheets to take advantage of future investment opportunities that may emerge in our markets over time. On Slide 13, we highlight our recently announced agreement to provide back-office financial administrative support to Gables Residential's portfolio of 25,000 apartment homes from our centralized customer care center, which we established in 2007 to create operating and scale efficiencies and supporting our own portfolio while enhancing our resident customer experience. At the outset, I want to acknowledge the efforts of the entire AvalonBay team that brought this business relationship to Gables across the finish line. We highlight this achievement for several reasons. First, because we are genuinely excited to be able to extend these services to a highly respected multifamily company such as Gables and to its residents; second, because this agreement demonstrates the appeal of the innovative capabilities that we've created in the 16 years since we established the CCC; and third, because we have embarked on extending those capabilities in a way that allows us to create additional value for AvalonBay shareholders by offering to support services to other institutional multifamily owners now and in the future. As a reminder, we are not offering property management services under our agreement with Gables, nor do we intend to do so. As all business and operational decisions related to AvalonBay's and Gables' portfolios will continue to be managed separately by each company, rather we are providing back-office financial administrative support to Gables . And then finally, from an economic and guidance perspective, while we are not disclosing the specific terms of our agreement for confidentiality reasons, the near-term earnings accretion from this agreement is relatively modest and was included in our initial outlook given back in February 2023. With that, I'll turn it back to Ben for closing comments. Sure. Thanks Nick. I'll start and others, Ben or Sean may want to chime in. In terms of the go-forward view of this, we're certainly excited to have this agreement in place. And without getting into the specifics of the economics, I mean, the impact is, at the moment, fairly modest, if you just think about the relative size of our business and our main value creators outside of operations and development and so forth. But we are excited to have it in a place that is accretive. There are, from a contribution point of view, healthy margins, for sure, that make this worth the while. As to the future potential, we're certainly hopeful and inspired to do more business like this, but we are not proactively looking for that new business right now. We've just completed this transaction, of course, with Gables. So \u2013 but we do hope looking ahead to be able to do more business like this over the time. And we think it does make sense for us to do it because over time, because it allows us to scale and more fully invest over time and an important capability that allows us to further differentiate ourselves from our peers. So there's a lot more I could go into there, but maybe I'll just pause there. And I don't know if Sean or Ben have anything else to add. Yes, Eric, let me kind of take a stab at it a little bit. I can't really give you, I mean, an answer what number of units would have to be under this kind of an arrangement for it to be material. It probably depends on what you think is material, I guess, to some degree. I think the way we look at it is from a slightly different perspective, not the immediate financial impact, but it's kind of been alluded to what this sort of thing does for us to continue our journey to create the leading operating platform in the business. And so we're in our 17th year with this experience. And I think that we're pointing this out probably for two reasons. One, to your question about what this can do, the more you do this for not only yourself but for others, the more you can reinvest in that business create a better platform in and of itself over time, that even draw, for our own sake, when we started, we weren't at our current size of, whatever, 80,000 apartment homes when we started this in 2007, we were quite a bit smaller. And it has gotten better itself over time. We've really fine-tuned and honed the CCC so that it's substantially better than it was even back in 2007 and 2010 and has done a number of things you can see on the slide here for us over time. I mean one thing it did is when we had the Archstone transaction, we were able to add 20,000 units in 30 days. So that bespoke that speaks to sort of the ability to scale quickly when you've got that capability centralized in-house. And the other reason why we think it's worth highlighting for you, apart from the fact that it is a relatively modest financial significance today, is the fact that a highly respected institutional multifamily owner, such as Gables, by entering the screen with us after its own due diligence on us and our center does provide external validation of the strength and the economic value of the capabilities we've created at the CCC over the past 16 years. And we think that's something that's worth emphasizing to our investors, given the increasing importance of generating alpha in our operating platform through innovation, which we're continuing to do across the entire business at this point. I feel I'm pretty confident about it. When I look at the starts for the year, we started one in the first quarter. We have one that we've just started. It will be a second quarter start, a third one where we have all of our final budgets, and it's been approved through our investment committee. So that's 3 of the 7 rate starts we have planned for the year. And when I look at it, the other ones, I'm feeling pretty confident that we should track that, unless something very unexpected happens. Yes, sure, Handel. This is Kevin. Well, the amount that we pulled down the equity for was $490 million. And so roughly speaking, that's the amount that we incrementally invested, and we did so. And latter time deposits with banking partners that are very highly rated, known to us, part of our credit facility syndicate. And so \u2013 and the latter-time deposits are essentially mapped to when we think we will be pulling that capital down or need the cash in order to reinvest into development. So, that's how we have structured that set of the cash investment activity so far. So \u2013 and we would retain liquidity to fund development from that source as well as liquidity on our line of credit, so we \u2013 of $2.25 billion, where there is nothing drawn. So, we have plenty of ability to respond to new opportunities that may justify an earlier deployment of cash, either from the cash is \u2013 the cash we have invested or from our line of credit. Alex, this is Kevin. Maybe I will just respond strictly to the insurance aspects of this, and then may Ben or Matt may want to respond to the development implications. But you are spot on with respect to highlighting the self-insurance aspects and really the relative strength of well-capitalized REITs and particularly, residential REITs that absorb this risk as opposed to passing on to commercial tenants. So, having that capability to self-insure has been a helpful thing in recent years as the insurance market has become increasingly challenging. I am not going to get too specific about what's going on with those property renewal now, because we renew on May 15th, so we are actually in the market for that. But we have, in the past, I would say, 7 years or 8 years, used our wholly-owned regulated captive insurance company in order to be strategic in these property renewals, to mitigate bearing the full impact of market increases in property insurance premiums, to the extent individual insurers have become inefficient in their pricing. And so that has helped keep our insurance costs in the property program to a far lower than market rate of growth. And so for example, last year, total insurance costs, which properties have the biggest piece, grew then by 4% to 5% last year. We do expect a higher level of growth this year in the property program. But as we look at this year's renewal, we're likely to be willing to take on more self-retained risk through our captive in order to mitigate inefficient pricing from some of the market participants should that be necessary."

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Ben. Continuing with Slide 7 to address market trends, effective rents in the East and West are up about 10% from pre-COVID levels but took very different paths to get to the same point. Rents on the West Coast, which have historically been more volatile than the East, declined sharply in 2020 escalated significantly in 2021 and the first half of 2022 and then softened consistent with seasonal norms in the back half of 2022. Rents on the East Coast experienced a more modest decline through COVID and have grown steadily since Q1 2021 with very modest seasonality in the back half of 2022. And consistent with historical norms, both coast posted positive sequential monthly rent growth during the first quarter. From a year-over-year growth rate perspective, the West Coast continued to decelerate during Q1 and while the East Coast shows signs of stabilization, bolstered by slightly better growth in absolute rent levels since the beginning of the year. Moving to Slide 8 to address trends in our same-store portfolio. Key performance indicators were healthy during Q1 and remained so heading into the prime leasing season. Our availability was in the low-5% range during the quarter. Turnover, which was relatively stable during the quarter, was lower than Q4 2022 as the volume of residents leaving our communities to purchase a home declined by roughly 25% sequentially and about one-third year-over-year. Occupancy increased about 30 basis points from Q4. And as noted in Chart 4 on Slide 8 and also in our earnings release, Brent change improved from 3.7% in January to 4.9% in April. Additionally, our portfolio average asking rent has increased about 3.5% since the beginning of the year, up 4% on the East and about 3% on the West and is slightly ahead of our original expectation. Also, renewal offers from May and June went out at roughly 7%. I'll turn it over to Matt to address development now. Matt? Yes, Steve, good questions. Maybe I'll provide a little of a high-level commentary as it relates to renewals versus new move-ins and a little bit about trends. But in the first quarter, what I'd say is if you look at the blend there, renewals were kind of in the high 5s, and new move-ins were sort of in the mid-2% range. And then in April, renewals were sort of in the mid-5s, but new move-in, just given the seasonality of rents, has kind of moved up into the mid-4s, just to give you some perspective there. And our expectation is that consistent with what we talked about on the first quarter call, that we would see the best rent change kind of in the first quarter, and then it would begin to decelerate. But that's dependent upon what happens with growth and asking rents as we move through the year. So our expectation is still consistent with what we communicated in Q1, is that we would see Q1 perform well, and then we would start to see some moderation, both in rent change and in overall rental revenue growth. And that's still the expectation. And part of that, you got to have to keep in mind is on a year-over-year basis, the headwind associated with the reduction in rent relief becomes far material as you get into the second and third quarter, and that will create some moderation from a rental revenue growth perspective. But as it relates to rent change, based on what we know today, I would say, as you get further into the second quarter, we would expect that to begin to moderate more so than what obviously we saw in the first quarter. Sure, Adam. This is Sean. Just a couple of comments on that. First, as it relates to bad debt during the quarter, the sort of uncollectible portion from our residents, as we think about a sort of underlying bad debt, came in at around 3%, which is about 22 basis points better than what we anticipated. And that's the $0.01 that Ben basically spoke about in terms of what we picked up in the first quarter. Moving forward, for the balance of the year, we're expecting Q2 through Q4 to average roughly 2.7%, starting at about 3% in Q2 and then sort of trending down throughout the year in terms of that underlying sort of bad debt percentage. So that's how the sort of trajectory looks as you move forward. Different markets are doing different things. We saw some nice improvement in New York \u2013 the Greater New York region in the first quarter. It was responsible for about half the variance in the quarter, about third in Southern Cal and then kind of sprinkled across the other markets as well. So overall, we were pleased with what we saw in the first quarter, but it doesn't necessarily make for a trend just yet, and we will be able to revisit that mid-year once we have a better sense for how things are playing out as we move through the second quarter as well. Adam, what I'd say is anything is possible. I don't think that is probable based on the resident behavior we have seen thus far. So I would not anticipate that. To the extent that we, all of a sudden, cash started ringing in from people who haven't paid, that's not necessarily what we've expected in our guidance, it would be a bump. But I would not expect that as a likely outcome. Sure, Chandni. This is Sean. Happy to answer that. First, in terms of Q1 activity, across all the leases we signed in the quarter, which was about 16,000 leases, the average concession is less than $200. So very, very modest. Obviously, more concentrated in certain places. What I would tell you is about 30% of the concession volume that we experienced in the quarter in terms of leases that were captured were spread across Seattle and the Bay Area, particularly in San Francisco. So that's where most of the volume is, frankly. But if you look at concessions over the last few weeks, just to give you a little more recent data, less than 10% of the transactions that we're executing are seeing a concession. And again, it's more concentrated in those two areas, San Francisco and the Pacific Northwest, where in those markets, you're 30%, 40%, 45% of the leases, depending on submarket or getting some type of a concession. So those are the two places where we're focused on at the most in terms of moving volume, but it's not a significant issue elsewhere. Yes. Jim, it's Sean. What I would say is that, yes, generally, things were in line. The rent change that we experienced in Q1, that's gave out 10 basis points better than what we anticipated. And if you double click through that and look at urban and suburban, again, very, very nominal variances. Certainly, as we move forward, particularly if we get into an environment that is weaker from an economic standpoint, we do feel very good about our suburban coastal portfolio, given the exposure, new supply is quite a bit less than what we are anticipating in urban environments. So, I would say, kind of as expected right now. But as you look forward, depending on how the environment unfolds, we would probably pivot more towards suburban assets outperforming. Yes. Ami, this is Sean. Good question. Obviously, somewhat speculative in nature in terms of what happens. I mean the one thing I would say is that we continue to remain in a relatively tight housing market overall. If you look at the sort of aggregation of multifamily, single-family, etcetera and the ability for people to access the kind of inventory they want, may be more limited, particularly on the single-family side, maybe condos, townhomes, et cetera, in the last couple of years. That does not seem to be likely to correct. So I'd say that's probably the one macro factor that may put some cap on sort of churn and people that would typically 13%, 14%, 15% that might go buy a home, this past quarter, that was less than 10%. And that's not likely to get better in the near-term given the financing market, but also just the production in terms of what's actually being put on the ground. So that's one factor that may kind of keep a lid on things here for the next several quarters."

            "name": "Ben Schall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason. In terms of key themes for this quarter, I will start by reviewing our strong start to the year and describe why we believe our suburban coastal portfolio is particularly well-positioned. Sean will discuss our operating performance and relative strength as we enter the peak leasing season. Matt will comment on the evolving development market and detail the differentiated earnings stream that our developments currently underway set to provide. And Kevin will review our strong financial position and highlight the advancements at our industry-leading centralized service center we utilize to drive revenue and operating efficiencies. Turning to our presentation, starting on Page 4, we continue to meaningfully grow earnings in Q1 with core FFO increasing 13.7%. A significant part of this uplift is related to the roll-through of leases signed last year. We also continue to grow rents during Q1 with like-term effective rent change of 4.1%. For the quarter, we exceeded core FFO guidance by $0.05, with the $0.01 of revenue primarily attributable to better-than-expected collection rates from residents, $0.03 due to lower operating expenses and $0.01 related to interest income and other items. In early April, we drew down the proceeds of our equity forward, which we entered into about a year ago, at the spot price of $255 per share. A couple of items to highlight here. First, the additional cost of this $500 million of capital is in the low-4% range. As was originally intended, we've allocated this capital to development projects underway, which are projected to generate development yields of 6% or more. So when we talk about funding our underway development at yesterday's capital cost, this almost 200 basis point spread is what we're referring to and leads to significant value creation for shareholders as these projects stabilize. The second aspect of the drawdown of the equity forward is unique to the current environment in which we can earn outsized returns on cash. We weren't originally planning to draw down the equity forward until Q4 of this year, but we executed it now and have invested the cash at 5%-plus interest rates with extremely strong banking partners. On a net basis, the incremental income on this cash is projected to increase 2023 core FFO by approximately $0.03 per share, after factoring in the incremental shares outstanding. We, in turn, increased our full year core FFO guidance by $0.10 to $10.41 per share at the midpoint. The breakdown is as follows: $0.02 in revenue with the $0.01 from Q1 and then an additional $0.01 in Q2 based on slightly better rental rates. There's an assumed $0.02 improvement for operating expenses for the full year, which includes the $0.03 from Q1, partially offset by $0.01 higher OpEx in the second half of the year. And then $0.06 of additional core FFO, primarily from the interest income on the equity forward proceeds as well as other cash management and slightly updated assumptions related to the transaction timing. We do not adjust our same-store guidance ranges at this point, and we'll reevaluate those as part of our more fulsome midyear we forecast. Turning to Page 5 regarding market fundamentals. Occupancy and rent trends in our established regions are experiencing less volatility than in the Sunbelt regions. Part of this is a reversion to long-term trend lines. There are also underlying demand factors providing greater stability in our established regions and two are worth noting. First, rent-to-income ratios are generally in line with traditional levels. As noted in Chart 3, effective market rents in our established regions have grown about 10% over the past 3 years with income levels more than keeping pace with rent growth. And second, with limited single-family home inventory and higher interest costs, the economics of renting are considerably more favorable than buying a home in our markets. The near-term supply picture also bodes well for the performance of our suburban coaster portfolio. As shown on Page 6, our established regions have meaningfully less new supply coming online this year, estimated at 1.6% of stock as compared to Sunbelt markets at 3.6%. And as shown on the right-hand side of this page, when we look at supply that is directly competing with our portfolio, levels are even lower, at 1.4% of stock overall and only 1.2% of stock in our suburban markets, which comprises roughly two-thirds of our portfolio. In terms of our portfolio allocation objectives, we do still want to shift 25% of our portfolio to our expansion regions over time in order to diversify and optimize our longer-term growth profile. So that has not changed. And in the near term, the relative trade of selling assets in our established regions to acquire assets in the expansion regions could be more attractive to us than it has been, allowing us to more profitably reposition our portfolio for future growth. And with that, I'll turn it to Sean for more specifics on the operating backdrop. Alright. Thanks, Kevin. Page 14 summarizes our key takeaways and focus areas. We're pleased with our start to the year expect our portfolio to outperform as we look ahead; and also mindful that these are the types of environments, particularly in an environment in which capital is generally less abundant in the industry, to selectively take advantage of opportunities in order to create value for shareholders. With that, I'll now ask the operator to open the line for questions. Yes. I think as well, but I'll add a couple of things, and thanks for the question, Nick. I would connect for you this step as the kind of next continued evolution, both of our operating model journey but as well as the role that the CCC and centralized services are planned for us. And so part of the appeal, in addition to the revenue and profit opportunity with Gables, we are increasingly handling more services, at least in part and at a centralized way. And this relationship allows us to make continued investments. Think about technology, process people that we think can then accrue to the larger platform here at AvalonBay. So it's a nice next step in our overall operating model journey and we're excited for this first step and potentially future clients going forward. Steve, maybe a little bit more to your question about how is our development approach changing. And we do have a fairly fulsome development rights pipeline. And Matt's talking about our near-term starts, which are fairly baked at this point. But the next set of deals, right, in that pipeline over the next couple of years, part of what we're going through right now is very effectively reworking those deals, right, to reflect today's environment. And given what's happening with some of our competitors, some of the formerly active developers there, sellers are starting to increasingly acknowledge that the environment has changed. And so that's leading to land repricing, that's leading to more attractive terms. It's allowing us to control high-quality real estate, relatively limited upfront costs. So, all those dynamics continue to run in our direction. Yes, Austin. On the first piece, short version of it, there were some existing relationships across the firms, which sort of started the conversations. We then went through a pilot with Gables on a smaller portion of this portfolio to test it, both for them and for us. And on the heels of that, we both decided to proceed given the benefits that were being realized. And then to your last piece, no, this is not an acquisition type of approach or angle here. This is much more focused on operational benefits. Two areas I'd emphasize, One, just on the point of our relatively limited land holdings, when you look across our peer set, our landholding numbers is below a number of our peers, despite kind of our ability to execute at higher development levels throughout cycles. So we've got some room in there. The second part is in an environment right now, we recognize we need to be selective about that. But in places, it could be markets we know really well, have nearby operating communities, places where we can bring our platform into, we're finding opportunities there in our expansion markets for some high-quality land deals that are falling out of contract, ability to step in. And yes, there have been a couple of situations where land is getting repriced at 30% to 35%, where it was priced 9 months ago. If we can step in and control that land with relatively limited cost to look out a couple of years, and we think that will accrue some significant benefits. I think we are still early. There are more sellers than less who are actually willing to give current contracts to the time, right, extend out and see where it heads. But we are starting to see some situations where deals are breaking. And the two situations I was referring to had buyers who are relatively motivated. And when they are looking at on the landscape, this goes to Matt's comments about our ability to execute our \u2013 that we don't need to rely on construction financing, right, to execute projects today, those buyers are going to own the margin, look to somebody like AvalonBay to contract to \u2013 contract with. So that's \u2013 yes, I'd say that's the kind of the general environment. Our expectation is that there is more to come. Starts are \u2013 we're expecting to be down substantially this year. And a big part of underlying all of this is you look out at the private market environment and the merchant builders who have been very prolific, their ability to get capital for new construction deals is just very challenging. And the cost of that capital has also expanded out significantly, right? So on a relative basis, this is one of the parts that we're starting to see. While our cost of capital has gone up or in our cost of debt borrowing has obviously gone up from the 2% range to 5% range, the private market players, if they can get construction financing, those senior mortgages are at 7.5% to 8.5% now, right? And that's before putting on some preferred equity or mezz and that's before getting to equity, right? So our relative advantage in a period like this, we think, is we're relatively well positioned. And so selectively, we're going to start stepping into some of these types of opportunities. John, yes, we haven't sized it yet at this point. We went through the pilot, as I described. We want to get to our first third-party client fully implemented. We get a little bit further out. We will start thinking about the profile of additional clients and even further down the road, thinking about where it could come, but we are not at that stage yet. Yes. I will hit maybe on three areas, and Matt can add in because he and his teams are living and breathing this. First is the development side, which we talked about. Second is on acquisitions, and this gets into \u2013 we do think our relative trade, selling out of the established regions and into the expansion regions, is more attractive today. We have got a couple of assets now that hopefully, we will sell over the next couple of months. And so when we look to deploy that capital, the types of situations we can be looking at are could be deals in lease up, right, which are harder to finance for most buyers today, could be a place where we can bring our platform to bear for a particular reason, nearby asset. But generally, in this type of environment we are not doing a ton of buying and selling. On the buy side, we are going to be looking for places where we can add and create some incremental yield on those acquisitions over the first couple of years. And then the third category that I would highlight goes broadly to the theme in a world of capital is less abundant. We believe opportunities will present themselves to us. But it also makes our capital more attractive, right. So, you think about our programs, the developer funding program, our structured investment program. And we look out over that book of business, and we think we have the ability, stronger sponsors, stronger quality real estate, better returns. So, that's another place where we can selectively put capital to create value. Yes. I appreciate that. I would start by emphasizing, I mean this is about this executive team, right. So, we are the ones setting the course for this business over the coming years, and we are looking for ways to continue to drive earnings, profit and ways to differentiate that we think can lead to long-term value creation. A number of the recent announcements, including the DFP and SIP, there have been versions of this that have existed, elements that we are working on. And so we have decided as a team, in certain areas, where we think we can accelerate that activity. And so you have seen that come. In terms of our strategic focus areas, we have communicated this externally and continue to emphasize it internally. First is our operating model transformation and driving margin and value to customers through that. Second is optimizing our portfolio as we grow. And part of that is our movement to the expansion markets and also looking to prune assets out of our established regions. Third is leveraging our development DNA in new ways. And so that gets into our programs like our DFP and our SIP. We don't talk a lot on this call, but particularly for certain investors, it matters and for associates and increasing our residents, our leadership in ESG. And then the fifth one, we always drive home, and this is what's special about here is people and culture. So, that's what \u2013 those are what are driving us as we look ahead and I believe will create outperformance for us. And then maybe just to add kind of \u2013 yes, the higher level regulatory dynamics are influencing our portfolio allocation decisions. It's been a part of the reason why over the last number of years, we've been moving more and more to a suburban-oriented portfolio. And if you see where we're allocating capital, we're two-thirds suburban today, probably headed towards three quarters there. It's influenced our move to the expansion regions, right, at a minimum to diversify away from regulatory environments. And then the reality is, at a more local level based on some of the steps of certain municipalities. And effectively, the bar is higher for allocating new capital there and it's playing into how we're shifting capital around our portfolio and within our regions. Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your support and look forward to speaking with you soon."

[Operator Instructions] Your host for today's call is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference call.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Melissa, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities' third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release, as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, the press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website, at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ben Schall, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks. Ben?\nBenjamin Schall: Thank you, Jason, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm here with Kevin O'Shea, our Chief Financial Officer; Matt Birenbaum, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sean Breslin, our Chief Operating Officer. Sean and I have some prepared remarks, and then we'll open the line for questions. Per our practice, we posted a presentation in conjunction with our earnings release, which we will reference on today's call. I'd like to start today's call with an update on the four strategic priorities we highlighted during our Investor Day last November. As summarized on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation, our organization has been laser-focused on executing our plans in each one of these areas, confident that they will continue to deliver superior growth for shareholders. First, as highlighted on Slide 5, we continue to make meaningful progress in transforming our operating model and driving both operating efficiencies and incremental revenue. Last November, we raised our target to $80 million of annual incremental NOI to come as a result of these operating initiatives. We are tracking on plan, including further deployments of AvalonConnect and our neighborhood operating model, as well as advancements in our utilization of AI. By yearend, we expect to add another $10 million, bringing our total achievement to $37 million towards our $80 million target, highlighting both our strong progress to-date and the significant runway of future earnings we expect to deliver over the coming years. Second, we continue to optimize our portfolio's future growth through proactive portfolio management and our strategy to increase our allocation to the suburbs and our expansion regions as summarized on Slide 6. Our portfolio is now 73% suburban, up from 70% last year and well-positioned in the near-term to benefit from steady demand and low levels of new supply, and in the long-term from shifting demographics, including aging millennials. We also continue to make steady progress toward our expansion region target of 25%, having now reached a 10% allocation. This year, we sold almost $600 million of assets, all from our established regions, half urban and half suburban, and reallocated that capital predominantly to suburban assets in our expansion regions at a very attractive basis as we look to further optimize and diversify our portfolio for the future. The third area that we detailed at our Investor Day was our unique development growth engine and our ability to consistently drive accretive external growth. As highlighted on Slide 7, our 2024 completions have meaningfully outperformed our original underwriting, achieving a 6.5% yield or 50 basis points above pro forma, generating additional earnings growth and value creation. We've increased our planned development starts for this year to nearly $1.1 billion with a projected untrended initial stabilized yield of 6.3% on these projects, which we consider to be well within our strike zone of generating 100 to 150 basis points of spread to both underlying cap rates and our cost of capital. Looking forward, we believe there could be an attractive window to further leverage our development capabilities and our cost of capital advantage to capture an outsized share of what's likely to be a lower overall level of new starts in the industry. Which brings me to our fourth strategic priority, ensuring continuous access to cost effective capital to fuel future growth. As highlighted on Slide 8, our balance sheet is as strong as it's ever been, among the strongest in the REIT industry, and supported further by our recent forward equity activity, sourcing $850 million at an implied initial cost of approximately 5% to fund future accretive development. We committed to providing this type of follow-up to you at our Investor Day last year, and we're pleased to report out on the strong progress that we've made in each of these four strategic priorities over the last 12 months. We're confident these strategies will position AvalonBay for continued superior growth in the quarters and years ahead. And as I transition to our Q3 results, I want to thank our 3,000 AvalonBay associates for their effort, collaboration, and commitment to these strategic priorities and for delivering another strong quarter of results. Slide 9 summarizes Q3 and year-to-date results and activities with the headline being that we exceeded core FFO guidance for the quarter by $0.03 per share. We also started $450 million of new developments this quarter as part of our planned $1.1 billion of starts this year, a vintage of projects that should face less competition when they open for leasing in a couple of years. Based on our continued operating momentum, we increased our full year core FFO guidance for 2024 for the third time this year to $11.04 per share, implying a peer-leading 3.9% core FFO growth rate as highlighted on Slide 10. For our same-store portfolio, we continue to expect same-store revenue growth of 3.5% and we lowered the midpoint of our same-store operating expense estimate by 30 basis points to 4.5%, which resulted in an increase in our same-store NOI guidance to 3% for the full year 2024. Sean will now speak to our performance in more detail, our momentum in Q4 and our building blocks as we head into 2025. Sean?\nSean Breslin: All right. Thanks, Ben. Moving to Slide 11 to address recent portfolio trends. Third quarter performance was strong and our same-store portfolio is well-positioned heading into the slower leasing season. Turnover continues to trend well below historical norms, which is typically around 55% on a full year basis, driven in part by a substantially lower volume of move-outs to purchase a home in our established regions, which remains at record lows. Additionally, economic occupancy has increased from the mid-summer low point and we expect it to remain relatively stable during Q4. Turning to Slide 12, during our mid-year earnings call, I mentioned the possibility of a reacceleration in asking rent and rent change given softer comps from Q4 2023. We're now starting to see that trend come to fruition. In the chart on the left, asking rent growth during the year has followed traditional seasonal curves and outperformed our experience throughout 2023. Recently, the level of outperformance has widened, and as of November 1, the average asking rent for our same-store portfolio was approximately 3% greater than the same date last year with the East Coast roughly 4% higher and the West Coast about 2%. The higher average asking rent will flow through to improved rent change, particularly for new move-ins as we look forward. Currently, we're forecasting rent change in November to be stronger than October and increase further as we move through December. Moving to Slide 13 and the outlook for 2025 revenue growth, we expect healthy job and wage growth, a financially well-positioned renter and relatively unaffordable for-sale housing alternatives will all support steady demand for our apartment homes in the year ahead. In Chart 1 on Slide 13, renters in our established coastal regions have experienced strong wage growth over the last several years, so rent-to-income ratios have actually declined and are currently about 10% below where they were at the beginning of 2020. This is important in understanding the potential capacity of renters to pay higher rents, all else being equal. Moving to Chart 2, renting an apartment in our established regions continues to be much more affordable than owning a home with the spread being the widest we've ever seen. This lack of affordable for-sale alternatives should continue to support a lower level of resident turnover and a greater propensity for new households to rent versus own. Moving to Slide 14 and the outlook for supply, our established coastal regions are expected to see new deliveries of 1.4% of existing stock in 2025, roughly 100 basis points lower than what's forecast for the Sunbelt, which is already facing a challenging operating environment given the record level of deliveries over the past year. Our same-store portfolio will further benefit from being roughly 70% suburban, where deliveries are expected to be roughly 1% of stock in 2025. Overall, we believe our portfolio is well insulated from the impact of excessive new supply in 2025. Turning to Slide 15, I'll address the building blocks for revenue growth in 2025. First, we're projecting embedded revenue growth or the earn-in to be roughly 1.1% or approximately 10 basis points greater than where we started 2024. Second, we've estimated that underlying bad debt from residents will improve by roughly 60 basis points from 2023 to 2024, and it has improved on a year-over-year basis in each quarter so far this year. While we haven't yet completed our forecast for 2025, we expect continued improvement in underlying bad debt throughout the upcoming year. And third, we expect to again produce strong other rental revenue growth during the coming year. While we don't expect the growth rate to be quite as strong as the roughly 15% increase we're forecasting for 2024, it should still contribute meaningfully to overall revenue growth for 2025. Moving to the outlook for operating expense growth on Slide 16, we expect overall operating expense pressures to moderate as we move into 2025. In terms of some of the key drivers, the impact from the expiration of tax abatement programs, notably the 421-a program in New York City, will still be present but ease in 2025. Additionally, given our AvalonConnect offering will be substantially deployed across the portfolio, the impact on our utilities expense in 2025 will be materially less than what we experienced in 2024. Most other categories are expected to grow modestly as we look to 2025. Now I'll turn it back to Ben for some more summary comments before we open it up to Q&A. Ben?\nBenjamin Schall: Thanks, Sean. To quickly summarize, Q3 results exceeded our expectations and supported a further increase to our full year earnings guidance. Our outlook heading into 2025 looks healthy, particularly given the fundamentals in our established regions. We're leaning further into development, a powerful driver of differentiated earnings growth and value-creation, and we will continue to execute as an organization on a set of strategic priorities that we are confident will continue to deliver superior growth for shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it to the operator to facilitate questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Wolfe: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned that deliveries as a percentage of stock should be around 1.4% next year, which I think is down a little bit from this year. Just based on what you're seeing on the ground, your pro formas, like where do you think that percentage could go over the next couple of years? I'm just trying to understand how supply risk might change, especially as you're increasing your Sunbelt concentration.\nSean Breslin: Yes, Eric, this is Sean. I can comment then Matt or others can certainly speak to it as well. But as it relates to our established coastal regions, first for 2025, we're expecting a reduction in delivery across those regions with the one exception being New York City, which actually is forecast to have a slight uptick. It's not material, but a slight uptick in deliveries in 2025. As it relates to where they settle beyond that, what I'd say is -- and Matt can speak this further is the development climate certainly has been challenging for a number of reasons, given what we've seen in-construction costs, what's been happening with capital costs and the impact, particularly on merchant builders across our regions. So given the fact that starts have come down and the fact that the gestation period for construction in our coastal markets is fairly lengthy given the product type, it wouldn't be a surprise to see deliveries for our -- again, coastal established regions to continue to trend down over the next couple of years, given what we've seen in terms of starts activity and the underwriting associated with new projects in those same regions. So hopefully that answers your question.\nEric Wolfe: That's helpful. And then for the four Sunbelt apartment projects you started this quarter, could you just talk about the underwritten yields on those and how you're looking at the value creation or margin on those projects? And I guess for Austin specifically, it's certainly been a market that I think people expect supply to weigh on it for a little while. So just curious if there's something specific about that project that lets you get to a higher yield than maybe the overall market would achieve.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Hi, sure. Hi, Eric, this is Matt. I can speak to that one. So we did start four deals this quarter, all of which were in expansion regions, two in North Carolina, two in Texas, and those deals are underwriting on today's rents to around a 6%, which would be on the tighter end of our range of development yields. I think our development starts for the year across the whole book is more like low to mid 6%, 6.3%. So it'd be at the lower end of that range, but still well in excess of our cost-of-capital and well in excess of where we think cap rates our assets would be trading. Every deal is different. So there are unique characteristics. The deal that we started in Austin, that's a parcel of land that we've owned for a couple of years and it's the first phase of what could be eventually a 1,300 or 1,400 unit garden deal. So it's -- there are some unusual costs loaded into the first phase because we're front-loading a lot of the infrastructure and amenities of what's really going to be kind of a signature community for us in that market. And that's our first start -- our first investment in Austin. We've identified Austin as one of our expansion regions really for four or five years, but have been pretty cautious about it up until now. But we're pretty bullish about the timing of that start in particular, because we think it's a nice match between hitting the low point on hard costs, which have come down. On that deal, hard costs are down double-digits compared to where they would have been 18 months ago when we could have started the deal when it was first ready to start. And when you think about that asset won't be in lease-up until '26 and we feel by that point, we should be facing very little new competition and with a basis that we like quite a bit.\nBenjamin Schall: Eric, I'll add a couple of additional comments to your question on sort of relative positioning. As we think about leaning into external growth and development today, one is the cost of capital advantage, right? We've got a cost of capital advantage relative to our private sector competitors. And the second is, we are increasingly able to drive incremental yield from our new investments, both on acquisitions and development. And a lot of that goes from taking our operating model transformation in those initiatives and bringing those to new investments. And so obviously, project specific and submarket specific, but in a lot of these projects, we're able to generate 30 to 40 -- 30 to 40 basis points of incremental yield by tapping into that strategic set of capabilities.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJamie Feldman: Thank you. I guess, sticking with development, can you talk about your thoughts, your early thoughts on what's in the pipeline that you could possibly start in '25? And I guess just kind of continuing with a similar discussion with the starts you've done all-in the Sunbelt, I mean, clearly, Sunbelt is recovering from a supply glut, but who's to say it can't happen again? The Austin project certainly sounds unique, but can you just talk through how you think you can navigate development in the Sunbelt better differently than people who are facing a lot of supply here as we just think about the longer term based on the projects you're starting?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes, I guess I can speak to that one, this is Matt. When we look at our '25 starts book and we do think that we have an opportunity to increase our start volume further in '25, could be a range and we're not providing guidance at this moment, but we could certainly see increasing our start activity next year to something on either side of a range of about $1.5 billion -- from $1.050 billion this year. So we are ramping it up partially in response to what Ben was talking about where we think we can get a greater share of a lesser number of starts given our balance sheet and our capital position and the capabilities we bring to it. And it's really a mix, so I think this year our start activity will be about 40% to 45% in the expansion regions, probably be similar to that, maybe a little less as a percentage next year. So we do have a couple of starts on the West Coast where development economics have been under pressure for quite a few years. We're starting to see green shoots there, both on the operating side and on the hard cost side, some pretty significant savings. So we have a large deal we could start next year in San Diego. We might wind up starting a deal in the East Bay. We have a garden deal in Denver that would be an expansion region. We have more kind of higher yield business to start in New Jersey, a deal here in the Mid-Atlantic, opportunities in Boston, a deal in Palm Beach County in Florida. So it's a mix. I would say the product tends to be lower density garden, kind of simpler construction. That's where it tends to be working better right now. And if more likely, it will be in more in the expansion regions or some of our -- I'm sorry, in the established regions some of our expansion regions, Denver and Florida, in particular, Southeast Florida, assets are trading more generally above replacement costs there. There's probably a little more pressure in North Carolina and Texas, and that's where it really does depend on the product and the submarket and specific -- the specific dynamics of the site you're looking at.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. That's very helpful. Impressive $1.5 billion number. I guess just switching gears to expenses. We appreciate the detailed line-by-line view for next year. I guess two ways to ask the question. One is just focusing on insurance specifically, I mean, clearly a lot is happening in Florida, happened in Florida. What gives you confidence that insurance can go lower in '25? And then also just if you were to boil down this third column on the right, do you think your expense growth rate is higher or lower in '25 than '24, if you're even able to answer that question?\nKevin O'Shea: So Jamie, this is Kevin. I'll start on insurance and Sean will probably follow on the broader look on OpEx for next year. So in terms of insurance, this year's expected insurance expense increase of about 10%, just to kind of give you some context, it's being driven primarily by increases in property insurance premiums and losses where the premium increases from property relate to our May 2023 renewal that continued to affect us earlier this year. But we had a roughly flat property renewal in May of this year, very successful in that regard, partly due to the kind of the abatement of decline in insurance premium pressures in that property insurance market relative to prior years. And that flat property renewal this past May provided some relief from the impact of higher premiums in this year's numbers and into next year. As we move into 2025, we just see based on what's going on in the various insurance markets that we have, a continued movement towards stabilization in program costs, as we look to renew property and other types of insurance next year such that we expect to generally renew those at more typical growth rates. Our property renewal is in May, and as you know, we have very little exposure to the high risk areas, where there have been problems such as in Florida, where we have limited exposure to Southeast Florida where there's concrete construction and generally have more of a coastal footprint. So we've been insulated from a lot of those pressures as well. The only exception we see with respect to insurance is liability insurance, which is seeing some above average premium increases, but fortunately, liability insurance comprises less than a quarter of our overall total insurance spend. So as a result, when you put it together and look at insurance costs for next year, while it's still early, we currently expect our overall insurance costs to be more in the mid to high single-digit range for next year, which is closer to more normal levels for us.\nSean Breslin: Jamie, as it relates to the broader question about the direction of OpEx growth in 2025 relative to 2024's growth rate, yes, the purpose of the slide was to give you some general sense that we do expect the growth rate to ease in 2025 relative to 2024. And the main callouts as it relates to that are items that are relatively well-known. For example, the 421-a and other pilot programs. That's about an 80 basis point impact on the 2024 overall growth rate that will diminish somewhat as we get into 2025. In terms of our operating initiatives, AvalonConnect will be pretty much 90% deployed by yearend '24. There will still be some roll-through of leases in '25, but the gross impact of that in 2024 on total OpEx growth was 120 basis points. That's the forecast. So that will come down. Just those two items alone will lead to some easing there. We don't see pressure points in the various other categories that would overcome the impact of those two items as an example. So we do expect growth rate to come down in '25 relative to '24.\nJamie Feldman: Okay, great. Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Kramer: Hi guys, thanks for the time. I just wanted to look at the kind of projection for improvement in lease growth in November and December. I guess just maybe kind of whether it's just easy comps or kind of what are the other maybe indications or things you're seeing in the portfolio today that kind of give you the confidence that, okay, things could reaccelerate here in the last two months of the year relative to October?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Adam, this is Sean. I can take that one. So first, in terms of high-level strategy for us, as I mentioned on the mid-year call, we had a nice run-up in occupancy at the beginning of the year kind of throughout the first quarter. And so we started pushing harder as it related to rate growth and we were able to do that through Q2 and most of Q3, which is the time when you want to do that given the heavy lease expiration volume, roughly 60% of our leases expire during those two quarters. So that's when you want to get it. But in terms of overall strategy then as you get into September and October, you do want to sort of stabilize occupancy as you head into slower leasing season. So as we move through September into October, you saw that in terms of the deceleration, particularly on the new move-in side. So that was part of the broader strategy. As it relates to where we are today, occupancy is relatively stable, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, given the softer comp in terms of where asking rents were in Q4 of 2023 relative to where they are as of now, asking rents are about 3% higher than where they were last year. So where we are signing leases currently is presenting a nice spread on the move-in side. So as we look forward, you know, October blended rent change was 1.2%. We see it ticking up into the high 1% range for November and then the mid-2%s in December, our expectation is that all of that is really on the backs of new move-ins, which were down about 180 basis points in October, but we expect that to flip to be modestly positive in November and a little over 100 basis points in December. Renewal offers were already out. We negotiate with residents, so for the most part, what you're going to see is the improvement coming on new move-ins as we move through November and December, given where asking rents are today.\nAdam Kramer: That's really helpful. Thanks for all that color. And maybe along similar lines, kind of a forward-looking question here just on the bad debt improvement. So it looks like 170 basis points is kind of the forecast for this year. I know it's still early. I know it's a tough line-item to maybe make a call or predict, but just maybe a sense of the whether it's the level of bad debt that you can get to next year or maybe the other way of asking it is just how long could it take? Will it take potentially to get back to the pre-COVID kind of bogey level of bad debt as you think about next year and going forwards?\nSean Breslin: Yes, good question. And everyone has probably a different crystal ball on that one of which probably none of ours are 100% accurate just given the nature of the issue, which is really highly dependent upon various things outside of our control in the various regions. So obviously, we've seen a nice improvement as it relates to the performance this year coming down roughly 60 basis points year-over-year. From 2022 to 2023 had come down 140 basis points, so a more significant improvement. My expectation is that by the time we get through 2025, we're probably not back to a fully stabilized or normalized level, but we're making good progress towards it. And what we use to sort of estimate that is the volume of skips and [evicts] that we see-through the portfolio. So for example, we saw 300 plus evictions in the third quarter. We have about 1,300 accounts that are still sort of sitting out there that are needed to be processed through either a skip or evict situation. So it's certainly -- at that run-rate, it's certainly at least a year. My guess is more likely a little bit more than that. So it's probably as you get into 2026 that we would start to see some normalization as opposed to expecting that to occur in 2025.\nAdam Kramer: Thanks so much for all the detail.\nSean Breslin: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I think, Sean, you mentioned that renewals were out for November, December, but I don't think you quoted a figure on those. Could you share that? And I guess just how much negotiation is going on kind of on those renewals today versus maybe what's happened over the last six to nine months?\nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean, what I can tell you is our expectation for November and December, I talked about the move-ins. On the renewals, we're expecting renewal achievement to be in the high 3% range for both November and December based on what we already know today that's signed as well as the expectation for negotiation spreads. So where those renewals went out, it's going to be irrelevant at this point. It's more kind of where they're trending and that's our expectation for November and December is high 3%.\nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And then, Kevin, I know you have the forward equity that's kind of sitting out there. Are we just assuming given Matt's comments about the accelerating development pipeline that the forward equities basically used to partially fund development opportunities versus acquisitions?\nKevin O'Shea: Yes, that's correct, Steve. That was what our intention was when we executed the forward equity deal back in early September. It was intended to support an elevated level of development starts next year. So we don't anticipate issuing the shares under the forward this year, but expect to do so next year as we kind of ramp development starts.\nSteve Sakwa: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just going back to new starts in the expansion markets and the fact that you underwrite on current yields. I mean, should we read into this that you think rents have bottomed in those expansion regions at least within the submarkets you're developing or that -- I guess any additional pullback would be short-lived.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes, Austin, it's Matt. I think, the reason why we underwrite on an untrended basis is we feel that that's pretty conservative that on average over time, rents grow. So we're not counting on that trending of the rents to make the deal work. We wouldn't start a deal that only works because of trended rents as opposed to current rents. So we're comfortable with our yield and our basis on those deals we're starting now in today's environment. And then it's really everybody can have their own view on what happens going forward. I would say any deal we're starting now, we're probably not leasing it for two years or maybe a year and a half. So I do think that in almost every case, we would think markets by that time should have positive momentum to them. What happens between now and then it's going to vary from market-to-market. And honestly, that's probably more relevant for our acquisitions in our development because there we are stepping into a rent roll and whether that existing rent roll has lost lease or gained lease in it, will affect our kind of short-term kind of year one yield and that in turn weighs on the IRR of the investment. So it's probably subject to a little more scrutiny on acquisitions than on development just based on the greater value creation margin there.\nBenjamin Schall: Also, I'll emphasize a couple of other components in terms of our lean-in which expands on -- we're talking about earlier on the call. As you know, as we think about development yields, both established regions and expansion regions, we're focused on 100 to 150 basis points of spread to both underlying cap rates and market rates and our cost of capital. So Kevin spoke to our cost of capital on next year's set of starts, right? We've locked that in at a five. We have over the last six months, not a huge amount of transaction activity, but we have gotten more visibility on transaction activity, which has given us more confidence around where underlying values are. And then the third piece is, we have seen construction costs come down, not everywhere, but in a lot of our regions, so when we think about our long-term basis or stepping in at this point in a time, that also has us leaning into net new external growth.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Yes, both of your responses, appreciate the color there and they kind of lead into the next question on the transaction market. And just curious, are you seeing more investment opportunities within expansion markets start to come forth, and with the equity proceeds now to help fund the development capital commitments next year, does that enable you to accelerate the paired strategy, the paired trade strategy given I think there are some limitations on capital gains from annual dispositions. Thanks.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes, it's a good point, Austin. And I would say yes. To the latter question, yes, to the former question, not so much. So the transaction market, it's still pretty thin, there's still not much activity and we're not seeing distress. In fact, a bunch of us were just at the ULI conference last week and everybody was talking about that and the lack of kind of distressed opportunities. And if you had asked me 30 days ago, I would have said the transaction market seems like it's about to finally break 3% and get back to a robust level of volume. That was when the tenure was kind of in the mid-3s, 3.6%, 3.7% range and there was a lot of optimism and confidence. It's a volatile time, and obviously, with the loan rate moving up quite a bit, I think that we've seen a pullback on transaction activity just in the last 30 days. So we are -- we continue to be in this environment where our select assets that meet the criteria that select buyers are looking for will trade. And as Ben mentioned, we've gotten more confidence in where those asset values are and a lot of folks are looking for the same kind of stuff to buy, including us. But we haven't seen kind of the large-scale transaction activity that we would like to see because we would like to do more portfolio trading. So it looks like this year, so far, we've sold $590 million and we bought $325 million. We're not done yet. We will probably have at least one more disposition and hopefully another acquisition or two before year-end, but we're going to end up the year net seller of, call it, $150 million to $200 million. Our goal would be to be net neutral and to be able to buy at the same volume as we're selling. And as you point out, we don't need the net disposition capital to fund the growth through development. So -- and we're happy with the trades that we're making. We feel like we're selling assets that are significantly older, that are a much higher price point that we had -- there were good investments in our established regions for many years, but which don't necessarily have the same growth profile as what we're buying and also kind of our regulatory exposure is part of that strategy as well. So all of those things continue and we certainly hope to be able to do more of that transaction trading in '25.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Dennerlein: Yes, hi guys. Thanks for the time. Just looking at the lease rate growth across the markets, just two kind of stood out to me, it was Pacific Northwest and Northern California. Any kind of color you could give on maybe the decel going into October versus what you saw in 3Q?\nSean Breslin: Josh, this is Sean. I mean, what I say with sort of a broad-brush is, yes, new moving rent change pretty much came down in every single region. And as I mentioned, that was sort of the strategy to sort of help stabilize occupancy as we went into the slower leasing season. And the one thing I would just point to is that Seattle tends to be more seasonal than average. And therefore, as you are attempting to build occupancy, any market that is more seasonal than average, you're going to take it a little bit harder on the new move-ins relative to maybe some other markets that aren't quite as seasonal. That's really sort of the primary issue for Seattle. In Northern California, really nothing significant to note there. It's kind of a submarket-by-submarket decision based on availability and pricing and the occupancy targets. So I wouldn't read too much into it other than in those particular submarkets, we gave a little bit more to shore up on the new move-in side.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. I appreciate that Sean.\nSean Breslin: There's not a lot, there's not a lot of volume, keep that in mind.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay, okay. Maybe on Seattle in particular, like I think our competitor said they were hearing, it felt like they were seeing more traffic after Amazon's return to office announcement. Are you guys seeing that or anticipating any kind of benefit?\nBenjamin Schall: Yes. No, we've seen that really kind of starting back in Q2, and Seattle is one of the regions that has performed much better than we originally anticipated through 2024, in part due to Amazon's callback and people sort of slowly and steadily getting closer to, or in the Seattle MSA. There are other employers doing the same thing. So I think overall return to office and the trend to return to office, whether it's Amazon and the impact in Seattle or announcements from Salesforce about calling people back in January to San Francisco, all those things are a positive trend for those markets. I would say on the Salesforce side in San Francisco, we started to see early signs of it, but there's probably still more to come, whereas Amazon made that announcement quite some time ago, and we've seen movement throughout Seattle as a result of that for a good portion this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Heffern: Yes. Thank you. Yes, maybe I didn't catch this, but if -- but could you guys give a lost lease number?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Brad, this is Sean. We actually haven't, but overall lost lease as of November 1 is about 100 basis points across the portfolio, slightly higher in the East than the West and we're actually in a modest gain to lease situation in the expansion regions.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thanks for that. And then you mentioned in the slides that the DFP program now covers build-to-rent. That's new to me at least. I guess, can you walk-through that addition, especially given it isn't a property type that you develop?\nBenjamin Schall: Yes. So on the build-to-rent, the BTR space, we have made a decision to more formally advance our plans there. And we consider it an expansion of our existing business. We've been building townhomes, purpose-built townhomes really since the beginning of AvalonBay. We do it today. A lot of times we're building townhomes in conjunction with apartment flats and sometimes we're building full townhome types of communities. And so it feels like an opportunity for us to take what we do well on the operating side and on the development side and bring it into this, I'll call it, expanded set of opportunities. As we -- we are organizing specific resources around the opportunity set. In the nearer term, you're likely to see more of our focus, one, be on townhome communities within the larger scope of BTR and second, in terms of the growth channels, to be via acquisitions. And so we had an acquisition in Austin, which was a full townhome community and through our developer funding program, which is the Plano project that you referenced. So we're excited about the opportunity set and I think we can really bring our strategic advantages to bear there and provide more growth opportunities going forward.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kim: Good morning. On your building blocks for same-store NOI growth next year, I think the one item that you haven't addressed yet on this call is property taxes. Do you expect that to go down next year and this is following a year where asset values have gone up and you've increased your Sunbelt exposure where the rates are higher. Can you just comment on just why you see taxes going down next year and maybe the quantum?\nSean Breslin: Yes, John, it's Sean. The main driver and we haven't settled all of our property tax budgets yet, but the main driver that will impact the growth rate for property taxes in 2025, particularly relative to 2024 is a modestly diminished impact from the expiration of various tax abatement programs, notably the 421-a program in New York City, which boosted overall expense growth by roughly 80 basis points this year, and we expect that to come down next year. So that will move the needle, all else being equal based on what we know today in terms of changes in assessed values or rates across the other markets when you have something that significant.\nJohn Kim: Okay. That makes sense. And then on development yields, I know you typically outperform your initial projections once you stabilize the projects. But the yields on your current pipeline are now 5.9%, which is slightly lower than it was last quarter. Were there any projects that underperformed as far as rent levels or budgeted costs versus your expectations?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. Hi, John, it's Matt. No, I mean really that's just a mix change that we had two deals complete last quarter whose yields were in the high 7s, which came out of the basket. They're no longer in the development bucket, they're now in other stabilized. And so -- and we added four deals that were around a 6%. So that's really -- the change there is really just a basket mix. The deals that we have that are currently in lease-up, which we don't have that many of, I think it's only 5%, they are running still ahead of pro forma, not as much ahead of pro forma as some of the deals we completed earlier this year. As we're now moving into -- we're now getting maybe a couple of years away from kind of '22 when we had pretty aggressive rent growth. But they're still running $175 per month ahead on rent and 20 basis points ahead on yield. So -- and that 5.9% -- what you'll see over the next couple of quarters is that number will start to move up into the 6%s, into the low 6%s and then probably by this time next year into the mid-6%s as more of the deals that we started this year and in '23, which were underwritten into the 6%s start and more of the deals that started in '21 and '22 when cap rates were 3.5% and yields were 5% as those deals complete and roll-out of that basket, you'll see it rise.\nJohn Kim: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [Anne Chan] with Green Street. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Going back to your comments on the build-to-rent communities, are you anticipating acquiring any detached single-family home build-to-rent communities as well or stick to the more townhome like product? And if so, can you give us a sense of the size of the pipeline you're evaluating?\nBenjamin Schall: So on your first question, Anne, detached BTR product is in the -- in the possibility set. It's not where we're necessarily starting. We're going to, as I said, emphasize the townhome product a little bit closer to our regular way activity. But purpose-built communities generally in the unit range of 80 to 130 units per community, places where we feel like we can bring our -- if we're going to buy an asset, particularly, bring our operating heft and operating scale to these communities, which is when we think about the space, one of the opportunities is there aren't many institutional large scale operators in this space. And so in places where we can have both apartments and BTR, we feel like there are synergies that can come in and around that mix. We haven't defined the pipeline at this point. We haven't set a specific target in terms of the percentage of the overall portfolio, but we have dedicated resources and it will be an area of incremental emphasis over the next 12 to 18 months.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. And just moving over to construction costs that you were talking about earlier. They have been shifting down. Could you also provide a sense for how land values have trended over the last few months and the construction, the labor costs in particular?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes, Anne, it's Matt. Land values are usually the stickiest part of the equation in development, and it is completely local. So it's hard to generalize on that. We have seen and we highlighted actually last year at our Investor Day how one of the deals we have under construction now in Quincy Mass, we were able to buy that land at 40% less than where it would have traded at the peak of the frenzy. So there are situations where we've seen that kind of move. I'd say in California, not a lot of land is trading because it's very difficult to get development to underwrite there. But to the extent it does, that's where we've seen some significant land retrenchment. And it's generally places -- those kind of markets where land represents a very high percentage of the deal cap. In some of the Sunbelt regions in North Carolina, even in Texas, the land is not that high a percentage of the deal cap. So whether you're paying 30 or 35 or 40 a door for the land, that's not really what's going to make the difference. So there is some give back there, but probably not as much. So it varies market-to-market, but it's not been -- with a few exceptions, I would say it hasn't been kind of a major move across the board.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amy Provost with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nAmy Provost: Hi, thanks. What is the outlook for when the expansion markets could reach an equilibrium in terms of supply and demand and see a return to some pricing power?\nBenjamin Schall: Our expectations for 2025 is particularly the high supply submarkets in the Sunbelt regions are going to continue to face fairly meaningful pressure. And then the impact on rent rolls and cash flows for those properties in those types of submarkets would then roll over into 2026. Start volumes, as we all seen are definitely coming down. I would emphasize they're coming down in both the Sunbelt and in our established regions. So as you get out into 2026, kind of all else being equal, we do expect lower levels of supply, and I'd say sort of equal levels of demand as we think about demand drivers in our established regions relative demand drivers in our expansion regions.\nAmy Provost: Okay. And then a quick one. What assumptions are baked into the earning calculation? Does this include your prospective rents through the end of the year?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Amy, it does based on the numbers I described previously. So yes, it does.\nAmy Provost: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Please proceed with your question.\nRich Anderson: Hi, thanks, and good morning. So clearly, you're sounding a little bit more upbeat on 2026 in terms of timing new deliveries. But what's the range of economic assumptions that you're using to get there, particularly for next year? I'm -- you obviously got some idea about where the broader economy is going, employment and so on to get you comfortable with the year following. So I'm just wondering if you could give a picture of what the broader underlying assumptions are for the next year to get you sort of confident in 2026 deliveries. Thanks.\nBenjamin Schall: Yes, sure, Rich. I'll provide some color and context and really focus on our sort of economic outlook for 2025 at this point. Consensus and we look to the National Association of Business Economics as a guide in, and around consensus generally has job growth slowing in 2022 relative to 2024 going from sort of two million net new jobs down into the 1.5 million type of range. A couple of call outs, one is potentially the mix of jobs next year could look different than this year and be higher income jobs and jobs in what we would consider our knowledge-based economy, our core type of customer. So that's leaning in a little bit. Wage prospects also for our core customer have continued to look strong. Those also look strong as we're heading into next year. And then generally, this kind of -- sort of the job outlook to the supply outlook, you sort of do a compare and contrast of '24 relative to '25, maybe jobs are slowing a little bit, supplies are coming down a little bit. But across the country in a lot of markets seems fairly consistent from a jobs and supply ratio. And so as we think about what are the types of markets that are going to outperform next year, they're going to continue to be the ones that have lower levels of new supply and the ones that are going to continue to be under pressure going to be those with higher levels of new supply coming online.\nRich Anderson: Okay. So with that color, what's the bull case for owning multifamily next year? It sounds like you got some decent economic observations and you're feeling generally okay, but equity residential describe things as good. And that's, I guess, good. But I just wonder if you -- is it sort of just a stable sort of not sideways moving year next year to the -- to the bigger prize in '26 and '27 or do you think it's more optimistic than that for next year?\nBenjamin Schall: Yes. So for us, Rich, I'll highlight a couple of areas. One, we expect our suburban coastal business to continue to outperform. I think you look at the building blocks and the drivers that we've talked about going into next year and that Sean detailed, we feel relatively positive there. The other component is the lean-in and around external growth. And we've talked about development activity and the -- and the buildup and the prospects there. And then potentially the transaction markets and I think with some -- hopefully some enhanced visibility and stability around rates and cap rates, that leads to some more transaction activity, which when I think about the prospects for next year and going into '26, players with our scale, our cost-of-capital, our ability to generate more value by having assets on our platform, that should also allow us to lean further into external growth.\nRich Anderson: Great. Awesome color, Ben. Thanks very much. Got it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Hi, good morning. Two questions for you. And maybe first, just following up on Rich's question. It's been five years since we've had a normal leasing market in apartment land. As you guys look to 2025, do you think it will be back to a normal leasing market or do you think there will still be some anomalies in what we see as we go through 2025?\nSean Breslin: Hi, Alex, it's Sean. When you said normal, just kind of normal seasonal patterns of pricing is what you mean specifically, I assume?\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes. I mean we had -- yes, 2020 was COVID and it's been topsy-turvy since then.\nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean, I think for the most part, if you think about what -- how the pricing curves are generated kind of follows the patterns of demand. And our expectation is the traditional seasonal patterns for demand aren't likely to shift anytime soon in terms of the reasons people move, when they want to move, what they're desiring in terms of apartments and things of that sort. The two things that are a little unusual that I think maybe still haven't fully played out, but are sort of in the background beyond what Ben talked about in terms of job and wage growth is in particularly in our coastal markets is the return to office trends. It certainly has gotten better. I'm not sure we felt the full impact of that yet across all of our coastal regions as people are sort of inching their way back to what they think is normal state. And we mentioned earlier, Amazon's announcement, Salesforce bringing people back to San Francisco in January that's certainly a positive that helps sort of build confidence in the city, other issues in LA and D.C., and places like that. So I think that's one factor. And then certainly, the lack of affordable for-sale housing in our established regions where the cost to own a home is relative to renting is the widest we've ever seen. Those two, it's hard to tell how those fully play out, but they are still playing out, I would say. You can see it on return to office trends. And on the for sale side, it's really showing up in lower turnover, which we think is going to be durable for a while, but the impact of new households being formed and their options, renting still looks like relative to historical norms as more attractive options -- option. So how those play into the seasonal patterns may not look different, but it may just provide further support for growth in those established regions relative to what we've seen historically.\nAlexander Goldfarb: The second question is on site selection, clearly, especially here in the Northeast, lower Westchester, New Jersey have had a lot of floods. As you guys look throughout your existing markets and expansion markets, have you seen a change in the land that you're looking at as far as land that years ago was not considered flood area is now considered and therefore, your site selection has changed? I'm curious if in fact, your site selection has changed based on how you know some of these rivers and such are overflowing with storms.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Hi, Alex, it's Matt. For us, I'd say for at least the last six or seven years, we actually do have a pretty formal process for that where every site gets run through a third-party coastal risk model. It's actually a resiliency risk model, which tries to capture wind, flooding, pluvial flooding, fluvial flooding excessive heat, wildfire risk, all those different things. So I'd say we were early adopters of that. And so there are probably sites we've passed on that maybe today would be harder for somebody to get financed than would have been the case five years ago. And we did switch vendors to a more robust reporting format on that, but we've always been pretty mindful of that.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two quick ones here. First, I guess is, can you talk a bit about the year-to-date performance of your East versus West Coast markets versus your initial expectations and some thoughts on the relative opportunity ahead in the East Coast markets? Boston, New York, D.C. have been very strong this year, but have tougher year-over-year comparison next year, while some of your West Coast markets, San Francisco and Seattle have easier comps and some RTO upside as you outlined, but less clarity. Thanks.\nSean Breslin: Yes. Haendel, this is Sean. I'll provide a little bit of color there. Yes, certainly what I'd say for this year is we've seen better performance out of Boston, New York City, specifically of the New York, New Jersey region, and the Mid-Atlantic to a certain degree and then also in the West Coast Seattle. In terms of the outlook for those markets, yes, the earn-in, if you want to describe it that way, it certainly is a little more robust in those markets relative to others. So all else being equal, in terms of, as you said, if everything else was equal in terms of rent change across the markets, those ones would outperform in 2025 relative to 2024. But to the extent you see significant momentum due to other factors in the various other markets that haven't performed as well as those in '24 that can certainly overwhelm the earn-in pretty quickly. So I think it's really a reflection of how you want to look at what the job growth expectations are for a particular market, how it blends with supply and then these other trends in terms of for sale housing and return to office and how that they play out. That would really impact the performance in '25 in terms of who is top of the leaderboard versus not?\nHaendel St. Juste: Would you care to quantify some of that earn-in for those East versus West Coast markets or perhaps weight?\nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean, we can look at it. I mean, I give an overall number of 110 basis points. The earn-in on the East is about 130 basis points and the earn-in on the West is about just under a point, it's around 94 basis points, 95 basis points. And it's a forecast. So things can move around a little bit here. And then as I mentioned earlier, as we were talking about lease-to-lease, loss-to-lease, or gain-to-lease as it relates to our expansion regions, it's actually a little bit negative around 20 basis points.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Appreciate that. And then one more if I could, just on the other income. I think it's up 15% or so this year, another 10%, I think you outlined for next year. I guess I'm curious on what's the remaining opportunity there, what's driving those numbers into next year? And then how should we think about the associated costs related to some of the initiatives that you'd be rolling out next year? Thanks.\nSean Breslin: Yes, I got no problem. Yes, so we do expect to -- the growth rate for other rental revenue to decelerate in '25 relative to '24 based on what we know today. There's a number of different categories that are producing sort of above-average growth, but the primary one that's driving it to that level has been our AvalonConnect offering, which will still be present in 2025 because we put the programs in place, it gets fully deployed, will be about 90% deployed by year-end 2024 and then the revenue flows through as the leases expire in 2025, since you can't push it through or people are already on existing leases. And so that's the main driver. And then in terms of OpEx trends, as I mentioned earlier, the impact for 2024 as a result of some of the initiatives is around 120 basis points in terms of the impact on total OpEx growth in 2024 and we do expect that to diminish pretty materially as we get into 2025, again, because the program is more fully deployed, it's not impacting as many units. So that will soften in 2025.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Appreciate the color.\nSean Breslin: Sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLinda Tsai: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just on the view of that like effective rent is reaccelerating into year-end, does this hold into January too? The chart on Page 12 looks like the comparisons stay reasonable in January. Would you expect new lease growth to be positioned to be positive as well?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Linda, we haven't provided a forecast yet for January as we're sort of still working through that. We felt comfortable doing that for November, December just given the volume of lease expirations in those months, what we already know about it and the shift in asking rents more importantly. So we're not providing that for January, but feel-good about what we did provide for November and December.\nLinda Tsai: Yes. And then just on BTR, how would yields differ between townhomes over, say, single detached? And then from the perspective of resident preferences, where do townhomes sit between traditional multifamily and single attached homes?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. Hi, Linda, it's Matt. It's early to tell because it's still a relatively new and quickly expanding sub-sector of our business of rental housing more broadly. But I would say that our experience with the townhomes that we do own and what we've seen from third-party's, the yields aren't really significantly different and for that matter, probably nor are the cap rates. As it relates to who is the customer and is the customer different for single-family versus the townhome, I think it probably starts with location that where you're going to see townhomes is in closer in locations where, you know the land is too valuable to kind of have quarter acre lots or what have you and people developing townhomes at 10, 15, 20 to the acre. And as you get further out, you start to have more land where you're able to do a single-family, true detached single-family. I don't -- I haven't seen a lot. I don't know that there's a huge difference in the customer base other than obviously, there are some customers, particularly empty nesters for whom a three-story townhouse might be a bit much. You know, families with kids also would probably prefer the larger yard. We do get a fair number of townhome BTR that do have their own yard as well as their own garage. That is something that's important. And I believe the community we just started there in Plano has yards as well as garages. So, but you -- so there are probably subtle differences in terms of life stage. So the school district is probably more important for an SF single-family product than a townhome product. But yes, this is all early days and we'll certainly learn a lot more as we get more of this product out there.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Kim with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Kim: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your apartment renter base. Have you seen any demographic shifts recently as millennials continue to age and move-out to buy remains low? How are the younger age cohorts showing up in your portfolio?\nSean Breslin: Yes. So this is Sean. I wouldn't say there's been any meaningful shifts recently. Obviously, as we went through COVID and then initially started coming out of COVID, there was a lot of movement initially in COVID, not as much doubling up, more single-person households. All those things have sort of transitioned through COVID, I'd say have stabilized at more normal levels, the percentage of roommates, et cetera. So I don't think there have been any significant shifts. I think as you look forward, just given the nature of demographics and some of the development Matt was talking about, I think, being more heavily suburban, some of the townhome products certainly fits the aging millennial profile where they want to be a little more infill in our established regions. It's very expensive to buy a home. So if they get a nice quality townhome product with a small yard or a nice deck and be in a good school district, that's highly attractive. So we are making sure our portfolio is well-positioned for the demand that's to come, which may represent slightly larger households when you include kids in some of these markets than what we've seen in the past. But looking at it over a short period of time, you get a lot of false signals in terms of just some noise in there that I wouldn't necessarily say has really resulted in anything significant in terms of shifts in the last few quarters.\nAlexander Kim: Got it. Makes sense. And then switching gears here to bad debt. You mentioned that you anticipate bad debt to continue to improve in 2025, I mean, can you talk about which markets are driving that change specifically or may have more runway for improvement as well? Thanks.\nBenjamin Schall: Yes, happy to do that. I mean the regions with the greatest opportunities, I'll say top four or five New York, New Jersey, particularly the New York City market, still running in the low 2% range. The Mid-Atlantic low 2% range as well, particularly the D.C. and Maryland being the outlier issues relative to Virginia actually doing pretty well, a little bit in Northern California still running high relative to historical norms, but it's about 125 basis points. LA still running a little over 2% with LA and Ventura being the issues there within Southern California, Orange County, San Diego, getting closer to norm at 70 to 90 basis points. Virginia, as I mentioned, around 70 basis points. Boston is back to 60%, so it's really New York, New Jersey, the Mid-Atlantic and then to a certain degree, Northern California and LA are the markets where we need to see more significant improvement as you move through 2025.\nAlexander Kim: Thanks for the color.\nBenjamin Schall: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Schall for any final comments.\nBenjamin Schall: Thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to seeing many of you shortly at Nareit. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matthew Birenbaum",
            "content": "Hi, sure. Hi, Eric, this is Matt. I can speak to that one. So we did start four deals this quarter, all of which were in expansion regions, two in North Carolina, two in Texas, and those deals are underwriting on today's rents to around a 6%, which would be on the tighter end of our range of development yields. I think our development starts for the year across the whole book is more like low to mid 6%, 6.3%. So it'd be at the lower end of that range, but still well in excess of our cost-of-capital and well in excess of where we think cap rates our assets would be trading. Every deal is different. So there are unique characteristics. The deal that we started in Austin, that's a parcel of land that we've owned for a couple of years and it's the first phase of what could be eventually a 1,300 or 1,400 unit garden deal. So it's -- there are some unusual costs loaded into the first phase because we're front-loading a lot of the infrastructure and amenities of what's really going to be kind of a signature community for us in that market. And that's our first start -- our first investment in Austin. We've identified Austin as one of our expansion regions really for four or five years, but have been pretty cautious about it up until now. But we're pretty bullish about the timing of that start in particular, because we think it's a nice match between hitting the low point on hard costs, which have come down. On that deal, hard costs are down double-digits compared to where they would have been 18 months ago when we could have started the deal when it was first ready to start. And when you think about that asset won't be in lease-up until '26 and we feel by that point, we should be facing very little new competition and with a basis that we like quite a bit. Yes, I guess I can speak to that one, this is Matt. When we look at our '25 starts book and we do think that we have an opportunity to increase our start volume further in '25, could be a range and we're not providing guidance at this moment, but we could certainly see increasing our start activity next year to something on either side of a range of about $1.5 billion -- from $1.050 billion this year. So we are ramping it up partially in response to what Ben was talking about where we think we can get a greater share of a lesser number of starts given our balance sheet and our capital position and the capabilities we bring to it. And it's really a mix, so I think this year our start activity will be about 40% to 45% in the expansion regions, probably be similar to that, maybe a little less as a percentage next year. So we do have a couple of starts on the West Coast where development economics have been under pressure for quite a few years. We're starting to see green shoots there, both on the operating side and on the hard cost side, some pretty significant savings. So we have a large deal we could start next year in San Diego. We might wind up starting a deal in the East Bay. We have a garden deal in Denver that would be an expansion region. We have more kind of higher yield business to start in New Jersey, a deal here in the Mid-Atlantic, opportunities in Boston, a deal in Palm Beach County in Florida. So it's a mix. I would say the product tends to be lower density garden, kind of simpler construction. That's where it tends to be working better right now. And if more likely, it will be in more in the expansion regions or some of our -- I'm sorry, in the established regions some of our expansion regions, Denver and Florida, in particular, Southeast Florida, assets are trading more generally above replacement costs there. There's probably a little more pressure in North Carolina and Texas, and that's where it really does depend on the product and the submarket and specific -- the specific dynamics of the site you're looking at. Yes, Austin, it's Matt. I think, the reason why we underwrite on an untrended basis is we feel that that's pretty conservative that on average over time, rents grow. So we're not counting on that trending of the rents to make the deal work. We wouldn't start a deal that only works because of trended rents as opposed to current rents. So we're comfortable with our yield and our basis on those deals we're starting now in today's environment. And then it's really everybody can have their own view on what happens going forward. I would say any deal we're starting now, we're probably not leasing it for two years or maybe a year and a half. So I do think that in almost every case, we would think markets by that time should have positive momentum to them. What happens between now and then it's going to vary from market-to-market. And honestly, that's probably more relevant for our acquisitions in our development because there we are stepping into a rent roll and whether that existing rent roll has lost lease or gained lease in it, will affect our kind of short-term kind of year one yield and that in turn weighs on the IRR of the investment. So it's probably subject to a little more scrutiny on acquisitions than on development just based on the greater value creation margin there. Yes, it's a good point, Austin. And I would say yes. To the latter question, yes, to the former question, not so much. So the transaction market, it's still pretty thin, there's still not much activity and we're not seeing distress. In fact, a bunch of us were just at the ULI conference last week and everybody was talking about that and the lack of kind of distressed opportunities. And if you had asked me 30 days ago, I would have said the transaction market seems like it's about to finally break 3% and get back to a robust level of volume. That was when the tenure was kind of in the mid-3s, 3.6%, 3.7% range and there was a lot of optimism and confidence. It's a volatile time, and obviously, with the loan rate moving up quite a bit, I think that we've seen a pullback on transaction activity just in the last 30 days. So we are -- we continue to be in this environment where our select assets that meet the criteria that select buyers are looking for will trade. And as Ben mentioned, we've gotten more confidence in where those asset values are and a lot of folks are looking for the same kind of stuff to buy, including us. But we haven't seen kind of the large-scale transaction activity that we would like to see because we would like to do more portfolio trading. So it looks like this year, so far, we've sold $590 million and we bought $325 million. We're not done yet. We will probably have at least one more disposition and hopefully another acquisition or two before year-end, but we're going to end up the year net seller of, call it, $150 million to $200 million. Our goal would be to be net neutral and to be able to buy at the same volume as we're selling. And as you point out, we don't need the net disposition capital to fund the growth through development. So -- and we're happy with the trades that we're making. We feel like we're selling assets that are significantly older, that are a much higher price point that we had -- there were good investments in our established regions for many years, but which don't necessarily have the same growth profile as what we're buying and also kind of our regulatory exposure is part of that strategy as well. So all of those things continue and we certainly hope to be able to do more of that transaction trading in '25. Yes. Hi, John, it's Matt. No, I mean really that's just a mix change that we had two deals complete last quarter whose yields were in the high 7s, which came out of the basket. They're no longer in the development bucket, they're now in other stabilized. And so -- and we added four deals that were around a 6%. So that's really -- the change there is really just a basket mix. The deals that we have that are currently in lease-up, which we don't have that many of, I think it's only 5%, they are running still ahead of pro forma, not as much ahead of pro forma as some of the deals we completed earlier this year. As we're now moving into -- we're now getting maybe a couple of years away from kind of '22 when we had pretty aggressive rent growth. But they're still running $175 per month ahead on rent and 20 basis points ahead on yield. So -- and that 5.9% -- what you'll see over the next couple of quarters is that number will start to move up into the 6%s, into the low 6%s and then probably by this time next year into the mid-6%s as more of the deals that we started this year and in '23, which were underwritten into the 6%s start and more of the deals that started in '21 and '22 when cap rates were 3.5% and yields were 5% as those deals complete and roll-out of that basket, you'll see it rise. Yes, Anne, it's Matt. Land values are usually the stickiest part of the equation in development, and it is completely local. So it's hard to generalize on that. We have seen and we highlighted actually last year at our Investor Day how one of the deals we have under construction now in Quincy Mass, we were able to buy that land at 40% less than where it would have traded at the peak of the frenzy. So there are situations where we've seen that kind of move. I'd say in California, not a lot of land is trading because it's very difficult to get development to underwrite there. But to the extent it does, that's where we've seen some significant land retrenchment. And it's generally places -- those kind of markets where land represents a very high percentage of the deal cap. In some of the Sunbelt regions in North Carolina, even in Texas, the land is not that high a percentage of the deal cap. So whether you're paying 30 or 35 or 40 a door for the land, that's not really what's going to make the difference. So there is some give back there, but probably not as much. So it varies market-to-market, but it's not been -- with a few exceptions, I would say it hasn't been kind of a major move across the board. Hi, Alex, it's Matt. For us, I'd say for at least the last six or seven years, we actually do have a pretty formal process for that where every site gets run through a third-party coastal risk model. It's actually a resiliency risk model, which tries to capture wind, flooding, pluvial flooding, fluvial flooding excessive heat, wildfire risk, all those different things. So I'd say we were early adopters of that. And so there are probably sites we've passed on that maybe today would be harder for somebody to get financed than would have been the case five years ago. And we did switch vendors to a more robust reporting format on that, but we've always been pretty mindful of that. Yes. Hi, Linda, it's Matt. It's early to tell because it's still a relatively new and quickly expanding sub-sector of our business of rental housing more broadly. But I would say that our experience with the townhomes that we do own and what we've seen from third-party's, the yields aren't really significantly different and for that matter, probably nor are the cap rates. As it relates to who is the customer and is the customer different for single-family versus the townhome, I think it probably starts with location that where you're going to see townhomes is in closer in locations where, you know the land is too valuable to kind of have quarter acre lots or what have you and people developing townhomes at 10, 15, 20 to the acre. And as you get further out, you start to have more land where you're able to do a single-family, true detached single-family. I don't -- I haven't seen a lot. I don't know that there's a huge difference in the customer base other than obviously, there are some customers, particularly empty nesters for whom a three-story townhouse might be a bit much. You know, families with kids also would probably prefer the larger yard. We do get a fair number of townhome BTR that do have their own yard as well as their own garage. That is something that's important. And I believe the community we just started there in Plano has yards as well as garages. So, but you -- so there are probably subtle differences in terms of life stage. So the school district is probably more important for an SF single-family product than a townhome product. But yes, this is all early days and we'll certainly learn a lot more as we get more of this product out there."

            "content": "So Jamie, this is Kevin. I'll start on insurance and Sean will probably follow on the broader look on OpEx for next year. So in terms of insurance, this year's expected insurance expense increase of about 10%, just to kind of give you some context, it's being driven primarily by increases in property insurance premiums and losses where the premium increases from property relate to our May 2023 renewal that continued to affect us earlier this year. But we had a roughly flat property renewal in May of this year, very successful in that regard, partly due to the kind of the abatement of decline in insurance premium pressures in that property insurance market relative to prior years. And that flat property renewal this past May provided some relief from the impact of higher premiums in this year's numbers and into next year. As we move into 2025, we just see based on what's going on in the various insurance markets that we have, a continued movement towards stabilization in program costs, as we look to renew property and other types of insurance next year such that we expect to generally renew those at more typical growth rates. Our property renewal is in May, and as you know, we have very little exposure to the high risk areas, where there have been problems such as in Florida, where we have limited exposure to Southeast Florida where there's concrete construction and generally have more of a coastal footprint. So we've been insulated from a lot of those pressures as well. The only exception we see with respect to insurance is liability insurance, which is seeing some above average premium increases, but fortunately, liability insurance comprises less than a quarter of our overall total insurance spend. So as a result, when you put it together and look at insurance costs for next year, while it's still early, we currently expect our overall insurance costs to be more in the mid to high single-digit range for next year, which is closer to more normal levels for us. Yes, that's correct, Steve. That was what our intention was when we executed the forward equity deal back in early September. It was intended to support an elevated level of development starts next year. So we don't anticipate issuing the shares under the forward this year, but expect to do so next year as we kind of ramp development starts."

            "name": "Benjamin Schall",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm here with Kevin O'Shea, our Chief Financial Officer; Matt Birenbaum, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sean Breslin, our Chief Operating Officer. Sean and I have some prepared remarks, and then we'll open the line for questions. Per our practice, we posted a presentation in conjunction with our earnings release, which we will reference on today's call. I'd like to start today's call with an update on the four strategic priorities we highlighted during our Investor Day last November. As summarized on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation, our organization has been laser-focused on executing our plans in each one of these areas, confident that they will continue to deliver superior growth for shareholders. First, as highlighted on Slide 5, we continue to make meaningful progress in transforming our operating model and driving both operating efficiencies and incremental revenue. Last November, we raised our target to $80 million of annual incremental NOI to come as a result of these operating initiatives. We are tracking on plan, including further deployments of AvalonConnect and our neighborhood operating model, as well as advancements in our utilization of AI. By yearend, we expect to add another $10 million, bringing our total achievement to $37 million towards our $80 million target, highlighting both our strong progress to-date and the significant runway of future earnings we expect to deliver over the coming years. Second, we continue to optimize our portfolio's future growth through proactive portfolio management and our strategy to increase our allocation to the suburbs and our expansion regions as summarized on Slide 6. Our portfolio is now 73% suburban, up from 70% last year and well-positioned in the near-term to benefit from steady demand and low levels of new supply, and in the long-term from shifting demographics, including aging millennials. We also continue to make steady progress toward our expansion region target of 25%, having now reached a 10% allocation. This year, we sold almost $600 million of assets, all from our established regions, half urban and half suburban, and reallocated that capital predominantly to suburban assets in our expansion regions at a very attractive basis as we look to further optimize and diversify our portfolio for the future. The third area that we detailed at our Investor Day was our unique development growth engine and our ability to consistently drive accretive external growth. As highlighted on Slide 7, our 2024 completions have meaningfully outperformed our original underwriting, achieving a 6.5% yield or 50 basis points above pro forma, generating additional earnings growth and value creation. We've increased our planned development starts for this year to nearly $1.1 billion with a projected untrended initial stabilized yield of 6.3% on these projects, which we consider to be well within our strike zone of generating 100 to 150 basis points of spread to both underlying cap rates and our cost of capital. Looking forward, we believe there could be an attractive window to further leverage our development capabilities and our cost of capital advantage to capture an outsized share of what's likely to be a lower overall level of new starts in the industry. Which brings me to our fourth strategic priority, ensuring continuous access to cost effective capital to fuel future growth. As highlighted on Slide 8, our balance sheet is as strong as it's ever been, among the strongest in the REIT industry, and supported further by our recent forward equity activity, sourcing $850 million at an implied initial cost of approximately 5% to fund future accretive development. We committed to providing this type of follow-up to you at our Investor Day last year, and we're pleased to report out on the strong progress that we've made in each of these four strategic priorities over the last 12 months. We're confident these strategies will position AvalonBay for continued superior growth in the quarters and years ahead. And as I transition to our Q3 results, I want to thank our 3,000 AvalonBay associates for their effort, collaboration, and commitment to these strategic priorities and for delivering another strong quarter of results. Slide 9 summarizes Q3 and year-to-date results and activities with the headline being that we exceeded core FFO guidance for the quarter by $0.03 per share. We also started $450 million of new developments this quarter as part of our planned $1.1 billion of starts this year, a vintage of projects that should face less competition when they open for leasing in a couple of years. Based on our continued operating momentum, we increased our full year core FFO guidance for 2024 for the third time this year to $11.04 per share, implying a peer-leading 3.9% core FFO growth rate as highlighted on Slide 10. For our same-store portfolio, we continue to expect same-store revenue growth of 3.5% and we lowered the midpoint of our same-store operating expense estimate by 30 basis points to 4.5%, which resulted in an increase in our same-store NOI guidance to 3% for the full year 2024. Sean will now speak to our performance in more detail, our momentum in Q4 and our building blocks as we head into 2025. Sean? Thanks, Sean. To quickly summarize, Q3 results exceeded our expectations and supported a further increase to our full year earnings guidance. Our outlook heading into 2025 looks healthy, particularly given the fundamentals in our established regions. We're leaning further into development, a powerful driver of differentiated earnings growth and value-creation, and we will continue to execute as an organization on a set of strategic priorities that we are confident will continue to deliver superior growth for shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it to the operator to facilitate questions. Eric, I'll add a couple of additional comments to your question on sort of relative positioning. As we think about leaning into external growth and development today, one is the cost of capital advantage, right? We've got a cost of capital advantage relative to our private sector competitors. And the second is, we are increasingly able to drive incremental yield from our new investments, both on acquisitions and development. And a lot of that goes from taking our operating model transformation in those initiatives and bringing those to new investments. And so obviously, project specific and submarket specific, but in a lot of these projects, we're able to generate 30 to 40 -- 30 to 40 basis points of incremental yield by tapping into that strategic set of capabilities. Also, I'll emphasize a couple of other components in terms of our lean-in which expands on -- we're talking about earlier on the call. As you know, as we think about development yields, both established regions and expansion regions, we're focused on 100 to 150 basis points of spread to both underlying cap rates and market rates and our cost of capital. So Kevin spoke to our cost of capital on next year's set of starts, right? We've locked that in at a five. We have over the last six months, not a huge amount of transaction activity, but we have gotten more visibility on transaction activity, which has given us more confidence around where underlying values are. And then the third piece is, we have seen construction costs come down, not everywhere, but in a lot of our regions, so when we think about our long-term basis or stepping in at this point in a time, that also has us leaning into net new external growth. Yes. No, we've seen that really kind of starting back in Q2, and Seattle is one of the regions that has performed much better than we originally anticipated through 2024, in part due to Amazon's callback and people sort of slowly and steadily getting closer to, or in the Seattle MSA. There are other employers doing the same thing. So I think overall return to office and the trend to return to office, whether it's Amazon and the impact in Seattle or announcements from Salesforce about calling people back in January to San Francisco, all those things are a positive trend for those markets. I would say on the Salesforce side in San Francisco, we started to see early signs of it, but there's probably still more to come, whereas Amazon made that announcement quite some time ago, and we've seen movement throughout Seattle as a result of that for a good portion this year. Yes. So on the build-to-rent, the BTR space, we have made a decision to more formally advance our plans there. And we consider it an expansion of our existing business. We've been building townhomes, purpose-built townhomes really since the beginning of AvalonBay. We do it today. A lot of times we're building townhomes in conjunction with apartment flats and sometimes we're building full townhome types of communities. And so it feels like an opportunity for us to take what we do well on the operating side and on the development side and bring it into this, I'll call it, expanded set of opportunities. As we -- we are organizing specific resources around the opportunity set. In the nearer term, you're likely to see more of our focus, one, be on townhome communities within the larger scope of BTR and second, in terms of the growth channels, to be via acquisitions. And so we had an acquisition in Austin, which was a full townhome community and through our developer funding program, which is the Plano project that you referenced. So we're excited about the opportunity set and I think we can really bring our strategic advantages to bear there and provide more growth opportunities going forward. So on your first question, Anne, detached BTR product is in the -- in the possibility set. It's not where we're necessarily starting. We're going to, as I said, emphasize the townhome product a little bit closer to our regular way activity. But purpose-built communities generally in the unit range of 80 to 130 units per community, places where we feel like we can bring our -- if we're going to buy an asset, particularly, bring our operating heft and operating scale to these communities, which is when we think about the space, one of the opportunities is there aren't many institutional large scale operators in this space. And so in places where we can have both apartments and BTR, we feel like there are synergies that can come in and around that mix. We haven't defined the pipeline at this point. We haven't set a specific target in terms of the percentage of the overall portfolio, but we have dedicated resources and it will be an area of incremental emphasis over the next 12 to 18 months. Our expectations for 2025 is particularly the high supply submarkets in the Sunbelt regions are going to continue to face fairly meaningful pressure. And then the impact on rent rolls and cash flows for those properties in those types of submarkets would then roll over into 2026. Start volumes, as we all seen are definitely coming down. I would emphasize they're coming down in both the Sunbelt and in our established regions. So as you get out into 2026, kind of all else being equal, we do expect lower levels of supply, and I'd say sort of equal levels of demand as we think about demand drivers in our established regions relative demand drivers in our expansion regions. Yes, sure, Rich. I'll provide some color and context and really focus on our sort of economic outlook for 2025 at this point. Consensus and we look to the National Association of Business Economics as a guide in, and around consensus generally has job growth slowing in 2022 relative to 2024 going from sort of two million net new jobs down into the 1.5 million type of range. A couple of call outs, one is potentially the mix of jobs next year could look different than this year and be higher income jobs and jobs in what we would consider our knowledge-based economy, our core type of customer. So that's leaning in a little bit. Wage prospects also for our core customer have continued to look strong. Those also look strong as we're heading into next year. And then generally, this kind of -- sort of the job outlook to the supply outlook, you sort of do a compare and contrast of '24 relative to '25, maybe jobs are slowing a little bit, supplies are coming down a little bit. But across the country in a lot of markets seems fairly consistent from a jobs and supply ratio. And so as we think about what are the types of markets that are going to outperform next year, they're going to continue to be the ones that have lower levels of new supply and the ones that are going to continue to be under pressure going to be those with higher levels of new supply coming online. Yes. So for us, Rich, I'll highlight a couple of areas. One, we expect our suburban coastal business to continue to outperform. I think you look at the building blocks and the drivers that we've talked about going into next year and that Sean detailed, we feel relatively positive there. The other component is the lean-in and around external growth. And we've talked about development activity and the -- and the buildup and the prospects there. And then potentially the transaction markets and I think with some -- hopefully some enhanced visibility and stability around rates and cap rates, that leads to some more transaction activity, which when I think about the prospects for next year and going into '26, players with our scale, our cost-of-capital, our ability to generate more value by having assets on our platform, that should also allow us to lean further into external growth. Yes, happy to do that. I mean the regions with the greatest opportunities, I'll say top four or five New York, New Jersey, particularly the New York City market, still running in the low 2% range. The Mid-Atlantic low 2% range as well, particularly the D.C. and Maryland being the outlier issues relative to Virginia actually doing pretty well, a little bit in Northern California still running high relative to historical norms, but it's about 125 basis points. LA still running a little over 2% with LA and Ventura being the issues there within Southern California, Orange County, San Diego, getting closer to norm at 70 to 90 basis points. Virginia, as I mentioned, around 70 basis points. Boston is back to 60%, so it's really New York, New Jersey, the Mid-Atlantic and then to a certain degree, Northern California and LA are the markets where we need to see more significant improvement as you move through 2025. Yes. Thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to seeing many of you shortly at Nareit. Have a good day."

            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Ben. Moving to Slide 11 to address recent portfolio trends. Third quarter performance was strong and our same-store portfolio is well-positioned heading into the slower leasing season. Turnover continues to trend well below historical norms, which is typically around 55% on a full year basis, driven in part by a substantially lower volume of move-outs to purchase a home in our established regions, which remains at record lows. Additionally, economic occupancy has increased from the mid-summer low point and we expect it to remain relatively stable during Q4. Turning to Slide 12, during our mid-year earnings call, I mentioned the possibility of a reacceleration in asking rent and rent change given softer comps from Q4 2023. We're now starting to see that trend come to fruition. In the chart on the left, asking rent growth during the year has followed traditional seasonal curves and outperformed our experience throughout 2023. Recently, the level of outperformance has widened, and as of November 1, the average asking rent for our same-store portfolio was approximately 3% greater than the same date last year with the East Coast roughly 4% higher and the West Coast about 2%. The higher average asking rent will flow through to improved rent change, particularly for new move-ins as we look forward. Currently, we're forecasting rent change in November to be stronger than October and increase further as we move through December. Moving to Slide 13 and the outlook for 2025 revenue growth, we expect healthy job and wage growth, a financially well-positioned renter and relatively unaffordable for-sale housing alternatives will all support steady demand for our apartment homes in the year ahead. In Chart 1 on Slide 13, renters in our established coastal regions have experienced strong wage growth over the last several years, so rent-to-income ratios have actually declined and are currently about 10% below where they were at the beginning of 2020. This is important in understanding the potential capacity of renters to pay higher rents, all else being equal. Moving to Chart 2, renting an apartment in our established regions continues to be much more affordable than owning a home with the spread being the widest we've ever seen. This lack of affordable for-sale alternatives should continue to support a lower level of resident turnover and a greater propensity for new households to rent versus own. Moving to Slide 14 and the outlook for supply, our established coastal regions are expected to see new deliveries of 1.4% of existing stock in 2025, roughly 100 basis points lower than what's forecast for the Sunbelt, which is already facing a challenging operating environment given the record level of deliveries over the past year. Our same-store portfolio will further benefit from being roughly 70% suburban, where deliveries are expected to be roughly 1% of stock in 2025. Overall, we believe our portfolio is well insulated from the impact of excessive new supply in 2025. Turning to Slide 15, I'll address the building blocks for revenue growth in 2025. First, we're projecting embedded revenue growth or the earn-in to be roughly 1.1% or approximately 10 basis points greater than where we started 2024. Second, we've estimated that underlying bad debt from residents will improve by roughly 60 basis points from 2023 to 2024, and it has improved on a year-over-year basis in each quarter so far this year. While we haven't yet completed our forecast for 2025, we expect continued improvement in underlying bad debt throughout the upcoming year. And third, we expect to again produce strong other rental revenue growth during the coming year. While we don't expect the growth rate to be quite as strong as the roughly 15% increase we're forecasting for 2024, it should still contribute meaningfully to overall revenue growth for 2025. Moving to the outlook for operating expense growth on Slide 16, we expect overall operating expense pressures to moderate as we move into 2025. In terms of some of the key drivers, the impact from the expiration of tax abatement programs, notably the 421-a program in New York City, will still be present but ease in 2025. Additionally, given our AvalonConnect offering will be substantially deployed across the portfolio, the impact on our utilities expense in 2025 will be materially less than what we experienced in 2024. Most other categories are expected to grow modestly as we look to 2025. Now I'll turn it back to Ben for some more summary comments before we open it up to Q&A. Ben? Yes, Eric, this is Sean. I can comment then Matt or others can certainly speak to it as well. But as it relates to our established coastal regions, first for 2025, we're expecting a reduction in delivery across those regions with the one exception being New York City, which actually is forecast to have a slight uptick. It's not material, but a slight uptick in deliveries in 2025. As it relates to where they settle beyond that, what I'd say is -- and Matt can speak this further is the development climate certainly has been challenging for a number of reasons, given what we've seen in-construction costs, what's been happening with capital costs and the impact, particularly on merchant builders across our regions. So given the fact that starts have come down and the fact that the gestation period for construction in our coastal markets is fairly lengthy given the product type, it wouldn't be a surprise to see deliveries for our -- again, coastal established regions to continue to trend down over the next couple of years, given what we've seen in terms of starts activity and the underwriting associated with new projects in those same regions. So hopefully that answers your question. Jamie, as it relates to the broader question about the direction of OpEx growth in 2025 relative to 2024's growth rate, yes, the purpose of the slide was to give you some general sense that we do expect the growth rate to ease in 2025 relative to 2024. And the main callouts as it relates to that are items that are relatively well-known. For example, the 421-a and other pilot programs. That's about an 80 basis point impact on the 2024 overall growth rate that will diminish somewhat as we get into 2025. In terms of our operating initiatives, AvalonConnect will be pretty much 90% deployed by yearend '24. There will still be some roll-through of leases in '25, but the gross impact of that in 2024 on total OpEx growth was 120 basis points. That's the forecast. So that will come down. Just those two items alone will lead to some easing there. We don't see pressure points in the various other categories that would overcome the impact of those two items as an example. So we do expect growth rate to come down in '25 relative to '24. Yes, Adam, this is Sean. I can take that one. So first, in terms of high-level strategy for us, as I mentioned on the mid-year call, we had a nice run-up in occupancy at the beginning of the year kind of throughout the first quarter. And so we started pushing harder as it related to rate growth and we were able to do that through Q2 and most of Q3, which is the time when you want to do that given the heavy lease expiration volume, roughly 60% of our leases expire during those two quarters. So that's when you want to get it. But in terms of overall strategy then as you get into September and October, you do want to sort of stabilize occupancy as you head into slower leasing season. So as we move through September into October, you saw that in terms of the deceleration, particularly on the new move-in side. So that was part of the broader strategy. As it relates to where we are today, occupancy is relatively stable, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, given the softer comp in terms of where asking rents were in Q4 of 2023 relative to where they are as of now, asking rents are about 3% higher than where they were last year. So where we are signing leases currently is presenting a nice spread on the move-in side. So as we look forward, you know, October blended rent change was 1.2%. We see it ticking up into the high 1% range for November and then the mid-2%s in December, our expectation is that all of that is really on the backs of new move-ins, which were down about 180 basis points in October, but we expect that to flip to be modestly positive in November and a little over 100 basis points in December. Renewal offers were already out. We negotiate with residents, so for the most part, what you're going to see is the improvement coming on new move-ins as we move through November and December, given where asking rents are today. Yes, good question. And everyone has probably a different crystal ball on that one of which probably none of ours are 100% accurate just given the nature of the issue, which is really highly dependent upon various things outside of our control in the various regions. So obviously, we've seen a nice improvement as it relates to the performance this year coming down roughly 60 basis points year-over-year. From 2022 to 2023 had come down 140 basis points, so a more significant improvement. My expectation is that by the time we get through 2025, we're probably not back to a fully stabilized or normalized level, but we're making good progress towards it. And what we use to sort of estimate that is the volume of skips and [evicts] that we see-through the portfolio. So for example, we saw 300 plus evictions in the third quarter. We have about 1,300 accounts that are still sort of sitting out there that are needed to be processed through either a skip or evict situation. So it's certainly -- at that run-rate, it's certainly at least a year. My guess is more likely a little bit more than that. So it's probably as you get into 2026 that we would start to see some normalization as opposed to expecting that to occur in 2025. Yes. Yes. I mean, what I can tell you is our expectation for November and December, I talked about the move-ins. On the renewals, we're expecting renewal achievement to be in the high 3% range for both November and December based on what we already know today that's signed as well as the expectation for negotiation spreads. So where those renewals went out, it's going to be irrelevant at this point. It's more kind of where they're trending and that's our expectation for November and December is high 3%. Josh, this is Sean. I mean, what I say with sort of a broad-brush is, yes, new moving rent change pretty much came down in every single region. And as I mentioned, that was sort of the strategy to sort of help stabilize occupancy as we went into the slower leasing season. And the one thing I would just point to is that Seattle tends to be more seasonal than average. And therefore, as you are attempting to build occupancy, any market that is more seasonal than average, you're going to take it a little bit harder on the new move-ins relative to maybe some other markets that aren't quite as seasonal. That's really sort of the primary issue for Seattle. In Northern California, really nothing significant to note there. It's kind of a submarket-by-submarket decision based on availability and pricing and the occupancy targets. So I wouldn't read too much into it other than in those particular submarkets, we gave a little bit more to shore up on the new move-in side. There's not a lot, there's not a lot of volume, keep that in mind. Yes, Brad, this is Sean. We actually haven't, but overall lost lease as of November 1 is about 100 basis points across the portfolio, slightly higher in the East than the West and we're actually in a modest gain to lease situation in the expansion regions. Yes, John, it's Sean. The main driver and we haven't settled all of our property tax budgets yet, but the main driver that will impact the growth rate for property taxes in 2025, particularly relative to 2024 is a modestly diminished impact from the expiration of various tax abatement programs, notably the 421-a program in New York City, which boosted overall expense growth by roughly 80 basis points this year, and we expect that to come down next year. So that will move the needle, all else being equal based on what we know today in terms of changes in assessed values or rates across the other markets when you have something that significant. Yes, Amy, it does based on the numbers I described previously. So yes, it does. Hi, Alex, it's Sean. When you said normal, just kind of normal seasonal patterns of pricing is what you mean specifically, I assume? Yes. I mean, I think for the most part, if you think about what -- how the pricing curves are generated kind of follows the patterns of demand. And our expectation is the traditional seasonal patterns for demand aren't likely to shift anytime soon in terms of the reasons people move, when they want to move, what they're desiring in terms of apartments and things of that sort. The two things that are a little unusual that I think maybe still haven't fully played out, but are sort of in the background beyond what Ben talked about in terms of job and wage growth is in particularly in our coastal markets is the return to office trends. It certainly has gotten better. I'm not sure we felt the full impact of that yet across all of our coastal regions as people are sort of inching their way back to what they think is normal state. And we mentioned earlier, Amazon's announcement, Salesforce bringing people back to San Francisco in January that's certainly a positive that helps sort of build confidence in the city, other issues in LA and D.C., and places like that. So I think that's one factor. And then certainly, the lack of affordable for-sale housing in our established regions where the cost to own a home is relative to renting is the widest we've ever seen. Those two, it's hard to tell how those fully play out, but they are still playing out, I would say. You can see it on return to office trends. And on the for sale side, it's really showing up in lower turnover, which we think is going to be durable for a while, but the impact of new households being formed and their options, renting still looks like relative to historical norms as more attractive options -- option. So how those play into the seasonal patterns may not look different, but it may just provide further support for growth in those established regions relative to what we've seen historically. Yes. Haendel, this is Sean. I'll provide a little bit of color there. Yes, certainly what I'd say for this year is we've seen better performance out of Boston, New York City, specifically of the New York, New Jersey region, and the Mid-Atlantic to a certain degree and then also in the West Coast Seattle. In terms of the outlook for those markets, yes, the earn-in, if you want to describe it that way, it certainly is a little more robust in those markets relative to others. So all else being equal, in terms of, as you said, if everything else was equal in terms of rent change across the markets, those ones would outperform in 2025 relative to 2024. But to the extent you see significant momentum due to other factors in the various other markets that haven't performed as well as those in '24 that can certainly overwhelm the earn-in pretty quickly. So I think it's really a reflection of how you want to look at what the job growth expectations are for a particular market, how it blends with supply and then these other trends in terms of for sale housing and return to office and how that they play out. That would really impact the performance in '25 in terms of who is top of the leaderboard versus not? Yes. I mean, we can look at it. I mean, I give an overall number of 110 basis points. The earn-in on the East is about 130 basis points and the earn-in on the West is about just under a point, it's around 94 basis points, 95 basis points. And it's a forecast. So things can move around a little bit here. And then as I mentioned earlier, as we were talking about lease-to-lease, loss-to-lease, or gain-to-lease as it relates to our expansion regions, it's actually a little bit negative around 20 basis points. Yes, I got no problem. Yes, so we do expect to -- the growth rate for other rental revenue to decelerate in '25 relative to '24 based on what we know today. There's a number of different categories that are producing sort of above-average growth, but the primary one that's driving it to that level has been our AvalonConnect offering, which will still be present in 2025 because we put the programs in place, it gets fully deployed, will be about 90% deployed by year-end 2024 and then the revenue flows through as the leases expire in 2025, since you can't push it through or people are already on existing leases. And so that's the main driver. And then in terms of OpEx trends, as I mentioned earlier, the impact for 2024 as a result of some of the initiatives is around 120 basis points in terms of the impact on total OpEx growth in 2024 and we do expect that to diminish pretty materially as we get into 2025, again, because the program is more fully deployed, it's not impacting as many units. So that will soften in 2025. Sure. Yes, Linda, we haven't provided a forecast yet for January as we're sort of still working through that. We felt comfortable doing that for November, December just given the volume of lease expirations in those months, what we already know about it and the shift in asking rents more importantly. So we're not providing that for January, but feel-good about what we did provide for November and December. Yes. So this is Sean. I wouldn't say there's been any meaningful shifts recently. Obviously, as we went through COVID and then initially started coming out of COVID, there was a lot of movement initially in COVID, not as much doubling up, more single-person households. All those things have sort of transitioned through COVID, I'd say have stabilized at more normal levels, the percentage of roommates, et cetera. So I don't think there have been any significant shifts. I think as you look forward, just given the nature of demographics and some of the development Matt was talking about, I think, being more heavily suburban, some of the townhome products certainly fits the aging millennial profile where they want to be a little more infill in our established regions. It's very expensive to buy a home. So if they get a nice quality townhome product with a small yard or a nice deck and be in a good school district, that's highly attractive. So we are making sure our portfolio is well-positioned for the demand that's to come, which may represent slightly larger households when you include kids in some of these markets than what we've seen in the past. But looking at it over a short period of time, you get a lot of false signals in terms of just some noise in there that I wouldn't necessarily say has really resulted in anything significant in terms of shifts in the last few quarters."

[Operator Instructions] Your host for today's conference is Mr. Jason Reilley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Reilley, you may begin your conference call.\nJason Reilley: Thank you, Paul, and welcome to AvalonBay Communities Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, please note that forward-looking statements may be made during this discussion. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. . There is a discussion of these risks and uncertainties in yesterday afternoon's press release as well as in the company's Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. As usual, the press release does include an attachment with definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other terms, which may be used in today's discussion. The attachment is also available on our website at www.avalonbay.com/earnings, and we encourage you to refer to this information during the review of our operating results and financial performance. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ben Schall, CEO and President of AvalonBay Communities for his remarks. Ben?\nBenjamin Schall: Thanks, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm here with Kevin O'Shea, our Chief Financial Officer; Sean Breslin, our Chief Operating Officer; and Matt Birenbaum, our Chief Investment Officer. I will start by emphasizing a number of key themes that are top of mind and that we believe are important drivers of our continued outperformance and then turn it to Kevin, Sean and Matt to go deeper. . As usual, we will reference our investor presentation, starting on Page 4 as we proceed through our prepared remarks. Our operating momentum continued in the second quarter with us exceeding revenue expectations and also successfully managing operating expenses lower. Based on this momentum, we further raised our guidance for the year and are projecting sector-leading full year core FFO and same-store revenue growth among our closest peers. Our operating momentum through the first half of the year has been driven by better-than-expected demand with our core renter, the knowledge-based worker in a relatively strong position right now. Sectors of the economy that encompass our core customer are at effectively full employment with stable job and income prospects. We also continue to benefit from customers' strong tilt towards renting versus buying a home, given the lack of for-sale inventory and unaffordability. And finally, as expected, we continue to benefit from the low levels of new supply in our suburban coastal markets, a dynamic that should continue to benefit our portfolio versus most of the rest of the sector for another 12 to 18 months at least. Our strong internal growth is also being fueled by our continued progress with our operating model transformation. As we detailed at our Investor Day last November, our collective set of initiatives, from investment -- from our investments in technology and centralization to our reimagined operating neighborhoods are driving meaningful operating efficiencies and allowing us to drive healthy increases in ancillary revenue streams. We're on track with these operating initiatives for 2024 with a strong runway of future earnings growth ahead of us. Importantly, we're also increasingly tapping these operating capabilities to drive outsized yields and returns on new developments and acquisitions. Further to that point, our platform is uniquely positioned to continue to drive incremental earnings growth and value creation from our external investment activity. Our developments underway continue to outperform. During the quarter, we completed 3 new development communities at an impressive initial stabilized yield of 7.7% as noted on Slide 5. We are also incrementally more optimistic about new development adding 2 new -- adding 2 additional developments to this year's starts for a total just north of $1 billion. We're underwriting mid-6% yields on this set of new projects well within our strike zone of having 100 to 150 basis points of spread relative to market cap rates and our cost of borrowing. And as the final differentiator that I'll highlight upfront, we continue to actively reposition our portfolio for superior longer-term growth, heading from 70% suburban to 80% and 8% of our portfolio in our expansion regions to 25%. We believe we are now moving into a more attractive environment to execute on this repositioning, particularly with the froth in rents and cap rates off in our Sun Belt expansion regions. We're also tailing our portfolio in our expansion markets with lower density and lower price point assets at an attractive basis. At the bottom of Page 5, $500 million of the $900 million of capital raised year-to-date has been from asset sales at an average cap rate of 5.1%, which we are then reallocating into acquisitions in our expansion markets. The remaining $400 million was our prior unsecured debt deal with an effective rate of 5.05%, including the benefits of swaps we had in place, highlighting our relative cost of capital advantage. Before turning it to Kevin to discuss our updated guidance, let me touch on a couple of the details of our Q2 results. Page 6 provides the detail of our $0.09 core FFO outperformance in Q2, broken down by category. And please take note that $0.02 of this $0.09 outperformance was timing-related and costs we expect to incur in the second half of the year. Slide 7 Zoom's closer in on our Q2 revenue outperformance with better-than-expected outcomes on lease rates, occupancy and other rental revenue, partially offset by bad debt staying more elevated than we had hoped. Other than bad debt, our revenue momentum was strong, which is a nice segue to Kevin to discuss our updated and increased guidance for the year. Kevin?\nKevin O'Shea: Turning to Slide 7. You will see our updated 2024 full year financial and operating outlook. Based on our performance to date and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our projection for full year core FFO per share by $0.11 to $11.02 per share. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of 3.7%, which is a healthy 100 basis point increase relative to our outlook in April and a 220 basis point increase relative to our January outlook. We're also favorably adjusting our expectations for full year same-store revenue, operating expense and NOI growth. We now expect revenue growth of 3.5% and same-store NOI growth of 2.9% in 2024, which are favorable increases of 40 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively, relative to our prior outlook in April. Lastly, our midyear forecast includes a strong increase in new development starts of nearly $200 million to just over $1 billion of new starts in 2024. Matt will provide additional details on this activity in a few moments. Slide 8 highlights the drivers of the $0.11 increase to our full year projected core FFO per share midpoint relative to our April outlook. Encouragingly and importantly, strong performance within the same-store portfolio is driving most of the increase. In addition, we are benefiting from outperformance at our lease-up communities. These amounts are partially offset by other items, including minor adjustments in capital markets activity and overhead. Slide 9 provides a road map from our second quarter core FFO per share to our third quarter projected core FFO per share midpoint. Looking at the components of the sequential quarterly change, we expect revenue growth from the same-store portfolio and NOI contributions from lease activity and other stabilized communities to drive $0.08 of sequential core FFO per share growth. These contributions will be affected by a combination of higher same-store operating expense growth in the third quarter, which we expect will increase about 6% on a year-over-year basis. Adjustments in capital markets and transaction market activities which are primarily driven by recent net disposition activity in the last month, consistent with our sell first and buy later transaction strategy and by adjustments in overhead expenses. In the fourth quarter, we expect reduced same-store operating expense growth. And for full year 2024, we now expect same-store operating expense growth of 4.8%, which is a 60 basis point decrease from our last quarter outlook and an 80 basis point decrease from our January outlook. Based on our performance to date, and our projected core FFO per share midpoint for the third quarter, the implied projected core FFO per share midpoint for the fourth quarter is $2.84 per share. Notably, this strong sequential growth in Q4 is primarily driven by our growth from our same-store portfolio and our lease-up communities during the fourth quarter. I will now turn the call over to Sean.\nSean Breslin: All right. Thanks, Kevin. Turning to Slide 10. Key portfolio indicators were strong during Q2, and we're off to a good start in Q3. In Chart 1, turnover remains well below historical norms in part supported by a lower level of move-outs to purchase a home. In Q2 specifically, turnover was down 600 basis points year-over-year or roughly 12% and was lower than last year in every region. Lower turnover supported relatively stable occupancy and drove higher rent change as we move through the quarter. Effective rent change increased from 3.2% in April to 4% in June before moderating into the high 3% range during July. As expected, our East Coast regions delivered the strongest rent change in Q2 of 4.2% and with our Mid-Atlantic portfolio leading the way of roughly 5.5%. Our Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland assets continue to demonstrate strong momentum, but the District of Columbia is still lagging due to weaker demand which is in part due to the federal government's return to the office policies and ongoing supply, which is projected to be roughly 4% of existing inventory this year before declining to approximately 2.5% in 2025. Our Boston portfolio, which represents high-quality assets and predominantly supply protected suburban submarkets produced rent change in the high 4s during the quarter. New supply in Boston has declined from the low 2% range a year ago to roughly 1.5% this year and is expected to decline to just above 1% next year for the urban supply projected to be substantially higher than suburban supply. Assuming a relatively static demand environment, the outlook for our suburban Boston portfolio remains quite positive. The Metro New York, New Jersey portfolio 2/3 of which is diversified across various suburban submarkets in Westchester, Long Island and Central and Northern New Jersey, delivered 4% rent change during the quarter. Recently, the strongest growth has occurred across the various submarkets in New York City, Northern New Jersey and Long Island. Some of the more distant locations in Central New Jersey have lag as employees increase their in-office Workday requirements in the city. The West Coast established regions produced rent change in the 3% range our Sudattle portfolio, which is primarily located in east side and north-end submarkets, led the way with 6% rent change during the quarter. While there are some pockets of new supply in select suburban submarkets, most notably Redmond, most of the new inventory is concentrated in urban submarkets and is not competitive with our portfolio. On the demand front, major employers like Microsoft and Amazon require more in-person work has supported the increased demand we've experienced throughout the first half of the year. Northern and Southern California lags Seattle with rent change in the mid-2% range. In Northern California, we had better momentum in San Francisco and San Jose, with 3.2% and 4% rent change, respectively, during Q2. However, the East Bay remains soft with the rent change of 50 basis points during the quarter. Given the supply is projected to be below 1% of stock across the major markets in Northern California for this year and next year. trends could continue to improve in the near future to the extent we realize a modestly stronger level of demand. Moving down to Southern California. Orange County produced the strongest rent change at 4.2%, followed by San Diego roughly 3% and L.A. in the 2% range. Orange County and San Diego have been healthy markets year-to-date, but performance across the various submarkets in L.A. has been choppy and highly correlated with the volume of inventory returning to the submarket from nonpaying residents. As it relates to bad debt, which is depicted in Chart 4 on Slide 10, while we're encouraged with the year-to-date trends in underlying bad debt across our same-store portfolio, results were choppy during the second quarter. We're still expecting bad debt to average roughly 1.7% for the full year 2024 at approximately 60 basis point improvement from 2023. As we've stated previously, prepandemic bad debt for our portfolio was 50 to 70 basis points. So to the extent we reach that level, we realized an incremental $25 million in revenue or more over the next several quarters. Transitioning to Slide 11 to address our updated revenue outlook for the year. We now expect same-store revenue growth of 3.5% for 2024, an increase of 40 basis points from our most recent outlook. The increased outlook is primarily driven by stronger lease rates as lower turnover and stronger occupancy in the first half of the year allowed us to achieve higher rental rates than originally anticipated, a trend we expect to continue. We now expect like term effective rent change in the 3% range for the full year 2024, up roughly 100 basis points from the 2% level we expected at the beginning of the year. We realized 3% rent change in the first half of the year and expect to produce similar performance in the second half. We've seen rent change begin to moderate to start the third quarter and consistent with seasonal norms expected to decelerate through the back half of the year. We expect renewals in the mid-4% range for the balance of the year, while new move-ins averaged roughly 1.5%. The near-term outlook for lease renewals remains healthy with offers in the low 6% range for August and September. Moving to Slide 12. You can see where we're projecting stronger revenue performance relative to our prior outlook. In our established regions, we're expecting substantially stronger growth in New England, the Mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northwest. We we're expecting modestly better growth in New York, New Jersey and almost no change in Northern and Southern California. In our expansion regions, Denver and Southeast Florida are expected to perform slightly better than we originally anticipated, but our other expansion regions of Dallas and Charlotte are expected to be weaker primarily as a result of the continued challenging levels of new supply in those markets. And then finishing on Slide 13, we're on track to realize roughly $10 million of incremental NOI from our operating initiatives in 2024. You can see those results in our same-store portfolio in 2 areas: first, the expected contribution from other rental revenue, which is projected to increase by 14% year-over-year; and second, highly constrained payroll costs, which have declined year-to-date and are expected to grow at roughly 1% for 2024, which is well below the average merit increase of approximately 4% and is related to a reduction in the number of on-site positions. These reductions relate to the enhanced efficiency of our teams, which is supported by our digital efforts and enabled by our new labor strategy. From a broader perspective, we're on track with the Horizon 1 and 2 financial objectives we communicated during our Investor Day last year, which reflect generating an incremental $80 million NOI from our portfolio. At year-end 2024, we expect to have achieved roughly $37 million of that $80 million and look forward to producing the balance of it over the next few years. We'll continue to keep you informed about our efforts and achievements as we innovate further in the future. Now I'll turn it over to Matt to address recently set performance, development starts and capital recycling activities. Matt?\nMatthew Birenbaum: All right. Great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to our development communities. You can see Slide 14 details the continued impressive results being generated by our lease-ups. The 6 development communities that had active leasing in the second quarter are delivering rents $320 per month or 11% above our initial underwriting, which is translating into a 40 basis points increase in yield. And this performance is being supported by strong leasing velocity with these assets averaging 37 net leases per month which was an all-time company record driving our increased guidance for lease-up NOI for the year by roughly $4 million. On the strength of these results and with the transaction market providing more insight into current asset values, we are also increasing our projected development start volume for the year, as shown on Slide 15. We now expect to break ground on 9 new communities this year for a total projected capital cost of $1.05 billion with the vast majority of these starts in either expansion regions or the Northeast and almost exclusively in suburban submarkets. Three of these starts occurred in the second quarter, with most of the others expected in Q3. Based on today's rents, operating expenses and construction costs, these developments are underwriting to a projected yield of 6.4%, generating our target spread of 100 to 150 basis points over current cap rates and we control a total development rights pipeline of roughly $4.5 billion, providing plenty of opportunities for future profitable growth in years to come. Turning to Slide 16. After several quarters, which were quiet, we have also been active in the transaction market recently, closing on 5 dispositions since our last call for aggregate sales proceeds of $515 million. All of these dispositions were in our established coastal regions and they priced at a weighted average cap rate of 5.1%, reflecting an average price per home of $475,000. 3 of the 5 sales were also in urban submarkets where we are seeing better investor interest after several years where these locations were heavily out of favor with institutional capital. We've reinvested a bit less than half of this capital so far into 3 acquisitions in our expansion regions at an average price per home of $260,000 as we are starting to find attractive opportunities to buy the low replacement cost in submarkets and assets that we like. Our asset trading activity continues to move us closer to our long-term portfolio allocation goals of having 25% of our portfolio and expansion regions and 80% in suburban submarkets. We will look to redeploy more of those proceeds before the end of the year as well as bring several additional assets to market as we continue to focus on optimizing our portfolio as we grow. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ben.\nBenjamin Schall: Thanks, Matt. I'll wrap up on Slide 17 with the highlights from our recent ESG report. Our efforts on sustainability are led by Katie Rotenberg and her team but it is a full commitment across the entire organization that enables us to continue to make meaningful progress on these collective initiatives, from reducing our operating costs and environmental impact to making ABB more inclusive and diverse and to all of the time invested via volunteering by our local teams, a huge thanks to all AvalonBay associates. And with that, I'll turn the call to the operator to facilitate questions. .\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Eric Wolfe with Citi.\nEric Wolfe: You mentioned in your remarks the strong growth you're seeing in the fourth quarter, specifically I was just wondering if that's a good run rate for us to think about as you go into 2025 or if there's something in that number that wouldn't maybe carry over like lower seasonal costs. Just because you brought up the remarks, I don't know if you were trying to signal something about not your earnings growth going forward.\nKevin O'Shea: Yes, Eric, this is Kevin. I'll take a crack at this one. Others may want to jump in. We weren't trying to signal anything about '25 in terms of our guidance yet. It's a little bit early at this point in the year to do that. Rather recently noting that the fourth quarter would be expected to have a sequential increase in earnings to get from that third quarter to midpoint core FFO per share guidance of $2.71 to the implied midpoint in the fourth quarter of $2.84. That 13% pickup is primarily driven by sequential growth from 3Q to the fourth quarter in the same-store portfolio. Much of it is a seasonal decline in operating expenses, but some of it is a sequential continued increase in same-store revenue item of business annual trends that Sean alluded to in his remarks as well some other adjustments. So that was really all we're trying to signal and road map to investors is the growth from 3Q to 4Q and the components and the sources of that being kind of coming primarily from same-store as well as continued growth from our lease-up portfolio as well.\nEric Wolfe: Got it. That's helpful. And then in the presentation, you had some [indiscernible] about the sort of unevenness in buyback. Can you talk about what you're seeing there, why you're seeing it, and what you're seeing sort of suggests that it might be harder to eventually get back to that normal long-term average that you typically run at?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Eric, it's Sean. Yes, I mean, overall, what I'd say is you sit back and look at it relative to what we've seen in the last couple of years, things are absolutely trending in the right direction, right? So it's 2.3% last year. We're looking in terms of underlying bad debt. We're expecting that to decline down into the roughly 1.7% range for 2024. So it's moved in the right direction. Each month, each quarter it can be a little bit bumpy based on underlying activity. But I think we're trending in the right direction. We've not provided a precise forecast as to when we would expect it to get back to normal levels just based on the underlying activity that has to manifest itself in actually happening, which relates to court cases and various things like that. So we'll certainly provide our best insight as we turn the quarter towards 2025, but you feel good about the overall change from '23 to '24 at this point in time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAustin Wurschmidt: Is it fair to say that based on the some of the lease rate growth data that you provided for what you expect for the back half of the year, kind of in that 3%-ish range that the earn-in heading into next year should be around that mid-1% range, maybe a little bit below that heading into 2025?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Austin, it's Sean. Given where we sit here with kind of half the year left to go, it wouldn't be appropriate to make comments as it relates to what we think the earnings going to be in January. But you can sort of do some math based on rent change last year versus this year and try to reach your own conclusion on that.\nAustin Wurschmidt: That's fair. And then -- so just based on maybe the projected acceleration in same-store revenue growth from 3Q to 4Q, you mentioned that picks up a bit, and I think you highlighted in the presentation. I know you don't want to provide too much on '25, but is that directionally what you'd expect then see heading into next year, just given kind of the growth you're getting in the back half of the year on lease rate growth, what you're seeing from a supply perspective? Or is there something specific in the fourth quarter that's causing that to reaccelerate?\nSean Breslin: Yes. I think for the most part, Austin, if you think back to Q4 of last year, we have a little bit softer comps when we get to Q4 of this year and that is in part producing the expectation for a slightly better revenue growth in Q4 as well as the continued activity in a couple of areas. One, from an operating initiative standpoint, continue to drive other rental revenue. We continue to push that and see that increasing sequentially as we move quarter-to-quarter. And then consistent with my last comment, we do expect bad debt in the second half of the year, potentially by Q4 to be a little bit better as compared to where we've been. So there's a few things that are contributing to it. But I would say the softer comp from last year is really the primary reason.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets.\nJohn Kim: Kevin, you mentioned that you expect same-store expense to rise, I think, in the third quarter to 6% before moderating back down again in the fourth quarter. Can you just explain that dynamic?\nKevin O'Shea: Sure. John, it's Kevin. Sean may want to jump in here a little bit. Essentially, what you've got going on in the second quarter, third quarter is a seasonal uptick in the number of the OpEx categories, particularly redecorating utilities and marketing expenses as well as a timing-related increase in nonroutine expenses. So what you're seeing, you're going through the second quarter, third quarter, essentially $0.09 sequential increase in OpEx in the same-store portfolio. And then in the fourth quarter, you see that reversal seasonally in the fourth quarter for Roper [ph] going to be the sort of a $0.07 sequential decline from the fourth quarter in OpEx. So that's a little bit of the background on that one.\nJohn Kim: And then I wanted to ask about build to rent. It looks like you have a new project in this category in Dallas. I was wondering how you look at this opportunity going forward and how you anticipate margins in the build-to-rent format versus multifamily?\nBenjamin Schall: John, I'll start with a couple of comments, and I appreciate you calling out that new project in Plano. The BTR space, when people talk about BTR. Significant portion of it is townhome development, and that's a product that we're very comfortable with, one we've developed historically, one in which we own, operate and develop today. So it's a product that we like the prospects of going forward, you think about demographics, population ships, you think about what's happening in the for-sale market. And so we've been active in the townhome space, I'd say, increasingly active over the last couple of years, and it's some places where we're building townhomes in conjunction with our apartment projects. . We actually have some town owned projects that we built that are full townhome projects. So this -- as we go forward, the Plano project sort of fits that type of growth and our growth in BTR, growth in townhome, you should expect to come through our similar channels of how we've been growing, which is some through our own development, some through funding of other developers, which is what this Plano project was as well as some potential acquisitions.\nJohn Kim: But as far as yields and operating margins, do you find it similar to multifamily?\nMatthew Birenbaum: John, it's Matt. Yes, very similar. I mean, again, these are communities where it's 150 homes in one location with a small amenity package, including a clubhouse and a pool and the operating margins are very comparable to multifamily communities that we would have in that region.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo.\nJamie Feldman: Great -- so I appreciate the color or the thoughts on the back half of the year in terms of your expected rent change renewals maybe to 4 to 1.5 [ph]. Can you talk more about by region, whether it's your major regions in the Northeast and the West or just kind of coastal versus Sunbelt, how you think that plays out? And then -- what -- how do you feel about visibility this time at this time this year versus this time last year? Clearly, we're heading into the slower season, but what feels different to you?\nSean Breslin: Yes. Jim, it's Sean. Why don't I take your second question first. Just from a macro perspective, I think we feel generally pretty good about the outlook that we provided. And I would say, just relative to last year, I mean, different things happening in terms of the general outlook, but I would say overall, each time we present our forecast, presumable we think is our realistic case for that forecast and the environment sort of dictates that. So I wouldn't say we're more or less confident this year than last year, per se, there's a lot of things that are happening out there that you could point to that you create concerns or you can create optimism, we try not to get caught up in that. As it relates to the outlook for the market, I'll try to keep it at a high level as opposed to going through all the regions, but we do expect continued outperformance across our established East Coast regions in the second half of the year relative to the Sunbelt and relative to the West Coast regions, generally speaking, with 1 exception potentially to be in Seattle, which has surprised -- I think most of us to the upside in the first half of the year and expect a solid growth in Seattle in the back half of the year. So without going through every region, I would think of it as East established, West established, followed by the expansion regions in terms of the latter of performance.\nJamie Feldman: Okay. And then thinking about the Dallas or the Plano asset, just -- how are you thinking about putting capital to work in development through infusions in [indiscernible] balance sheets versus on your own balance sheet? Is there something changing given rates are on their way down, it seems like the cycle people are getting more positive on late -- or late '25, '26 can look like? Do you think you pare back maybe some of these more capital infusion type investments versus just doing everything on balance sheet or keep the same mix?\nBenjamin Schall: Jamie, what I would call out as different going forward is we have, to a certain degree, institutionalized our programs are providing capital to third-party developers. And we think about that as additive to the external investment activity that we make through our own teams. As we look out over the next number of months and number of quarters, you can hear from us, we are incrementally more positive in and around the prospects on development. And we're excited for the DFP program because it potentially allows us to accelerate external investment activity, call it earlier in that development cycle.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Just one thing I'd add there, Jamie, just to be clear, whether we're doing it as an AvalonBay or DFP, they're both on balance sheet. We're both match funding them and they're being reported as consolidated communities. The only difference is that, in one case, our development and construction teams are actually executing on it. And in the other case, there's a third-party developer. But from a capitalization point of view, they are the same. .\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Kramer: Great. Just wondering where you guys are going out with renewals for August, December and maybe even October, if you have that?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Adam, it's Sean. We've mentioned that for August and September, renewals went out in the low 6s, which is the visibility that we have today.\nAdam Kramer: Got it. Helpful. And then just kind of a backward-looking basis, just thinking about kind of the cadence of particularly new and blended lease growth in May, June and July. Looks like a nice acceleration into June and then a little bit of a decel into July. Just wondering if you could kind of comment on kind of what happened, right? Was this kind of a typical seasonal pattern? Was this something different? Was this a pull forward of seasonality, just interested to kind of hear on a backwards [indiscernible] basis, what happened in the last few months.\nSean Breslin: Yes, Adam, it's Sean again. I mean I think the way it lays out is pretty consistent with historical seasonal patterns where you think about where you start the year in January, asking rents typically rise up through kind of early July, spending in the market, I'm kind of picking the average here, 6%, 7%, then you see a decelerate in the back half of the year, also consistent with seasonal norms. And so the acceleration that we saw was a combination of 2 things. One, the seasonal approach or seasonal factors. Second is just our overall revenue management approach. And what we saw early in the first quarter was better than anticipated occupancy, lower turnover. We hit the gas pretty hard as it related to asking rents. You saw that manifest itself in both renewals and new move-ins as we move through Q2. But as you see the seasonal peak in rents, and you try to make sure that you're maintaining stable occupancy, you start to see it begin to decelerate July, August time frame for the balance of the year. And so as you look at what happened, for example, from June to July, some markets were up a little bit, some markets were down a little bit. Overall, it was net down slightly 30 basis points from June to July, but it's not material in the whole scheme of things. But we would expect to see continued seasonal deceleration as we move through August all the way through the balance of the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Pawlowski with Green Street.\nJohn Pawlowski: Matt, a question for you on -- just to get a sense for how the economics of the development rights pipeline compared to the starts this year. So [indiscernible] and started an additional $1 billion of starts, how would yield compared to the 6.4% you're expecting for 2024 starts?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. John, it really is depending on the geography. So the next $1 billion versus starts, what are those yields going to look like, it does depend on where they are. So we're finding yields basically from here in the mid-Atlantic North to Boston, the suburban kind of medium density to lower density product mid- to high 6s to even pushing 7 or even a little bit north of 7 and some of our Jersey starts. What we're seeing in the expansion regions is yields kind of around 6%, low 6s. But again, cap rates are lower there as well. So that -- we still have that spread. And on the West Coast, it's hard to find deals that you can get a yield into the 6s which is why very little of the start activity is in those regions. So it would really depend on kind of the mix of business. And then the other thing I'd say is hard costs are moving, and you don't know how much until you actually bring the jobs to bid. So some of the acceleration that we're seeing this year is, frankly, because hard costs are coming in a little better than we thought. So those deals are starting to pencil a little better than we thought. So and we have more visibility into that on the jobs that are closer to start than the ones that aren't. So there are some deals that aren't going to be ready to start for another year or two, where based on the hard costs we looked at 12 months ago, they might be in the 5s, but based on our hard costs today, they might be in the 6s.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay, that's helpful. But there's nothing unique or maybe a stale land basis that you've seen the 6.4% yield on 2024 starts. Is there anything unique that's inflating the expected yields on this year starts?\nMatthew Birenbaum: No. In fact, if anything, it's the inverse. The newer deals we're signing up have a lower land basis that's more reflective of where today's market is.\nJohn Pawlowski: Okay. Great. Last question on acquisitions. Could you share the average cap rate on the 3 deals you acquired in recent months? And what's a reasonable base case of acquisition volume we should expect this year?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. So the 3 we bought so far, the cap rates around 5. And again, we sold the cap rate is just slightly north of that at 5.1. So that spread has actually come in some. I looked at last year that it was more about -- it was probably 40 basis points. So now that's one reason why we're looking to be more active because we feel like the trade is looking a little better. We are hoping to do at least another $300 million or so of acquisitions before the end of the year. We could certainly do more. We have more assets that we're going to bring to sale in the disposition market as well. So -- but it depends on if we find assets that we like.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJosh Dennerlein: I was looking over the ESG slide, and I noticed you highlighted like solar sites, your team has activated in 2023. Could you remind us of just your goal on that front? And then any of that income from those solar sites is included in that $80 million of incremental NOI from the operating model transformation? Or is that something else or in addition?\nBenjamin Schall: On the second part, Josh, that's a separate bucket of activity. So that's not in the operating model, $80 million target. It's part of an NOI enhancing pool that also has the sustainability benefits associated with it. And so when we talked at the Investor Day around our increased menu and opportunity set to be investing back into the portfolio in the 10% to 14% type of range. Those solar projects were a component of that.\nJosh Dennerlein: Okay. Okay. I appreciate that. And then I just want to follow up on Eric's first question on the seasonality of expenses. You mentioned 4Q is a lower quarter. Could you remind us like the cadence throughout the year? And if there's anything we need to like kind of watch out for on a go-forward basis?\nSean Breslin: I wouldn't -- I'm not sure anything to watch out for going forward. I mean, typically, and Kevin went through this earlier, but in terms of the sequence of OpEx, you do see a spike in the third quarter historically. And as Kevin noted, for this year, that spike from Q2 to Q3, about 1/3 of that's in utilities based on seasonal increases in energy and water and sewer and things like that, about 1/3 is in R&M seasonal increase in turnover, which is historically the case and some projects from the first half to the second half and then kind of nits and nats and then things slow down as you get into the fourth quarter. So I think that's normal. I think the pattern has changed materially. . What you should see going forward that would be different, and we have explained before, is that as it relates to the absolute level of OpEx growth, we have a number of things happening that will begin to dissipate in terms of the impact on the portfolio in 2025. So our OpEx guidance for the full year is the [indiscernible] that we identified, but there's about 160 basis points of unusual activity embedded in that, about 80 basis points from the burn off of various pilots, mainly for 21 days and then the net impact of the operating initiatives, primarily in utilities category with both telecom, Internet, things of that sort. So kind of the organic run rate is closer to 320 basis points for this year. And some of those elevated activities that I just mentioned will begin to dissipate as you get into 2025. So without providing specific guidance, there's a little bit more of a tailwind as we get into '25 related to those various categories, but the seasonal patterns won't really change if you think about it from quarter-to-quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith: Are you seeing any changes in resident behavior across markets? Or any sort of price sensitivity among your tenants?\nSean Breslin: Yes, Michael, it's Sean. In terms of sort of movement, if you want to describe it that way, nothing terribly substantial. The only thing that might be worth noting that has continued in Q2, we saw the same thing in Q1 is that in the tech markets, particularly in Northern California and Seattle, the percentage of new move-ins from a more distant location within that same region is a little bit elevated. So people that may have moved to second, third ring out or some rural locations during COVID over the last year, they have started to come back and closer. It wasn't like to move 1,500 miles away, but they moved 150 miles that type of thing. So that's the only thing of note as it relates to movement. And then your second question, just in terms of other resident behavior in terms of reasons for move-outs, the percentage of move-outs related to rent increase is above historical norms, not surprised just given the inflationary pressures we've seen across the economy over the last couple of years. But on the sort of flip side, you got to move out to buy a home is way below historical norms. And so renting is still the more affordable option, particularly in our markets where the spread between kind of medium-priced rent and medium price for home is equivalent to more than $2,000 a month is a big number in our established regions. Renting is still the most affordable alternatives. So people are potentially making different choices and other parts of their daily life. But that's the only thing of note.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. And my follow-up question is, it seems as though there's been a push for more supply in New Jersey, suburban markets. Is there a risk that similar supply growth could pop up in some of your other suburban markets?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Michael, it's Matt. It's an interesting question. For sure, in Jersey, the late -- the last round of Mount Laurel kind of affordable housing allocations was more aggressive than the prior 3 rounds, and we've been the beneficiary of that with an increase in very high-yielding development opportunities. But it is -- it does -- there will be more supply in some of those inland suburban markets than we've seen in the past. We haven't seen that Boston, by contrast, the 4B framework has been the same for the last 30 years. There's actually a lot of towns that are kind of at their 40 threshold now. So as Sean mentioned, the suburban supply in Boston is pretty muted and I would expect it to stay that way. Long Island is another place where they don't really have the ability to force supply on some of these recalcitrant jurisdictions. The governor tried and got her head handed to ourselves. So I would say Jersey is probably the biggest example. The one that people talk about a lot is California, where the state legislature is trying to do things that would push jurisdictions to approve more housing. What we've seen so far is those attempts haven't been as effective as I think the advocates had hoped because it's still really, really difficult to make the economics work in California. So I wouldn't -- I wouldn't be concerned that there's going to be a sudden onslaught of supply there anytime soon.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Goldfarb: Two questions. Just first, going back to the bad debt was really interesting that you guys presumably would have a higher, more affluent renter base and yet the bad debt remains elevated. It's certainly above like what MidAmerica was commenting on their call. And specifically, 2 markets that jump out are Metro New York, New Jersey and Mid-Atlantic with rival Southern Cal. So can you just give a sense of overall why your renter base, which assuming has pretty good jobs, one has higher delinquency. And then two, what's going on in Metro New York, New Jersey and Mid-Atlantic that's causing the delinquencies to be as high as they are.\nSean Breslin: Yes, Alex, this is Sean. Happy to take that one. In terms of trying to compare bad debt across companies, one, I'd say it's probably a little bit challenging just because we don't know everyone's policies and -- what I mean by that is everyone bills different amounts for different things. So when someone doesn't pay us, for example, we bill them for everything. We bill them for the rent, we bill them for the late fees, billing for utilities, there's lease break fees, there's legal cost. There are a lot of things that we bill for and through our customer care center, [indiscernible] we track it very carefully. So I don't know if everyone is the same or not, but differences in policies can impact what the level of bad debt is. So I don't know if there was the same or not, but no differences and policies can unpack. What's the level of bad debt side? it's hard to comment on specifically different customers. As it relates to the markets that you mentioned, yes, New York, New Jersey is an example. It's only 23% of the outstanding accounts that we have. but it punches way above its weight in terms of dollar value. So it's about 1/3 of the outstanding receivables that we have that we're trying to chase down. And the main issue there as you may know, from being there, is just the pace at which the courts are moving. It is the slowest jurisdiction by far in the country. And so we have almost 400 accounts out there in the greater New York Metro area, and a lot of them have been sitting out there for more than a year in terms of their current time sort of in the eviction process, which continues. So we continue to see faster movement in primarily in New York City, but it does extend to places like Long Island and Westchester. And then in the Mid-Atlantic, a lot of that is tied to accounts in the District of Columbia and Montgomery County, 2 areas that have also been slow and also have taken steps to try to give renters more time through free legal advice, delays in court cases and things of that sort. So there's sort of a combination of factors that have led to it where New York, New Jersey, the Mid-Atlantic and Southern [indiscernible] are kind of all in the general same range. And what we've seen some movement, we need to see faster processing and sort of the relaxation of some of these other supportive benefits to prospective extreme cases kind of dissipate to allow the process to continue to move So that's just because like John?\nAlexander Goldfarb: Yes. Second question is, on dispositions. Obviously, [indiscernible] jumped out given that you established a pretty good renter base there. But in looking over your Metro New York portfolio, you have a lot New Jersey, a lot Long Island and Connecticut, you really only down to 2, just New Canaan and Wilton, used to have Shelton, Stanford, a bunch of other markets. So is Connecticut just not a desirable market or you saw an opportunity where disposition IRRs were just way too good to pass up, and your intent is to rebulkup in Connecticut versus the New Jersey and Long Island.\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. Alex, it's Matt. No, it is -- we are almost complete with exiting the Connected market completely. You're right. If you go back, I think we probably sold 15 assets in Connecticut in the last 6 or 7 years. And once you're on that path to have a couple becomes very operationally inefficient. So you're right. I mean those -- the ones that [indiscernible] was among kind of the absolute most desirable of our Connecticut portfolio, but we've kind of made the decision that we're exiting that market. And so when you only have 2 or 3 assets left, it's kind of not worth it. .\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank.\nOmotayo Okusanya: I just wanted to ask a question on the regulatory front as you're kind of heading into the election cycle, if you're hearing anything at the state level and maybe some thoughts regarding the Biden proposal to have national rent control?\nSean Breslin: Yes, this is Sean. Happy to take that one. We [indiscernible] front, there's a lot of different things happening across different states. So without being specific, I would just say that the various associations that we're involved with and others are very active in engaging with the local political folks as it relates to what's happening, what's being proposed ballot initiatives, various things like that. So there's a lot of engagement there to manage that activity, most importantly, to educate people as it relates to the pros and cons of various policies. I think the trend we've seen, generally speaking, is that both political entities and individuals are sensitive to Matt's earlier point about doing things that will impact the future supply of housing in a negative way. And I think that's something that has been good for the industry over the last couple of years. . The topic of regulatory control might challenge, but we understand the policy and its impact is absolutely the wrong policy. And for that same reason, there is plenty of engagement not only with the advised administration, but the potential 2 candidates, particularly through the National Multi Housing Council and others as it relates to any kind of national policy, which likely putting a lot of teeth to it. First off, is the States, but just the harm [ph] as it relates to the supply of housing, which is actually what they're trying to solve for. So I think there's slightly a road map there for other policies to promote some housing in areas where it's needed. That is not direct control in nature [ph]. But obviously, can't predict exactly what people may talk about in an election environment.\nOmotayo Okusanya: That's helpful. And then if I may ask one more. In your expansion markets, are you seeing anything different just in regards to how the competition is kind of behaving in light of kind of supply deliveries. And I know we have kind of had the classic use of concessions, but anything unusual in regards to this business practices to kind of shore up their financials that you may be seeing?\nSean Breslin: Not necessarily. This is John again. I mean it's a typical concessions, 2 months, 3 months, depending on the lease term in the sort of hyper supplied market like part of Austin as an example, or maybe some of the Charlotte places like that, our field people with positive stuff like that, and nothing atypical from what you typically see in this kind of environment where there are pockets of supply commensurate impact on lease-ups.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rich Anderson with Wedbush.\nRichard Anderson: So in terms of your Sunbelt expansion, obviously, you're not getting any bargains there today. And if you're listening to MidAmerica call, things are trending in the right direction, at least eventually. Do you feel a sense of urgency to move more now than ever. And in part 2 of that same question is, can you characterize the nature of your sellers? And are you talking to any of the REITs in the cases where you are expanding through acquisitions?\nBenjamin Schall: Rich, this is Ben. I'll handle the first part, and Matt can talk to the seller dynamics. On the first part, and we think it is an opportune time to effectuate the trade. And Matt talked to earlier, sort of the upfront dilution has gotten pretty narrow as we think about selling older, slower growth assets out of our established regions and then reallocating that capital. The other part that comes to mind is I'm not a believer that, that window is closing. I think when you look at the supply dynamics that are going to continue to be a wait on operating fundamentals in a lot of those markets as well as that we're still a certain degree of the front wave of refinancing activity. I expect the window of opportunity to be with us for a while.\nMatthew Birenbaum: And Rich, in terms of who the sellers are -- what we're finding at least the assets we've been buying and then some of the others that we bid on and maybe haven't been successful. There's a lot of kind of institutional owners that are in funds where the funds are limited like vehicles, may be reaching the end of their 7- or 10-year fund life, and they're just in a position where -- and frankly, they're sitting on a lot of gains on those assets if they bought them back in '14, '15, '16, and even though not as much gain as what it would have been if they have sold it 2 years ago, they're still in a fine position. And so they're going to meet the market. Again, that's not the majority of the market, and that's why there's still plenty of assets that are not trading and sellers that are still holding out for yesterday's prices. But that's the typical buyer profile, it's usually a fund sponsor with institutional capital who's 3 funds later now, and they're closing out this one.\nRichard Anderson: But not your REIT [indiscernible] down there?\nMatthew Birenbaum: No, we have not -- we haven't [indiscernible] really anything that another REIT was selling.\nRichard Anderson: Okay. Second question. I think the townhome model is interesting when you consider millennials, building families and so on. Is that -- does that model work better in the expansion markets in general? Or is it sort of across the board sort of thinking in terms of that -- building out that product?\nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. It's an interesting question. It really does depend on the land economics. So you do see more of it in some of our expansion regions because land is cheaper there and the zoning is more flexible. So you're seeing a lot of it in North Carolina, we're seeing a lot of it in Texas, not so much in Southeast Florida because that looks a lot like the Northeast in terms of where rents are in land values and very little in California because again, kind of land values and -- the other key factor is what's the relative price of home versus the rent. And when you get into California where the homes are 7 figures, it just doesn't pay to build rental townhomes there. It does pay in some of these other regions, and those economics are a lot closer. .\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to Ben Schall for any closing remarks.\nBenjamin Schall: Thanks, everyone. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Kevin. Turning to Slide 10. Key portfolio indicators were strong during Q2, and we're off to a good start in Q3. In Chart 1, turnover remains well below historical norms in part supported by a lower level of move-outs to purchase a home. In Q2 specifically, turnover was down 600 basis points year-over-year or roughly 12% and was lower than last year in every region. Lower turnover supported relatively stable occupancy and drove higher rent change as we move through the quarter. Effective rent change increased from 3.2% in April to 4% in June before moderating into the high 3% range during July. As expected, our East Coast regions delivered the strongest rent change in Q2 of 4.2% and with our Mid-Atlantic portfolio leading the way of roughly 5.5%. Our Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland assets continue to demonstrate strong momentum, but the District of Columbia is still lagging due to weaker demand which is in part due to the federal government's return to the office policies and ongoing supply, which is projected to be roughly 4% of existing inventory this year before declining to approximately 2.5% in 2025. Our Boston portfolio, which represents high-quality assets and predominantly supply protected suburban submarkets produced rent change in the high 4s during the quarter. New supply in Boston has declined from the low 2% range a year ago to roughly 1.5% this year and is expected to decline to just above 1% next year for the urban supply projected to be substantially higher than suburban supply. Assuming a relatively static demand environment, the outlook for our suburban Boston portfolio remains quite positive. The Metro New York, New Jersey portfolio 2/3 of which is diversified across various suburban submarkets in Westchester, Long Island and Central and Northern New Jersey, delivered 4% rent change during the quarter. Recently, the strongest growth has occurred across the various submarkets in New York City, Northern New Jersey and Long Island. Some of the more distant locations in Central New Jersey have lag as employees increase their in-office Workday requirements in the city. The West Coast established regions produced rent change in the 3% range our Sudattle portfolio, which is primarily located in east side and north-end submarkets, led the way with 6% rent change during the quarter. While there are some pockets of new supply in select suburban submarkets, most notably Redmond, most of the new inventory is concentrated in urban submarkets and is not competitive with our portfolio. On the demand front, major employers like Microsoft and Amazon require more in-person work has supported the increased demand we've experienced throughout the first half of the year. Northern and Southern California lags Seattle with rent change in the mid-2% range. In Northern California, we had better momentum in San Francisco and San Jose, with 3.2% and 4% rent change, respectively, during Q2. However, the East Bay remains soft with the rent change of 50 basis points during the quarter. Given the supply is projected to be below 1% of stock across the major markets in Northern California for this year and next year. trends could continue to improve in the near future to the extent we realize a modestly stronger level of demand. Moving down to Southern California. Orange County produced the strongest rent change at 4.2%, followed by San Diego roughly 3% and L.A. in the 2% range. Orange County and San Diego have been healthy markets year-to-date, but performance across the various submarkets in L.A. has been choppy and highly correlated with the volume of inventory returning to the submarket from nonpaying residents. As it relates to bad debt, which is depicted in Chart 4 on Slide 10, while we're encouraged with the year-to-date trends in underlying bad debt across our same-store portfolio, results were choppy during the second quarter. We're still expecting bad debt to average roughly 1.7% for the full year 2024 at approximately 60 basis point improvement from 2023. As we've stated previously, prepandemic bad debt for our portfolio was 50 to 70 basis points. So to the extent we reach that level, we realized an incremental $25 million in revenue or more over the next several quarters. Transitioning to Slide 11 to address our updated revenue outlook for the year. We now expect same-store revenue growth of 3.5% for 2024, an increase of 40 basis points from our most recent outlook. The increased outlook is primarily driven by stronger lease rates as lower turnover and stronger occupancy in the first half of the year allowed us to achieve higher rental rates than originally anticipated, a trend we expect to continue. We now expect like term effective rent change in the 3% range for the full year 2024, up roughly 100 basis points from the 2% level we expected at the beginning of the year. We realized 3% rent change in the first half of the year and expect to produce similar performance in the second half. We've seen rent change begin to moderate to start the third quarter and consistent with seasonal norms expected to decelerate through the back half of the year. We expect renewals in the mid-4% range for the balance of the year, while new move-ins averaged roughly 1.5%. The near-term outlook for lease renewals remains healthy with offers in the low 6% range for August and September. Moving to Slide 12. You can see where we're projecting stronger revenue performance relative to our prior outlook. In our established regions, we're expecting substantially stronger growth in New England, the Mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northwest. We we're expecting modestly better growth in New York, New Jersey and almost no change in Northern and Southern California. In our expansion regions, Denver and Southeast Florida are expected to perform slightly better than we originally anticipated, but our other expansion regions of Dallas and Charlotte are expected to be weaker primarily as a result of the continued challenging levels of new supply in those markets. And then finishing on Slide 13, we're on track to realize roughly $10 million of incremental NOI from our operating initiatives in 2024. You can see those results in our same-store portfolio in 2 areas: first, the expected contribution from other rental revenue, which is projected to increase by 14% year-over-year; and second, highly constrained payroll costs, which have declined year-to-date and are expected to grow at roughly 1% for 2024, which is well below the average merit increase of approximately 4% and is related to a reduction in the number of on-site positions. These reductions relate to the enhanced efficiency of our teams, which is supported by our digital efforts and enabled by our new labor strategy. From a broader perspective, we're on track with the Horizon 1 and 2 financial objectives we communicated during our Investor Day last year, which reflect generating an incremental $80 million NOI from our portfolio. At year-end 2024, we expect to have achieved roughly $37 million of that $80 million and look forward to producing the balance of it over the next few years. We'll continue to keep you informed about our efforts and achievements as we innovate further in the future. Now I'll turn it over to Matt to address recently set performance, development starts and capital recycling activities. Matt? Yes, Eric, it's Sean. Yes, I mean, overall, what I'd say is you sit back and look at it relative to what we've seen in the last couple of years, things are absolutely trending in the right direction, right? So it's 2.3% last year. We're looking in terms of underlying bad debt. We're expecting that to decline down into the roughly 1.7% range for 2024. So it's moved in the right direction. Each month, each quarter it can be a little bit bumpy based on underlying activity. But I think we're trending in the right direction. We've not provided a precise forecast as to when we would expect it to get back to normal levels just based on the underlying activity that has to manifest itself in actually happening, which relates to court cases and various things like that. So we'll certainly provide our best insight as we turn the quarter towards 2025, but you feel good about the overall change from '23 to '24 at this point in time. Yes, Austin, it's Sean. Given where we sit here with kind of half the year left to go, it wouldn't be appropriate to make comments as it relates to what we think the earnings going to be in January. But you can sort of do some math based on rent change last year versus this year and try to reach your own conclusion on that. Yes. I think for the most part, Austin, if you think back to Q4 of last year, we have a little bit softer comps when we get to Q4 of this year and that is in part producing the expectation for a slightly better revenue growth in Q4 as well as the continued activity in a couple of areas. One, from an operating initiative standpoint, continue to drive other rental revenue. We continue to push that and see that increasing sequentially as we move quarter-to-quarter. And then consistent with my last comment, we do expect bad debt in the second half of the year, potentially by Q4 to be a little bit better as compared to where we've been. So there's a few things that are contributing to it. But I would say the softer comp from last year is really the primary reason. Yes. Jim, it's Sean. Why don't I take your second question first. Just from a macro perspective, I think we feel generally pretty good about the outlook that we provided. And I would say, just relative to last year, I mean, different things happening in terms of the general outlook, but I would say overall, each time we present our forecast, presumable we think is our realistic case for that forecast and the environment sort of dictates that. So I wouldn't say we're more or less confident this year than last year, per se, there's a lot of things that are happening out there that you could point to that you create concerns or you can create optimism, we try not to get caught up in that. As it relates to the outlook for the market, I'll try to keep it at a high level as opposed to going through all the regions, but we do expect continued outperformance across our established East Coast regions in the second half of the year relative to the Sunbelt and relative to the West Coast regions, generally speaking, with 1 exception potentially to be in Seattle, which has surprised -- I think most of us to the upside in the first half of the year and expect a solid growth in Seattle in the back half of the year. So without going through every region, I would think of it as East established, West established, followed by the expansion regions in terms of the latter of performance. Yes, Adam, it's Sean. We've mentioned that for August and September, renewals went out in the low 6s, which is the visibility that we have today. Yes, Adam, it's Sean again. I mean I think the way it lays out is pretty consistent with historical seasonal patterns where you think about where you start the year in January, asking rents typically rise up through kind of early July, spending in the market, I'm kind of picking the average here, 6%, 7%, then you see a decelerate in the back half of the year, also consistent with seasonal norms. And so the acceleration that we saw was a combination of 2 things. One, the seasonal approach or seasonal factors. Second is just our overall revenue management approach. And what we saw early in the first quarter was better than anticipated occupancy, lower turnover. We hit the gas pretty hard as it related to asking rents. You saw that manifest itself in both renewals and new move-ins as we move through Q2. But as you see the seasonal peak in rents, and you try to make sure that you're maintaining stable occupancy, you start to see it begin to decelerate July, August time frame for the balance of the year. And so as you look at what happened, for example, from June to July, some markets were up a little bit, some markets were down a little bit. Overall, it was net down slightly 30 basis points from June to July, but it's not material in the whole scheme of things. But we would expect to see continued seasonal deceleration as we move through August all the way through the balance of the year. I wouldn't -- I'm not sure anything to watch out for going forward. I mean, typically, and Kevin went through this earlier, but in terms of the sequence of OpEx, you do see a spike in the third quarter historically. And as Kevin noted, for this year, that spike from Q2 to Q3, about 1/3 of that's in utilities based on seasonal increases in energy and water and sewer and things like that, about 1/3 is in R&M seasonal increase in turnover, which is historically the case and some projects from the first half to the second half and then kind of nits and nats and then things slow down as you get into the fourth quarter. So I think that's normal. I think the pattern has changed materially. . What you should see going forward that would be different, and we have explained before, is that as it relates to the absolute level of OpEx growth, we have a number of things happening that will begin to dissipate in terms of the impact on the portfolio in 2025. So our OpEx guidance for the full year is the [indiscernible] that we identified, but there's about 160 basis points of unusual activity embedded in that, about 80 basis points from the burn off of various pilots, mainly for 21 days and then the net impact of the operating initiatives, primarily in utilities category with both telecom, Internet, things of that sort. So kind of the organic run rate is closer to 320 basis points for this year. And some of those elevated activities that I just mentioned will begin to dissipate as you get into 2025. So without providing specific guidance, there's a little bit more of a tailwind as we get into '25 related to those various categories, but the seasonal patterns won't really change if you think about it from quarter-to-quarter. Yes, Michael, it's Sean. In terms of sort of movement, if you want to describe it that way, nothing terribly substantial. The only thing that might be worth noting that has continued in Q2, we saw the same thing in Q1 is that in the tech markets, particularly in Northern California and Seattle, the percentage of new move-ins from a more distant location within that same region is a little bit elevated. So people that may have moved to second, third ring out or some rural locations during COVID over the last year, they have started to come back and closer. It wasn't like to move 1,500 miles away, but they moved 150 miles that type of thing. So that's the only thing of note as it relates to movement. And then your second question, just in terms of other resident behavior in terms of reasons for move-outs, the percentage of move-outs related to rent increase is above historical norms, not surprised just given the inflationary pressures we've seen across the economy over the last couple of years. But on the sort of flip side, you got to move out to buy a home is way below historical norms. And so renting is still the more affordable option, particularly in our markets where the spread between kind of medium-priced rent and medium price for home is equivalent to more than $2,000 a month is a big number in our established regions. Renting is still the most affordable alternatives. So people are potentially making different choices and other parts of their daily life. But that's the only thing of note. Yes, Alex, this is Sean. Happy to take that one. In terms of trying to compare bad debt across companies, one, I'd say it's probably a little bit challenging just because we don't know everyone's policies and -- what I mean by that is everyone bills different amounts for different things. So when someone doesn't pay us, for example, we bill them for everything. We bill them for the rent, we bill them for the late fees, billing for utilities, there's lease break fees, there's legal cost. There are a lot of things that we bill for and through our customer care center, [indiscernible] we track it very carefully. So I don't know if everyone is the same or not, but differences in policies can impact what the level of bad debt is. So I don't know if there was the same or not, but no differences and policies can unpack. What's the level of bad debt side? it's hard to comment on specifically different customers. As it relates to the markets that you mentioned, yes, New York, New Jersey is an example. It's only 23% of the outstanding accounts that we have. but it punches way above its weight in terms of dollar value. So it's about 1/3 of the outstanding receivables that we have that we're trying to chase down. And the main issue there as you may know, from being there, is just the pace at which the courts are moving. It is the slowest jurisdiction by far in the country. And so we have almost 400 accounts out there in the greater New York Metro area, and a lot of them have been sitting out there for more than a year in terms of their current time sort of in the eviction process, which continues. So we continue to see faster movement in primarily in New York City, but it does extend to places like Long Island and Westchester. And then in the Mid-Atlantic, a lot of that is tied to accounts in the District of Columbia and Montgomery County, 2 areas that have also been slow and also have taken steps to try to give renters more time through free legal advice, delays in court cases and things of that sort. So there's sort of a combination of factors that have led to it where New York, New Jersey, the Mid-Atlantic and Southern [indiscernible] are kind of all in the general same range. And what we've seen some movement, we need to see faster processing and sort of the relaxation of some of these other supportive benefits to prospective extreme cases kind of dissipate to allow the process to continue to move So that's just because like John? Yes, this is Sean. Happy to take that one. We [indiscernible] front, there's a lot of different things happening across different states. So without being specific, I would just say that the various associations that we're involved with and others are very active in engaging with the local political folks as it relates to what's happening, what's being proposed ballot initiatives, various things like that. So there's a lot of engagement there to manage that activity, most importantly, to educate people as it relates to the pros and cons of various policies. I think the trend we've seen, generally speaking, is that both political entities and individuals are sensitive to Matt's earlier point about doing things that will impact the future supply of housing in a negative way. And I think that's something that has been good for the industry over the last couple of years. . The topic of regulatory control might challenge, but we understand the policy and its impact is absolutely the wrong policy. And for that same reason, there is plenty of engagement not only with the advised administration, but the potential 2 candidates, particularly through the National Multi Housing Council and others as it relates to any kind of national policy, which likely putting a lot of teeth to it. First off, is the States, but just the harm [ph] as it relates to the supply of housing, which is actually what they're trying to solve for. So I think there's slightly a road map there for other policies to promote some housing in areas where it's needed. That is not direct control in nature [ph]. But obviously, can't predict exactly what people may talk about in an election environment. Not necessarily. This is John again. I mean it's a typical concessions, 2 months, 3 months, depending on the lease term in the sort of hyper supplied market like part of Austin as an example, or maybe some of the Charlotte places like that, our field people with positive stuff like that, and nothing atypical from what you typically see in this kind of environment where there are pockets of supply commensurate impact on lease-ups."

            "name": "Matthew Birenbaum",
            "content": "All right. Great. Thanks, Sean. Turning to our development communities. You can see Slide 14 details the continued impressive results being generated by our lease-ups. The 6 development communities that had active leasing in the second quarter are delivering rents $320 per month or 11% above our initial underwriting, which is translating into a 40 basis points increase in yield. And this performance is being supported by strong leasing velocity with these assets averaging 37 net leases per month which was an all-time company record driving our increased guidance for lease-up NOI for the year by roughly $4 million. On the strength of these results and with the transaction market providing more insight into current asset values, we are also increasing our projected development start volume for the year, as shown on Slide 15. We now expect to break ground on 9 new communities this year for a total projected capital cost of $1.05 billion with the vast majority of these starts in either expansion regions or the Northeast and almost exclusively in suburban submarkets. Three of these starts occurred in the second quarter, with most of the others expected in Q3. Based on today's rents, operating expenses and construction costs, these developments are underwriting to a projected yield of 6.4%, generating our target spread of 100 to 150 basis points over current cap rates and we control a total development rights pipeline of roughly $4.5 billion, providing plenty of opportunities for future profitable growth in years to come. Turning to Slide 16. After several quarters, which were quiet, we have also been active in the transaction market recently, closing on 5 dispositions since our last call for aggregate sales proceeds of $515 million. All of these dispositions were in our established coastal regions and they priced at a weighted average cap rate of 5.1%, reflecting an average price per home of $475,000. 3 of the 5 sales were also in urban submarkets where we are seeing better investor interest after several years where these locations were heavily out of favor with institutional capital. We've reinvested a bit less than half of this capital so far into 3 acquisitions in our expansion regions at an average price per home of $260,000 as we are starting to find attractive opportunities to buy the low replacement cost in submarkets and assets that we like. Our asset trading activity continues to move us closer to our long-term portfolio allocation goals of having 25% of our portfolio and expansion regions and 80% in suburban submarkets. We will look to redeploy more of those proceeds before the end of the year as well as bring several additional assets to market as we continue to focus on optimizing our portfolio as we grow. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ben. John, it's Matt. Yes, very similar. I mean, again, these are communities where it's 150 homes in one location with a small amenity package, including a clubhouse and a pool and the operating margins are very comparable to multifamily communities that we would have in that region. Just one thing I'd add there, Jamie, just to be clear, whether we're doing it as an AvalonBay or DFP, they're both on balance sheet. We're both match funding them and they're being reported as consolidated communities. The only difference is that, in one case, our development and construction teams are actually executing on it. And in the other case, there's a third-party developer. But from a capitalization point of view, they are the same. . Yes. John, it really is depending on the geography. So the next $1 billion versus starts, what are those yields going to look like, it does depend on where they are. So we're finding yields basically from here in the mid-Atlantic North to Boston, the suburban kind of medium density to lower density product mid- to high 6s to even pushing 7 or even a little bit north of 7 and some of our Jersey starts. What we're seeing in the expansion regions is yields kind of around 6%, low 6s. But again, cap rates are lower there as well. So that -- we still have that spread. And on the West Coast, it's hard to find deals that you can get a yield into the 6s which is why very little of the start activity is in those regions. So it would really depend on kind of the mix of business. And then the other thing I'd say is hard costs are moving, and you don't know how much until you actually bring the jobs to bid. So some of the acceleration that we're seeing this year is, frankly, because hard costs are coming in a little better than we thought. So those deals are starting to pencil a little better than we thought. So and we have more visibility into that on the jobs that are closer to start than the ones that aren't. So there are some deals that aren't going to be ready to start for another year or two, where based on the hard costs we looked at 12 months ago, they might be in the 5s, but based on our hard costs today, they might be in the 6s. No. In fact, if anything, it's the inverse. The newer deals we're signing up have a lower land basis that's more reflective of where today's market is. Yes. So the 3 we bought so far, the cap rates around 5. And again, we sold the cap rate is just slightly north of that at 5.1. So that spread has actually come in some. I looked at last year that it was more about -- it was probably 40 basis points. So now that's one reason why we're looking to be more active because we feel like the trade is looking a little better. We are hoping to do at least another $300 million or so of acquisitions before the end of the year. We could certainly do more. We have more assets that we're going to bring to sale in the disposition market as well. So -- but it depends on if we find assets that we like. Michael, it's Matt. It's an interesting question. For sure, in Jersey, the late -- the last round of Mount Laurel kind of affordable housing allocations was more aggressive than the prior 3 rounds, and we've been the beneficiary of that with an increase in very high-yielding development opportunities. But it is -- it does -- there will be more supply in some of those inland suburban markets than we've seen in the past. We haven't seen that Boston, by contrast, the 4B framework has been the same for the last 30 years. There's actually a lot of towns that are kind of at their 40 threshold now. So as Sean mentioned, the suburban supply in Boston is pretty muted and I would expect it to stay that way. Long Island is another place where they don't really have the ability to force supply on some of these recalcitrant jurisdictions. The governor tried and got her head handed to ourselves. So I would say Jersey is probably the biggest example. The one that people talk about a lot is California, where the state legislature is trying to do things that would push jurisdictions to approve more housing. What we've seen so far is those attempts haven't been as effective as I think the advocates had hoped because it's still really, really difficult to make the economics work in California. So I wouldn't -- I wouldn't be concerned that there's going to be a sudden onslaught of supply there anytime soon. Yes. Alex, it's Matt. No, it is -- we are almost complete with exiting the Connected market completely. You're right. If you go back, I think we probably sold 15 assets in Connecticut in the last 6 or 7 years. And once you're on that path to have a couple becomes very operationally inefficient. So you're right. I mean those -- the ones that [indiscernible] was among kind of the absolute most desirable of our Connecticut portfolio, but we've kind of made the decision that we're exiting that market. And so when you only have 2 or 3 assets left, it's kind of not worth it. . And Rich, in terms of who the sellers are -- what we're finding at least the assets we've been buying and then some of the others that we bid on and maybe haven't been successful. There's a lot of kind of institutional owners that are in funds where the funds are limited like vehicles, may be reaching the end of their 7- or 10-year fund life, and they're just in a position where -- and frankly, they're sitting on a lot of gains on those assets if they bought them back in '14, '15, '16, and even though not as much gain as what it would have been if they have sold it 2 years ago, they're still in a fine position. And so they're going to meet the market. Again, that's not the majority of the market, and that's why there's still plenty of assets that are not trading and sellers that are still holding out for yesterday's prices. But that's the typical buyer profile, it's usually a fund sponsor with institutional capital who's 3 funds later now, and they're closing out this one. No, we have not -- we haven't [indiscernible] really anything that another REIT was selling. Yes. It's an interesting question. It really does depend on the land economics. So you do see more of it in some of our expansion regions because land is cheaper there and the zoning is more flexible. So you're seeing a lot of it in North Carolina, we're seeing a lot of it in Texas, not so much in Southeast Florida because that looks a lot like the Northeast in terms of where rents are in land values and very little in California because again, kind of land values and -- the other key factor is what's the relative price of home versus the rent. And when you get into California where the homes are 7 figures, it just doesn't pay to build rental townhomes there. It does pay in some of these other regions, and those economics are a lot closer. ."

            "name": "Benjamin Schall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm here with Kevin O'Shea, our Chief Financial Officer; Sean Breslin, our Chief Operating Officer; and Matt Birenbaum, our Chief Investment Officer. I will start by emphasizing a number of key themes that are top of mind and that we believe are important drivers of our continued outperformance and then turn it to Kevin, Sean and Matt to go deeper. . As usual, we will reference our investor presentation, starting on Page 4 as we proceed through our prepared remarks. Our operating momentum continued in the second quarter with us exceeding revenue expectations and also successfully managing operating expenses lower. Based on this momentum, we further raised our guidance for the year and are projecting sector-leading full year core FFO and same-store revenue growth among our closest peers. Our operating momentum through the first half of the year has been driven by better-than-expected demand with our core renter, the knowledge-based worker in a relatively strong position right now. Sectors of the economy that encompass our core customer are at effectively full employment with stable job and income prospects. We also continue to benefit from customers' strong tilt towards renting versus buying a home, given the lack of for-sale inventory and unaffordability. And finally, as expected, we continue to benefit from the low levels of new supply in our suburban coastal markets, a dynamic that should continue to benefit our portfolio versus most of the rest of the sector for another 12 to 18 months at least. Our strong internal growth is also being fueled by our continued progress with our operating model transformation. As we detailed at our Investor Day last November, our collective set of initiatives, from investment -- from our investments in technology and centralization to our reimagined operating neighborhoods are driving meaningful operating efficiencies and allowing us to drive healthy increases in ancillary revenue streams. We're on track with these operating initiatives for 2024 with a strong runway of future earnings growth ahead of us. Importantly, we're also increasingly tapping these operating capabilities to drive outsized yields and returns on new developments and acquisitions. Further to that point, our platform is uniquely positioned to continue to drive incremental earnings growth and value creation from our external investment activity. Our developments underway continue to outperform. During the quarter, we completed 3 new development communities at an impressive initial stabilized yield of 7.7% as noted on Slide 5. We are also incrementally more optimistic about new development adding 2 new -- adding 2 additional developments to this year's starts for a total just north of $1 billion. We're underwriting mid-6% yields on this set of new projects well within our strike zone of having 100 to 150 basis points of spread relative to market cap rates and our cost of borrowing. And as the final differentiator that I'll highlight upfront, we continue to actively reposition our portfolio for superior longer-term growth, heading from 70% suburban to 80% and 8% of our portfolio in our expansion regions to 25%. We believe we are now moving into a more attractive environment to execute on this repositioning, particularly with the froth in rents and cap rates off in our Sun Belt expansion regions. We're also tailing our portfolio in our expansion markets with lower density and lower price point assets at an attractive basis. At the bottom of Page 5, $500 million of the $900 million of capital raised year-to-date has been from asset sales at an average cap rate of 5.1%, which we are then reallocating into acquisitions in our expansion markets. The remaining $400 million was our prior unsecured debt deal with an effective rate of 5.05%, including the benefits of swaps we had in place, highlighting our relative cost of capital advantage. Before turning it to Kevin to discuss our updated guidance, let me touch on a couple of the details of our Q2 results. Page 6 provides the detail of our $0.09 core FFO outperformance in Q2, broken down by category. And please take note that $0.02 of this $0.09 outperformance was timing-related and costs we expect to incur in the second half of the year. Slide 7 Zoom's closer in on our Q2 revenue outperformance with better-than-expected outcomes on lease rates, occupancy and other rental revenue, partially offset by bad debt staying more elevated than we had hoped. Other than bad debt, our revenue momentum was strong, which is a nice segue to Kevin to discuss our updated and increased guidance for the year. Kevin? Thanks, Matt. I'll wrap up on Slide 17 with the highlights from our recent ESG report. Our efforts on sustainability are led by Katie Rotenberg and her team but it is a full commitment across the entire organization that enables us to continue to make meaningful progress on these collective initiatives, from reducing our operating costs and environmental impact to making ABB more inclusive and diverse and to all of the time invested via volunteering by our local teams, a huge thanks to all AvalonBay associates. And with that, I'll turn the call to the operator to facilitate questions. . John, I'll start with a couple of comments, and I appreciate you calling out that new project in Plano. The BTR space, when people talk about BTR. Significant portion of it is townhome development, and that's a product that we're very comfortable with, one we've developed historically, one in which we own, operate and develop today. So it's a product that we like the prospects of going forward, you think about demographics, population ships, you think about what's happening in the for-sale market. And so we've been active in the townhome space, I'd say, increasingly active over the last couple of years, and it's some places where we're building townhomes in conjunction with our apartment projects. . We actually have some town owned projects that we built that are full townhome projects. So this -- as we go forward, the Plano project sort of fits that type of growth and our growth in BTR, growth in townhome, you should expect to come through our similar channels of how we've been growing, which is some through our own development, some through funding of other developers, which is what this Plano project was as well as some potential acquisitions. Jamie, what I would call out as different going forward is we have, to a certain degree, institutionalized our programs are providing capital to third-party developers. And we think about that as additive to the external investment activity that we make through our own teams. As we look out over the next number of months and number of quarters, you can hear from us, we are incrementally more positive in and around the prospects on development. And we're excited for the DFP program because it potentially allows us to accelerate external investment activity, call it earlier in that development cycle. On the second part, Josh, that's a separate bucket of activity. So that's not in the operating model, $80 million target. It's part of an NOI enhancing pool that also has the sustainability benefits associated with it. And so when we talked at the Investor Day around our increased menu and opportunity set to be investing back into the portfolio in the 10% to 14% type of range. Those solar projects were a component of that. Rich, this is Ben. I'll handle the first part, and Matt can talk to the seller dynamics. On the first part, and we think it is an opportune time to effectuate the trade. And Matt talked to earlier, sort of the upfront dilution has gotten pretty narrow as we think about selling older, slower growth assets out of our established regions and then reallocating that capital. The other part that comes to mind is I'm not a believer that, that window is closing. I think when you look at the supply dynamics that are going to continue to be a wait on operating fundamentals in a lot of those markets as well as that we're still a certain degree of the front wave of refinancing activity. I expect the window of opportunity to be with us for a while. Thanks, everyone. Thanks for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you soon."

            "name": "Kevin O'Shea",
            "content": "Turning to Slide 7. You will see our updated 2024 full year financial and operating outlook. Based on our performance to date and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are raising our projection for full year core FFO per share by $0.11 to $11.02 per share. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of 3.7%, which is a healthy 100 basis point increase relative to our outlook in April and a 220 basis point increase relative to our January outlook. We're also favorably adjusting our expectations for full year same-store revenue, operating expense and NOI growth. We now expect revenue growth of 3.5% and same-store NOI growth of 2.9% in 2024, which are favorable increases of 40 basis points and 80 basis points, respectively, relative to our prior outlook in April. Lastly, our midyear forecast includes a strong increase in new development starts of nearly $200 million to just over $1 billion of new starts in 2024. Matt will provide additional details on this activity in a few moments. Slide 8 highlights the drivers of the $0.11 increase to our full year projected core FFO per share midpoint relative to our April outlook. Encouragingly and importantly, strong performance within the same-store portfolio is driving most of the increase. In addition, we are benefiting from outperformance at our lease-up communities. These amounts are partially offset by other items, including minor adjustments in capital markets activity and overhead. Slide 9 provides a road map from our second quarter core FFO per share to our third quarter projected core FFO per share midpoint. Looking at the components of the sequential quarterly change, we expect revenue growth from the same-store portfolio and NOI contributions from lease activity and other stabilized communities to drive $0.08 of sequential core FFO per share growth. These contributions will be affected by a combination of higher same-store operating expense growth in the third quarter, which we expect will increase about 6% on a year-over-year basis. Adjustments in capital markets and transaction market activities which are primarily driven by recent net disposition activity in the last month, consistent with our sell first and buy later transaction strategy and by adjustments in overhead expenses. In the fourth quarter, we expect reduced same-store operating expense growth. And for full year 2024, we now expect same-store operating expense growth of 4.8%, which is a 60 basis point decrease from our last quarter outlook and an 80 basis point decrease from our January outlook. Based on our performance to date, and our projected core FFO per share midpoint for the third quarter, the implied projected core FFO per share midpoint for the fourth quarter is $2.84 per share. Notably, this strong sequential growth in Q4 is primarily driven by our growth from our same-store portfolio and our lease-up communities during the fourth quarter. I will now turn the call over to Sean. Yes, Eric, this is Kevin. I'll take a crack at this one. Others may want to jump in. We weren't trying to signal anything about '25 in terms of our guidance yet. It's a little bit early at this point in the year to do that. Rather recently noting that the fourth quarter would be expected to have a sequential increase in earnings to get from that third quarter to midpoint core FFO per share guidance of $2.71 to the implied midpoint in the fourth quarter of $2.84. That 13% pickup is primarily driven by sequential growth from 3Q to the fourth quarter in the same-store portfolio. Much of it is a seasonal decline in operating expenses, but some of it is a sequential continued increase in same-store revenue item of business annual trends that Sean alluded to in his remarks as well some other adjustments. So that was really all we're trying to signal and road map to investors is the growth from 3Q to 4Q and the components and the sources of that being kind of coming primarily from same-store as well as continued growth from our lease-up portfolio as well. Sure. John, it's Kevin. Sean may want to jump in here a little bit. Essentially, what you've got going on in the second quarter, third quarter is a seasonal uptick in the number of the OpEx categories, particularly redecorating utilities and marketing expenses as well as a timing-related increase in nonroutine expenses. So what you're seeing, you're going through the second quarter, third quarter, essentially $0.09 sequential increase in OpEx in the same-store portfolio. And then in the fourth quarter, you see that reversal seasonally in the fourth quarter for Roper [ph] going to be the sort of a $0.07 sequential decline from the fourth quarter in OpEx. So that's a little bit of the background on that one."

Ben? \nBenjamin Schall: Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined by Sean Breslin, our Chief Operating Officer; Matt Birenbaum, our Chief Investment Officer; and Kevin O'Shea, our Chief Financial Officer. Sean will speak to our operating outperformance year-to-date and our positive momentum as we enter the prime leasing season. Matt will discuss the continued outperformance of our developments and lease-up and how we are strategically deploying capital to generate value. And Kevin is here for questions and is more than happy to speak to our preeminent balance sheet and liquidity profile. \n Utilizing our earnings presentation. Slide 4 provides the highlights for the quarter and identify these key themes as we look ahead. First and foremost, we are off to a strong start to 2024 with first quarter results outpacing expectations. We were able to build occupancy earlier than expected, and we also experienced meaningful improvements in bad debt in February and March. \n Second, we feel well positioned as we enter the peak leasing season, given low turnover, solid occupancy and positive rental rate momentum. We also expect our suburban coastal footprint to continue to outperform, given steady and improved demand drivers and [indiscernible] delivering in our markets versus the rest of the country. \n Given our first quarter outperformance, applications for Q2 and improvement in underlying trends, we have increased our full year guidance. We also remain laser-focused on executing on our strategic initiatives, including our operating model transformation. We remain on track here to deliver $80 million incremental annual NOI uplift from our operating [indiscernible], a target we raised from $55 million at our Investor Day in November. \n And finally, with one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, we are focused on growth opportunities in which we can tap our strategic capabilities from our operating prowess to our development strength to drive outsized returns for shareholders. With that summary, let me go a layer deeper on our results, the wider supply and demand backdrop and our increase to guidance. \n For the quarter, as shown on Slide 5, we produced core FFO growth of 5.1%, which was 350 basis points above our prior outlook. Same-store revenue growth increased 4.2% and 90 basis points better than our prior outlook. And our developments and lease-up are seeing strong absorption and achieving rents and returns above pro forma. \n Slide 6 shows the components of the Q1 core FFO outperformance with the bulk of the increase coming from higher same-store NOI. Revenues exceeded our prior outlook by $0.04. Expenses in the first quarter were $0.03 better than expected, while we note that $0.02 of this $0.03 is estimated to be timing related or in other words, expenses we still expect to incur just later in the year than we had originally forecast. \n Turning to Slide 7. Demand for our portfolio is benefiting from more job growth than originally forecasted. For our job growth estimates, we look to the National Association of Business Economics, or NABE, which has now increased its estimate to 1.6 million new jobs in 2024, up from the prior estimate of 700,000 jobs. This better job outlook provides an incremental list of demand, not necessarily on the same trajectory as it may have in the past, given that a disproportionate share of these additional jobs may be part-time and seem to be more concentrated in lower-paying sectors of the economy. \n As shown on the right-hand side of Slide 7, demand for [indiscernible] also continues to benefit from the differential in the cost of owning a home versus renting. This is true across most of the country but particularly pronounced in our markets, given the level of home prices, resulting in it being more than $2,000 per month more expensive to own versus rent a home. And this differential translates into record low numbers of residents leaving us to buy a home. \n Turning to supply on Slide 8. As we emphasized at our Investor Day, our suburban coastal portfolio, 71% suburban today and headed towards 80% suburban, faces significantly less new supply than many of our peers. In our established regions, deliveries will be 1.5% of stock this year and in line with historical averages. \n In the Sunbelt, by contrast, deliveries will be 3.8% of stock in 2024, significantly above historical averages. And with the lease-up of a typical project taking an additional 12 to 18 months, the pressure on rents and occupancy in the Sunbelt will last, at least, through the end of 2025, if not into 2026. \n This weaker operating performance in the Sunbelt is, in turn, starting to weigh on asset values there, which provides a more attractive opportunity for us to acquire assets below replacement costs as we continue on our journey of growing our expansion market portfolio from 8% today to our 25% target. With the supply demand backdrop and our outperformance year-to-date, we are increasing our full year core FFO guidance estimate to $10.91 per share for a 2.6% increase relative to 2023. \n With the detail on Slides 9 and 10, the bulk of the increase is in higher NOI driven mainly by higher revenue with same-store revenue growth now projected to be 3.1%, up from 2.6% in our original outlook. \n Before turning it to Sean, I'd also like to take a moment to thank the team and the wider AvalonBay associate base, who continue to execute at a high level and above plan. It is energizing to see the organization executing on the priorities that we detailed at our Investor Day, a collective set of initiatives that we are confident will deliver superior growth in the near term and in the years ahead. \n And with that, I'll turn it to Sean to go deeper and provide his perspectives. \nSean Breslin: All right. Thanks, Ben. Turning to Slide 11. The primary drivers of our 90 basis points of revenue growth outperformance in Q1 were economic occupancy, which accounted for roughly 1/3 of the total outperformance for the quarter; and underlying bad debt, which represented another roughly 20%. \n Occupancy was about 30 basis points higher than expected, an increase from the mid-95% range at the end of last year to the high 95s for the quarter. While we expected occupancy to grow during Q1, it increased more quickly than we anticipated, reflecting strength in the underlying demand for our primarily coastal suburban portfolio and very limited new supply. \n In terms of underlying bad debt from residents. We ended up about 25 basis points favorable to our original expectations for the quarter, with all the improvement being realized in February and March. January was in line with budget at roughly 2.2% [indiscernible] declined materially to 1.8% in February and again to 1.6% in March, which is roughly 60 basis points below our original budget. \n We experienced a similar dip in May of last year. The bad debt has been reverted to higher levels in June. Therefore, while we're encouraged by results in February and March, we need to see a few more months at these lower levels to feel confident that we'll experience consistently better performance moving forward. \n From a geographic perspective, the favorable variance to our initial expectations was more material in New England, New York, New Jersey, Seattle and, to a lesser degree, in Northern and Southern California. \n Moving to Slide 12. Key portfolio indicators are very healthy during Q1, and our portfolio is well positioned for the prime leasing season. In Chart 1, turnover remains well below historical norms, in part due to a very low level of move-outs to purchase a home. \n During Q1, only 7% of our residents moved out of one of our communities to purchase a home. It wasn't that long ago that we highlighted 12% to 13% of move-outs, purchasing a home as being low. 7% is extremely low relative to the long-term average of 16% to 17% and certainly reflects the favorable rent versus own economics in our established regions as Ben referenced earlier. \n Given the low level of turnover, availability has been relatively stable and supportive of above-average asking rent growth recently, which is reflected in Chart 3 and accelerating rent change, which is reflected in Chart 4. \n As expected, our East Coast regions delivered the strongest rent change in Q1 at 2.7% with the East Coast established regions trending at 3% range, while Florida was sub-1%. We experienced positive momentum in rent change throughout the quarter across the East Coast markets, which was particularly notable in Mid-Atlantic, while performance in the District of Columbia has been soft and volatile due to a number of issues, including the impact of new supply. \n The Northern Virginia and Maryland suburbs have demonstrated continued positive momentum. Rent change for the West Coast regions was 1.3% during the quarter, with the Seattle market leading at 2.8%, which further increased into the mid-4% range for April. While urban Seattle is still soft due to a significant amount of new supply and weaker demand, performance across our primary suburban portfolio improved meaningfully during the quarter. \n In Northern California, while the underpinnings of better performance are starting to appear, it's not yet having a meaningful impact on current performance. Rent change was flat for the quarter with a positive rent change in San Jose being offset by negative rent change in San Francisco and the East Bay. \n Transitioning to Slide 13 to address our updated revenue outlook for the year. We now expect same-store revenue growth of 3.1% for 2024, an increase of 50 basis points from our original guidance. The increased outlook is primarily driven by stronger lease rates as higher occupancy at the start of the year has allowed us to begin to achieve higher rental rates than we originally anticipated as we move into the prime leasing season. \n We now expect like-term effective rent change in the mid-2% range, about a 50 basis point increase from our original outlook. The second quarter should trend up into the low 3% range before decelerating in the back half of the year, consistent with seasonal norms. \n We expect renewals in the low to mid-4% range for the balance of the year, while new move-ins average roughly 50 basis points, which reflects the low 2% range for Q2 move-ins before experiencing the normal seasonal decline in Q3 and Q4. In addition, we're projecting a greater contribution from the improvement in underlying bad debt with a full year rate of 1.7%, down from 2.4% last year and slightly more rent relief. \n And finally, moving to Slide 14, you can see where we're projecting stronger revenue performance relative to our original outlook. We're expecting the most significant improvement in Seattle and New England, which outperformed our expectations in Q1 and accelerated further into April, with both regions delivering greater than 4% rent change followed by Metro New York. \n The Mid-Atlantic is expected to modestly outperform our original expectations, supported by stronger performance in Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland. Southern California is also expected to perform modestly better than our original outlook, and we haven't changed our forecast for Northern California. \n So I'll turn it over to Matt to address recent lease-up performance and our capital allocation plan for 2024. Matt? \nMatthew Birenbaum: All right. Thank you, Sean. Turning to our development communities. Slide 15 details the continued impressive results being generated by our lease-ups. The 6 development communities that had active leasing in Q1 are delivering rents $295 per month or 10% above our initial underwriting, which is translating into a 40 basis point increase in yield. \n And this performance is being supported by strong traffic and leasing velocity with these assets averaging 30 net leases per month in the seasonally slow first quarter, which grew throughout the quarter to nearly 40 per month in March. This outperformance is driven by 2 primary factors. \n First, since we conservatively don't trend rents and report our development economics based on projected NOI at the time of construction start until the communities enter lease-up, there's usually rent growth during the construction period, which provides some incremental lift to our development yields by the time of their completion. And second, while we are pretty good at predicting how the market will respond to our latest state-of-the-art product offerings and new development, we do still frequently see some additional premium as the market responds to the unit and community features we incorporate into our designs. \n Turning to Slide 16. While it was a quiet quarter for investment activity with no closed transactions or development starts, our investment plans for the year are still very much on track. We brought 4 assets in our established regions to the market in Q1, looking to take advantage of a potential lull in the investment sales market as many owners were waiting for interest rate cuts before getting going with their disposition plans. All 4 are now under agreement at pricing, consistent with our initial expectations with a weighted average cap rate of 5.1%. \n We expect to redeploy some of the proceeds from these pending sales into acquisitions in our expansion regions in the coming months as we continue to make progress on our portfolio optimization objectives to increase our expansion market allocation to 25% over time. Planning for development starts is also proceeding as expected with our start activity this year concentrated in Q2 and Q3. We are seeing some helpful construction buyout savings in certain regions, which will allow us to preserve our targeted spread of 100 to 150 basis points between development yields and prevailing cap rates. \n And in our SIP book, we continue to be conservative but do expect to grow that business line modestly through the course of the year. Fortunately, the $200 million in commitments in the program today were all originated in the last 2 years, are geographically dispersed across our markets, concentrated in submarkets with less new supply pressure and have initial maturity dates that are still 2-plus years out. So we do not have any legacy overhang burdening our loan book. \n It's also been interesting to see some larger portfolio transactions start to gain traction just in the past few weeks. This illustrates the continued attractiveness of our sector to private the capital and perhaps marks a shift in sentiment that might bring increased deal flow as the year progresses. We continue to preserve dry powder on our balance sheet so that we will be in a position to take advantage of future opportunities that may emerge, if they are aligned with our strategic priorities and our unique capabilities. \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben to wrap things up. \nBenjamin Schall: Thanks, Matt. Our results to date have exceeded our expectations, and we're excited for the momentum we have heading into the peak leasing season. Demand is stronger than originally expected, and our suburban coastal portfolio faces meaningfully less supply than elsewhere in the country. And we're confident that we will find opportunities to put our balance sheet and strategic capabilities to work to generate shareholder value. \n I'll end our prepared remarks there and turn it to the operator to open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. \nNicholas Joseph: It's Nick here with Eric. Maybe just on the capital allocation and then rotation into the Sunbelt. You made a comment in the prepared remarks about seeing opportunities below replacement costs. And so I was just curious if you can quantify kind of that. Obviously, it's probably range, but kind of how far below replacement costs you're seeing on average then also the size of the opportunity you're seeing in terms of product, I mean, on the market in those expansion markets. \nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. Sure. Nick, it's Matt. I would say the discount replacement cost is obviously going to vary to some extent based on the age of the asset. I mean, in theory, assets that are 10, 20 years old should be trading below replacement cost because there is some depreciation there. \n But we are -- I'd say we are seeing assets that are 10 years old. It might be trading 15% to 20% below current replacement cost. We haven't seen kind of brand-new assets coming out of lease-up come to market yet at compelling prices. I think people are getting extensions on their construction loans, and there's a pretty active bridge lending space. So we would look at those as well. \n So younger assets, I would expect the discount to be a little bit less than that, but we haven't seen as much of that yet. The volume has been [ light ]. And that's one reason that supported cap rates honestly being lower than I would have thought they would have been, but there is a little bit of a scarcity premium. And on the one hand, we're taking advantage of that as a seller, and that's one reason we brought some assets to market early because we anticipated that might happen. But as a buyer, that's a little bit frustrating. \nNicholas Joseph: Would you expect some of that product to start to come to market? Or do you think it's more -- owners right now will be more of a wait and hold? I'm just trying to understand how kind of the current supply and the rate uncertainty may impact kind of your acquisition strategy and maybe urgency into moving into these, if we fast forward a year or 2, and the supply picture has started to improve. \nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. I mean, who knows? I would say that there is more volume coming. And if you talk to the brokers, they'll say they're pretty busy with [ BOVs ]. This is the seasonal time of the year when you start to see an uptick in transaction volume. \n Q1 volumes were down over -- below Q1 '23, which was down a lot from Q1 '22. And transaction volumes are now below where they were kind of in '17, '18, '19. So I think you will start to see some pickup in what might be available. And certainly, from our point of view, we're staying disciplined about it. But we are hopeful that we might move into an environment where we'll be able to start to accelerate our asset trading activity a little bit. We haven't done that much in the last, say, 4 or 5 quarters. \nBenjamin Schall: Nick, I'll add a couple of comments, guess it's well put by Matt. I generally see as our window of opportunity being open for a decent period of time and 2 primary reasons: one, the supply dynamics that exist in the Sunbelt. Per my prepared remarks, we expect to be with us for a period of time. So that softness on rate and occupancy and a weight on asset values is we think, we'll be here. \n And then the second part is on kind of the capital world, which we're really just at the front part of the wave of maturities of deals done 2, 3, 4 years ago. So I agree with Matt, not seeing a ton today would -- also not seeing a ton of dislocation, but it is still early. And we think we're well prepared to take advantage of it for the right types of opportunities. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. \nJames Feldman: Great. So I want to go back to a comment you made on -- I think you said rents and occupancy in the Sunbelt could last, at least, through '25. The pressure on rents and occupancy in the Sunbelt could last, at least, through '25 and possibly into '26. So first, I want to make sure I heard that correctly. \n And secondly, can you just talk more about what gives you the confidence in saying that? And if you think about we've got spring leasing this year, then it slows down at the end of the year, then you've got spring leasing next year. I think a lot of people think things will get cleaned up by then. But your comments kind of indicate they probably won't. So just want to hear based on data you're seeing or what you're seeing on the ground of how you think that trajectory plays out. \nBenjamin Schall: Yes, Jamie, I'll start with a couple of comments. So one is just the sort of the facts and the known dynamics that exist. Supply in the Sunbelt, yes, it is going to be peaking later this year, but it is going to remain elevated into 2025. \n Second known dynamic is we know when projects are -- we know which projects are under construction, you know when those projects are completing, and you know the period of time associated with lease-up. So that inherently takes you out another 12 to 15 months depending on the size of the project and the velocity of that lease-up. \n And then the third dynamic, and this gets into the impact on NOI is the rolling through of rent rolls over that period of time. And so when you then think about sort of the last dynamic and the last effective NOI impact, that gets you into that early 2026 type of time frame. \n It's the area where, in our minds, it's sort of -- it's one of those known industry dynamics. And to the extent the economic scenario has gotten better, but in a, call it, a slower growth economic environment, overlaid on high supply in certain submarkets, we expect there to continue to be pressure. \nJames Feldman: Okay. And then are there specific markets? I mean I know we've heard Austin, and we were [indiscernible] as kind of the poster child of the weakness. But when you think about all the Sunbelt markets, I mean, you're painting a pretty broad brush. Is there some that really stand out that will be in pain for longer? \nBenjamin Schall: Yes. Austin would also be at the top of that list. Just look at percentage of stock coming online. That would be high up on the list. Generally, in the Sunbelt markets, the more urban-oriented submarkets are generally seeing the highest levels of supply coming online. And that's one of the reasons we've been conscious as we've been growing our expansion market portfolio to really push ourselves out further into those marketplaces out of a submarket or 2 with lower density product, lower price point. That is competing less directly with new supply. \nJames Feldman: Okay. So it sounds like your Sunbelt expansion would still be mostly suburban, if you could find that. \nBenjamin Schall: It is. Yes, that's been a very conscious choice of ours. And we also think about it as complementing what we're buying with what we're going to be building. And so even to make the point further, what we've been buying tends to be slightly older product, lower price point, lower density products. Recognizing that our development, while it still will be suburban, will tend to be mid-rise and a little bit higher price point, once it comes to market. So we think about that as just our overall -- we talk about at a portfolio level optimization, but we also very much focus on it in terms of a market and a submarket perspective. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nAustin Wurschmidt: Great. Matt, I just want to go back to the dispositions. You kind of highlighted the scarcity premium, but I'm curious if there was any specific factors related to the assets you sold sort of idiosyncratic factors that maybe benefited valuations you achieved? Or if you think that is reflective of valuations today? And then can you just share how deep the buyer pool was and whether or not there is financing contingencies? \nMatthew Birenbaum: Sure. Well, the first thing I'd say is none of them have closed yet. So be able to provide more detail at the end -- on the second quarter call. But it's a pretty good mix. Three of the 4 assets are AVAs, so a little bit more urban than what we've been selling in the past, one in Jersey, one in Seattle, one in Boston, one in Southern California. So a good mix of geographies. And it continues to be a little bit of a bifurcated market. \n So the ones -- the smaller deals, kind of less than $100 million, tend to be either private buyers, [ 1031 ] buyers, syndicators, little bit less institutional. And then when you get into bigger assets, that's where probably those buyers are using less leverage. And the cap rates are little bit lower if you can find -- if that's more of an institutional bid. \n But there's plenty of assets that are not getting that institutional bid. So it does really vary based on kind of where you are. And -- but one of the things that was a pleasant surprise is that even -- we have one larger urban asset, urban Boston, which is a relatively [ fair ] market. And the bid was probably deeper there than any of the others actually. \nAustin Wurschmidt: That's helpful detail. Just switching over to operations. Just wanted to hit on sort of the Bay Area commentary. You mentioned, I think, that the underpinnings of positive momentum were there. What's it going to take for that to translate into outperformance and sort of a little bit better and maybe less volatile fundamental backdrop? The Bay Area and then any other West Coast submarkets as well? \nSean Breslin: Yes, so it's Sean. Good question and the question, I think, on a lot of people's minds. I think the way I describe it is, first, supply should not be an issue for an extended period of time. There are 1 or 2 assets in San Francisco as an example that are finishing lease-up. \n But given the nature of the product, economics, timelines, that won't be an issue for a long period of time. It's really more on the demand side and making sure that I think for the most part, what we're hearing on the ground is that we really just do need business leaders to be more confident in bringing people back to their respective offices and opening offices in San Francisco. \n What's underneath that is making sure that the associate population for all those various employers is comfortable being in that market, kind of living [indiscernible] life issues. Certainly, the political dynamic has started to shift in a meaningful way. There seems to be some positive momentum there, but that takes time. \n So that's why I'd say that, that is probably the most important thing. Obviously, job growth matters, and it's been a little bit choppy. But we are seeing some good signs of life, particularly given the generative AI boom, so to speak. But it has not manifested itself into thousands of jobs showing up yet in these markets. \n And so I think the broad view around technology and that being the epicenter of sort of technology innovation is still present, more the confidence about bringing people back to work, particularly in San Francisco, I would say. We're starting to see signs of life of that in San Jose. There's more short-term demand than there has been for the last couple of years. That's an initial indicator that's positive. But it's sort of a mixed bag as it relates to San Francisco and certain parts of the East Bay. \nAustin Wurschmidt: And so just one quick follow-up there. I mean is that sort of sequential improvement, Seattle and Bay Area, are those -- given we weren't hearing you talk about this 3 to 6 months ago, I guess, is that year-to-date improvement in asking rents being driven by those West Coast markets specifically? Or is it just more broad and related to the lower turnover, et cetera, that you're seeing? \nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean as it relates to this trend at asking rents, that's primarily driven by the East Coast markets. And if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, the East Coast markets are up 2% to 3% versus the West Coast markets are up about 1% roughly. That's being supported by markets like San Diego, Orange County, parts of L.A. Certainly, Seattle has had a nice recovery. \n We've been surprised, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about Seattle. The trends and the firming in Seattle certainly seems to have sort of a greater foundation to it than what we've seen in the Bay Area just yet. And part of what's driving the effective rent change in Seattle in Q1 and into April is a pretty significant reduction in concessions. \n Concession volume for us, as an example, from Q4 to Q1, it was down about 70%. We incurred almost 900,000 in concessions in Q4 versus [ 275 ] in Q1 of '24 versus in the Bay Area, it was down about 20%. So you're seeing good trends, but I would say it's not being broadly supported yet by Northern California, more so the Southern California markets in Seattle as it relates to the West Coast. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. \nSteve Sakwa: Sorry. Sorry about that. Sorry. I guess on the Slide 13, the economic occupancy for 2024 is basically showing kind of no improvement. So I'm not sure what was in the initial outlook. But clearly, you had a 30 basis point pickup in the first quarter. And I think the [ comps ] actually get easier as time goes on. So I'm just curious, and given the top of funnel demand that you talked about being reasonably strong, I guess I'm just curious why you're not assuming maybe improved occupancy? Or is there something you're doing on the rate side that might keep occupancy growth at bay? \nSean Breslin: Yes, Steve, it's Sean. It's really 2 factors. One is what you described. We've seen sort of a faster improvement in occupancy. We experienced that in Q1. That is quickly translating to rate acceleration, which actually puts a little bit of pressure on occupancy. \n And the other thing, if you think about it from a revenue standpoint with higher rates, the dollar value of each vacant unit is actually higher. So it doesn't contribute as much to revenue as you might think when you look at it from that perspective. Anything that is vacant is worth more, and so it does sort of weigh on the revenue side of it. But those are the 2 primary reasons. In terms of physical occupancy, we expect it to be roughly about a push by the time we get to year-end relative to our original guidance. And that's why it shows up that way on the slide. \nSteve Sakwa: Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, I think I heard -- I think you said that you were expecting about 4% on renewal growth, if I wasn't mistaken, maybe for the balance of the year. I don't know if I heard you say where you were sending out renewal notices for kind of the May, June, July period. But are those going out at substantially better than 4%, and you're assuming some discounting? Or could there maybe be some upside to that 4% number? \nSean Breslin: Yes. You're correct. I did not state renewal offers. But renewal offers for May and June are around the high 5% range. So expecting them to settle sort of in the low to mid 4s is reasonable based on historical norms. \nSteve Sakwa: Got it. And then just lastly on development, Matt. You guys are starting a couple of new projects here, I think, in the second quarter. Can just remind us, what are you targeting on new projects today? I know that there's been some upside on the things you're delivering, but what's kind of the new hurdle in light of today's new interest rate environment? \nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes, Steve, I guess, we -- there's actually -- it's not one number. There are different target yields for different markets and even down to different submarkets and also based on the risk profile of the deal. But we're generally looking for that 100 to 150 basis point spread to cap rates. What that's translating into kind of on average is probably a mid- to high 6s target yield. And then it's going to be lower in markets where deals that are less risky or markets where we expect stronger growth because ultimately, it's about the full investment return, the IRR. And it's going to be higher in markets that have the inverse of that. \n And so where you see where deals actually clearing those today, we expect to start a deal in suburban Boston in kind of the mid 6s, which maps well to where cap rates are in those markets. We expect to start a deal in suburban Jersey, which is around a 7 because cap rates are higher in that market. And then Mid-Atlantic, it would also be around the 7, and then some of our expansion regions that might be a little lower than that, closer to 6. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Adam Kramer with Morgan Stanley. \nAdam Kramer: Just wanted to ask about your expectations for West Coast markets. I think these are markets that lagged a little bit if I just look at your kind of market-by-market effective [indiscernible] growth in the supplemental. But they also have pretty high expectations for same-store revenue if I'm looking at your presentation correctly. \n So I just wanted to ask you about kind of what's the delta there? Are there kind of outsized growth expected there in -- for the rest of the year that's going to bring same-store revenue to be one of the best-performing markets there, if I'm looking at your slide deck? \nSean Breslin: Yes, Adam, it's Sean. Good question. And one of the factors to keep in mind is what's changing in underlying bad debt across the markets. If you think about it, it was like rent change is one component, but changes in occupancy, bad debt, et cetera. And particularly for the Southern California market, I would say that is a meaningful contributor to total revenue growth in 2024. \n To give you some sense in the first quarter, I think Southern California, roughly 40% of the revenue growth was related to just better underlying bad debt as we're -- those folks out, seeing the churn and then rerenting those units to people who are paying. So that is a driver. There's a table in the back. There are lots of attachment that gives you the change that we're seeing over the last few quarters in bad debt, and that may help you kind of map a little bit better. \nAdam Kramer: Great. And just maybe as a follow-up. You guys provided a really helpful kind of expectations for new and renewal growth for the whole year. And apologies if you've talked about this already today, but maybe just walk us through kind of what the updated expectations would be. \n I think renewals prior were 4%. New was roughly flat, leading to 2% blended growth. Maybe just walk us through what the updated expectations are assuming with the new guidance that those may be a little bit higher than they were previously. \nSean Breslin: Yes. What I mentioned in my prepared remarks is that we expect like-term effective rent change kind of in the mid-2% range, which is about 50 basis points above our original outlook. What I indicated is that the second quarter should trend up probably in the low 3% range before decelerating in the back half of the year. \n As it relates to renewals, kind of low to mid-4% range for the balance of the year, while new move-ins averaged roughly 50 basis points, which sort of reflects maybe the low 2% range for Q2, before experiencing kind of the normal seasonal decline in Q3 and Q4. So that's kind of how we're looking at it right now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. \nJohn Kim: Part of your beat and guidance raise was due to better-than-expected capital markets activity. And I was wondering what component of capital markets outperformed your expectations. Last quarter, you gave a pretty good breakdown on that $0.29 headwind, which has improved slightly. \nKevin O'Shea: Yes, John, this is Kevin. Really, the $0.02 from better-than-expected capital markets activity was primarily driven by a combination of favorable interest expense and interest income as well as slightly higher budgeted -- higher-than-budgeted capital interest expense. So it's really in those categories where most of the favorability was realized. \nJohn Kim: What about your cap rate expectations either on sales or investments? \nKevin O'Shea: Well, I was referring to Q1. We didn't have any transactions that closed in Q1. So transaction activity cap rates did not really have an impact. As you look at the full year guidance, we expect basically due to adjustments in a range of things that fall with the capital markets activity such as buying and selling assets and then movement of interest rates on existing debt and additional debt activity that we have anticipated. \n We anticipate getting $0.01 of the $0.02 back and being net favorable by $0.01 for the full year on capital markets, in terms of our core FFO relative to our initial outlook. So we're early in the year in terms of what we will do broadly in terms of transaction activity, capital markets activity. So haven't made a lot of adjustments, but there's been some movement that caused that additional $0.01 shortfall in the back half, back 3 quarters of the year that leave us sort of getting $0.01 of the $0.02 back later in the year on that line item. \nJohn Kim: Okay. My second question is on the SIP program, where you mentioned that you had a favorable vintage '22 and '23 originations. I was wondering when some of those '22 originations start to get paid off. And forward and reinvest some of the proceeds. What metrics do you look at or monitor whether it's exit cap rate or [ tenure ] or maybe supply that would make you more cautious on reinvesting in the program? \nMatthew Birenbaum: John, it's Matt. So the only deal that we have that matures next year '25 is a very small $13 million loan in Northern New Jersey, very stable, strong market. So all the other ones don't mature until '26 or later. So it wasn't necessarily kind of first in, first out, so to speak. \n So it's still quite a ways out there. And we're still building the book. So we haven't really focused too much on reinvesting, getting that money back. We're still -- we're at $200 million in the program today. I think our long-term goal is for it to be around 400, 400 or 500. So we're hoping to grow that total balance maybe $75 million this year and then continue from there in '26. At some point, yes, we'll have to -- we'll face that revolving door where we start getting redemptions. But we're still, at least, a couple of years away from that. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. \nJoshua Dennerlein: Ben, I just want to explore a big picture topic you mentioned. You were talking about the differential between owning and renting in your markets is really wide. Rents are benefiting from that. Is there any historical time period where we could kind of look back at where the delta was this wide? And if so, just like how did it play out on the rent growth front? \nBenjamin Schall: I mean the rent versus own economics that we're seeing today are really unique, not something that we've seen. We've obviously, over time, seen small variations in that. But the combination of home price appreciation, particularly in our markets and the rise in mortgage rates has led to all-time levels, right? \n I mean you're approaching where it's some of our markets 2x more expensive to own versus rent. And if we think about it kind of longer term and looking forward, I would frame it as that's an incremental cushion that we have that's supporting our demand on rental economics. So it may not stay as peak as it is today. Obviously, part of that is based on the trajectory of interest rates. But there's a nice cushion that should serve as a tailwind for us for a number of years. \nJoshua Dennerlein: Is there anything in your forecast like as far as rent growth goes? Or does your forecast assume any kind of like narrowing of that gap? Or would that be potential like upside? And maybe it's not just a 1 year dynamic, maybe it's multiyear. Just trying to think through [ potential ] upside from this. \nSean Breslin: Yes. I mean the forecast for this year reflected being a relatively stable level. Obviously, interest rates bounce around, prices bounce around. But in terms of the current year outlook sort of reflects generally where we are at this point in time have remained relatively stable. \nOperator: Our next question comes from [ Anne Chan ] with Green Street. \nUnknown Analyst: I'm just wondering have you seen any examples of things beginning to get more aggressive with property tax assessments of apartments to help fill the hole in budgets left by suppressed commercial real estate values in other sectors? \nSean Breslin: Anne, this is Sean. I mean it's early in the calendar year for some of the assessment cycles that really are more heavily weighted towards kind of midyear and the back half of the year. What we have seen thus far is a little bit of an uptick in Washington State and Virginia. \n We don't have insight into all the jurisdictions just yet. But in terms of our portfolio, that's what we're aware of. There's a lag as it relates to property tax assessed values. So our expectation would be there'll probably be more pressure on the Sunbelt based on the run-up that occurred sort of through COVID that's still working its way through the system before you see it in the next couple of years maybe start to move the other direction. So we haven't seen clear evidence of that for 2024 just yet, but that's kind of the high-level view. \nUnknown Analyst: All right. Appreciate that. And I'm just curious, what level of CapEx per unit should we expect in the next few years combined between NOI enhancing and asset preservation? \nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. Anne, it's Matt. So our asset preservation CapEx has been pretty consistent over the last -- well, between '23 and '24, around $1,600, $1,700 a unit, which is, I guess, roughly 6% or 7% of NOI, 7%. The NOI-enhancing CapEx, that's where we really increased our investment or we're looking to increase our investment volume quite a bit. I think we invested about $75 million, $80 million last year across the whole portfolio, most of which I guess was same store. We're looking to double that this year. \n A lot of that is driven by expanded solar production and by expanded the opportunity for the accessory dwelling units in California that we talked about it at Investor Day. And we think that's an opportunity that's out there for the next couple of years. So we're excited about that. And I would think that there will be the opportunity to continue to have those increased opportunities, at least, for the next couple of years. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. \nBrad Heffern: Yes. On the blended rate assumptions, the low 3% for the second quarter, maybe seems a little conservative given you would normally expect those blends to pick up further from here, and you're already at 3.3% in April. So is your assumed seasonality more muted than normal for the second quarter and for the rest of the year? Or am I perceiving that wrong? \nSean Breslin: No, not really, Brad. I mean low 3%, 3.2%, 3.3%, somewhere in that ballpark. I mean we've seen asking rent growth kind of 5.5% or so through yesterday. That's played through just renewal offers that have already been made in terms of what our expectation is for rate growth. So it seems like somewhere in that range for the second quarter is reasonable. And then you will have to see how asking rent growth continues as we move through the second quarter. \nBrad Heffern: Okay. And then on concessions, you talked a little bit about the Bay Area and Seattle, but can you go through any of the other regions that have concessions and how they trended? I'm particularly thinking about the expansion regions, but anywhere else as well. \nSean Breslin: Yes. What I would say, first, in terms of the expansion regions is we have relatively small portfolios in our same-store basket in those regions. So as you think of the expansion markets in Texas, for example, we don't have anything in Austin. There's only 2 assets in Dallas. We have seen -- at least in Q1, we saw a year-over-year increase in concession volume in Dallas. In the previous year, it was about 1/3 of all leases. It was roughly about half in Q1. \n So Dallas -- Dallas is really a market, very large geography, broadly diversified, really depends on where you are. There are some submarkets where it's well over a month for almost every lease. There are other submarkets where it's half a month for some level of volume. So it really depends on where you are. \n If you move to the Denver market, it's really a story of urban versus suburban, as I think Ben referred to earlier. If you're in the urban submarkets where we have one operating asset, concessions are much more [indiscernible] as compared to the suburbs where we have most of our assets. \n And then in terms of our other expansion regions. In Charlotte, it's a similar story as Denver. We have some assets in the South end. Concessions are more pronounced there, average closer to 0.5 month for probably 50%, 60% of the leases versus you move to sort of the northern suburbs, it's quite a bit less. \n And then in Florida. Florida is a little more of an effective rent kind of market where people tend to price based on absolute rent and as many concessions for existing assets. Lease-up assets are different but existing assets, it tends to be a little more of a what am I writing a check for. And so they're most concerned about the lease rent than the concession. So that's a little bit more volatile, but we haven't seen a huge amount of concession volume. Again, I think that's more representative of the sort of market behavior than it is to our pricing dynamics. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities. We'll move on to our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [ Amy ] on with Michael. Looking back, there have been periodic supply cycles in the South. So clearly, we're seeing supply starting to slow heading into '26. But as rents recover, how fast can development start to pick back up in the Sunbelt? And is that concerning to you as you look to increase your exposure there? \nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. Amy, it's Matt. It is certainly true that there's less barriers. There's less regulatory barriers to entry in the Southern markets. And so supply is able to respond to demand much more quickly. And some of the supply kind of excesses you're seeing now are -- were a relatively quick market response to tremendous demand a couple of years ago that really started with COVID in some of those Southern or Sunbelt markets. So it is, I'd say, a shorter cycle, a more attenuated cycle. Demand comes, supply can respond quickly. But having said that, there is a lot of demand there. And the interplay between those 2 factors into our view on kind of our long-term portfolio allocation and trying to get to 25% there. \n The other thing I would say is submarkets matter a lot. And there are -- even within some of these geographies and particularly the expansion markets that we selected, there are submarkets that do have some meaningful supply barriers. And those are certainly the submarkets that are more attractive to us, both for acquisitions -- and we're pretty good at unlocking those constraints on the development side. So you'll see that inform our portfolio strategy within each region. \nBenjamin Schall: Yes. I'll add to that. And as we're thinking about the opportunity set in the Sunbelt, we've got in the near term, the ability to buy below replacement cost and be at a good basis and find that attractive from a long-term hold perspective. We are increasingly also focused on bringing our strategic capabilities and particularly our operating model initiatives. \n It's been driving a lot on growth for our existing assets, but we're increasingly bringing that to new assets that we bring into the fold. And as we get more and more density in the Sunbelt and our expansion markets, we expect that flywheel to accelerate. There is the land side and the opportunity with less competition in these markets to be finding attractive land structured appropriately, some of which will make sense to start more immediately and some of which could position us longer term to generate value. \n And then kind of a fourth driver of value for us is in a world where capital is less abundant, our ability to provide capital to other developers. And we've used that as a tool for growth in our expansion regions. And for sure, in today's environment are seeing a better quality sponsor, better quality real estate, better return profile there. So it's that combination of opportunities that we'll tap into to drive our longer-term expansion of those markets. \nUnknown Analyst: Great. And then just a quick follow-up on that. What are you seeing in terms of land cost currently? \nMatthew Birenbaum: Land costs? \nUnknown Analyst: Right. To acquire land, if you were going to buy. \nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. So it varies, obviously, a lot by region. In some regions, we have seen, particularly in some of our [indiscernible] regions, we have seen land prices come down significantly for motivated sellers. There's plenty of sellers kind of like the assets we're talking about, who are not particularly -- there's no time sensitivity, and they're holding out. \n But one of the deals we actually highlighted at our Investor Day was the deal in suburban Boston in Quincy. That's the deal we're looking to start in Q2 in suburban Boston, where that land -- we were able to buy that land at probably 40% less than where it had been under contract before, say, in '21 or '22. \n So we are seeing that to some extent. In the expansion regions, land pricing has probably come off a little bit in Florida, where it had gotten incredibly aggressive. But we haven't necessarily seen significant moves down in land costs. \n Partially, I would say that's because in many of the expansion regions, the land is a much smaller percentage of the total deal cap than it is, say, in California or New York, where land might be 30%, 40% of your total deal cap. It moves a lot. It's very high beta. \n If you're doing a garden deal in Charlotte, land might only be 10% of your total deal cap. So it's not going to move the needle as much, and it's not going to be as sensitive really in either direction. So it's been -- land prices tend to be sticky in general. They've probably been stickier in those markets where, obviously, they were cheaper to begin with. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Goldfarb with Piper Sandler. \nAlexander Goldfarb: So 2 questions here. First, just going to New York with the recent rent law updates. The office to resi conversions actually looks to be quite lucrative, not expecting you guys to take down an office building. But for your development capital program, does this represent a new opportunity for you, given that there's sort of a 2-year shot clock where the landlords have to apply for permits? So it seems like a lot of existing office landlords who may be contemplating this have a short window to act, and your capital may be attractive to them. \nMatthew Birenbaum: Alex, it's Matt. I would say no. Our developer funding program is really focused on expanding our growth in our expansion regions. So we're not looking to grow our capital investment in New York. \nAlexander Goldfarb: Okay. And then the second question is your overall outlook just was impressive, certainly ahead of expectations that you guys provided a few months ago. There's a broader debate out there about soft landing, hard landing, what's going to happen to the economy. But none of the comments that you guys spoke about suggest that there's any sort of weakness out there. \n I mean across all the markets, it seems like things are healthy. Is that a fair takeaway? Or are there -- is there anything that you feel from the different markets are seeing that would give caution towards later this year or what all the different regions are seeing suggest actually almost an improving environment? \nSean Breslin: Yes, Alex, this is Sean. I think the broad brush is relatively consistent of what you stated. But certainly, real estate is a local business here. And there are submarkets that are challenged for either demand or supply reasons or both. \n As I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks, while the Mid-Atlantic is generally doing pretty well, that is driven by our suburban portfolio. The District of Columbia is quite soft for both demand and supply reasons. The same thing could be said about urban Seattle, downtown L.A. We have one asset there as an example. \n So I would say, broadly speaking, what you're indicating is correct. For the portfolio, we have coastal, suburban, primary customer base healthy. But obviously, there are exceptions [ where you are ]. And I would point to really some of these urban submarkets with plentiful supply, some still quality of life conditions that are challenging as a little more choppy. \n And then there are certain markets, still some of the Bay Area where there are signs of some job growth, but then there are still signs of layoffs here and there that you're hearing about in the media. So I wouldn't say everything is rosy, but the broad brush is it looks pretty good right now. \nBenjamin Schall: Alex, I'll just add briefly. We've highlighted the improved job picture, right, given the change in expectations from the beginning of the year. But there are crosswinds, Sean touched on a couple. And I would highlight the inflationary impacts on our consumer and their wallet. I mean those are very much there and true when you think about car loans, I'm coming up for renewal, when you think about the beginning of student loan repayment. So the outlook has improved, but I would still describe it generally as sort of our consumer facing a series of crosswinds. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Anthony Dowling with Barclays. \nAnthony Powell: Anthony Powell here. Just a question on the bad debt improvement you saw in the quarter. What drove that improvement? Was it the core kind of improving their process, getting quicker, resi coming back in current? Maybe more detail would be great there. \nSean Breslin: Sure, Anthony, it's Sean. Sort of a combination of all those factors that you just laid out. And what I'd point to geographically, which might be a little bit of a surprise for people is most of the improvement was actually not in places like L.A., which have been sort of the poster child for this. \n But we saw very good improvement in the broader sort of New York metro area. Underlying bad debt in Q4 in that region was 3.1%. In Q1, it declined to 2.4%. Boston was 120 basis points in Q4, a decline of 60 basis points. It was about 20 basis points of improvement in Seattle. So for all the reasons you mentioned, some [indiscernible] up on payments as well as the skip and evict process, sort of a combination of all those factors driving the improvement. \nAnthony Powell: Maybe going back to the New York law that was just passed. I guess you don't want to increase more capital to New York. Was that a comment on the office ready or just a broader comment? I wanted to see if you can maybe just close your views on both the rental provisions and also the development provisions in the [ wall ]? \nMatthew Birenbaum: Yes. I mean -- this is Matt. It was really just a broader comment. When you look at our portfolio allocation, our portfolio allocation to the New York Metro area, I think, is roughly 20% today. It has been -- and we've been on a journey to reduce that over time. That's one of the regions we're rotating capital out of as we redeploy capital into our expansion regions. \n So first and foremost, we're just overweight that region relative to our long-term goal. And then there are -- when you talk about New York specifically, more of our investment in the New York region is going to New Jersey these days. We're finding very strong development yields, pretty good operating performance. And there is a regulatory overlay there, which it can be challenging, but it is not as challenging as New York State and New York City, and that does factor into our long-term view as well. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. \nLinda Yu Tsai: In terms of the 7% moving out to buy a house, along those lines, wondering if you've seen any demographic shifts in the composition of your residents over the past year or so? \nSean Breslin: Yes. Linda, it's Sean. I wouldn't say anything terribly significant. The only thing that I could point to a little bit is as you might imagine, as winter, COVID, the [ roommates ], the volume of [ room rates ] across the portfolio has certainly declined. It has kind of come back up to some more normal levels, roughly, I would say. That would be the only data point that I really could point to for you. \nLinda Yu Tsai: And then on the better job growth being concentrated in lower-income residents. Is there any kind of read through for AvalonBay in terms of resident demand? \nSean Breslin: Yes, Sean, again. Not at this point that we've seen, other than certainly our lower price point assets in some of the markets, particularly on the West Coast, where we have a greater share of those assets are performing quite well. I think to Ben's point, there certainly are consumers that are feeling a little bit of pinch from what's happened with inflation, student loans, car leases expire, et cetera, et cetera. \n And so certainly, those lower price point assets are performing quite well, in many cases, better than some of the higher price point assets in some of those submarkets. So it's really a market-by-market question. But overall, we have healthy demand and in some cases, maybe for the reasons you just described, maybe even stronger demand for some of the lower price points. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. \nJames Feldman: Just quickly, I just wanted to get your thoughts on your debt maturities in '24 and '25. Obviously, a much larger maturity pipeline in '25 with $825 million of unsecured. But what are your thoughts -- like maybe can you talk to us about what's in your guidance in terms of refinancing? And is there any chance you'd pull forward the '25 maturities? And might that have any impact on your outlook if you did that? Just kind of what are you thinking about the markets in general? \nKevin O'Shea: Yes. Sure, Jamie. This is Kevin. Maybe just to kind of provide some context, I'll just start with our capital plan for the year. It's not changed significantly from our initial outlook. And as you recall, what we identified then and it's still true today is that for 2024, we have $1.4 billion in uses, which consists of $1.1 billion of investment spend and then a $300 million debt maturity later this year in November, which has a 3.7% interest rate. \n So that's the usage we've got for this year. Our sources are pretty straightforward and have kind of 3 broad parts, $400 million of free cash flow. We anticipate drawing down about $175 million of unrestricted cash that we had at the beginning of the year and ending the year with 2 25 in cash at the end of the year. \n And then our [ initial outlook ] contemplated about $850 million or so of external capital, which at the time we contemplated would be sourced through the combination of 2 debt offerings. We're early in the year, a lot can change, and we'll see what will happen. In our Q1 reforecast, we assumed that we do only about $700 million of incremental debt this year and probably use about $100 million or so of net disposition proceeds from the acquisition -- disposition activity that's underway. So not a lot of change. \n So 2 debt deals, we have $250 million of hedges in place that we intend to apply to our first debt deal. The $250 million are basically effectively struck at a 3.7%, 10-year rate. So if we were to do a small debt deal, we'd probably be looking at the cost of debt today, somewhere in the low 5% range versus an unhedged 10-year debt deal that would be more like [ 5 6, 5 7 ]. \n So we're in great shape. I mean it kind of goes back to Ben's initial comments. We have a terrifically strong balance sheet, lots of free cash flow, low leverage at 4.3x, and well-laddered debt maturities that typically range from $500 million a year to $800 million or so a year. \n Next year is a little bit more elevated, but it's still just over 2 points of our capitalization. So relative to the broader REIT industry, even that maturity is a modest one. That $825 million breaks down into a June maturity in 2025 at around 3.6%, and then there's another $300 million in November 2025, also at around 3.6%. \n So our maturities are spaced out roughly 6 months apart. They're relatively light and level across the spectrum. And so we're well positioned to kind of roll those debt maturities as they come due. We do not currently anticipate prepaying them. And certainly with debt rates where they are today, which is relatively unattractive compared to the expiring rate. It's unlikely we would pull that forward to retire them early. So we'll probably address those as they come due. And again, this is a pretty light year for capital markets activity, including debt, and we'll take things as they come. \nJames Feldman: Great. That's very helpful. And then for the next year, would you put a hedge on early? And when would you want to do that? \nKevin O'Shea: Yes. Jamie, it's sort of -- one of the -- hedging is something we do. We evaluate continually over the course of the year. We don't have rigid fixed plans to hedge X percent of debt maturity, in advance of its maturity. It's really a function of what do we anticipate doing in the current year and the following year? And how do we think about our evolving sense of the capital plan that we'll have for each of those years and what the opportunity set looks like in the treasury market for hedging. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lewis with Truist Securities. \nMichael Lewis: I know we're already going long, but I have just one question. And it relates to a topic you talked a lot about, which is the Sunbelt versus the established regions and what 2025 and 2026 are going to look like. When I look at your Slide 8, 1.3% growth, unit growth in your established regions in '25 versus 2.5% in the Sunbelt. It's not really clear to me where the advantage lies there, right? In other words, what should that spread be? \n Because once you layer demand onto it, if I'm just looking at households created versus units added, it looks to me like maybe your expansion regions are going to have better fundamentals than your established ones in '25 and more likely '26. So I'm just wondering, what do you think is an equilibrium for that difference in supply? It's just not clear to me that there's a big advantage there. \nBenjamin Schall: Yes, Michael, I'll make a couple of comments. So starts in the Sunbelt expected to peak at some point kind of mid this year, stay elevated as you get through kind of the middle of next year. And then given the reduction in start volume, starts to come down back towards more historical levels as you get towards the end of 2025. So I think that was sort of part of your comment there. \n Now the impacts on markets as deals deliver, to my comments earlier, will be more extended. And then if you look further out, you're exactly right. It is both obviously demand and supply story. And for us, it very much leads into how do we think about our overall portfolio optimization. \n And broadly, that's the reason we're headed towards 25% in the expansion markets. We think that's a nice addition. Also continue to feel very strongly about the performance opportunity in our South region. So there's more into that we went into the Investor Day, but that is as we get into a more normalized environment, leading to how we think about our longer-term optimization goals. \nMichael Lewis: Okay. So if 2.5% supply growth in the Sunbelt next year, is that -- I mean it sounds like you think things are going to kind of gradually get better. But I mean, is that a concerning number versus the 1.3% established regions? Or are those pretty -- you think fundamentals in those 2 parts of your portfolio might start to look pretty similar next year? \nBenjamin Schall: I think they start to approach closer to historical norms for a period of time. Matt made the comment earlier about now the barriers to starting deals in the Sunbelt and the shortness of those market cycles. So it does factor into how do we think about our overall portfolio optimization. \nSean Breslin: And Mike, one thing, I think, to keep in mind here is I'd be a little careful about isolating years as being very unique in terms of the delivery cycle and the impact on fundamentals. As Ben was alluding to earlier, what you see on that chart in terms of deliveries for 2024, where it does peak in the back half of this year, people will be leasing up. Putting those units into the market 12 to 13 months beyond sort of the initial delivery dates in terms of how they're leasing them up. \n And if you think of the impact on pricing, you've got those deliveries coming in plus you have new deliveries that are beginning in 2025. So the units coming in to market takes a long period of time for them to lease up. And the impact on stabilized assets takes time as rents are reset to a new sort of market clearing price. \n As those leases expire, it has to roll through the rent roll. So when you sort of take the compounded effect, I think that's why we're saying that for 2025, we feel much better about our performance in the established regions relative to the Sunbelt. And that should carry into 2026, given the time it takes to lease up the assets and those new prices to be reflected in stabilized asset rent rolls, if that makes sense. \nMichael Lewis: Yes. '23 was a high supply year, too, right? Understood. \nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the floor back to Ben Schall for closing remarks. \nBenjamin Schall: All right. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your engagement and support, and we'll talk with you soon. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our call for today. All parties may disconnect.",

            "name": "Matthew Birenbaum",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Sean. Turning to our development communities. Slide 15 details the continued impressive results being generated by our lease-ups. The 6 development communities that had active leasing in Q1 are delivering rents $295 per month or 10% above our initial underwriting, which is translating into a 40 basis point increase in yield. \n And this performance is being supported by strong traffic and leasing velocity with these assets averaging 30 net leases per month in the seasonally slow first quarter, which grew throughout the quarter to nearly 40 per month in March. This outperformance is driven by 2 primary factors. \n First, since we conservatively don't trend rents and report our development economics based on projected NOI at the time of construction start until the communities enter lease-up, there's usually rent growth during the construction period, which provides some incremental lift to our development yields by the time of their completion. And second, while we are pretty good at predicting how the market will respond to our latest state-of-the-art product offerings and new development, we do still frequently see some additional premium as the market responds to the unit and community features we incorporate into our designs. \n Turning to Slide 16. While it was a quiet quarter for investment activity with no closed transactions or development starts, our investment plans for the year are still very much on track. We brought 4 assets in our established regions to the market in Q1, looking to take advantage of a potential lull in the investment sales market as many owners were waiting for interest rate cuts before getting going with their disposition plans. All 4 are now under agreement at pricing, consistent with our initial expectations with a weighted average cap rate of 5.1%. \n We expect to redeploy some of the proceeds from these pending sales into acquisitions in our expansion regions in the coming months as we continue to make progress on our portfolio optimization objectives to increase our expansion market allocation to 25% over time. Planning for development starts is also proceeding as expected with our start activity this year concentrated in Q2 and Q3. We are seeing some helpful construction buyout savings in certain regions, which will allow us to preserve our targeted spread of 100 to 150 basis points between development yields and prevailing cap rates. \n And in our SIP book, we continue to be conservative but do expect to grow that business line modestly through the course of the year. Fortunately, the $200 million in commitments in the program today were all originated in the last 2 years, are geographically dispersed across our markets, concentrated in submarkets with less new supply pressure and have initial maturity dates that are still 2-plus years out. So we do not have any legacy overhang burdening our loan book. \n It's also been interesting to see some larger portfolio transactions start to gain traction just in the past few weeks. This illustrates the continued attractiveness of our sector to private the capital and perhaps marks a shift in sentiment that might bring increased deal flow as the year progresses. We continue to preserve dry powder on our balance sheet so that we will be in a position to take advantage of future opportunities that may emerge, if they are aligned with our strategic priorities and our unique capabilities. \n And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben to wrap things up. Yes. Sure. Nick, it's Matt. I would say the discount replacement cost is obviously going to vary to some extent based on the age of the asset. I mean, in theory, assets that are 10, 20 years old should be trading below replacement cost because there is some depreciation there. \n But we are -- I'd say we are seeing assets that are 10 years old. It might be trading 15% to 20% below current replacement cost. We haven't seen kind of brand-new assets coming out of lease-up come to market yet at compelling prices. I think people are getting extensions on their construction loans, and there's a pretty active bridge lending space. So we would look at those as well. \n So younger assets, I would expect the discount to be a little bit less than that, but we haven't seen as much of that yet. The volume has been [ light ]. And that's one reason that supported cap rates honestly being lower than I would have thought they would have been, but there is a little bit of a scarcity premium. And on the one hand, we're taking advantage of that as a seller, and that's one reason we brought some assets to market early because we anticipated that might happen. But as a buyer, that's a little bit frustrating. Yes. I mean, who knows? I would say that there is more volume coming. And if you talk to the brokers, they'll say they're pretty busy with [ BOVs ]. This is the seasonal time of the year when you start to see an uptick in transaction volume. \n Q1 volumes were down over -- below Q1 '23, which was down a lot from Q1 '22. And transaction volumes are now below where they were kind of in '17, '18, '19. So I think you will start to see some pickup in what might be available. And certainly, from our point of view, we're staying disciplined about it. But we are hopeful that we might move into an environment where we'll be able to start to accelerate our asset trading activity a little bit. We haven't done that much in the last, say, 4 or 5 quarters. Sure. Well, the first thing I'd say is none of them have closed yet. So be able to provide more detail at the end -- on the second quarter call. But it's a pretty good mix. Three of the 4 assets are AVAs, so a little bit more urban than what we've been selling in the past, one in Jersey, one in Seattle, one in Boston, one in Southern California. So a good mix of geographies. And it continues to be a little bit of a bifurcated market. \n So the ones -- the smaller deals, kind of less than $100 million, tend to be either private buyers, [ 1031 ] buyers, syndicators, little bit less institutional. And then when you get into bigger assets, that's where probably those buyers are using less leverage. And the cap rates are little bit lower if you can find -- if that's more of an institutional bid. \n But there's plenty of assets that are not getting that institutional bid. So it does really vary based on kind of where you are. And -- but one of the things that was a pleasant surprise is that even -- we have one larger urban asset, urban Boston, which is a relatively [ fair ] market. And the bid was probably deeper there than any of the others actually. Yes, Steve, I guess, we -- there's actually -- it's not one number. There are different target yields for different markets and even down to different submarkets and also based on the risk profile of the deal. But we're generally looking for that 100 to 150 basis point spread to cap rates. What that's translating into kind of on average is probably a mid- to high 6s target yield. And then it's going to be lower in markets where deals that are less risky or markets where we expect stronger growth because ultimately, it's about the full investment return, the IRR. And it's going to be higher in markets that have the inverse of that. \n And so where you see where deals actually clearing those today, we expect to start a deal in suburban Boston in kind of the mid 6s, which maps well to where cap rates are in those markets. We expect to start a deal in suburban Jersey, which is around a 7 because cap rates are higher in that market. And then Mid-Atlantic, it would also be around the 7, and then some of our expansion regions that might be a little lower than that, closer to 6. John, it's Matt. So the only deal that we have that matures next year '25 is a very small $13 million loan in Northern New Jersey, very stable, strong market. So all the other ones don't mature until '26 or later. So it wasn't necessarily kind of first in, first out, so to speak. \n So it's still quite a ways out there. And we're still building the book. So we haven't really focused too much on reinvesting, getting that money back. We're still -- we're at $200 million in the program today. I think our long-term goal is for it to be around 400, 400 or 500. So we're hoping to grow that total balance maybe $75 million this year and then continue from there in '26. At some point, yes, we'll have to -- we'll face that revolving door where we start getting redemptions. But we're still, at least, a couple of years away from that. Yes. Anne, it's Matt. So our asset preservation CapEx has been pretty consistent over the last -- well, between '23 and '24, around $1,600, $1,700 a unit, which is, I guess, roughly 6% or 7% of NOI, 7%. The NOI-enhancing CapEx, that's where we really increased our investment or we're looking to increase our investment volume quite a bit. I think we invested about $75 million, $80 million last year across the whole portfolio, most of which I guess was same store. We're looking to double that this year. \n A lot of that is driven by expanded solar production and by expanded the opportunity for the accessory dwelling units in California that we talked about it at Investor Day. And we think that's an opportunity that's out there for the next couple of years. So we're excited about that. And I would think that there will be the opportunity to continue to have those increased opportunities, at least, for the next couple of years. Yes. Amy, it's Matt. It is certainly true that there's less barriers. There's less regulatory barriers to entry in the Southern markets. And so supply is able to respond to demand much more quickly. And some of the supply kind of excesses you're seeing now are -- were a relatively quick market response to tremendous demand a couple of years ago that really started with COVID in some of those Southern or Sunbelt markets. So it is, I'd say, a shorter cycle, a more attenuated cycle. Demand comes, supply can respond quickly. But having said that, there is a lot of demand there. And the interplay between those 2 factors into our view on kind of our long-term portfolio allocation and trying to get to 25% there. \n The other thing I would say is submarkets matter a lot. And there are -- even within some of these geographies and particularly the expansion markets that we selected, there are submarkets that do have some meaningful supply barriers. And those are certainly the submarkets that are more attractive to us, both for acquisitions -- and we're pretty good at unlocking those constraints on the development side. So you'll see that inform our portfolio strategy within each region. Land costs? Yes. So it varies, obviously, a lot by region. In some regions, we have seen, particularly in some of our [indiscernible] regions, we have seen land prices come down significantly for motivated sellers. There's plenty of sellers kind of like the assets we're talking about, who are not particularly -- there's no time sensitivity, and they're holding out. \n But one of the deals we actually highlighted at our Investor Day was the deal in suburban Boston in Quincy. That's the deal we're looking to start in Q2 in suburban Boston, where that land -- we were able to buy that land at probably 40% less than where it had been under contract before, say, in '21 or '22. \n So we are seeing that to some extent. In the expansion regions, land pricing has probably come off a little bit in Florida, where it had gotten incredibly aggressive. But we haven't necessarily seen significant moves down in land costs. \n Partially, I would say that's because in many of the expansion regions, the land is a much smaller percentage of the total deal cap than it is, say, in California or New York, where land might be 30%, 40% of your total deal cap. It moves a lot. It's very high beta. \n If you're doing a garden deal in Charlotte, land might only be 10% of your total deal cap. So it's not going to move the needle as much, and it's not going to be as sensitive really in either direction. So it's been -- land prices tend to be sticky in general. They've probably been stickier in those markets where, obviously, they were cheaper to begin with. Alex, it's Matt. I would say no. Our developer funding program is really focused on expanding our growth in our expansion regions. So we're not looking to grow our capital investment in New York. Yes. I mean -- this is Matt. It was really just a broader comment. When you look at our portfolio allocation, our portfolio allocation to the New York Metro area, I think, is roughly 20% today. It has been -- and we've been on a journey to reduce that over time. That's one of the regions we're rotating capital out of as we redeploy capital into our expansion regions. \n So first and foremost, we're just overweight that region relative to our long-term goal. And then there are -- when you talk about New York specifically, more of our investment in the New York region is going to New Jersey these days. We're finding very strong development yields, pretty good operating performance. And there is a regulatory overlay there, which it can be challenging, but it is not as challenging as New York State and New York City, and that does factor into our long-term view as well."

            "name": "Kevin O'Shea",
            "content": "Yes, John, this is Kevin. Really, the $0.02 from better-than-expected capital markets activity was primarily driven by a combination of favorable interest expense and interest income as well as slightly higher budgeted -- higher-than-budgeted capital interest expense. So it's really in those categories where most of the favorability was realized. Well, I was referring to Q1. We didn't have any transactions that closed in Q1. So transaction activity cap rates did not really have an impact. As you look at the full year guidance, we expect basically due to adjustments in a range of things that fall with the capital markets activity such as buying and selling assets and then movement of interest rates on existing debt and additional debt activity that we have anticipated. \n We anticipate getting $0.01 of the $0.02 back and being net favorable by $0.01 for the full year on capital markets, in terms of our core FFO relative to our initial outlook. So we're early in the year in terms of what we will do broadly in terms of transaction activity, capital markets activity. So haven't made a lot of adjustments, but there's been some movement that caused that additional $0.01 shortfall in the back half, back 3 quarters of the year that leave us sort of getting $0.01 of the $0.02 back later in the year on that line item. Yes. Sure, Jamie. This is Kevin. Maybe just to kind of provide some context, I'll just start with our capital plan for the year. It's not changed significantly from our initial outlook. And as you recall, what we identified then and it's still true today is that for 2024, we have $1.4 billion in uses, which consists of $1.1 billion of investment spend and then a $300 million debt maturity later this year in November, which has a 3.7% interest rate. \n So that's the usage we've got for this year. Our sources are pretty straightforward and have kind of 3 broad parts, $400 million of free cash flow. We anticipate drawing down about $175 million of unrestricted cash that we had at the beginning of the year and ending the year with 2 25 in cash at the end of the year. \n And then our [ initial outlook ] contemplated about $850 million or so of external capital, which at the time we contemplated would be sourced through the combination of 2 debt offerings. We're early in the year, a lot can change, and we'll see what will happen. In our Q1 reforecast, we assumed that we do only about $700 million of incremental debt this year and probably use about $100 million or so of net disposition proceeds from the acquisition -- disposition activity that's underway. So not a lot of change. \n So 2 debt deals, we have $250 million of hedges in place that we intend to apply to our first debt deal. The $250 million are basically effectively struck at a 3.7%, 10-year rate. So if we were to do a small debt deal, we'd probably be looking at the cost of debt today, somewhere in the low 5% range versus an unhedged 10-year debt deal that would be more like [ 5 6, 5 7 ]. \n So we're in great shape. I mean it kind of goes back to Ben's initial comments. We have a terrifically strong balance sheet, lots of free cash flow, low leverage at 4.3x, and well-laddered debt maturities that typically range from $500 million a year to $800 million or so a year. \n Next year is a little bit more elevated, but it's still just over 2 points of our capitalization. So relative to the broader REIT industry, even that maturity is a modest one. That $825 million breaks down into a June maturity in 2025 at around 3.6%, and then there's another $300 million in November 2025, also at around 3.6%. \n So our maturities are spaced out roughly 6 months apart. They're relatively light and level across the spectrum. And so we're well positioned to kind of roll those debt maturities as they come due. We do not currently anticipate prepaying them. And certainly with debt rates where they are today, which is relatively unattractive compared to the expiring rate. It's unlikely we would pull that forward to retire them early. So we'll probably address those as they come due. And again, this is a pretty light year for capital markets activity, including debt, and we'll take things as they come. Yes. Jamie, it's sort of -- one of the -- hedging is something we do. We evaluate continually over the course of the year. We don't have rigid fixed plans to hedge X percent of debt maturity, in advance of its maturity. It's really a function of what do we anticipate doing in the current year and the following year? And how do we think about our evolving sense of the capital plan that we'll have for each of those years and what the opportunity set looks like in the treasury market for hedging."

            "name": "Benjamin Schall",
            "content": "Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined by Sean Breslin, our Chief Operating Officer; Matt Birenbaum, our Chief Investment Officer; and Kevin O'Shea, our Chief Financial Officer. Sean will speak to our operating outperformance year-to-date and our positive momentum as we enter the prime leasing season. Matt will discuss the continued outperformance of our developments and lease-up and how we are strategically deploying capital to generate value. And Kevin is here for questions and is more than happy to speak to our preeminent balance sheet and liquidity profile. \n Utilizing our earnings presentation. Slide 4 provides the highlights for the quarter and identify these key themes as we look ahead. First and foremost, we are off to a strong start to 2024 with first quarter results outpacing expectations. We were able to build occupancy earlier than expected, and we also experienced meaningful improvements in bad debt in February and March. \n Second, we feel well positioned as we enter the peak leasing season, given low turnover, solid occupancy and positive rental rate momentum. We also expect our suburban coastal footprint to continue to outperform, given steady and improved demand drivers and [indiscernible] delivering in our markets versus the rest of the country. \n Given our first quarter outperformance, applications for Q2 and improvement in underlying trends, we have increased our full year guidance. We also remain laser-focused on executing on our strategic initiatives, including our operating model transformation. We remain on track here to deliver $80 million incremental annual NOI uplift from our operating [indiscernible], a target we raised from $55 million at our Investor Day in November. \n And finally, with one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, we are focused on growth opportunities in which we can tap our strategic capabilities from our operating prowess to our development strength to drive outsized returns for shareholders. With that summary, let me go a layer deeper on our results, the wider supply and demand backdrop and our increase to guidance. \n For the quarter, as shown on Slide 5, we produced core FFO growth of 5.1%, which was 350 basis points above our prior outlook. Same-store revenue growth increased 4.2% and 90 basis points better than our prior outlook. And our developments and lease-up are seeing strong absorption and achieving rents and returns above pro forma. \n Slide 6 shows the components of the Q1 core FFO outperformance with the bulk of the increase coming from higher same-store NOI. Revenues exceeded our prior outlook by $0.04. Expenses in the first quarter were $0.03 better than expected, while we note that $0.02 of this $0.03 is estimated to be timing related or in other words, expenses we still expect to incur just later in the year than we had originally forecast. \n Turning to Slide 7. Demand for our portfolio is benefiting from more job growth than originally forecasted. For our job growth estimates, we look to the National Association of Business Economics, or NABE, which has now increased its estimate to 1.6 million new jobs in 2024, up from the prior estimate of 700,000 jobs. This better job outlook provides an incremental list of demand, not necessarily on the same trajectory as it may have in the past, given that a disproportionate share of these additional jobs may be part-time and seem to be more concentrated in lower-paying sectors of the economy. \n As shown on the right-hand side of Slide 7, demand for [indiscernible] also continues to benefit from the differential in the cost of owning a home versus renting. This is true across most of the country but particularly pronounced in our markets, given the level of home prices, resulting in it being more than $2,000 per month more expensive to own versus rent a home. And this differential translates into record low numbers of residents leaving us to buy a home. \n Turning to supply on Slide 8. As we emphasized at our Investor Day, our suburban coastal portfolio, 71% suburban today and headed towards 80% suburban, faces significantly less new supply than many of our peers. In our established regions, deliveries will be 1.5% of stock this year and in line with historical averages. \n In the Sunbelt, by contrast, deliveries will be 3.8% of stock in 2024, significantly above historical averages. And with the lease-up of a typical project taking an additional 12 to 18 months, the pressure on rents and occupancy in the Sunbelt will last, at least, through the end of 2025, if not into 2026. \n This weaker operating performance in the Sunbelt is, in turn, starting to weigh on asset values there, which provides a more attractive opportunity for us to acquire assets below replacement costs as we continue on our journey of growing our expansion market portfolio from 8% today to our 25% target. With the supply demand backdrop and our outperformance year-to-date, we are increasing our full year core FFO guidance estimate to $10.91 per share for a 2.6% increase relative to 2023. \n With the detail on Slides 9 and 10, the bulk of the increase is in higher NOI driven mainly by higher revenue with same-store revenue growth now projected to be 3.1%, up from 2.6% in our original outlook. \n Before turning it to Sean, I'd also like to take a moment to thank the team and the wider AvalonBay associate base, who continue to execute at a high level and above plan. It is energizing to see the organization executing on the priorities that we detailed at our Investor Day, a collective set of initiatives that we are confident will deliver superior growth in the near term and in the years ahead. \n And with that, I'll turn it to Sean to go deeper and provide his perspectives. Thanks, Matt. Our results to date have exceeded our expectations, and we're excited for the momentum we have heading into the peak leasing season. Demand is stronger than originally expected, and our suburban coastal portfolio faces meaningfully less supply than elsewhere in the country. And we're confident that we will find opportunities to put our balance sheet and strategic capabilities to work to generate shareholder value. \n I'll end our prepared remarks there and turn it to the operator to open the line for questions. Nick, I'll add a couple of comments, guess it's well put by Matt. I generally see as our window of opportunity being open for a decent period of time and 2 primary reasons: one, the supply dynamics that exist in the Sunbelt. Per my prepared remarks, we expect to be with us for a period of time. So that softness on rate and occupancy and a weight on asset values is we think, we'll be here. \n And then the second part is on kind of the capital world, which we're really just at the front part of the wave of maturities of deals done 2, 3, 4 years ago. So I agree with Matt, not seeing a ton today would -- also not seeing a ton of dislocation, but it is still early. And we think we're well prepared to take advantage of it for the right types of opportunities. Yes, Jamie, I'll start with a couple of comments. So one is just the sort of the facts and the known dynamics that exist. Supply in the Sunbelt, yes, it is going to be peaking later this year, but it is going to remain elevated into 2025. \n Second known dynamic is we know when projects are -- we know which projects are under construction, you know when those projects are completing, and you know the period of time associated with lease-up. So that inherently takes you out another 12 to 15 months depending on the size of the project and the velocity of that lease-up. \n And then the third dynamic, and this gets into the impact on NOI is the rolling through of rent rolls over that period of time. And so when you then think about sort of the last dynamic and the last effective NOI impact, that gets you into that early 2026 type of time frame. \n It's the area where, in our minds, it's sort of -- it's one of those known industry dynamics. And to the extent the economic scenario has gotten better, but in a, call it, a slower growth economic environment, overlaid on high supply in certain submarkets, we expect there to continue to be pressure. Yes. Austin would also be at the top of that list. Just look at percentage of stock coming online. That would be high up on the list. Generally, in the Sunbelt markets, the more urban-oriented submarkets are generally seeing the highest levels of supply coming online. And that's one of the reasons we've been conscious as we've been growing our expansion market portfolio to really push ourselves out further into those marketplaces out of a submarket or 2 with lower density product, lower price point. That is competing less directly with new supply. It is. Yes, that's been a very conscious choice of ours. And we also think about it as complementing what we're buying with what we're going to be building. And so even to make the point further, what we've been buying tends to be slightly older product, lower price point, lower density products. Recognizing that our development, while it still will be suburban, will tend to be mid-rise and a little bit higher price point, once it comes to market. So we think about that as just our overall -- we talk about at a portfolio level optimization, but we also very much focus on it in terms of a market and a submarket perspective. I mean the rent versus own economics that we're seeing today are really unique, not something that we've seen. We've obviously, over time, seen small variations in that. But the combination of home price appreciation, particularly in our markets and the rise in mortgage rates has led to all-time levels, right? \n I mean you're approaching where it's some of our markets 2x more expensive to own versus rent. And if we think about it kind of longer term and looking forward, I would frame it as that's an incremental cushion that we have that's supporting our demand on rental economics. So it may not stay as peak as it is today. Obviously, part of that is based on the trajectory of interest rates. But there's a nice cushion that should serve as a tailwind for us for a number of years. Yes. I'll add to that. And as we're thinking about the opportunity set in the Sunbelt, we've got in the near term, the ability to buy below replacement cost and be at a good basis and find that attractive from a long-term hold perspective. We are increasingly also focused on bringing our strategic capabilities and particularly our operating model initiatives. \n It's been driving a lot on growth for our existing assets, but we're increasingly bringing that to new assets that we bring into the fold. And as we get more and more density in the Sunbelt and our expansion markets, we expect that flywheel to accelerate. There is the land side and the opportunity with less competition in these markets to be finding attractive land structured appropriately, some of which will make sense to start more immediately and some of which could position us longer term to generate value. \n And then kind of a fourth driver of value for us is in a world where capital is less abundant, our ability to provide capital to other developers. And we've used that as a tool for growth in our expansion regions. And for sure, in today's environment are seeing a better quality sponsor, better quality real estate, better return profile there. So it's that combination of opportunities that we'll tap into to drive our longer-term expansion of those markets. Alex, I'll just add briefly. We've highlighted the improved job picture, right, given the change in expectations from the beginning of the year. But there are crosswinds, Sean touched on a couple. And I would highlight the inflationary impacts on our consumer and their wallet. I mean those are very much there and true when you think about car loans, I'm coming up for renewal, when you think about the beginning of student loan repayment. So the outlook has improved, but I would still describe it generally as sort of our consumer facing a series of crosswinds. Yes, Michael, I'll make a couple of comments. So starts in the Sunbelt expected to peak at some point kind of mid this year, stay elevated as you get through kind of the middle of next year. And then given the reduction in start volume, starts to come down back towards more historical levels as you get towards the end of 2025. So I think that was sort of part of your comment there. \n Now the impacts on markets as deals deliver, to my comments earlier, will be more extended. And then if you look further out, you're exactly right. It is both obviously demand and supply story. And for us, it very much leads into how do we think about our overall portfolio optimization. \n And broadly, that's the reason we're headed towards 25% in the expansion markets. We think that's a nice addition. Also continue to feel very strongly about the performance opportunity in our South region. So there's more into that we went into the Investor Day, but that is as we get into a more normalized environment, leading to how we think about our longer-term optimization goals. I think they start to approach closer to historical norms for a period of time. Matt made the comment earlier about now the barriers to starting deals in the Sunbelt and the shortness of those market cycles. So it does factor into how do we think about our overall portfolio optimization. All right. And thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your engagement and support, and we'll talk with you soon."

            "name": "Sean Breslin",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Ben. Turning to Slide 11. The primary drivers of our 90 basis points of revenue growth outperformance in Q1 were economic occupancy, which accounted for roughly 1/3 of the total outperformance for the quarter; and underlying bad debt, which represented another roughly 20%. \n Occupancy was about 30 basis points higher than expected, an increase from the mid-95% range at the end of last year to the high 95s for the quarter. While we expected occupancy to grow during Q1, it increased more quickly than we anticipated, reflecting strength in the underlying demand for our primarily coastal suburban portfolio and very limited new supply. \n In terms of underlying bad debt from residents. We ended up about 25 basis points favorable to our original expectations for the quarter, with all the improvement being realized in February and March. January was in line with budget at roughly 2.2% [indiscernible] declined materially to 1.8% in February and again to 1.6% in March, which is roughly 60 basis points below our original budget. \n We experienced a similar dip in May of last year. The bad debt has been reverted to higher levels in June. Therefore, while we're encouraged by results in February and March, we need to see a few more months at these lower levels to feel confident that we'll experience consistently better performance moving forward. \n From a geographic perspective, the favorable variance to our initial expectations was more material in New England, New York, New Jersey, Seattle and, to a lesser degree, in Northern and Southern California. \n Moving to Slide 12. Key portfolio indicators are very healthy during Q1, and our portfolio is well positioned for the prime leasing season. In Chart 1, turnover remains well below historical norms, in part due to a very low level of move-outs to purchase a home. \n During Q1, only 7% of our residents moved out of one of our communities to purchase a home. It wasn't that long ago that we highlighted 12% to 13% of move-outs, purchasing a home as being low. 7% is extremely low relative to the long-term average of 16% to 17% and certainly reflects the favorable rent versus own economics in our established regions as Ben referenced earlier. \n Given the low level of turnover, availability has been relatively stable and supportive of above-average asking rent growth recently, which is reflected in Chart 3 and accelerating rent change, which is reflected in Chart 4. \n As expected, our East Coast regions delivered the strongest rent change in Q1 at 2.7% with the East Coast established regions trending at 3% range, while Florida was sub-1%. We experienced positive momentum in rent change throughout the quarter across the East Coast markets, which was particularly notable in Mid-Atlantic, while performance in the District of Columbia has been soft and volatile due to a number of issues, including the impact of new supply. \n The Northern Virginia and Maryland suburbs have demonstrated continued positive momentum. Rent change for the West Coast regions was 1.3% during the quarter, with the Seattle market leading at 2.8%, which further increased into the mid-4% range for April. While urban Seattle is still soft due to a significant amount of new supply and weaker demand, performance across our primary suburban portfolio improved meaningfully during the quarter. \n In Northern California, while the underpinnings of better performance are starting to appear, it's not yet having a meaningful impact on current performance. Rent change was flat for the quarter with a positive rent change in San Jose being offset by negative rent change in San Francisco and the East Bay. \n Transitioning to Slide 13 to address our updated revenue outlook for the year. We now expect same-store revenue growth of 3.1% for 2024, an increase of 50 basis points from our original guidance. The increased outlook is primarily driven by stronger lease rates as higher occupancy at the start of the year has allowed us to begin to achieve higher rental rates than we originally anticipated as we move into the prime leasing season. \n We now expect like-term effective rent change in the mid-2% range, about a 50 basis point increase from our original outlook. The second quarter should trend up into the low 3% range before decelerating in the back half of the year, consistent with seasonal norms. \n We expect renewals in the low to mid-4% range for the balance of the year, while new move-ins average roughly 50 basis points, which reflects the low 2% range for Q2 move-ins before experiencing the normal seasonal decline in Q3 and Q4. In addition, we're projecting a greater contribution from the improvement in underlying bad debt with a full year rate of 1.7%, down from 2.4% last year and slightly more rent relief. \n And finally, moving to Slide 14, you can see where we're projecting stronger revenue performance relative to our original outlook. We're expecting the most significant improvement in Seattle and New England, which outperformed our expectations in Q1 and accelerated further into April, with both regions delivering greater than 4% rent change followed by Metro New York. \n The Mid-Atlantic is expected to modestly outperform our original expectations, supported by stronger performance in Northern Virginia and suburban Maryland. Southern California is also expected to perform modestly better than our original outlook, and we haven't changed our forecast for Northern California. \n So I'll turn it over to Matt to address recent lease-up performance and our capital allocation plan for 2024. Matt? Yes, so it's Sean. Good question and the question, I think, on a lot of people's minds. I think the way I describe it is, first, supply should not be an issue for an extended period of time. There are 1 or 2 assets in San Francisco as an example that are finishing lease-up. \n But given the nature of the product, economics, timelines, that won't be an issue for a long period of time. It's really more on the demand side and making sure that I think for the most part, what we're hearing on the ground is that we really just do need business leaders to be more confident in bringing people back to their respective offices and opening offices in San Francisco. \n What's underneath that is making sure that the associate population for all those various employers is comfortable being in that market, kind of living [indiscernible] life issues. Certainly, the political dynamic has started to shift in a meaningful way. There seems to be some positive momentum there, but that takes time. \n So that's why I'd say that, that is probably the most important thing. Obviously, job growth matters, and it's been a little bit choppy. But we are seeing some good signs of life, particularly given the generative AI boom, so to speak. But it has not manifested itself into thousands of jobs showing up yet in these markets. \n And so I think the broad view around technology and that being the epicenter of sort of technology innovation is still present, more the confidence about bringing people back to work, particularly in San Francisco, I would say. We're starting to see signs of life of that in San Jose. There's more short-term demand than there has been for the last couple of years. That's an initial indicator that's positive. But it's sort of a mixed bag as it relates to San Francisco and certain parts of the East Bay. Yes. I mean as it relates to this trend at asking rents, that's primarily driven by the East Coast markets. And if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, the East Coast markets are up 2% to 3% versus the West Coast markets are up about 1% roughly. That's being supported by markets like San Diego, Orange County, parts of L.A. Certainly, Seattle has had a nice recovery. \n We've been surprised, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about Seattle. The trends and the firming in Seattle certainly seems to have sort of a greater foundation to it than what we've seen in the Bay Area just yet. And part of what's driving the effective rent change in Seattle in Q1 and into April is a pretty significant reduction in concessions. \n Concession volume for us, as an example, from Q4 to Q1, it was down about 70%. We incurred almost 900,000 in concessions in Q4 versus [ 275 ] in Q1 of '24 versus in the Bay Area, it was down about 20%. So you're seeing good trends, but I would say it's not being broadly supported yet by Northern California, more so the Southern California markets in Seattle as it relates to the West Coast. Yes, Steve, it's Sean. It's really 2 factors. One is what you described. We've seen sort of a faster improvement in occupancy. We experienced that in Q1. That is quickly translating to rate acceleration, which actually puts a little bit of pressure on occupancy. \n And the other thing, if you think about it from a revenue standpoint with higher rates, the dollar value of each vacant unit is actually higher. So it doesn't contribute as much to revenue as you might think when you look at it from that perspective. Anything that is vacant is worth more, and so it does sort of weigh on the revenue side of it. But those are the 2 primary reasons. In terms of physical occupancy, we expect it to be roughly about a push by the time we get to year-end relative to our original guidance. And that's why it shows up that way on the slide. Yes. You're correct. I did not state renewal offers. But renewal offers for May and June are around the high 5% range. So expecting them to settle sort of in the low to mid 4s is reasonable based on historical norms. Yes, Adam, it's Sean. Good question. And one of the factors to keep in mind is what's changing in underlying bad debt across the markets. If you think about it, it was like rent change is one component, but changes in occupancy, bad debt, et cetera. And particularly for the Southern California market, I would say that is a meaningful contributor to total revenue growth in 2024. \n To give you some sense in the first quarter, I think Southern California, roughly 40% of the revenue growth was related to just better underlying bad debt as we're -- those folks out, seeing the churn and then rerenting those units to people who are paying. So that is a driver. There's a table in the back. There are lots of attachment that gives you the change that we're seeing over the last few quarters in bad debt, and that may help you kind of map a little bit better. Yes. What I mentioned in my prepared remarks is that we expect like-term effective rent change kind of in the mid-2% range, which is about 50 basis points above our original outlook. What I indicated is that the second quarter should trend up probably in the low 3% range before decelerating in the back half of the year. \n As it relates to renewals, kind of low to mid-4% range for the balance of the year, while new move-ins averaged roughly 50 basis points, which sort of reflects maybe the low 2% range for Q2, before experiencing kind of the normal seasonal decline in Q3 and Q4. So that's kind of how we're looking at it right now. Yes. I mean the forecast for this year reflected being a relatively stable level. Obviously, interest rates bounce around, prices bounce around. But in terms of the current year outlook sort of reflects generally where we are at this point in time have remained relatively stable. Anne, this is Sean. I mean it's early in the calendar year for some of the assessment cycles that really are more heavily weighted towards kind of midyear and the back half of the year. What we have seen thus far is a little bit of an uptick in Washington State and Virginia. \n We don't have insight into all the jurisdictions just yet. But in terms of our portfolio, that's what we're aware of. There's a lag as it relates to property tax assessed values. So our expectation would be there'll probably be more pressure on the Sunbelt based on the run-up that occurred sort of through COVID that's still working its way through the system before you see it in the next couple of years maybe start to move the other direction. So we haven't seen clear evidence of that for 2024 just yet, but that's kind of the high-level view. No, not really, Brad. I mean low 3%, 3.2%, 3.3%, somewhere in that ballpark. I mean we've seen asking rent growth kind of 5.5% or so through yesterday. That's played through just renewal offers that have already been made in terms of what our expectation is for rate growth. So it seems like somewhere in that range for the second quarter is reasonable. And then you will have to see how asking rent growth continues as we move through the second quarter. Yes. What I would say, first, in terms of the expansion regions is we have relatively small portfolios in our same-store basket in those regions. So as you think of the expansion markets in Texas, for example, we don't have anything in Austin. There's only 2 assets in Dallas. We have seen -- at least in Q1, we saw a year-over-year increase in concession volume in Dallas. In the previous year, it was about 1/3 of all leases. It was roughly about half in Q1. \n So Dallas -- Dallas is really a market, very large geography, broadly diversified, really depends on where you are. There are some submarkets where it's well over a month for almost every lease. There are other submarkets where it's half a month for some level of volume. So it really depends on where you are. \n If you move to the Denver market, it's really a story of urban versus suburban, as I think Ben referred to earlier. If you're in the urban submarkets where we have one operating asset, concessions are much more [indiscernible] as compared to the suburbs where we have most of our assets. \n And then in terms of our other expansion regions. In Charlotte, it's a similar story as Denver. We have some assets in the South end. Concessions are more pronounced there, average closer to 0.5 month for probably 50%, 60% of the leases versus you move to sort of the northern suburbs, it's quite a bit less. \n And then in Florida. Florida is a little more of an effective rent kind of market where people tend to price based on absolute rent and as many concessions for existing assets. Lease-up assets are different but existing assets, it tends to be a little more of a what am I writing a check for. And so they're most concerned about the lease rent than the concession. So that's a little bit more volatile, but we haven't seen a huge amount of concession volume. Again, I think that's more representative of the sort of market behavior than it is to our pricing dynamics. Yes, Alex, this is Sean. I think the broad brush is relatively consistent of what you stated. But certainly, real estate is a local business here. And there are submarkets that are challenged for either demand or supply reasons or both. \n As I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks, while the Mid-Atlantic is generally doing pretty well, that is driven by our suburban portfolio. The District of Columbia is quite soft for both demand and supply reasons. The same thing could be said about urban Seattle, downtown L.A. We have one asset there as an example. \n So I would say, broadly speaking, what you're indicating is correct. For the portfolio, we have coastal, suburban, primary customer base healthy. But obviously, there are exceptions [ where you are ]. And I would point to really some of these urban submarkets with plentiful supply, some still quality of life conditions that are challenging as a little more choppy. \n And then there are certain markets, still some of the Bay Area where there are signs of some job growth, but then there are still signs of layoffs here and there that you're hearing about in the media. So I wouldn't say everything is rosy, but the broad brush is it looks pretty good right now. Sure, Anthony, it's Sean. Sort of a combination of all those factors that you just laid out. And what I'd point to geographically, which might be a little bit of a surprise for people is most of the improvement was actually not in places like L.A., which have been sort of the poster child for this. \n But we saw very good improvement in the broader sort of New York metro area. Underlying bad debt in Q4 in that region was 3.1%. In Q1, it declined to 2.4%. Boston was 120 basis points in Q4, a decline of 60 basis points. It was about 20 basis points of improvement in Seattle. So for all the reasons you mentioned, some [indiscernible] up on payments as well as the skip and evict process, sort of a combination of all those factors driving the improvement. Yes. Linda, it's Sean. I wouldn't say anything terribly significant. The only thing that I could point to a little bit is as you might imagine, as winter, COVID, the [ roommates ], the volume of [ room rates ] across the portfolio has certainly declined. It has kind of come back up to some more normal levels, roughly, I would say. That would be the only data point that I really could point to for you. Yes, Sean, again. Not at this point that we've seen, other than certainly our lower price point assets in some of the markets, particularly on the West Coast, where we have a greater share of those assets are performing quite well. I think to Ben's point, there certainly are consumers that are feeling a little bit of pinch from what's happened with inflation, student loans, car leases expire, et cetera, et cetera. \n And so certainly, those lower price point assets are performing quite well, in many cases, better than some of the higher price point assets in some of those submarkets. So it's really a market-by-market question. But overall, we have healthy demand and in some cases, maybe for the reasons you just described, maybe even stronger demand for some of the lower price points. And Mike, one thing, I think, to keep in mind here is I'd be a little careful about isolating years as being very unique in terms of the delivery cycle and the impact on fundamentals. As Ben was alluding to earlier, what you see on that chart in terms of deliveries for 2024, where it does peak in the back half of this year, people will be leasing up. Putting those units into the market 12 to 13 months beyond sort of the initial delivery dates in terms of how they're leasing them up. \n And if you think of the impact on pricing, you've got those deliveries coming in plus you have new deliveries that are beginning in 2025. So the units coming in to market takes a long period of time for them to lease up. And the impact on stabilized assets takes time as rents are reset to a new sort of market clearing price. \n As those leases expire, it has to roll through the rent roll. So when you sort of take the compounded effect, I think that's why we're saying that for 2025, we feel much better about our performance in the established regions relative to the Sunbelt. And that should carry into 2026, given the time it takes to lease up the assets and those new prices to be reflected in stabilized asset rent rolls, if that makes sense."
