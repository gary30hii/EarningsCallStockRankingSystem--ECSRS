All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question and answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. [Operator Instruction] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\nArvind Sood: Okay. Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to our call to review our Q4 and full year financial results for 2020. I would say, the strong execution, despite the pandemic and pipeline advancement are two themes that were pervasive. So, let\u2019s get after it. We'll stick to an efficient format of limited prepared comments or one question rule, as Erica pointed out, and the overall duration of the call to one hour. Slides have been posted. Just a quick reminder that we use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation, and some of the statements would be forward-looking. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to different materially. So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob? \nBob Bradway: Thank you, Arvind, and thank all of you for joining our call. I\u2019ll start today by discussing Amgen\u2019s performance in 2020, and then provide some perspective on our priorities for 2021. By any measure 2020 was a very successful year for us. Despite the disruption of COVID-19, we delivered strong sales and earnings, driven by volume growth of 15% of our products. We advanced our innovative pipeline, most notably sotorasib and tezepelumab, both of which have received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. We successfully integrated Otezla, strengthening our decades-long leadership in inflammation with a $2 billion plus product that we believe has runway for further global growth. We grew our sales outside the U.S. to more than $6 billion, delivering on long-term goals by expanding our presence in China and Japan, the successful transactions in both markets. We did all this while staying focused on the health and safety of our 24,000 employees around the world. And to all of them, I want to say thank you for a job well done. As we look to 2021, we're embracing three realities. First, COVID-19 is leading to some lasting changes in how we do business. For example, we expect to continue leveraging digital capabilities, call on customers and run clinical trials around the world with improved speed, efficiency, effectiveness. Second, we expect ongoing pressure on drug prices across the industry. We are fortunate to have products like Repatha, Prolia, Aimovig that meet the needs of millions of patients and can grow through increased penetration of the appropriate patient populations. Our industry-leading portfolio of biosimilars is also well-positioned for future.  Third is capital continues to flow into our sector. We've entered a time of intense competition where speed of execution is paramount. We've built a track record featuring quality and speed. We\u2019ve shown that with innovative first-in-class medicines like Repatha, the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor, and Aimovig, the first approved CGRP inhibitor. We showed it also with biosimilars, like MVASI and KANJINTI, the first approved biosimilars to Avastin and Herceptin, here in the U.S. And we're doing it right now with sotorasib, the first KRAS G12C inhibitor to be filed for approval just 28 months after we dosed our first patient. We expect to do it again later in the year when tezepelumab as the first TSLP inhibitor. We are excited about our pipeline and plan on increasing our R&D investment in 2021. Dave will speak in a moment about some of our promising mid-stage pipeline candidates. But since this is the time of year when I'd like to address our long-term investments, I want to focus for a moment on a couple of areas central to our early research strategy. These are areas where we are building differentiated capabilities. First, in human genetics, where we have industry-leading capabilities, we are adding to our database approximately 1 million subjects from the U.S. and the UK, or whom we will have extensive phenotypic and genotypic information. This will augment the data we already have on in excess of 1.5 million individuals. In addition, we're pioneering the use of large-scale proteomics to measure the relative levels of some 5,000 different proteins in the blood. We're excited about the insights we generate from this genomic proteomic work and expect to benefit in the selection of new drug targets and clinical trial design. There's growing interest in our industry in the area of targeted protein degradation. We believe the opportunity is broader than that, and our efforts are not just limited to degrading proteins. We're looking at degrading other biologic molecules as well. We're designing molecules to have multi-specific activity through a principle we call induced proximity. The idea is to use this platform to dramatically expand the universe of druggable targets. It's still early days in the field, but I wanted to flag it as an area where we want to emerge through time as an industry leader. All of our work is taking place at a time when more is expected of companies than ever before. Amgen is advancing an ambitious ESG agenda that includes providing medicines at no cost to low-income patients and funding world-class STEM education programs. With respect to the environment, we're committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2027, along with a 40% reduction in water use and the 75% reduction in waste. In summary, our success in 2020 gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver in 2021 and beyond. The world needs more innovation, not less, and we've proven ourselves ready, willing and able to provide it. I look forward to your questions a little later on in the call. Right now, let me turn over to Dave Reese, our Head of R&D. \nDave Reese: Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin today with sotorasib, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor. To-date, more than 700 patients have been treated across five continents. We are accelerating this groundbreaking program into new indications and earlier lines of therapy. A few days ago, we presented the first pivotal data for KRAS G12C inhibitor at the World Conference on Lung Cancer, where we reported on 126 patients with second line plus non-small cell lung cancer. Sotorasib drove rapid, deep, and durable responses across a broad range of mutational profiles in subgroups with poor prognoses. In a centrally adjudicated intent-to-treat analysis, the objective response rate was 37%, including three complete remissions, progression-free survival was 6.8 months and duration of response was 10 months. Importantly, sotorasib demonstrated a very tolerable and differentiated clinical profile. And based on these data, we completed regulatory submissions in the United States and EU in December. More recently, we submitted files in Canada, the UK, Brazil, and Australia with additional global submissions anticipated in the coming weeks and months, and launch preparations are well-advanced. The Phase 3 non-small cell lung cancer monotherapy study versus docetaxel continues to advance nicely as do our 10 combination cohorts and Phase 2 colorectal study with data expected from these latter two, beginning in the first half of this year. We will initiate a Phase 2 study in first line non-small cell lung cancer in the second quarter, where we will investigate sotorasib monotherapy in patients most likely to benefit, based on tumor profiling. For example, those tumors harboring STK11 mutations. Finally, we recently cleared the safety hurdle at the full sotorasib dose in our MEK inhibitor combination study and have completed enrollment in an expansion cohort. In inflammation, along with our partner, AstraZeneca, we look forward to presenting the results from the Phase 3 NAVIGATOR study at the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology Virtual Annual Meeting, also known as AAAAI, at the end of February. You may have seen the abstract posting yesterday, with results from the primary and key secondary endpoints data that in our view, provide a compelling rationale for the potential utility of tezepelumab in a broad population of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, including those with low eosinophil counts where we have breakthrough therapy designation in the United States. We are working closely with AstraZeneca on our U.S. and EU filing packages, which we expect to submit in the first half. Turning to our BiTE platform, we are particularly excited about the rapid progress we are making with two solid tumor programs, AMG 160, targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, for castrate-resistant prostate cancer; and AMG 757, targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. AMG 160 is currently in dose expansion, and we expect to advance AMG 757 into dose expansion in the coming months. We are quite pleased with the clinical profiles we are seeing with both of these molecules. And, as you will see in our press release, we also continue to actively prioritize our oncology portfolio. In migraine, Aimovig continues to demonstrate important benefits for patients as our colleagues at Novartis announced positive Phase 4 results, showing superior efficacy and safety of Aimovig over topiramate in the migraine prevention setting. Finally, our biosimilars portfolio continues to advance, and we have completed enrollment in our Phase 3 study of ABP 959, our biosimilar SOLIRIS. In closing, I'd like to thank our staff for their ongoing efforts to deliver our portfolio for patients. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Dave. 2020 product sales grew 9% year-over-year, driven by 15% volume growth, with roughly equal growth rates in the U.S. and internationally. Starting with our innovative portfolio, Prolia grew year-over-year, despite significant impacts from the pandemic. And EVENITY sales increased 85% year-over-year, driven by strong volume growth. Repatha is now annualizing at over $1 billion in revenues with 67% year-over-year volume growth. In the first full year since acquisition, we've seamlessly integrated Otezla, growing total prescriptions by 13% year-over-year. And finally, our biosimilars portfolio totaled $1.7 billion in sales. Moving to fourth quarter performance. Product sales grew 8% year-over-year, driven by 13% volume growth. In our bone franchise, we remained focused on ensuring patient continuity. By year-end, osteoporosis diagnoses reached approximately 80% of pre-COVID levels, leading to a positive trend in new patient starts, entering 2021. In Q4, Prolia's repeat patient numbers were lower than historical trends, as a result of the echo effect of COVID disruption in Q2. EVENITY sales grew quarter-over-quarter. We believe EVENITY's unique bone building profile will continue to drive growth in our franchise as physicians appreciate its benefit risk profile for treating their high-risk post fracture patients. In cardiovascular, Repatha remains the global PCSK9 leader. Net sales in Q4 were $253 million, driven by sequential volume growth and stable U.S. net price. As we enter 2021, we expect continued momentum for this brand globally, driven by growth from international markets, improved U.S. PBM formulary position and relatively stable net price in the U.S. Moving on to Aimovig, which is the market leader in the highly competitive CGRP class, volumes grew 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but remained flat quarter-over-quarter as the pandemic negatively impacted new patient starts. Next to Parsabiv. Q4 sales declined 8% quarter-over-quarter in the U.S. as some customers decreased utilization, while others built inventory in advance of the January reimbursement change. With Parsabiv\u2019s inclusion in the end-stage renal disease bundle, we expect sales to decline by approximately 40% to 50% in 2021 as U.S. dialysis centers update their treatment protocols to accommodate generic forms of cinacalcet. We also expect sales in Q1 to be the lowest of the year as customers deplete $40 million of inventory build in the second half of 2020. For patients on hemodialysis, Parsabiv is the only IV-administered calcimimetic that lowers and maintains key secondary hyperthyroidism lab values. Also, Parsabiv offers providers control over calcimimetic delivery and the opportunity to reduce patient pill burden. Transitioning to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales were $617 million in Q4, driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in total U.S. prescriptions. We see attractive future growth opportunities through global launches, and our planned submission for the mild to moderate psoriasis indication in the U.S. in the coming weeks. With Enbrel, fourth quarter sales declined 5% year-over-year. Volumes declined from gradual share loss, coupled with slower growth in the rheumatology segment, which we attribute in part to the pandemic. For 2020, net price declined in the low single digits, and we expect volume and net price trends to persist in 2021. Enbrel has an established record of safety and efficacy, and we will continue to invest in innovative solutions to enhance the patient experience. Switching to biosimilars. Q4 sales were $541 million, driven by volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We are leading in biosimilar share in Europe for AMGEVITA and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI, with a respective 48% and 41% average share in Q4. We recently launched our fifth biosimilar, RIABNI, a biosimilar to Rituxan. For 2021, we expect biosimilar volume growth to be partially offset by a decline in net selling prices due to increased competition. In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF with 54% share of volume in the quarter. Onpro continues to demonstrate the value of innovation, allowing patients to receive their GCSF treatment without having to return to their doctor's office or other sites of care for administration. Overall, Neulasta sales decreased 19% year-over-year, driven by declines in volume and net selling price. And the most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 28% year-over-year. Going forward, we expect the price and volume trends to persist as biosimilar competition increases. Looking ahead, we're excited about new opportunities across our business. Internationally, we recently received national reimbursement drug listing for Prolia, which will accelerate growth in China. In Japan, we're preparing for the launch of Aimovig, and we're planning for the launch of our biosimilar brands across multiple markets in 2021. Finally, our team is ready to launch sotorasib upon approval, and we're excited to establish it as a foundational therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. And we're also preparing for the launch of tezepelumab with our partner, AstraZeneca, and are enthusiastic about the prospect of having a therapy that can help treat the 2.5 million people in the world living with severe uncontrolled asthma. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, and look forward to Amgen serving more patients in 2021. Now, I'll turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Murdo. Good afternoon and good evening, everyone. We are pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. In Q4, we delivered 7% revenue and 5% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. For the full year, we delivered 9% revenue and 12% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. As Murdo mentioned, both Q4 and the full year benefited from volume-driven sales growth of 13% and 15%, respectively. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as spend accelerated to advance our innovative pipeline, drive volume growth for much of our portfolio around the globe and prepare for future launches, particularly for sotorasib and tezepelumab. Operating expense grew 7% for the full year, including a full year of Otezla-related activities and expenses. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter and the full year was $2.0 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively. Now, turning to the outlook for business for 2021 on page 37. We look forward to investing in innovation in 2021 and in launching new products. We will also continue to execute on our volume-driven growth strategy. Due to COVID, we also anticipate some uncertainty and quarter-to-quarter variability in revenue and earnings throughout 2021, with potential recovery later in the year, contingent upon the speed and effectiveness of global vaccination. Our 2021 revenue guidance is $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion, and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $16 to $17 per share. GAAP earnings per share guidance is $12.12 per share to $13.17 per share. Now, let me mention several key assumptions embedded in our guidance. First, our revenue range reflects volume growth from Prolia, Otezla Repatha, EVENITY, Aimovig, and our biosimilars portfolio, and importantly, our innovative oncology portfolio. At the same time, we expect continued competition against our filgrastim and ESA franchises, as well as accelerating erosion in U.S. Parsabiv sales, as Murdo highlighted. We experienced a 6% decline in net selling prices globally in 2020. For 2021, we again expect mid-single-digit price declines. A couple of points to recall when considering Q1 of 2021. Historically, the first quarter represents the lowest product sales quarter of the year, with planned changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, especially for products, including Enbrel, Otezla and Aimovig. Additionally, I want to remind everyone that in Q1 2020, Enbrel benefited from approximately $115 of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions, and the entire portfolio saw roughly $100 million in inventory build due to COVID. So, as a proportion of our full year sales, we expect Q1 2021 to be a slightly lower percentage than the 24% it was in Q1 2020. We expect other revenue to be in the range of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year 2021. This includes revenues from COVID-19 antibody manufacturing and profit share agreement with Lilly, under which we expect to begin shipping in the second quarter. We expect 2021 total non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at a rate similar to the 7% 2020 non-GAAP operating expense growth, as we continue to invest in innovation, launches of new products and digitization efforts. We have created an industry-leading cost structure and expect an operating margin of roughly 50% in 2021. Cost of sales as a percent of product sales will increase to a range of 16% to 17% due to an evolving product mix, and higher royalties and profit share payments. Additionally, cost of sales will increase in connection with our manufacturing agreement with Lilly. As I mentioned previously, the revenues and profit share will be included in other revenue. Research and development expenses will increase as our pipeline advances with year-over-year increases in early and late-stage investments. And SG&A will decline, primarily due to changes in our commercial model including an increased focus on digital efforts. Now, let me take a moment to explain an update we are making to our non-GAAP policy. Effective January 2021, our non-GAAP results will no longer include fair value adjustments to equity investments. These adjustments to equity investments have historically been recorded in other income and expenses and were positive in our 2020 non-GAAP results. This change will not apply to our strategic investment in BeiGene, which is included in our non-GAAP results and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The press release contains the pro forma 2020 results by quarter under our updated policy. We will also now use updated adjusted 2020 amounts that conform to this policy for comparison purposes going forward. Under our updated non-GAAP policy that I just explained, here is our guidance for other income and expense. We anticipate non-GAAP other income expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of expense. This 2021 guidance reflects incorporation of four quarters of BeiGene's results versus three quarters in 2020, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. Recall that we only use the limited publicly available consensus estimates for BeiGene in connection with our guidance and thus may experience additional variability depending on BeiGene's actual results. Our basis in BeiGene as of December 31, 2020, was approximately $2.9 billion, and this long-term investment is valued at approximately $6 billion today based upon the current U.S. market price. Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is 13% to 14%, and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $900 million this year, including investments in additional manufacturing and other capacity to support our volume-driven growth strategy as well as an environmental sustainability initiatives that will enable our global operations to achieve carbon neutrality by 2027 and also in our digitization efforts to continue to scale up and integrate data and analytics in everything we do at Amgen. And finally, our capital allocation hierarchy remains unchanged. After both internal and external innovation and then investing in our capital expenditures, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of growing dividends, including the 10% increase in the first quarter of 2021 to $1.76 per share. We anticipate opportunistic share repurchases in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, subject to our Board's authorization. So, in summary, we deliver for patients every patient every time, and for our investors in a challenging year that included the greatest public health crisis in 100 years, and the greatest economic disruption since the great depression. And we are confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2021 and beyond. This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call back over to Bob.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Peter. And Erica, let me invite you to remind our callers of our process for Q&A, and let's begin the question session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question in queue is from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nAlethia Young: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a solid guidance and great quarter. I just wanted maybe if you guys could talk a little bit about, obviously, the KRAS program and the combinations, and maybe perhaps kind of -- I know it is probably early Phase 1 studies, but what you're kind of looking to glean from some of these different combinations? I know you get asked a lot about this, but just kind of as we're getting closer and closer, like how you think about unpacking that with different indications? Thanks.\nBob Bradway: Hi, Alethia, and thanks for the question. Yes, we do get this one quite a bit about the combinations. What I will say is there's no generic answer here. It's going to depend on line of therapy end indication, non-small cell lung cancer, of course, colorectal cancer and then some of the other indications beyond that. Typically, you're looking for a 15%, 20%, 30% increment on any given endpoint beyond standard of care, but also looking at the totality of the data. I think in many of these settings, in particular, progression-free survival and ultimately, overall survival. So, given the safety profile we've demonstrated to date, those are the sort of efficacy metrics that we'll probably take a look at.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Yee with Jefferies.\nMichael Yee: I bet you're going to get a lot of combo KRAS questions, so I'm just going to ask as well. The MEK expansion cohort, David, I thought it's really exciting that you've actually completed enrollment. And I know, I guess, that was mentioned at the conference as well. That could be potentially pivotal. Can you talk about whether you would actually be able to announce data on that at some point this year? It's pivotal, do you want the whole thing to be done before you report out on it? Could you have piecemeal data? And then, maybe make a comment on the SHIP2 combo as well?\nBob Bradway: Yes. Thanks, Mike. No, we are very pleased with rapidity of enrollment in the MEK safety cohort. As we noted, we've moved beyond that to the expansion cohort. It's quite possible we'll have data from that over the course of this year. It will depend on just as the data come in and as we see those results. And again, it's too early to speculate on whether this could be pivotal or not. As I've mentioned, the master protocol from which these data are derived is essentially designed, so that any given arm can be blown up into a pretty rigorous Phase 2 trial. And depending on indication and line of therapy, of course, we would make any sort of decisions regarding regulatory intent in that context. So, more to come as those data unfold, but we're quite happy with what we're seeing in terms of enrollment.\nMichael Yee: And SHIP2?\nBob Bradway: On SHIP2, it's moving along. I think biologically, that is a very interesting combination. And again, potentially more to come over the course of the year on that combination as well.\nOperator: Your next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Maybe just a two-part from me. Maybe for Peter. I was just wondering as you look out the sustainability of that 50% operating margin, how you think about some of the puts and takes? And then, any visibility into your biosimilar franchise, the margins there? I know, that's a question we get frequently. And then, again, a higher level, and maybe for Bob. You mentioned protein degradation is an interesting platform on the forward that you guys are spending a lot of time building out. Do you expect to do that all internally, or is that an area where you could also look externally for opportunities?\nPeter Griffith: Thank you. Great question on the operating margin. As you know, we don't go out on a long-term basis on that. But, you also know that we intend to continue to be a top-performing biopharma firm, when you look at any number of financial metrics and importantly, operating margin. I do want to make sure that I mention and confirm, we will remain flexible and adaptable as attractive internal and/or external investment opportunities arise. We have the underlying objective to grow our volumes and after tax cash flow. So, that's really important to us. We are committed to lean on our permanent productivity commitment. As I mentioned, we're investing in and working on digitization and automation. So, we'll continue to exercise all that muscle to make sure that we do remain an outperforming biopharma firm and operating margin. On the biosimilars, that's a fair question. We continue to see biosimilars as an extremely strong allocation of capital for us. The margins continue to be very competitive. And we're very confident in terms of allocating capital to that category, and we'll continue to do that. And we think we've got some strong expertise there. I like to quote Murdo, who says that we've played a lot of defense in biosimilars. And now, as we're on offense, we're able to have a high quality of execution level. So, good questions in that, and I'll flip it over to -- I think, to Bob.\nBob Bradway: Terence, thanks for the question. As I said in my remarks, rather than calling it targeted protein degradation, we're describing it as our induced proximity platform. The intention there, as I said, is just to be clear that we think the technology that we're building can be used, not just to degrade proteins but other molecules as well. So, we're excited about it. This is -- as I said, again, in my remarks, long-term research strategy. And Dave, his team and I spent a lot of time with each other, trying to think about how to position for the long term. And in this area, will be both internal and external. I'd remind you that we acquired new evolution now two years ago for the purpose of helping to build out this set of capabilities. And I would imagine we'll continue to look, as I said, both internally and externally. Dave, feel free to jump in and add your thoughts.\nDave Reese: Yes. I think that covers it pretty well, Bob. I would say that we view this multi-specificity in drugs as part of the future. Many of you know that 80% to 85% of the currently desirable targets are currently undruggable. We think this is going to be a very important technology and making many of those targets tractable. And as Bob mentioned, we are investing for the long haul, and we expect that to be a combination of both internal and external innovation.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: Dave, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit more on the BiTE program and some of the, I guess, safety issues that have happened? And just what's your confidence in those programs, especially as it seems to relate to some of these extended half-life programs?\nDave Reese: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Thank you for this question. I would say, overall, I feel very bullish on the BiTE program. As we mentioned, AMG 160 and AMG 757 are advancing quite rapidly. Cytokine release syndrome is clearly the single challenge that sits before the entire field. And we're making adjustments in the 701 program to handle that. I'm quite confident that we can come up with a clinically important profile for that molecule. There are many BCMA molecules in development. And of course, we'll shape our investments according to whether we can really fulfill an unmet medical need. I would say, in closing that I'm quite optimistic about the half-life extended BiTE platform, the -- a few of the positives such as AMG 673 for acute myelogenous leukemia were done on purpose because we selected the first generation molecule, which we are investigating in a minimal residual disease, setting where that technology is well suited. This was done in close concert with our investigators. Many of these choices were part of our strategy. We anticipated making these choices as part of prudent shaping of our portfolio going forward. So, overall, I feel quite good about where we are and how that platform is evolving.\nOperator: Your next question is from Yaron Werber with Cowen.\nYaron Werber: David, I have a question for you, if you don't mind, and a quick follow-up. On sotorasib, can you give us a sense? Obviously, it's encouraging that the MEK combo, you're able to get the full dose of sotorasib. Any comments on KEYTRUDA, SHIP2 or Erbitux? And then, on tezepelumab, the late-breaker looks really good. The data in the steroid refractory was surprising. And I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s potentially trial design differences from the other biologics, just given how robust the response is otherwise. Would you consider repeating that study with a more similar trial design to the other ones?\nDave Reese: Yes. Thanks for the questions. In regards to the combinations, the ones you mentioned are all actively in dose escalation, looking at either different doses or in some cases, even scheduling, depending on the agents. This is standard Phase 1b oncology drug development. I feel good about how quickly we're moving. And we'll provide guidance as we expect those data to emerge. With tezepelumab, as you mentioned, the abstract is out now. We feel the data are very strong. We feel we're competitive. With the best in the high eosinophil population and in many ways, standalone in the low eosinophil population, the steroid-sparing study. As you alluded, we think there were potentially trial design issues. And we're going through that with our investigators, anticipate presenting those data a little later this spring. And we're discussing with our partners, whether a differently designed follow-on study would be appropriate. I would point out that that trial was not necessary for filing, and we are moving ahead with all deliberate speed, as we announced with global submissions of tezepelumab, based on the current data.\nOperator: Your next question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Peter, I may have missed this, but looking to 2021 revenue guidance, can you speak at a higher level, what contribution, if any, you assume from sotorasib and tezepelumab for this year? And are there any COVID headwinds still factored in when you look at product sales, or do you assume 2021 as a more normalized demand curve all year?\nPeter Griffith: Thanks for the question, Geoff, and I'll invite Murdo here in just a moment to jump in on soto and teze. And look, we expect continued COVID impact throughout 2021 and revenue potential recovery in the latter part of the year contingent on the vaccination rollout, as I mentioned. So, we'll be closely monitoring that, as you can imagine. And with respect to soto and teze, let me turn that over to Murdo. And look, it's a very exciting time for us. And we've invested a lot of money getting preparing the launches for those and so forth. So, Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Peter, and thanks for the question, Geoff. Obviously, we're quite excited about sotorasib. And I want to complement Dave and his team how fast they've moved in developing this product and also just the number of regulatory submissions they've been able to affect in a very compressed time frame. So, we are optimistic and hopeful that we'll get a fairly quick review in multiple markets around the world. And so, we would expect sotorasib to contribute to revenue. We don't give product-specific guidance, but this is a very large population of high unmet medical need. There's not a lot of choice for these advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. So, we do anticipate that there'll be a potential market with a high need there. The one caution that I'll put out is just the actual percentage of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients that have a KRAS G12C status result in their file and their medical record. Right now, we ascertain that to be at about 50%. So, we've got work to do to grow that number. And obviously, we've seen, with other targeted therapies, when you have an actionable mutation, the testing rate rises fairly rapidly. So, we would expect upon approval to be able to do that. But nonetheless, we think sotorasib will be a meaningful contribution to at least revenue in the U.S. And then teze, we'll see what the regulatory authorities do with the filing, obviously, given that we had breakthrough designation. And obviously, given the pan-eosinophilic results that we've seen, and now you guys can see the breakdown in that in the abstract. We think this is an important medicine to get to market very quickly. The last question you asked about COVID in fact, Geoff, was just -- I think, we actually anticipate COVID will have a fairly significant impact on the market, through the better part of the year, beyond the midpoint of the year. I hope we're wrong and I hope that vaccination programs will improve. But right now, we think that COVID will be with us for the majority of 2021.\nOperator: Your next question is from Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse.\nEvan Seigerman: So, I want to ask one on business development and capital allocation priorities. So, it seems like there's a growing need for more mid-stage assets, noting several pipeline pauses reported in this quarter. With 80% of free cash flows going to dividends and repurchases, how do you think about bringing in larger scale assets? And would you lever up beyond your current leverage levels, if there was an attractive opportunity?\nBob Bradway: Evan, I think, we've been pretty consistent in saying that our focus is on investing in the business. So, as we said in our prepared remarks, we're planning to increase our investment in R&D this year. So, committing internally to continue to allocate capital to R&D opportunities. We'll continue to look externally. We'll look at small and larger opportunities, like licensing and business development. They're very active in the areas where we have demonstrated expertise therapeutically. And that's what our focus very likely entail opportunities that sit well with the areas that we have demonstrated expertise in. In terms of the balance sheet, rather than engage in hypothetical, we maintain a strong balance sheet so that we have strategic flexibility. And we'll consider individual opportunities as they arise.\nOperator: Your next question is from Dane Leone with Raymond James.\nDane Leone: Congratulations on the update and outlook for 2021. So, the question for me, it focuses a bit on tezepelumab, but is a little bit different than what's been discussed previously. Allergy and asthma specifically, in this case, would be a new vertical for Amgen. How are you thinking about building out that vertical around expected commercial launch of tezepelumab, but also thinking about other indications or assets behind that internally or externally that you could point to, to make it more of a broader vertical going forward. In that same vein, maybe touch a little bit more on oncology. Obviously, in the solid tumor space, it hasn't been an area that you've been heavily invested in historically, but obviously, it was sotorasib approval coming in the first half this year. You're kind of resting on the BiTE program behind that. Are there other assets outside the BiTE program that you could highlight internally that might expand your presence there, and/or should we be thinking about something more differentiated that you might do externally around the solid tumor space?\nBob Bradway: There is a lot there, Dan, in your question. Murdo and I will just double team you. But, very quickly, let me remind you what we pointed out when we entered into a partnership with AstraZeneca in particular, around the respiratory opportunity, which was that just as you point out, is a new area for us. We felt that we could deliver more for our shareholders and more for patients by collaborating with a group that had demonstrated an expertise in respiratory medicine. And so, we chose to partner with AstraZeneca, and we're pleased with that collaboration and look forward to taking the molecule to market with them. And I would just point out that we came to this through our commitment to anti-inflammation and have decades of experience in the biology of information that we've been able to capitalize on with this program and hopefully others over time. But Murdo, jump in and in particular, share your thoughts also on the solid tumor question.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes, sure. Thanks, Bob. We are building out our teams as we speak. And Amgen will help commercialize tezepelumab in the Americas region. So, U.S. and Canada, we will be focused on allergists, while AstraZeneca will play a broader role beyond just allergists, including the respiratory specialties. So, this is -- as you mentioned, it's a new area, but it's not that different from what we've done, as Bob mentioned, in other inflammatory disease processes. The other thing that's worth mentioning is we'll be taking a leading role in establishing access for tezepelumab with payers. And again, our extensive biologics contracting experience in Part D and the government programs will help us secure broad access for tezepelumab for a broad range of patients. As you saw, we have a nice product profile here that will benefit a lot of patients regardless of their eosinophilic status. And then, Dave Reese's team is obviously building out medical capabilities for the same customer-facing group. So, we're excited about it. It's a focused effort. The beauty of focusing on allergists is they're very productive prescribers, but they're a relatively small audience size. So, we'll be quite focused on addressing that. When it comes to kind of how we're looking at our oncology portfolio, we've got a very strong base right now in oncology between our hematology business, our solid tumor therapeutics that we have now our overall biosimilar portfolio and our supportive care. Basically one in five oncology patients today receives an Amgen therapy. And so, bringing sotorasib into that mix and then the potential of AMG 160 and 757 and 701, I think, is a fairly action-packed next few years in oncology that we can build on the current strength that we have, and we're excited about that. I'm always asking Dave Reese to deliver more, and I know his team have a lot of other earlier assets to put into the clinic. I'll turn it over to Dave for additional comments.\nDave Reese: Exactly. We've got a couple of gastric cancer BiTEs, of course, also a solid tumor indication. And we've got some other molecules in late preclinical. We're just entering the clinic that will target solid tumor indications. More on those, as we're ready to speak about them going along. So, I think it's going to be quite a broad portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question is from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.\nRobyn Karnauskas: So, I have a question for Murdo. I was just looking at the MVASI strength and the KANJINTI decline, and the Neulasta price decline was significant. Putting all these trends together, can you just help us think now what you think of how to model the tail for biosimilars? And if there's differences between some of your oncology drugs like the strength of MVASI is really impressive versus the decline of Neulasta, just give a sense of how we should think about that and help us model that. Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Thanks for the question, Robyn. And as we look at 2021, I would say that the majority of our growth will come from additional international launches of our biosimilar portfolio. And obviously, some additional revenue from AVSOLA and RIABNI, two relatively recent biosimilar launches in the U.S. Specifically, if you think about MVASI and KANJINTI, they are a little bit different. And the differences are twofold. There's more than that ballistic to the two major ones. Bevacizumab as a molecule is actually growing, whereas trastuzumab as a molecule is flat to declining. So, one thing that we're seeing in MVASI is actually the number of cycles of bevacizumab overall is growing. And so, even holding share in that molecule actually holds up quite well. We also have less competition. That's the other factor. So there's less competition for now in the bevacizumab molecule, whereas with trastuzumab, we have more competitors. And so, I think going forward, you would see competitive dynamics shaping those two brands a little bit differently.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mohit Bansal with Citigroup.\nMohit Bansal: Congrats on all the progress. Maybe one question on EVENITY. It seems like you have been able to grow this product, not just U.S., globally as well. And this has been a difficult market historically. So, could you please help us characterize the growth in terms of whether you are taking share from existing anabolics or you're expanding the market? And then, do you expect any challenge when the [Technical Difficulty] comes to market of this product.\nBob Bradway: Yes. I was picking up a little bit of static. So, I think the question's on EVENITY. The first part of the question I understood was how are we sourcing our EVENITY growth? Is it from existing anabolic patients, or are we expanding and treating new patients? I didn't catch the second part of the question, but let me address the first part. Overall, we're pleased with how EVENITY has evolved. We've got nice evolution in our Japan business. In Japan, it's obviously -- we've been in the market a little bit longer. So, one thing that we're seeing with EVENITY is patients are on the product for a 12-month duration of treatment. And so, you have to replenish those new patients. You do have to source those new patients. And so, I think the team in Japan is quite experienced now at sourcing new patients and not necessarily where we got our early growth was from which was switching from other anabolics. And there are -- unfortunately, there are a lot of aging patients in these markets where osteoporosis goes unchecked and patients suffer fractures and these high-risk patients need a solid bone builder, like EVENITY to be able to improve their clinical outcomes. So, I think in Japan, we're sourcing now more de novo growth than we were perhaps 6 to 12 months ago. Whereas in the U.S., it's much more of a mix of de novo and switch. The other thing that's helping us in the U.S. is, of course, having both Prolia and EVENITY for the customer. A lot of the time when a patient will come in and have a fracture despite their Prolia treatment, they're a really good candidate for EVENITY. So, we're often getting patients on both treatments. And sometimes after the 12 months of EVENITY treatment are up, they'll roll back on to Prolia. So, it's a nice franchise to have and have both an anti-resort and a bone-building agent for our customers. So, I think, the future growth looks very good. Obviously, our partners at UCB are just getting going in Europe as they establish reimbursement for the product. But, I'm quite excited about what EVENITY could become for bone building for these very high-risk post-fracture patients.\nOperator: Your next question is from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: Murdo, you recently mentioned 25,000 as the target population for KRAS. And that sounded rather irony, at least for U.S. So, I was curious, A, whether that was for U.S.-only or worldwide? And B, if you were assuming a -- around 14% prevalence rate for G12C and whether you are doing this analysis only for this math? Thank you so much.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks for the question, Umer. The 25,000 was a U.S. number. We actually estimate the non-small cell lung cancer incidents globally at 120,000 patients. Now, obviously, there's some reduction from first-line to second-line in lung cancer because unfortunately, we lose patients in frontline. The second line and beyond is obviously our target population at launch. And we assume a 13% incidence of KRAS G12C in the broad non-small cell lung cancer patient population.\nUmer Raffat: Right. So Murdo, if we just go down that track, 13% at 120K. I was just confused, the 25K?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. So that's a U.S.-only number for incidence of non-small cell lung cancer that have progressed into second line and beyond.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets.\nKennen MacKay: Maybe for Dave, maybe it's the BiTEs that you spoke to previously, but I always love asking this question. Within the early stage Phase 1 or stage 2 pipeline, what are you most excited about in 2021? What's going to be the next sotorasib? Thank you.\nDave Reese: Yes, thanks. And I think we are able to just rejoin in time for that question. Again, I think in terms of the early pipeline, AMG 160 and AMG 757, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, are ones that we're really looking at. 160 has advanced into the expansion cohort. And if we continue to generate data as we have recently through a larger number of patients. That's a program that we would probably be discussing potential registration paths sooner rather than later. I think, AMG 757 is just one step behind. And that's another one that we're keeping a very close eye on. And then, in our inflammation portfolio, we've got a variety of Phase 2 assets in autoimmune indications, as we previously indicated, and those programs are ones that I'm quite interested in, as we move forward.\nOperator: Your next question is from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Murdo, a question about your commercial model. You mentioned in the prepared remarks a couple of times that you were shifting to more of a digital approach. And I'm just wondering, we've heard that there have been significant reductions in your commercial field organizations. Can you give us a sense of what the magnitude of the efficiency in headcount you're seeing on your average sales force by moving towards digital? And could you talk about how you think that might play out in a post-COVID world? Wouldn't you expect to have to ramp back up once we eliminate social distancing?\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Geoffrey, for the question. There were a couple of factors that went into our recent reorganization of our field force. One is just portfolio evolution and creating capacity for the new product launches and then reallocating from the older side of the portfolio. And depending on which region you're talking about in the world with Amgen, we're in very different stages of development. So, for example, we're placing large investments in field force in Japan and in China, even in Russia and some other markets that are emerging for us as being important growth drivers. And in the U.S. we're really paying close attention to the forces in the market beyond COVID. We're looking at potential negative net price effects and/or price reform, as Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, as being a bit of a prevailing wind here. And so, what we're doing is looking at our overall commercial model, and to your point, making it more productive and making it more efficient. So, we're largely on track with that plan. We were able to move very rapidly last year and build out our digital capabilities to an even greater extent than we had historically. We are seeing customers willing to engage in those channels. And we think some of those engagements will be persistent beyond COVID, quite frankly. And it's that persistency that we're betting on. What we haven\u2019t done is compromised the ability to have competitive share of voice in our field facing interactions, both on the medical side, both on the commercial side, in front of the customer. And so, we think we'll continue to be able to compete effectively in the categories we're in, as well as augment that with highly efficient digital channels of communication.\nOperator: Our next question is from Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Congrats on sotorasib data, the impressive execution. I guess, Murdo and Bob, coming back to Otezla, at the time of the acquisition, it seems to have oriented us that the majority of the growth would come from the U.S. And I guess, your comments today seem to be teeing up really, I guess, the global nature of the growth going forward. I guess, just your level of confidence around Otezla growth in the U.S. through the mid-2025 timeframe, I guess, given the competition and what have you?\nBob Bradway: Maybe I'll just take the first sense or two, and then Murdo, you can augment however you'd like. But, Carter, what I'd say is that when we acquired it, we said we felt we could achieve double-digit growth through the first several years of ownership, and we continue to feel confident in that. And that's a function of both, potential for increased label range in the U.S. as well as the opportunity to launch in international markets. But, Murdo, maybe you want to elaborate on the opportunity, the mild to moderate, severe opportunity?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Bob. We do see some of the international expansion maturing now. We've got a good business for Otezla in Japan. We're pursuing registration in China, and we recently secured reimbursement in Australia. So, we're evolving the global footprint of Otezla beyond where the legacy Celgene efforts had it. So, that is one source of growth. But, as Bob mentioned, we're also pursuing in the U.S. mild to moderate approval on the basis of the positive data set we have there. And that will allow us to move Otezla into a patient population that really is still an unmet need. These are patients who have enough skin surface area that they might be seeking an alternative to messy and inconvenient topical agents. And I think Otezla can play a very important role there in helping treat those patients. We're also in making investments in Otezla by expanding the promotional footprint of the product to include primary care promotion, something that Celgene had not done historically. So, we're doing that both for the moderate to severe patient, but as well for that mild to moderate indication in anticipation of that potential approval. And the only other thing I would say is, while we are seeing a little bit of softness in psoriasis and broader rheumatology, for the category due to COVID, Otezla being an oral has held up quite well, and the execution has been strong. I also think that the established safety and efficacy profile of Otezla is highly appreciated, given recent news in the broader rheumatology category of other orals where perhaps that risk-benefit equation is different than it is where it's very strong with Otezla. So, we think we've got a good opportunity for growth. We also said when we gave that guidance that it assumed a successful competitive program from the TYK2 asset. And of course, that was confirmed today.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer.\nJay Olson: Hi. Congrats on all the progress and thank you for taking the question? Since you received breakthrough therapy designation for sotorasib in China, could you comment on how fast you could submit a filing and gain regulatory approval? And what percent of Asian non-small cell lung cancer patients have their KRAS G12C mutation, and how large is that commercial opportunity is for sotorasib in China? Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Thanks, Jay. Yes. We're very pleased to get breakthrough therapy designation in China. As our filing plans move forward with our colleagues at BeiGene, we'll provide guidance about what those time lines might look like. But, it has a little bit different implications in China than it does potentially in the United States. And then, one thing that we're looking at quite carefully is the epidemiology of G12C mutations. There is a suggestion that it may be a little lower in prevalence in Asian populations, probably because they are mutually exclusive with mutations in EGFR, which are quite high in these populations, up to 40% in China and Japan, for example. So that will be an important question that we address. We've got active research collaborations now, looking at just that. And Murdo, I don't know if you want to add anything about the commercial side in China.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. I think, we're obviously very excited about what we can do with the product, huge unmet medical need. We're seeing that China is an attractive market for specialty products and the fact that sotorasib is an oral makes it very accessible. So, we'll pursue commercialization of sotorasib in China, and our affiliate is very excited about that.\nOperator: Your next question is from Colin Bristow with UBS.\nColin Bristow: Obviously, seeing the abstract data for tezepelumab, the less than 150 group looks pretty impressive. I was just curious what your level of confidence is in getting a broad label in light of the fact that you didn't test it for statistical significance? Is that something you've discussed with the FDA previously? And I'll keep it short.\nBob Bradway: Yes. Thanks, Colin. This is a question we get frequently. We demonstrated efficacy in -- across a broad range of patients regardless of eosinophil count. I think that's what clinicians will pay attention to. We'll provide guidance as regulatory discussions proceed. I think, it's too early, of course, prior to submitting to debate what a potential label would look like. But, our view is that overall these are very, very strong data pointing to a differentiated product. And I think this is just going to be a really important medicine for patients with severe uncontrolled asthma.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Just about biosimilars. You spiked my head a little bit talking about increased competition pressure. Is the anticipation that in 2021 the price decrease in oncology will exit that 10%, 15% decline rate? Is there any reason to expect it? Are the payers coming in and making changes, or is this just an issue of you would cite the market, it's going to be hard to get 100%.\nBob Bradway: Yes. Ronny, I think you definitely see a diminishing rate of return or gain in terms of volume share. You see that in the shape of our uptake curves for both our oncology biosimilars in the U.S. I think that the way, of course, these products are used, they're largely used in the community setting, about 80% of the usage of both bevacizumab and trastuzumab in a community oncology setting. And those businesses tend to contract on a network by network basis. And by now, most of those contracts are set in motion. There's still some incremental opportunity to add to our overall revenue base. But yes, I think the gains on volume will be incremental. And then, price trends, as I mentioned in my scripted remarks, will continue to evolve the way we've seen them.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim Securities.\nMichael Schmidt: I thought it was interesting to hear about some of the early stage R&D efforts and the comments that were made around the induced proximity platform. Along those lines, I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more insight into progress that may have been made within your human genetics initiative, and when or how this initiative may translate into new pipeline products? Thanks so much.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Michael. In human genetics, as Bob mentioned and as we previously announced, we have collaborations with Intermountain Health and UK Biobank that will add up to 1 million participants. We think we'll have the largest database on earth as these projects move towards completion. And we have broadened our focus on human data to include other omic technologies such as transcriptomics and proteomics really in the belief that in the long term, it will be human data such as these that are most important for drug discovery and development. At the current time, a majority of our non-oncology portfolio assets have genetic support that's either primary or secondary. And we expect over time that, that percentage will simply increase because there's now clear evidence that targets for which there's genetic validation and programs based on them have a higher rate of success. So, more to come. But we firmly believe that the era of human data is upon us, and we believe our collection of capabilities is almost unique in the industry. And we intend to push that forward. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Salim Syed with Mizuho Securities.\nSalim Syed: Just one from me strategically, high level here, guys. When you think about Amgen here, is it a correct interpretation to say that the interest in hemonc has gone significantly down and the interest in solid tumors has gone significantly up? And just curious if Kyprolis has anything to do with that, if that's the correct interpretation?\nMurdo Gordon: I don't think it is, Salim, but I invite Dave to...\nDave Reese: Yes. So, Salim, yes. Kyprolis, I think, has nothing to do with that. What you're seeing is the natural evolution of a portfolio based on emerging data, and we will expect that to be shaped going forward, based on emerging data, of course. And some of the changes we announced today our strategic choices that we had teed up that we anticipated making. And we think it's a prudent portfolio management to make those choices. Let me call out the MCL-1 programs in particular, where we have elected to move forward with the IV formulation. Again, we had anticipated we would choose among those molecules. And given our ability to more precisely control exposures and achieve a therapeutic window, in collaboration with our investigators, we made that decision, and we're moving through dose escalation after reinitiation of that program. So, no specific conscious choices, based on hematology versus solid tumors and more shaping to come as data emerges.\nPeter Griffith: Salim, I would just jump in and say, we had a strong quarter on Kyprolis in the fourth quarter, given the approval of CANDOR and our first full quarter promoting it. And we expect to be able to do a nice job of making hemonc specialists around the world aware of those data in combination with daratumumab. So, more growth to come on Kyprolis, and it's a good story now.\nOperator: Your final question is from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Andrew Galler [ph] on for Tim. Thanks for taking my question. Just thinking about sotorasib in Europe. Given EMA typically has a higher threshold for approval for single arm studies, can you describe your degree of confidence you'll be able to get approved on this 37% response rate in 10-month DOR?\nBob Bradway: Yes, sure. Let me take that question. We filed in the EU, obviously, we've got ongoing discussions. We'll provide guidance at the appropriate time. We don't speculate on likely timelines or probabilities in terms of regulatory approvals. But, I think, it is fair to say that regulators around the world do recognize the large unmet medical need in patients with G12C mutations after first-line therapy, and that certainly will be the focus of discussion going forward.\nArvind Sood: Well, thank you. Again, apologies for the fact that we went about 12 minutes over tonight, but we did want to get to all of your questions. So, thank you for your interest and your support of the Company. And we look forward to seeing you or being back together with you after the end of the first quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen's fourth quarter 2020 financial results conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Murdo. Good afternoon and good evening, everyone. We are pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020. In Q4, we delivered 7% revenue and 5% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. For the full year, we delivered 9% revenue and 12% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. As Murdo mentioned, both Q4 and the full year benefited from volume-driven sales growth of 13% and 15%, respectively. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter as spend accelerated to advance our innovative pipeline, drive volume growth for much of our portfolio around the globe and prepare for future launches, particularly for sotorasib and tezepelumab. Operating expense grew 7% for the full year, including a full year of Otezla-related activities and expenses. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter and the full year was $2.0 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively. Now, turning to the outlook for business for 2021 on page 37. We look forward to investing in innovation in 2021 and in launching new products. We will also continue to execute on our volume-driven growth strategy. Due to COVID, we also anticipate some uncertainty and quarter-to-quarter variability in revenue and earnings throughout 2021, with potential recovery later in the year, contingent upon the speed and effectiveness of global vaccination. Our 2021 revenue guidance is $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion, and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $16 to $17 per share. GAAP earnings per share guidance is $12.12 per share to $13.17 per share. Now, let me mention several key assumptions embedded in our guidance. First, our revenue range reflects volume growth from Prolia, Otezla Repatha, EVENITY, Aimovig, and our biosimilars portfolio, and importantly, our innovative oncology portfolio. At the same time, we expect continued competition against our filgrastim and ESA franchises, as well as accelerating erosion in U.S. Parsabiv sales, as Murdo highlighted. We experienced a 6% decline in net selling prices globally in 2020. For 2021, we again expect mid-single-digit price declines. A couple of points to recall when considering Q1 of 2021. Historically, the first quarter represents the lowest product sales quarter of the year, with planned changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, especially for products, including Enbrel, Otezla and Aimovig. Additionally, I want to remind everyone that in Q1 2020, Enbrel benefited from approximately $115 of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions, and the entire portfolio saw roughly $100 million in inventory build due to COVID. So, as a proportion of our full year sales, we expect Q1 2021 to be a slightly lower percentage than the 24% it was in Q1 2020. We expect other revenue to be in the range of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for the full year 2021. This includes revenues from COVID-19 antibody manufacturing and profit share agreement with Lilly, under which we expect to begin shipping in the second quarter. We expect 2021 total non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at a rate similar to the 7% 2020 non-GAAP operating expense growth, as we continue to invest in innovation, launches of new products and digitization efforts. We have created an industry-leading cost structure and expect an operating margin of roughly 50% in 2021. Cost of sales as a percent of product sales will increase to a range of 16% to 17% due to an evolving product mix, and higher royalties and profit share payments. Additionally, cost of sales will increase in connection with our manufacturing agreement with Lilly. As I mentioned previously, the revenues and profit share will be included in other revenue. Research and development expenses will increase as our pipeline advances with year-over-year increases in early and late-stage investments. And SG&A will decline, primarily due to changes in our commercial model including an increased focus on digital efforts. Now, let me take a moment to explain an update we are making to our non-GAAP policy. Effective January 2021, our non-GAAP results will no longer include fair value adjustments to equity investments. These adjustments to equity investments have historically been recorded in other income and expenses and were positive in our 2020 non-GAAP results. This change will not apply to our strategic investment in BeiGene, which is included in our non-GAAP results and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The press release contains the pro forma 2020 results by quarter under our updated policy. We will also now use updated adjusted 2020 amounts that conform to this policy for comparison purposes going forward. Under our updated non-GAAP policy that I just explained, here is our guidance for other income and expense. We anticipate non-GAAP other income expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of expense. This 2021 guidance reflects incorporation of four quarters of BeiGene's results versus three quarters in 2020, which are recorded on a one quarter lag. Recall that we only use the limited publicly available consensus estimates for BeiGene in connection with our guidance and thus may experience additional variability depending on BeiGene's actual results. Our basis in BeiGene as of December 31, 2020, was approximately $2.9 billion, and this long-term investment is valued at approximately $6 billion today based upon the current U.S. market price. Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance is 13% to 14%, and we expect capital expenditures of approximately $900 million this year, including investments in additional manufacturing and other capacity to support our volume-driven growth strategy as well as an environmental sustainability initiatives that will enable our global operations to achieve carbon neutrality by 2027 and also in our digitization efforts to continue to scale up and integrate data and analytics in everything we do at Amgen. And finally, our capital allocation hierarchy remains unchanged. After both internal and external innovation and then investing in our capital expenditures, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders in the form of growing dividends, including the 10% increase in the first quarter of 2021 to $1.76 per share. We anticipate opportunistic share repurchases in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, subject to our Board's authorization. So, in summary, we deliver for patients every patient every time, and for our investors in a challenging year that included the greatest public health crisis in 100 years, and the greatest economic disruption since the great depression. And we are confident in the outlook for Amgen's success in 2021 and beyond. This concludes the financial update. I will now turn the call back over to Bob. Thank you. Great question on the operating margin. As you know, we don't go out on a long-term basis on that. But, you also know that we intend to continue to be a top-performing biopharma firm, when you look at any number of financial metrics and importantly, operating margin. I do want to make sure that I mention and confirm, we will remain flexible and adaptable as attractive internal and/or external investment opportunities arise. We have the underlying objective to grow our volumes and after tax cash flow. So, that's really important to us. We are committed to lean on our permanent productivity commitment. As I mentioned, we're investing in and working on digitization and automation. So, we'll continue to exercise all that muscle to make sure that we do remain an outperforming biopharma firm and operating margin. On the biosimilars, that's a fair question. We continue to see biosimilars as an extremely strong allocation of capital for us. The margins continue to be very competitive. And we're very confident in terms of allocating capital to that category, and we'll continue to do that. And we think we've got some strong expertise there. I like to quote Murdo, who says that we've played a lot of defense in biosimilars. And now, as we're on offense, we're able to have a high quality of execution level. So, good questions in that, and I'll flip it over to -- I think, to Bob. Thanks for the question, Geoff, and I'll invite Murdo here in just a moment to jump in on soto and teze. And look, we expect continued COVID impact throughout 2021 and revenue potential recovery in the latter part of the year contingent on the vaccination rollout, as I mentioned. So, we'll be closely monitoring that, as you can imagine. And with respect to soto and teze, let me turn that over to Murdo. And look, it's a very exciting time for us. And we've invested a lot of money getting preparing the launches for those and so forth. So, Murdo? Salim, I would just jump in and say, we had a strong quarter on Kyprolis in the fourth quarter, given the approval of CANDOR and our first full quarter promoting it. And we expect to be able to do a nice job of making hemonc specialists around the world aware of those data in combination with daratumumab. So, more growth to come on Kyprolis, and it's a good story now."

            "name": "Dave Reese",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin today with sotorasib, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor. To-date, more than 700 patients have been treated across five continents. We are accelerating this groundbreaking program into new indications and earlier lines of therapy. A few days ago, we presented the first pivotal data for KRAS G12C inhibitor at the World Conference on Lung Cancer, where we reported on 126 patients with second line plus non-small cell lung cancer. Sotorasib drove rapid, deep, and durable responses across a broad range of mutational profiles in subgroups with poor prognoses. In a centrally adjudicated intent-to-treat analysis, the objective response rate was 37%, including three complete remissions, progression-free survival was 6.8 months and duration of response was 10 months. Importantly, sotorasib demonstrated a very tolerable and differentiated clinical profile. And based on these data, we completed regulatory submissions in the United States and EU in December. More recently, we submitted files in Canada, the UK, Brazil, and Australia with additional global submissions anticipated in the coming weeks and months, and launch preparations are well-advanced. The Phase 3 non-small cell lung cancer monotherapy study versus docetaxel continues to advance nicely as do our 10 combination cohorts and Phase 2 colorectal study with data expected from these latter two, beginning in the first half of this year. We will initiate a Phase 2 study in first line non-small cell lung cancer in the second quarter, where we will investigate sotorasib monotherapy in patients most likely to benefit, based on tumor profiling. For example, those tumors harboring STK11 mutations. Finally, we recently cleared the safety hurdle at the full sotorasib dose in our MEK inhibitor combination study and have completed enrollment in an expansion cohort. In inflammation, along with our partner, AstraZeneca, we look forward to presenting the results from the Phase 3 NAVIGATOR study at the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology Virtual Annual Meeting, also known as AAAAI, at the end of February. You may have seen the abstract posting yesterday, with results from the primary and key secondary endpoints data that in our view, provide a compelling rationale for the potential utility of tezepelumab in a broad population of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, including those with low eosinophil counts where we have breakthrough therapy designation in the United States. We are working closely with AstraZeneca on our U.S. and EU filing packages, which we expect to submit in the first half. Turning to our BiTE platform, we are particularly excited about the rapid progress we are making with two solid tumor programs, AMG 160, targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen, or PSMA, for castrate-resistant prostate cancer; and AMG 757, targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. AMG 160 is currently in dose expansion, and we expect to advance AMG 757 into dose expansion in the coming months. We are quite pleased with the clinical profiles we are seeing with both of these molecules. And, as you will see in our press release, we also continue to actively prioritize our oncology portfolio. In migraine, Aimovig continues to demonstrate important benefits for patients as our colleagues at Novartis announced positive Phase 4 results, showing superior efficacy and safety of Aimovig over topiramate in the migraine prevention setting. Finally, our biosimilars portfolio continues to advance, and we have completed enrollment in our Phase 3 study of ABP 959, our biosimilar SOLIRIS. In closing, I'd like to thank our staff for their ongoing efforts to deliver our portfolio for patients. Murdo? Yes. I think that covers it pretty well, Bob. I would say that we view this multi-specificity in drugs as part of the future. Many of you know that 80% to 85% of the currently desirable targets are currently undruggable. We think this is going to be a very important technology and making many of those targets tractable. And as Bob mentioned, we are investing for the long haul, and we expect that to be a combination of both internal and external innovation. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Thank you for this question. I would say, overall, I feel very bullish on the BiTE program. As we mentioned, AMG 160 and AMG 757 are advancing quite rapidly. Cytokine release syndrome is clearly the single challenge that sits before the entire field. And we're making adjustments in the 701 program to handle that. I'm quite confident that we can come up with a clinically important profile for that molecule. There are many BCMA molecules in development. And of course, we'll shape our investments according to whether we can really fulfill an unmet medical need. I would say, in closing that I'm quite optimistic about the half-life extended BiTE platform, the -- a few of the positives such as AMG 673 for acute myelogenous leukemia were done on purpose because we selected the first generation molecule, which we are investigating in a minimal residual disease, setting where that technology is well suited. This was done in close concert with our investigators. Many of these choices were part of our strategy. We anticipated making these choices as part of prudent shaping of our portfolio going forward. So, overall, I feel quite good about where we are and how that platform is evolving. Yes. Thanks for the questions. In regards to the combinations, the ones you mentioned are all actively in dose escalation, looking at either different doses or in some cases, even scheduling, depending on the agents. This is standard Phase 1b oncology drug development. I feel good about how quickly we're moving. And we'll provide guidance as we expect those data to emerge. With tezepelumab, as you mentioned, the abstract is out now. We feel the data are very strong. We feel we're competitive. With the best in the high eosinophil population and in many ways, standalone in the low eosinophil population, the steroid-sparing study. As you alluded, we think there were potentially trial design issues. And we're going through that with our investigators, anticipate presenting those data a little later this spring. And we're discussing with our partners, whether a differently designed follow-on study would be appropriate. I would point out that that trial was not necessary for filing, and we are moving ahead with all deliberate speed, as we announced with global submissions of tezepelumab, based on the current data. Exactly. We've got a couple of gastric cancer BiTEs, of course, also a solid tumor indication. And we've got some other molecules in late preclinical. We're just entering the clinic that will target solid tumor indications. More on those, as we're ready to speak about them going along. So, I think it's going to be quite a broad portfolio. Yes, thanks. And I think we are able to just rejoin in time for that question. Again, I think in terms of the early pipeline, AMG 160 and AMG 757, as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, are ones that we're really looking at. 160 has advanced into the expansion cohort. And if we continue to generate data as we have recently through a larger number of patients. That's a program that we would probably be discussing potential registration paths sooner rather than later. I think, AMG 757 is just one step behind. And that's another one that we're keeping a very close eye on. And then, in our inflammation portfolio, we've got a variety of Phase 2 assets in autoimmune indications, as we previously indicated, and those programs are ones that I'm quite interested in, as we move forward. Yes. So, Salim, yes. Kyprolis, I think, has nothing to do with that. What you're seeing is the natural evolution of a portfolio based on emerging data, and we will expect that to be shaped going forward, based on emerging data, of course. And some of the changes we announced today our strategic choices that we had teed up that we anticipated making. And we think it's a prudent portfolio management to make those choices. Let me call out the MCL-1 programs in particular, where we have elected to move forward with the IV formulation. Again, we had anticipated we would choose among those molecules. And given our ability to more precisely control exposures and achieve a therapeutic window, in collaboration with our investigators, we made that decision, and we're moving through dose escalation after reinitiation of that program. So, no specific conscious choices, based on hematology versus solid tumors and more shaping to come as data emerges."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Bob Bradway",
            "content": "Thank you, Arvind, and thank all of you for joining our call. I'll start today by discussing Amgen's performance in 2020, and then provide some perspective on our priorities for 2021. By any measure 2020 was a very successful year for us. Despite the disruption of COVID-19, we delivered strong sales and earnings, driven by volume growth of 15% of our products. We advanced our innovative pipeline, most notably sotorasib and tezepelumab, both of which have received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. We successfully integrated Otezla, strengthening our decades-long leadership in inflammation with a $2 billion plus product that we believe has runway for further global growth. We grew our sales outside the U.S. to more than $6 billion, delivering on long-term goals by expanding our presence in China and Japan, the successful transactions in both markets. We did all this while staying focused on the health and safety of our 24,000 employees around the world. And to all of them, I want to say thank you for a job well done. As we look to 2021, we're embracing three realities. First, COVID-19 is leading to some lasting changes in how we do business. For example, we expect to continue leveraging digital capabilities, call on customers and run clinical trials around the world with improved speed, efficiency, effectiveness. Second, we expect ongoing pressure on drug prices across the industry. We are fortunate to have products like Repatha, Prolia, Aimovig that meet the needs of millions of patients and can grow through increased penetration of the appropriate patient populations. Our industry-leading portfolio of biosimilars is also well-positioned for future.  Third is capital continues to flow into our sector. We've entered a time of intense competition where speed of execution is paramount. We've built a track record featuring quality and speed. We've shown that with innovative first-in-class medicines like Repatha, the first approved PCSK9 inhibitor, and Aimovig, the first approved CGRP inhibitor. We showed it also with biosimilars, like MVASI and KANJINTI, the first approved biosimilars to Avastin and Herceptin, here in the U.S. And we're doing it right now with sotorasib, the first KRAS G12C inhibitor to be filed for approval just 28 months after we dosed our first patient. We expect to do it again later in the year when tezepelumab as the first TSLP inhibitor. We are excited about our pipeline and plan on increasing our R&D investment in 2021. Dave will speak in a moment about some of our promising mid-stage pipeline candidates. But since this is the time of year when I'd like to address our long-term investments, I want to focus for a moment on a couple of areas central to our early research strategy. These are areas where we are building differentiated capabilities. First, in human genetics, where we have industry-leading capabilities, we are adding to our database approximately 1 million subjects from the U.S. and the UK, or whom we will have extensive phenotypic and genotypic information. This will augment the data we already have on in excess of 1.5 million individuals. In addition, we're pioneering the use of large-scale proteomics to measure the relative levels of some 5,000 different proteins in the blood. We're excited about the insights we generate from this genomic proteomic work and expect to benefit in the selection of new drug targets and clinical trial design. There's growing interest in our industry in the area of targeted protein degradation. We believe the opportunity is broader than that, and our efforts are not just limited to degrading proteins. We're looking at degrading other biologic molecules as well. We're designing molecules to have multi-specific activity through a principle we call induced proximity. The idea is to use this platform to dramatically expand the universe of druggable targets. It's still early days in the field, but I wanted to flag it as an area where we want to emerge through time as an industry leader. All of our work is taking place at a time when more is expected of companies than ever before. Amgen is advancing an ambitious ESG agenda that includes providing medicines at no cost to low-income patients and funding world-class STEM education programs. With respect to the environment, we're committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2027, along with a 40% reduction in water use and the 75% reduction in waste. In summary, our success in 2020 gives me great confidence in our ability to deliver in 2021 and beyond. The world needs more innovation, not less, and we've proven ourselves ready, willing and able to provide it. I look forward to your questions a little later on in the call. Right now, let me turn over to Dave Reese, our Head of R&D. Okay. Thank you, Peter. And Erica, let me invite you to remind our callers of our process for Q&A, and let's begin the question session. Hi, Alethia, and thanks for the question. Yes, we do get this one quite a bit about the combinations. What I will say is there's no generic answer here. It's going to depend on line of therapy end indication, non-small cell lung cancer, of course, colorectal cancer and then some of the other indications beyond that. Typically, you're looking for a 15%, 20%, 30% increment on any given endpoint beyond standard of care, but also looking at the totality of the data. I think in many of these settings, in particular, progression-free survival and ultimately, overall survival. So, given the safety profile we've demonstrated to date, those are the sort of efficacy metrics that we'll probably take a look at. Yes. Thanks, Mike. No, we are very pleased with rapidity of enrollment in the MEK safety cohort. As we noted, we've moved beyond that to the expansion cohort. It's quite possible we'll have data from that over the course of this year. It will depend on just as the data come in and as we see those results. And again, it's too early to speculate on whether this could be pivotal or not. As I've mentioned, the master protocol from which these data are derived is essentially designed, so that any given arm can be blown up into a pretty rigorous Phase 2 trial. And depending on indication and line of therapy, of course, we would make any sort of decisions regarding regulatory intent in that context. So, more to come as those data unfold, but we're quite happy with what we're seeing in terms of enrollment. On SHIP2, it's moving along. I think biologically, that is a very interesting combination. And again, potentially more to come over the course of the year on that combination as well. Terence, thanks for the question. As I said in my remarks, rather than calling it targeted protein degradation, we're describing it as our induced proximity platform. The intention there, as I said, is just to be clear that we think the technology that we're building can be used, not just to degrade proteins but other molecules as well. So, we're excited about it. This is -- as I said, again, in my remarks, long-term research strategy. And Dave, his team and I spent a lot of time with each other, trying to think about how to position for the long term. And in this area, will be both internal and external. I'd remind you that we acquired new evolution now two years ago for the purpose of helping to build out this set of capabilities. And I would imagine we'll continue to look, as I said, both internally and externally. Dave, feel free to jump in and add your thoughts. Evan, I think, we've been pretty consistent in saying that our focus is on investing in the business. So, as we said in our prepared remarks, we're planning to increase our investment in R&D this year. So, committing internally to continue to allocate capital to R&D opportunities. We'll continue to look externally. We'll look at small and larger opportunities, like licensing and business development. They're very active in the areas where we have demonstrated expertise therapeutically. And that's what our focus very likely entail opportunities that sit well with the areas that we have demonstrated expertise in. In terms of the balance sheet, rather than engage in hypothetical, we maintain a strong balance sheet so that we have strategic flexibility. And we'll consider individual opportunities as they arise. There is a lot there, Dan, in your question. Murdo and I will just double team you. But, very quickly, let me remind you what we pointed out when we entered into a partnership with AstraZeneca in particular, around the respiratory opportunity, which was that just as you point out, is a new area for us. We felt that we could deliver more for our shareholders and more for patients by collaborating with a group that had demonstrated an expertise in respiratory medicine. And so, we chose to partner with AstraZeneca, and we're pleased with that collaboration and look forward to taking the molecule to market with them. And I would just point out that we came to this through our commitment to anti-inflammation and have decades of experience in the biology of information that we've been able to capitalize on with this program and hopefully others over time. But Murdo, jump in and in particular, share your thoughts also on the solid tumor question. Thanks for the question, Robyn. And as we look at 2021, I would say that the majority of our growth will come from additional international launches of our biosimilar portfolio. And obviously, some additional revenue from AVSOLA and RIABNI, two relatively recent biosimilar launches in the U.S. Specifically, if you think about MVASI and KANJINTI, they are a little bit different. And the differences are twofold. There's more than that ballistic to the two major ones. Bevacizumab as a molecule is actually growing, whereas trastuzumab as a molecule is flat to declining. So, one thing that we're seeing in MVASI is actually the number of cycles of bevacizumab overall is growing. And so, even holding share in that molecule actually holds up quite well. We also have less competition. That's the other factor. So there's less competition for now in the bevacizumab molecule, whereas with trastuzumab, we have more competitors. And so, I think going forward, you would see competitive dynamics shaping those two brands a little bit differently. Yes. I was picking up a little bit of static. So, I think the question's on EVENITY. The first part of the question I understood was how are we sourcing our EVENITY growth? Is it from existing anabolic patients, or are we expanding and treating new patients? I didn't catch the second part of the question, but let me address the first part. Overall, we're pleased with how EVENITY has evolved. We've got nice evolution in our Japan business. In Japan, it's obviously -- we've been in the market a little bit longer. So, one thing that we're seeing with EVENITY is patients are on the product for a 12-month duration of treatment. And so, you have to replenish those new patients. You do have to source those new patients. And so, I think the team in Japan is quite experienced now at sourcing new patients and not necessarily where we got our early growth was from which was switching from other anabolics. And there are -- unfortunately, there are a lot of aging patients in these markets where osteoporosis goes unchecked and patients suffer fractures and these high-risk patients need a solid bone builder, like EVENITY to be able to improve their clinical outcomes. So, I think in Japan, we're sourcing now more de novo growth than we were perhaps 6 to 12 months ago. Whereas in the U.S., it's much more of a mix of de novo and switch. The other thing that's helping us in the U.S. is, of course, having both Prolia and EVENITY for the customer. A lot of the time when a patient will come in and have a fracture despite their Prolia treatment, they're a really good candidate for EVENITY. So, we're often getting patients on both treatments. And sometimes after the 12 months of EVENITY treatment are up, they'll roll back on to Prolia. So, it's a nice franchise to have and have both an anti-resort and a bone-building agent for our customers. So, I think, the future growth looks very good. Obviously, our partners at UCB are just getting going in Europe as they establish reimbursement for the product. But, I'm quite excited about what EVENITY could become for bone building for these very high-risk post-fracture patients. Maybe I'll just take the first sense or two, and then Murdo, you can augment however you'd like. But, Carter, what I'd say is that when we acquired it, we said we felt we could achieve double-digit growth through the first several years of ownership, and we continue to feel confident in that. And that's a function of both, potential for increased label range in the U.S. as well as the opportunity to launch in international markets. But, Murdo, maybe you want to elaborate on the opportunity, the mild to moderate, severe opportunity? Thanks, Jay. Yes. We're very pleased to get breakthrough therapy designation in China. As our filing plans move forward with our colleagues at BeiGene, we'll provide guidance about what those time lines might look like. But, it has a little bit different implications in China than it does potentially in the United States. And then, one thing that we're looking at quite carefully is the epidemiology of G12C mutations. There is a suggestion that it may be a little lower in prevalence in Asian populations, probably because they are mutually exclusive with mutations in EGFR, which are quite high in these populations, up to 40% in China and Japan, for example. So that will be an important question that we address. We've got active research collaborations now, looking at just that. And Murdo, I don't know if you want to add anything about the commercial side in China. Yes. Thanks, Colin. This is a question we get frequently. We demonstrated efficacy in -- across a broad range of patients regardless of eosinophil count. I think that's what clinicians will pay attention to. We'll provide guidance as regulatory discussions proceed. I think, it's too early, of course, prior to submitting to debate what a potential label would look like. But, our view is that overall these are very, very strong data pointing to a differentiated product. And I think this is just going to be a really important medicine for patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. Yes. Ronny, I think you definitely see a diminishing rate of return or gain in terms of volume share. You see that in the shape of our uptake curves for both our oncology biosimilars in the U.S. I think that the way, of course, these products are used, they're largely used in the community setting, about 80% of the usage of both bevacizumab and trastuzumab in a community oncology setting. And those businesses tend to contract on a network by network basis. And by now, most of those contracts are set in motion. There's still some incremental opportunity to add to our overall revenue base. But yes, I think the gains on volume will be incremental. And then, price trends, as I mentioned in my scripted remarks, will continue to evolve the way we've seen them. Yes, sure. Let me take that question. We filed in the EU, obviously, we've got ongoing discussions. We'll provide guidance at the appropriate time. We don't speculate on likely timelines or probabilities in terms of regulatory approvals. But, I think, it is fair to say that regulators around the world do recognize the large unmet medical need in patients with G12C mutations after first-line therapy, and that certainly will be the focus of discussion going forward."

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. 2020 product sales grew 9% year-over-year, driven by 15% volume growth, with roughly equal growth rates in the U.S. and internationally. Starting with our innovative portfolio, Prolia grew year-over-year, despite significant impacts from the pandemic. And EVENITY sales increased 85% year-over-year, driven by strong volume growth. Repatha is now annualizing at over $1 billion in revenues with 67% year-over-year volume growth. In the first full year since acquisition, we've seamlessly integrated Otezla, growing total prescriptions by 13% year-over-year. And finally, our biosimilars portfolio totaled $1.7 billion in sales. Moving to fourth quarter performance. Product sales grew 8% year-over-year, driven by 13% volume growth. In our bone franchise, we remained focused on ensuring patient continuity. By year-end, osteoporosis diagnoses reached approximately 80% of pre-COVID levels, leading to a positive trend in new patient starts, entering 2021. In Q4, Prolia's repeat patient numbers were lower than historical trends, as a result of the echo effect of COVID disruption in Q2. EVENITY sales grew quarter-over-quarter. We believe EVENITY's unique bone building profile will continue to drive growth in our franchise as physicians appreciate its benefit risk profile for treating their high-risk post fracture patients. In cardiovascular, Repatha remains the global PCSK9 leader. Net sales in Q4 were $253 million, driven by sequential volume growth and stable U.S. net price. As we enter 2021, we expect continued momentum for this brand globally, driven by growth from international markets, improved U.S. PBM formulary position and relatively stable net price in the U.S. Moving on to Aimovig, which is the market leader in the highly competitive CGRP class, volumes grew 21% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but remained flat quarter-over-quarter as the pandemic negatively impacted new patient starts. Next to Parsabiv. Q4 sales declined 8% quarter-over-quarter in the U.S. as some customers decreased utilization, while others built inventory in advance of the January reimbursement change. With Parsabiv's inclusion in the end-stage renal disease bundle, we expect sales to decline by approximately 40% to 50% in 2021 as U.S. dialysis centers update their treatment protocols to accommodate generic forms of cinacalcet. We also expect sales in Q1 to be the lowest of the year as customers deplete $40 million of inventory build in the second half of 2020. For patients on hemodialysis, Parsabiv is the only IV-administered calcimimetic that lowers and maintains key secondary hyperthyroidism lab values. Also, Parsabiv offers providers control over calcimimetic delivery and the opportunity to reduce patient pill burden. Transitioning to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales were $617 million in Q4, driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in total U.S. prescriptions. We see attractive future growth opportunities through global launches, and our planned submission for the mild to moderate psoriasis indication in the U.S. in the coming weeks. With Enbrel, fourth quarter sales declined 5% year-over-year. Volumes declined from gradual share loss, coupled with slower growth in the rheumatology segment, which we attribute in part to the pandemic. For 2020, net price declined in the low single digits, and we expect volume and net price trends to persist in 2021. Enbrel has an established record of safety and efficacy, and we will continue to invest in innovative solutions to enhance the patient experience. Switching to biosimilars. Q4 sales were $541 million, driven by volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We are leading in biosimilar share in Europe for AMGEVITA and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI, with a respective 48% and 41% average share in Q4. We recently launched our fifth biosimilar, RIABNI, a biosimilar to Rituxan. For 2021, we expect biosimilar volume growth to be partially offset by a decline in net selling prices due to increased competition. In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF with 54% share of volume in the quarter. Onpro continues to demonstrate the value of innovation, allowing patients to receive their GCSF treatment without having to return to their doctor's office or other sites of care for administration. Overall, Neulasta sales decreased 19% year-over-year, driven by declines in volume and net selling price. And the most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 28% year-over-year. Going forward, we expect the price and volume trends to persist as biosimilar competition increases. Looking ahead, we're excited about new opportunities across our business. Internationally, we recently received national reimbursement drug listing for Prolia, which will accelerate growth in China. In Japan, we're preparing for the launch of Aimovig, and we're planning for the launch of our biosimilar brands across multiple markets in 2021. Finally, our team is ready to launch sotorasib upon approval, and we're excited to establish it as a foundational therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. And we're also preparing for the launch of tezepelumab with our partner, AstraZeneca, and are enthusiastic about the prospect of having a therapy that can help treat the 2.5 million people in the world living with severe uncontrolled asthma. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q4 and full year performance, and look forward to Amgen serving more patients in 2021. Now, I'll turn it over to Peter. Thanks, Peter, and thanks for the question, Geoff. Obviously, we're quite excited about sotorasib. And I want to complement Dave and his team how fast they've moved in developing this product and also just the number of regulatory submissions they've been able to affect in a very compressed time frame. So, we are optimistic and hopeful that we'll get a fairly quick review in multiple markets around the world. And so, we would expect sotorasib to contribute to revenue. We don't give product-specific guidance, but this is a very large population of high unmet medical need. There's not a lot of choice for these advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. So, we do anticipate that there'll be a potential market with a high need there. The one caution that I'll put out is just the actual percentage of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients that have a KRAS G12C status result in their file and their medical record. Right now, we ascertain that to be at about 50%. So, we've got work to do to grow that number. And obviously, we've seen, with other targeted therapies, when you have an actionable mutation, the testing rate rises fairly rapidly. So, we would expect upon approval to be able to do that. But nonetheless, we think sotorasib will be a meaningful contribution to at least revenue in the U.S. And then teze, we'll see what the regulatory authorities do with the filing, obviously, given that we had breakthrough designation. And obviously, given the pan-eosinophilic results that we've seen, and now you guys can see the breakdown in that in the abstract. We think this is an important medicine to get to market very quickly. The last question you asked about COVID in fact, Geoff, was just -- I think, we actually anticipate COVID will have a fairly significant impact on the market, through the better part of the year, beyond the midpoint of the year. I hope we're wrong and I hope that vaccination programs will improve. But right now, we think that COVID will be with us for the majority of 2021. Yes, sure. Thanks, Bob. We are building out our teams as we speak. And Amgen will help commercialize tezepelumab in the Americas region. So, U.S. and Canada, we will be focused on allergists, while AstraZeneca will play a broader role beyond just allergists, including the respiratory specialties. So, this is -- as you mentioned, it's a new area, but it's not that different from what we've done, as Bob mentioned, in other inflammatory disease processes. The other thing that's worth mentioning is we'll be taking a leading role in establishing access for tezepelumab with payers. And again, our extensive biologics contracting experience in Part D and the government programs will help us secure broad access for tezepelumab for a broad range of patients. As you saw, we have a nice product profile here that will benefit a lot of patients regardless of their eosinophilic status. And then, Dave Reese's team is obviously building out medical capabilities for the same customer-facing group. So, we're excited about it. It's a focused effort. The beauty of focusing on allergists is they're very productive prescribers, but they're a relatively small audience size. So, we'll be quite focused on addressing that. When it comes to kind of how we're looking at our oncology portfolio, we've got a very strong base right now in oncology between our hematology business, our solid tumor therapeutics that we have now our overall biosimilar portfolio and our supportive care. Basically one in five oncology patients today receives an Amgen therapy. And so, bringing sotorasib into that mix and then the potential of AMG 160 and 757 and 701, I think, is a fairly action-packed next few years in oncology that we can build on the current strength that we have, and we're excited about that. I'm always asking Dave Reese to deliver more, and I know his team have a lot of other earlier assets to put into the clinic. I'll turn it over to Dave for additional comments. Thanks for the question, Umer. The 25,000 was a U.S. number. We actually estimate the non-small cell lung cancer incidents globally at 120,000 patients. Now, obviously, there's some reduction from first-line to second-line in lung cancer because unfortunately, we lose patients in frontline. The second line and beyond is obviously our target population at launch. And we assume a 13% incidence of KRAS G12C in the broad non-small cell lung cancer patient population. Yes. So that's a U.S.-only number for incidence of non-small cell lung cancer that have progressed into second line and beyond. Thanks, Geoffrey, for the question. There were a couple of factors that went into our recent reorganization of our field force. One is just portfolio evolution and creating capacity for the new product launches and then reallocating from the older side of the portfolio. And depending on which region you're talking about in the world with Amgen, we're in very different stages of development. So, for example, we're placing large investments in field force in Japan and in China, even in Russia and some other markets that are emerging for us as being important growth drivers. And in the U.S. we're really paying close attention to the forces in the market beyond COVID. We're looking at potential negative net price effects and/or price reform, as Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, as being a bit of a prevailing wind here. And so, what we're doing is looking at our overall commercial model, and to your point, making it more productive and making it more efficient. So, we're largely on track with that plan. We were able to move very rapidly last year and build out our digital capabilities to an even greater extent than we had historically. We are seeing customers willing to engage in those channels. And we think some of those engagements will be persistent beyond COVID, quite frankly. And it's that persistency that we're betting on. What we haven't done is compromised the ability to have competitive share of voice in our field facing interactions, both on the medical side, both on the commercial side, in front of the customer. And so, we think we'll continue to be able to compete effectively in the categories we're in, as well as augment that with highly efficient digital channels of communication. Yes. Thanks, Bob. We do see some of the international expansion maturing now. We've got a good business for Otezla in Japan. We're pursuing registration in China, and we recently secured reimbursement in Australia. So, we're evolving the global footprint of Otezla beyond where the legacy Celgene efforts had it. So, that is one source of growth. But, as Bob mentioned, we're also pursuing in the U.S. mild to moderate approval on the basis of the positive data set we have there. And that will allow us to move Otezla into a patient population that really is still an unmet need. These are patients who have enough skin surface area that they might be seeking an alternative to messy and inconvenient topical agents. And I think Otezla can play a very important role there in helping treat those patients. We're also in making investments in Otezla by expanding the promotional footprint of the product to include primary care promotion, something that Celgene had not done historically. So, we're doing that both for the moderate to severe patient, but as well for that mild to moderate indication in anticipation of that potential approval. And the only other thing I would say is, while we are seeing a little bit of softness in psoriasis and broader rheumatology, for the category due to COVID, Otezla being an oral has held up quite well, and the execution has been strong. I also think that the established safety and efficacy profile of Otezla is highly appreciated, given recent news in the broader rheumatology category of other orals where perhaps that risk-benefit equation is different than it is where it's very strong with Otezla. So, we think we've got a good opportunity for growth. We also said when we gave that guidance that it assumed a successful competitive program from the TYK2 asset. And of course, that was confirmed today. Yes. I think, we're obviously very excited about what we can do with the product, huge unmet medical need. We're seeing that China is an attractive market for specialty products and the fact that sotorasib is an oral makes it very accessible. So, we'll pursue commercialization of sotorasib in China, and our affiliate is very excited about that. Yes. Thanks, Michael. In human genetics, as Bob mentioned and as we previously announced, we have collaborations with Intermountain Health and UK Biobank that will add up to 1 million participants. We think we'll have the largest database on earth as these projects move towards completion. And we have broadened our focus on human data to include other omic technologies such as transcriptomics and proteomics really in the belief that in the long term, it will be human data such as these that are most important for drug discovery and development. At the current time, a majority of our non-oncology portfolio assets have genetic support that's either primary or secondary. And we expect over time that, that percentage will simply increase because there's now clear evidence that targets for which there's genetic validation and programs based on them have a higher rate of success. So, more to come. But we firmly believe that the era of human data is upon us, and we believe our collection of capabilities is almost unique in the industry. And we intend to push that forward. Thanks. I don't think it is, Salim, but I invite Dave to..."

        "content": "Operator: My name is April, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\nArvind Sood: Okay. Thank you, April. Good afternoon, everybody. I together with several members of our leadership team that you will hear from today, would like to welcome you to our Q3 call. The format of our Q2 call was very well received, so we\u2019ll stick to keeping our prepared comments to a minimum and limit the overall duration of the call to one hour. The slides have been posted. Just a quick reminder that we use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our 10-K and subsequent filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob?\nRobert Bradway: Okay. Thank you for joining today\u2019s call. I\u2019ll take a few moments to discuss our performance in the third quarter and then share some thoughts on the overall operating environment in a COVID context. We delivered another strong quarter, and you can see that in our revenue growth of 12%. And in addition, once again this quarter, our revenue growth exceeded expense growth, enabling us to report earnings per share growth well ahead of revenues. Putting the results in a broader context, our double-digit increase in revenues was driven by the continued volume-driven growth of many of our innovative products, the strong uptake of our high-quality biosimilars and the relative stability of our base business, which is proving resilient in the face of increased competition. We expect these three factors to be key for our long-term success. Turning to COVID-19, clearly the pandemic remains an important factor affecting performance for Amgen and for our industry. You\u2019ll recall that Amgen grew revenues by 11% in the first quarter of the year, with the first 10 weeks of performance largely unaffected by the pandemic. In the second quarter, when conditions were at their worst, revenues grew by 6%. Our performance in the third quarter reflects an encouraging recovery from the depths of the pandemic and was largely consistent with what we anticipated for you in our remarks at the time of our second quarter call. As regards to the fourth quarter, we see the current resurgence in cases as a potential headwind for our business, and we are closely monitoring this to see what the impact may be for the rest of the year and if there might be any spillover into 2021. We don\u2019t expect anything like what we saw earlier in the year, as global healthcare systems know much more about how to treat COVID-19 and are better prepared to do so than they were earlier in the year. However, on the margin, we\u2019re not ruling out that there will be some impact and we tried to incorporate this into our planning assumptions for the fourth quarter and into the beginning of next year. Overall, I remain optimistic that innovation from the biopharma industry will break the back of this pandemic, with vaccines, antibodies and other therapeutics that are being developed with unprecedented speed and collaboration. One thing this pandemic has exposed is the importance of innovation, and that of course is at the core of our strategy and it\u2019s reflected in the first-in-class molecules that are advancing rapidly in our pipeline. We are pleased, of course, with the Phase II results of our first-in-class molecule sotorasib and we expect to see topline Phase III data for tezepelumab, a potential first-in-class treatment for severe asthma by year-end. We are also making good progress with several of our half-life extended BiTE molecules particularly in solid tumors like prostate and small-cell lung cancer. All the work that we do is taking place at a time when more is expected of companies than ever before. We understand these expectations and are committed to good corporate citizenship and sustainable operations. Before I turn things over to the rest of the team, let me thank our staff members around the world for their unwavering commitment to serving patients during this challenging time. Their resilience, creativity and ability to execute give me great confidence in our long-term future. Dave?\nDavid Reese: Thanks Bob. I\u2019ll begin with sotorasib, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor. Based on the data we have accumulated and the evolution of the field, we are extremely optimistic about the potential of sotorasib and will continue to aggressively advance the development program. Earlier this month, we reported positive topline results from our Phase II monotherapy study in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, demonstrating an objective response rate consistent with our Phase I data at 960 milligrams and promising results on other measures of efficacy, including duration of response, with more than half of the responders still on treatment at the data cutoff. Safety and tolerability were similar to previously reported data for this population and have been remarkably consistent across the 160 patients treated with our Phase II dose. Our Phase I and Phase II data are based on protocol specified intent to treat criteria as is our practice and the scans to assess efficacy parameters in Phase II have been evaluated by independent central review. We look forward to presenting the Phase II results at the World Congress on Lung Cancer taking place in January. We also reviewed with interest a data presentation made a few days ago. Based on our assessment of available efficacy and safety data, including durability measures, we remain extremely confident in our molecule. To date, we have treated over 550 patients with sotorasib and we are looking forward to discussions with the FDA and other regulatory agencies to determine the best path forward as monotherapy in patients with advanced lung cancer. We couldn\u2019t be more enthusiastic about our position as we move towards establishing sotorasib as a KRAS G12C foundational therapy. We also remain optimistic about our BiTE platform. We now have evidence of clinical activity in solid tumors, including recently presented prostate cancer data from AMG 160 which targets prostate specific membrane antigen. The benefit risk profile AMG 160 has continued to improve with additional dose optimization. AMG 757 is our half-life extended BiTE targeting DLL3, which is a very attractive target due to its differential expression in small-cell lung cancers, and we look forward to presenting initial data at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting next month. Small-cell lung cancer is a large unmet medical need globally and yet treatment options have not advanced significantly in decades. We will also investigate AMG 757 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. We expect to present data from AMG 701 targeting BCMA for multiple myeloma later in the year as well. And before leaving the BiTE platform, I wanted to mention a Phase II publication in the New England Journal of Medicine that reported deep responses and a tolerable safety profile for dasatinib induction followed by BLINCYTO consolidation in adults with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL. 60% of patients achieved a molecular response and disease free survival was 88% at 18 months, highlighting the potential of a chemotherapy free regimen. If these results are confirmed in larger trials, this could lead to a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of this disease. In cardiovascular disease, we recently released the topline results from our omecamtiv mecarbil Phase III outcome study and the results will be presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in November. In inflammation, along with AstraZeneca, we look forward to the topline results of the pivotal Tezepelumab Phase III study, Navigator, in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, which remains on track. We also expect the results from the oral corticosteroid sparing Phase III study source by the end of the year, which should complement the pivotal data. I\u2019m happy to announce that we will be advancing our third inflammation program into Phase II development next year with AMG 592, now named Efavaleukin alfa or IL-2 mutein for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. The trial was selected for inclusion in the FDA\u2019s complex innovative trial designs pilot program, which supports the development and regulatory review of novel clinical trial designs for new therapies. In closing, I would like to thank all of the Amgen teams for executing at such a high level during the ongoing pandemic. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Dave. We\u2019ve seen volumes continue to improve from the initial stages of the pandemic, with Q3 global revenues growing 12% year-over-year driven by 18% volume growth. During Q3, physician-patient interactions increased to near pre-COVID levels. Across the industry in the U.S., total prescriptions are still down approximately 2% and physician visits, either in person or remote are down approximately 10% versus the pre-COVID baseline. While trends improved during the quarter, we are seeing infection rates rise in many parts of the world, which may bring additional quarter-to-quarter variability. Let me spend a few minutes to discuss our Q3 performance and outline our expectations for the remainder of 2020. In bone health, our efforts are focused on ensuring patient continuity. We grew Prolia volume by 10% year-over-year, even though osteoporosis diagnosis rates have returned to just 70% of pre-COVID levels in the U.S. COVID has also resulted in a change in historical quarterly trends for Prolia. Prior to the pandemic, the first and third quarters each year had lower sales than the second and fourth quarters. However, given the impact of the pandemic in the second quarter and the six-month dosing regimen of Prolia, we would expect year-over-year growth rates in the fourth quarter to be lower than pre-COVID growth trends. With the current rise in COVID infection rates in the U.S. and Europe, there could be additional delays in patients receiving their Prolia treatment in Q4. EVENITY sales in the U.S. grew quarter-over-quarter driven by 30% volume growth. This growth was offset by lower sales in Japan, which were partially related to timing of purchases by our partner Astellas. We believe EVENITY\u2019s unique bone-building abilities will continue to drive growth in our business as physicians appreciate its benefit risk profile in treating their post fracture patients. Repatha sales increased 22% year-over-year, driven by 60% volume growth and is the segment leader globally. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha, and given the significant unmet medical need in treating high risk cardiovascular patients, our comprehensive patient payor coverage, the convenient self-administration and the established outcomes data in the label. Moving on to Parsabiv, which is an attractive treatment for secondary HPT, supported by the convenience of its IV administration. In January 2021, reimbursement for Parsabiv will move into the dialysis bundle payment system. We\u2019ve already begun to see some negative impact on Parsabiv utilization in the U.S., and we would expect this impact to continue in Q4. Transitioning to our Inflammation portfolio, total prescriptions for Otezla in the U.S. grew 11% year-over-year. Underlying volume trends remained strong. Sales were negatively impacted by lower inventory levels versus last year. We\u2019re confident that Otezla will continue its double-digit year-over-year volume growth based on its well-established safety and efficacy profile, convenient oral dosage, broad payor coverage and the lack of lab monitoring requirements. Enbrel remains the cornerstone of our Inflammation franchise and we continue to invest in Enbrel, along with our broader inflammation portfolio including Otezla, AMGEVITA and recently launched AVSOLA. Enbrel was impacted by slowing growth in rheumatology prescribing in Q3 related to COVID and experienced some share loss in the quarter while maintaining price stability year-on-year. Continued softness in rheumatology prescribing related to rising COVID infections could further impact Enbrel in the fourth quarter. Our Q3 biosimilar revenues were $480 million, supported by share growth by MVASI and KANJINTI. We\u2019ve achieved leading biosimilar shares for AMGEVITA in Europe and for MVASI and KANJINTI in the U.S. Our highly efficient operating model and full complement of patient services provide an important advantage as we face additional biosimilar competitors heading into 2021. In Oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF with 55% share of volume in the quarter. Neulasta sales decreased 22% year-over-year, driven by declines in volume and net selling price. Competitive activity in long-acting filgrastim is impacting average selling price. The most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 19% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our Q3 performance. We remain vigilant as the pandemic continues to create uncertainty and potential disruptions in the healthcare marketplace. Amgen employees around the world are focused on ensuring continuity of care for our patients, and we will continue investing to drive growth of our innovative products, advance our geographic expansion and prepare for potential new product launches. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Murdo. Consistent with the first half of the year, we executed effectively during the third quarter, delivering 12% revenue and 19% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. As you heard Murdo say, revenue growth was driven by volume increases of 18% consistent with our focus on volume-driven growth. Third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter, as we accelerated our investments to drive growth and advance the pipeline. Although activity levels during Q3 were still partially impacted by COVID-19, most trials continue to enroll patients. Customer-facing commercial activity levels increased and launch preparations were in process. We see activity levels increasing in the fourth quarter of the year, resulting in increased investments. We have financial flexibility with $12.4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, and continue to generate stable free cash flow with $3.2 billion in the quarter. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was $1.60 per share, an increase of 10% over last year. Our capital allocation principles and plans remain unchanged and uninterrupted. Let me now share some thoughts on our 2020 outlook going forward. We are narrowing our revenue guidance to $25.1 billion to $25.5 billion from $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion. The range reflects the uncertainty created by the recent resurgence of COVID-19 infections globally which Bob discussed in his remarks. And as you just heard Murdo say, our products, including Prolia, for the most at-risk COVID patients are most susceptible to the accelerated rate of infection. The lower end of our range takes into account a more accelerated impact from COVID globally. We are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $15.80 per share to $16.15 per share versus our prior guidance of $15.10 per share to $15.75 per share. We continue to believe that we could experience fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and earnings over the duration of the pandemic. As we shared during our Q2 call, we expect full-year total non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year on an absolute basis. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at about 20% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Now let me share a bit more detail on our non-GAAP expectations for the full-year 2020. Cost of sales as a percent of product sales will be generally consistent with 2019. We plan to increase R&D investments in the fourth quarter of the year, as clinical trial and laboratory activities continue to recover from COVID related slowdowns. SG&A spend is projected to increase due to investments in Otezla and other growth brands, geographic expansion and launch preparations. We anticipate other income and expense to be a net expense of about $1.3 billion, which includes more than $130 million of benefit from mark-to-market gains on our equity investment portfolio in Q3. We are updating non-GAAP tax rate guidance to 13% to 14%, versus prior guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. Our expectations for share repurchases are unchanged. At the lower end of our previously disclosed range of $3 billion to $5 billion. Finally, recall that Q4 of 2020 will be comparing against a partial quarter of Otezla sales and expenses in Q4 2019. So as we approach the end of 2020, we are pleased with our progress and execution this year, including the successful integration of Otezla, collaboration with BeiGene and transition from Astellas in Japan. As is customary, we will provide full 2021 guidance on our January call. This concludes the financial update. I\u2019ll turn it back to Bob to get going on Q&A. \nRobert Bradway: Okay, April, why don\u2019t we open up the lines for questions and perhaps you could start us by reminding our callers of the procedures for asking a question.\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies.\nMichael Yee: Hey, guys. Thanks for the update. Really appreciate it. I had a question on tezepelumab, of course a really important readout coming soon and it\u2019s an important drug. Just wanted to understand David\u2019s perspective on the importance of the low eosinophil group and in the context of the overall data and how important that is to hit there and how that would change the overall profile and outlook for that drug? Thanks.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Mike. Yes, and of course, we are greatly looking forward to that readout as well. What I can say is that the trial is very well powered to look at outcomes on the primary endpoint here as annualized exacerbation rates, the standard endpoint for asthma studies across the different subgroups, including the low eosinophil population. So we feel very comfortable that this will be a definitive test of tezepelumab across the entire range of patients with severe asthma.\nArvind Sood: April, can we have the next caller, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for the update. I guess another question for Dave. Could you maybe just comment, I know you commented on your opening remarks here on G12C. I guess the question here is as we think about moving the response rate higher in terms of the combination studies that you have ongoing, what's your relative confidence around those studies either improving response rates or improving durability? And how do you think about your ability to progress them rapidly now that you have a good sense of the monotherapy activities of the compound? Thanks.\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks, Matt. That's certainly the combination studies are an important topic, they're moving forward quite briskly. We have I think seven cohorts open now, three or four more are coming very soon. So we feel we are testing in a range of indications. The biologically plausible and clinically relevant combinations will have data next year on a number of these. And to your point, the goal always in combination therapy beyond monotherapy is to enhance efficacy and potentially in terms of response rates, but also durability if you are cutting off avenues of tumor resistance or escape, and that's certainly our goal. We're very much guided by the biology here, and as you look at those cohorts that are coming up I think you'll see that that's the case.\nOperator: And next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen.\nYaron Werber: Yes. Great. Thanks for taking my question. David, I'm just going to maybe keep you on the spot on sotorasib. Some of the data or comments that we heard this week is that a competing product was well tolerated at the high dose with an EGFR inhibitor and pembro. If I remember correctly at ESMO, I think your investigator said something along the lines, and correct me if I'm wrong, that it \u2013 with your product with PD-1 there was tolerability, there was \u2013 but it was addressed with dose reduction, something along those lines. If you don't mind maybe exactly kind of correct what he said. And then secondly on tezepelumab, our understanding is that the way the study is designed, it's actually incorporating the low eosinophil dose into one of the analysis in the primary endpoint as a sub-analysis. And so if you hit that, does that mean you get a broad label? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yes, sure. So let me take those in order. In terms of the combinations, one thing I would caution everyone is let's not over read anything into cohorts of three or four patients, whether that's our trials or anyone else's trials. We're moving forward. We've been \u2013 what we have is a foundation of tolerability in monotherapy, which is the critical thing to build on in combinations. And I think this was put into some perspective by an editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the publication of our Phase 1 trial a few weeks ago and I'd refer you to that. And certainly it's very common in combination therapy development in oncology to look at all sorts of dosing and scheduling regimens, and we fully intend to do that and on priority we would intend on doing that. With regards to the analysis in tezepelumab, yes, that's correct. The analysis is powered and geared across the entire population then with also look at the low eosinophil population. So your suppositions there are correct.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer.\nJay Olson: Hey, congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the comments around KRAS G12C. The competing program that [featured] [ph] data over the weekend did report QT prolongation, including some cases of, grade 3, 4. Is this a class effect and have you seen any cases of QT prolongation with sotorasib? And how important is this cardiovascular safety findings in this patient population? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yes. Well, I can't speak to directly to others data and of course, I'll allow them to do that. I will say that we've, as I mentioned, treated over 550 patients. There is no evidence whatsoever of a QT signal to date and we remain quite pleased with the overall tolerability of sotorasib.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I was just wondering if, as you think about capital allocation, if the Omecamtiv setback maybe changes anything on that front, particularly, how you think about the cardiology opportunity for the company. And then a question for Peter, I was just wondering if you could give us a preliminary view of 2021 expenses just relative to this year? Just wondering if you're wrapping up a number of late-stage programs now, why spend would grow next year. Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Hey, Terence. This is Bob, why don't I take the first part of your question. The short answer is no. The Omecamtiv results don't change our thinking on capital allocation. We continue to look for business development opportunities and continue to look for internal programs in cardiovascular disease. As you know, we're moving rapidly with our Phase II program directed against LP(a), so we're excited to have some advanced studies going for that molecule, and we'll continue to look for ways to invest in that franchise. Cardiovascular disease as you know, the leading killer of people on the planet. We continue to think what we need in that field is more innovation, not less. So we will continue looking for that.\nPeter Griffith: Terence, it's Peter. Thank you for your question. A good question. As you know, we will guide on 2021 when we get to January. But I do want to just say we always intend on continuing to be a top-performing biopharma firm looking at various financial metrics, always operating margin right there. So look, we're going to remain flexible and adaptable as attractive opportunities arise, and with the underlying objective to grow our after-tax cash flows. So that's where we sit right now on expenses. We wanted to be clear on the fourth quarter and how that's going to sequence in which is really on a normal historical basis, just at the upper end of it on an OpEx basis. So with that, I'll turn it over to the next question.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. Actually one for Murdo kind of on some of the dynamics in the Biosimilar business. So you're talking about pricing headwinds as volumes increase. Are you seeing this more in the inflammation space or this is \u2013 is this in oncology? And can you kind of provide some color as to how accounts generally I guess in the U.S. are using biosimilars? Is it more just totally forgetting the brand and going all to the biosimilar or do you see some sort of a mix? Thank you so much.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks. Evan. Look, we're really pleased with what we've been able to do with our Biosimilars business in the quarter. The team has done a really nice job this year despite COVID in establishing strong penetration into the U.S. oncology market with MVASI our Avastin biosimilar and KANJINTI, our Herceptin biosimilar. I would say with respect to the dynamic in the market, a lot of people question whether or not we had an efficient functioning biosimilar market in the U.S. because I think they were over interpreting some of the early biosimilar launches. And I think what you can see now is that we have an efficient market, that when there are \u2013 when there is a clear value on the table healthcare systems, providers and payers are able to capitalize on it. And that's what's driving of course the uptake of our biosimilars. I also think that the experience we've had in defending against biosimilar erosion on products like Neulasta has positioned us well to understand how accounts are looking to purchase biosimilars. So when we launched our own, we were able to take some advantage of that. And I would say that of the accounts that have opened up biosimilar usage generally initially we thought they might be using biosimilars for new patients going forward, but we've actually seen them use our biosimilars both for new patients and switching patients who are mid-course of treatment to biosimilars as well. So I'd say that the penetration at an account level has been deeper than we originally anticipated. And I think by now there is fairly broad adoption in the U.S. at the 340B level, the non-340B level and of course within the clinics. Now that's oncology. It's a little different in inflammation depending on the biosimilar itself whether it's a \u2013 an infused biosimilar or whether it's a self-injected or self-administered biosimilar. And I think need to watch that carefully because the two are not analogous. So I would treat each business segment as its own example and not draw comparisons from one to the other.\nEvan Seigerman: Thank you so much.\nArvind Sood: April, go ahead. April, are you there?\nOperator: All right. And your next question is from the lien of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler.\nChristopher Raymond: Thanks for taking the question. Yes, I was wondering if I could maybe ask on sotorasib again and take the conversation back there. So I heard, David, your commentary on hopes on the response rate in combo. But I think you guys are also working on a BID dose. And if memory serves, I think we were \u2013 maybe we were expecting to see something by year end or at least in the coming months. So I wonder if you could talk about your hopes with respect to that, potential as a monotherapy BID? And then also on the same topic, can you just confirm, does sotorasib have CNS activity? Can you give us a indication on that one? Thanks.\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks, Chris. Both important questions. It's standard in any new molecule as part of the clinical pharmacology program to examine different schedules. So we continue to do that with twice daily dosing. But one thing I'd urge everyone to do is kind of go back to basic pharmacokinetics here as we think about this field and what are the reasons to go to split dosing. Well there are really two reasons. One, if you need split dosing in order to achieve target coverage or two, if you need to split the dose because of tolerability issues. And with sotorasib, we're very convinced that we are getting target coverage throughout the dosing interval with our once-daily dosing, and of course we've got very nice tolerability at once daily dosing. And so that's really \u2013 this is I think basic pharmacology and pharmacokinetics and the science underlying that that has driven our clinical choices. In terms of CNS penetration, we did mention at ESMO we have a couple of patients with \u2013 one or two patients with CNS metastases who clearly had responses. So the question with small molecules or in CNS responses in general is always is that due to true penetration or because there is typically a highly disrupted blood brain barrier in that setting you almost always get some exposure to drug. The third potential explanation, which we continue to explore is that it's a secondary immune activation that could potentially trigger activity in the central nervous system. We are exploring this question explicitly in a cohort that we're just opening for patients with brain metastases. And so I think in through next year, we'll have a good sense of potential activity in the central nervous system. Thank you.\nChristopher Raymond: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Berens: Thank you for the question. This is Andrew on for Geoff. So I have a question regarding to tezepelumab's read outs. So if the study is successful, how might it be commercialized given the conflict that your partner has with \u2013 standout for the same indication? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Yes, thank you. I'll jump in on that one. We've obviously been very transparent with our partners on how we can commercialize tezepelumab. I have to say with the many years of experience that AstraZeneca has in this therapeutic area, we continue to believe they're outstanding partner. We've worked through all the details of commercialization. AstraZeneca will indeed be putting up dedicated resources for the promotion of tezepelumab. So think about different sales reps literally in the market promoting the two different products. We will be handling many elements of the commercial process in the U.S., for example, we'll be lead on the market access negotiations and relationships, while AstraZeneca will lead on consumer marketing and professional marketing. So I think we've really put the best of the best together here and I continue to have a lot of confidence in the emphasis that our partner is placing on this really exciting molecule, both for the launch and also just strategic lifecycle management ideas that they have as well.\nAndrew Berens: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my call. You've done really well with biosimilars. You're closing in on about $2 billion run rate from about $1 billion last year, I'm wondering about the balance for next year, you were seeing significant competition coming in on both the Avastin and Herceptin biosimilars. You're launching to yourself in rituximab and infliximab, but the dynamics seem to be potentially tougher. If we're going to think about the next 12 months, can we expect the same kind of growth rate or is this asking for too much? And then separately, Murdo, I was wondering if you can comment on Repatha outlook and how do you think about the competition with an RNA-based physician office based molecule?\nMurdo Gordon: Okay, thank you. Overall, I think the biosimilars business, as I said, has evolved really nicely and we've penetrated quite well. If I look at the oncology products in the U.S. running at 44% share currently on our Avastin biosimilar. I do think, as you see additional competitors come in, the average selling price will come down. So that's a reality that competition brings and it's related to my comment earlier about this being an efficient marketplace. I do think there is an appreciation though for what we've done at Amgen which is to have a very effective provider-focused commercial presence the same people that are talking to accounts about our innovative portfolio are talking to those same customers about our biosimilars. So all of our services that we normally have on an innovative product are available on biosimilars, and that includes patient services for things like reimbursement or co-pay assistance and I think that differentiates us. So I would anticipate us being able to continue to capture good volume albeit at some price erosion as we go into the new year. But as I said, we're at 44% share of the total bevacizumab market and slightly less than that of the trastuzumab market. So there's still a lot of headroom for growth. And I think on the inflammation side, the dynamics are a little bit different depending on whether it's a product like our Remicade biosimilar, Avsola or whether we're looking at a product like our Rituxan biosimilar. So I think we have to watch how we draw parallels on expectations. Overall, we made a big commitment to biosimilars. So we'll continue to advance new products through the clinic and into the market and we compete effectively across Europe and we're competing nicely so far in the U.S. Just transitioning to Repatha. Look we've done I think an excellent job of converting to an affordable price of Repatha. We've got about 80% access coverage across Medicaid and commercial and we're seeing really nice volume growth with 60% in the quarter, and I think we're also seeing some nice evolution outside of the U.S. where Repatha continues to gain share. The product \u2013 really with Repatha, we are scratching the surface of those that need this. There is a lot of high-risk coronary event patients who require more aggressive lipid lowering therapy. And in light of COVID, I actually think that Repatha is a unique solution. It's a self-administered product with excellent coverage and well demonstrated efficacy and safety profile and we have event reduction data in the label. So I think compared to a product that might require patients to travel to a physician office for administration in light of COVID, that's going to be a tougher task for another product to come in. So I feel good about where we are and I feel good about our growth prospects going forward.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow from UBS.\nColin Bristow: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. So another one on sotorasib. I'm just curious like you have more data on this asset now, what's your current thinking around the potential to advance this to early or I guess first line therapy in light of the strong data we've seen some higher agents in the G12C patients? Thanks.\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks, Colin. Great question. And of course as is typical in oncology development programs, you start in later lines of therapy where patients don't have much in the way of treatment options, but certainly moving into earlier lines of therapy will be part of the development program as we move forward. I would also point out that an important part of the program in later lines is the head-to-head Phase III trial against docetaxel chemotherapy. That is very important outside of the U.S. in some jurisdictions for regulatory approval, but also in many jurisdictions for our reimbursement. And so I wouldn't also overlook the potential of that. This is a global development program and that's another important piece. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Citibank.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one question on tezepelumab and asthma. So as the data are coming up, how important do you think is to show the benefit in low U.S. patients in case if it doesn't work, do you think you're partner may not be interested in commercializing this product given that they already have a product for high EOS patients and they may have two competing products? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yes. Well, let me start and then I'll hand things off to Murdo. As we discussed, the primary endpoint is powered across the entire population and also the analysis plan allows a look in the low eosinophil group. In our Phase II data, which is currently our best predictor, we showed relatively comparable efficacy regardless of eosinophil status and it certainly would be our hope that we're able to replicate that in Phase III. In terms of commercialization, let me ask Murdo to weigh in.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. As I mentioned before, there is a strategic commitment here from our partners to Teze. They've been very supportive constructive and helpful as we've worked through the development plan and now we look beyond that to the commercialization and potential lifecycle management ideas and I think that there is a strong press from AstraZeneca to continue to really think about all of the patients that we can benefit with development of Teze. I would just say that there is a large market opportunity here in severe asthma. Having alternative mechanisms in the market is a good thing and I think that there's plenty of room for us to launch effectively there and I'm pretty sure that's how of our partners at AstraZeneca see it.\nMohit Bansal: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoffrey Meacham: Afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Murdo, I feel like I ask this one a lot, but on Aimovig, what do you think it will take for this product to really break out? I get it, it's growing on units. But for a new product, it looks range bound. Is there a meaningful negotiation with \u2013 renegotiation with payers like you guys did with Repatha that's going to be required or what do you think it could take? Thanks.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks Geoff. Let's narrow or reframe the question. I don't think it's a payer issue. I think we've negotiated very good access for Aimovig. It's covered broadly with very little in the way of utilization management criteria. Physician requests are being filled very well. Our percentage of paid patients is very high now. We're in the high 80% range for patients. So it's not an access restriction that's reducing the uptick of the class. There are really two things. One, is obvious, it's COVID. We are down substantially in new patients per week because of COVID and a lot of migraine sufferers unfortunately are just not seeking care. And neurology as a prescribing specialty is down more than some others like cardiology recovered nicely in the quarter. Neurology is still down in terms of total prescribing. And that's the COVID impact. And then there's another I think opportunity which we're focused on and that is to have both neurologists and patients moving quicker through older, less-effective preventative agents and to try biologic CGRPs like Aimovig, and that's really where our focus is for growth. We've seen movement there and it was going well, but we've still got a lot of work to do, as you point out. But we've got a large volume of patients, over $4 million. I think we're 15% penetrated into that patient population. So there is really no doubt in my mind that it will move. I also think, by the way the oral CGRPs are helping here with the promotional effort, communication of patients, awareness building of the benefits to the category. So they're acute promotion is also helping in the preventive space. But yes, we are focused on that. I think we've done all the right things on the communications front to payers. Now we are focused on patients and patient \u2013 providers and patients.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kennen MacKay from RBC Capital.\nKennen MacKay: Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Wondering or hoping rather that you could set the record straight for planning Omecamtiv mecarbil? Are there plans to pursue a regulatory filing for the agent and if so, what is the gating factor? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Kennen. I'll take that. With Omecamtiv we issued the topline results. We've got data coming out with the American Heart Association in just a couple weeks, and I think in the wake of that we will be discussing next steps.\nArvind Sood: Okay. April, let\u2019s take the next question please.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I had two here, if I may. First, I know there's a lot of focus on the duration of response data as it's evolving in your Phase I and Phase II trial with KRAS. But my question is, as we think about one step out in a possible first-line setting, possibly as a PD-1 combination, we know what KEYTRUDA does as a first-line regimen on a duration of treatment and duration of response. I'm curious, what's your expectation that KEYTRUDA paired with a targeted therapy, how much improvement can we see realistically? That would be very helpful. Number one. And also on that same note, as we head into the colorectal data in the first half knowing that there were I think three out of 25 responses in colorectal previously, what are your expectations on what we need to see to be more constructive on colorectal? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks, Umer. So in terms of duration of response in and moving in earlier lines of therapy, it's very clear what the checkpoint inhibitors do. I mean typically you're going to look for 25%, 30% improvements on these sorts of efficacy measures to get into the clinically meaningful range. So as we're designing programs, those are the sorts of targets that we would generally look at. In colorectal cancer, as I've mentioned before, we fully enrolled the Phase II trial data. Next year that will inform a potential monotherapy path forward. I would want to see response rates perhaps a little better than we've observed now for monotherapy, but that'll be a discussion with folks in the field. And here, I would say there is also just a huge amount of emphasis on combination therapy to both enhance the response rate and then of course to generate duration of response. As I mentioned earlier, we've got a number of combination trials, either up and running or about to launch and some of them are directed specifically for colorectal cancer. So we're really looking forward to generating those data. But I think that's the kind of state of play right now.\nUmer Raffat: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald.\nAlethia Young: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and the progress. Can you just talk a little bit about Otezla and what you've seen in light of maybe COVID-19? Would it be an oral? And I know there\u2019s more kind of marketing, I guess on the television. Just wanted to get your outlook on price and volume over the next 12 months. Thanks.\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks, Alethia. So we've been pleased with Otezla. We continue see all of our integration activities of bringing that product and being smooth uneventful, largely now under the management of Amgen employees around the world. And the field force continues to really do an outstanding job of making sure dermatologists understand the benefits of Otezla in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. I think what we've seen in the quarter is a return to customer activity, largely about 90% of pre-COVID levels. The majority of those customer interactions are in the virtual realm, about 60% of those. I think overall, we're pleased with the growth in volume in the quarter. We did see some one-time events, accounting adjustments. We had a favorable accounting adjustment in 2019 in Q3 and an unfavorable accounting adjustment in Q3 this year, creating an unfavorable compare quarter-over-quarter from prior year. And we're also seeing a bit of softness in the dermatology prescribing volume year-on-year on the basis of COVID. But I think the differentiation of having an oral versus biologics versus topicals in psoriasis is really helping us hold up well, and we continue to feel confident about our double-digit growth going forward. We've also held price nicely as we go into 2021. That's a good effect of having a differentiated product. And then overall, I think as we look at sources of growth throughout the world, our international expansion plans have been going well. We secured reimbursement in Australia. Our Japanese business really is doing well and we're looking at reimbursement and market authorization in other markets. So overall, it's been a really good growth story for us and we continue to feel good about the future. And then we will wait patiently to see if we're able to secure a mild to moderate indication next year because I think that's a patient population that could really benefit from the convenience of an oral and the safety profile that we've established of Otezla versus say more potent orals or even biologics.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan.\nCory Kasimov: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to follow up on Otezla and ask about your baseline assumptions for TYK2 just given the proximity of that data in psoriasis? Those results are roughly are consistent with the Phase II data that's been published. How do you think about this potentially slotting into the market and the potential impact it may or may not have on the future trajectory of Otezla? And can you remind us whether the double-digit CAGR expectation you put out there for Otezla contemplates U.S. competition? Thanks a lot.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. So I'll answer your second part of your question first, Cory. The double-digit growth assumptions that we put out there did indeed assume the launch of other orals into the U.S. in a relatively similar timeframe as to what's been publicly disclosed. I think overall, as I was saying earlier, we feel really good about the position of Otezla in the market. It's a widely reimbursed product with really good market access, an affordable products from a patient perspective, a very safe product from an overall profile perspective, and I just think that new entrants into the category will not necessarily differentiate on efficacy or on safety right out of the gate. I think it's going to take some time before dermatologists who are quite frankly leery of potent biologics or other products that might have efficacy, but that might travel with some safety concerns and that's not the case with Otezla. So this familiarity with Otezla, the unique positioning of it being the first product they go to post-topical and pre-biologic, I think is going to hold up really well and we continue to invest heavily. Somebody mentioned they noticed more television advertising. We have ramped up DTC given COVID is somewhat disrupting patient behavior. And also in light of COVID, there are a lot of products in this category that require lab monitoring and Otezla doesn't. So a really good profile and I think one that will hold up well despite competition.\nArvind Sood: April is getting to the top of the hour. So let's take one more question, after which, Bob will make some closing comments.\nOperator: And your last question will come from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'll stay on Otezla. So I know that the current topicals are not ideal with the side effect profile. Wondered if you could comment on the recent data for apremilast with a PASI score that looked on par with Otezla? And my specific question is more what percentage of Otezla use is with low surface involvement patients? And do you see these new topicals that are coming out potentially disruptive on a share or price basis? Thanks.\nDavid Reese: Yes, thanks, Robyn. We really see these as unique segments of the market. The topical segment doesn't necessarily compete with the oral segment and we do see - right now, we do see some low surface area usage. But I think as we look at our mild to moderate indication in the future, I think there would be more potential overlap with say - let's say more effective topicals for low surface areas and orals, but it's really - it's not impeding our ability to grow and I don't see them as overlapping sectors. I think when patients say they want the convenience of an oral, it's a very clear choice to go to Otezla.\nArvind Sood: Bob, would you like to make any closing remarks?\nRobert Bradway: Sure, just briefly. With nine or so weeks left in the year, we're encouraged that we continue to execute well. I think you see that in the numbers and in the progress that we're making in our market shares and in our pipeline. But we know that this is a year unlike any other, so we're trying to be prudent. As we look at the balance of the year and the beginning of next year, particularly as regards to the risk posed - the risks posed by COVID-19. So appreciate you joining our call. We'll look forward to seeing you or speaking to you in the New Year. And in the meantime, Arvind and his team are here for any questions that you might have. Thank you.\nArvind Sood: Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes Amgen's third quarter 2020 financial results conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Murdo. Consistent with the first half of the year, we executed effectively during the third quarter, delivering 12% revenue and 19% non-GAAP EPS year-over-year growth. As you heard Murdo say, revenue growth was driven by volume increases of 18% consistent with our focus on volume-driven growth. Third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter, as we accelerated our investments to drive growth and advance the pipeline. Although activity levels during Q3 were still partially impacted by COVID-19, most trials continue to enroll patients. Customer-facing commercial activity levels increased and launch preparations were in process. We see activity levels increasing in the fourth quarter of the year, resulting in increased investments. We have financial flexibility with $12.4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, and continue to generate stable free cash flow with $3.2 billion in the quarter. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was $1.60 per share, an increase of 10% over last year. Our capital allocation principles and plans remain unchanged and uninterrupted. Let me now share some thoughts on our 2020 outlook going forward. We are narrowing our revenue guidance to $25.1 billion to $25.5 billion from $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion. The range reflects the uncertainty created by the recent resurgence of COVID-19 infections globally which Bob discussed in his remarks. And as you just heard Murdo say, our products, including Prolia, for the most at-risk COVID patients are most susceptible to the accelerated rate of infection. The lower end of our range takes into account a more accelerated impact from COVID globally. We are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $15.80 per share to $16.15 per share versus our prior guidance of $15.10 per share to $15.75 per share. We continue to believe that we could experience fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and earnings over the duration of the pandemic. As we shared during our Q2 call, we expect full-year total non-GAAP operating expenses to grow in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year on an absolute basis. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at about 20% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Now let me share a bit more detail on our non-GAAP expectations for the full-year 2020. Cost of sales as a percent of product sales will be generally consistent with 2019. We plan to increase R&D investments in the fourth quarter of the year, as clinical trial and laboratory activities continue to recover from COVID related slowdowns. SG&A spend is projected to increase due to investments in Otezla and other growth brands, geographic expansion and launch preparations. We anticipate other income and expense to be a net expense of about $1.3 billion, which includes more than $130 million of benefit from mark-to-market gains on our equity investment portfolio in Q3. We are updating non-GAAP tax rate guidance to 13% to 14%, versus prior guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. Our expectations for share repurchases are unchanged. At the lower end of our previously disclosed range of $3 billion to $5 billion. Finally, recall that Q4 of 2020 will be comparing against a partial quarter of Otezla sales and expenses in Q4 2019. So as we approach the end of 2020, we are pleased with our progress and execution this year, including the successful integration of Otezla, collaboration with BeiGene and transition from Astellas in Japan. As is customary, we will provide full 2021 guidance on our January call. This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it back to Bob to get going on Q&A. Terence, it's Peter. Thank you for your question. A good question. As you know, we will guide on 2021 when we get to January. But I do want to just say we always intend on continuing to be a top-performing biopharma firm looking at various financial metrics, always operating margin right there. So look, we're going to remain flexible and adaptable as attractive opportunities arise, and with the underlying objective to grow our after-tax cash flows. So that's where we sit right now on expenses. We wanted to be clear on the fourth quarter and how that's going to sequence in which is really on a normal historical basis, just at the upper end of it on an OpEx basis. So with that, I'll turn it over to the next question."

            "name": "Robert Bradway",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you for joining today's call. I'll take a few moments to discuss our performance in the third quarter and then share some thoughts on the overall operating environment in a COVID context. We delivered another strong quarter, and you can see that in our revenue growth of 12%. And in addition, once again this quarter, our revenue growth exceeded expense growth, enabling us to report earnings per share growth well ahead of revenues. Putting the results in a broader context, our double-digit increase in revenues was driven by the continued volume-driven growth of many of our innovative products, the strong uptake of our high-quality biosimilars and the relative stability of our base business, which is proving resilient in the face of increased competition. We expect these three factors to be key for our long-term success. Turning to COVID-19, clearly the pandemic remains an important factor affecting performance for Amgen and for our industry. You'll recall that Amgen grew revenues by 11% in the first quarter of the year, with the first 10 weeks of performance largely unaffected by the pandemic. In the second quarter, when conditions were at their worst, revenues grew by 6%. Our performance in the third quarter reflects an encouraging recovery from the depths of the pandemic and was largely consistent with what we anticipated for you in our remarks at the time of our second quarter call. As regards to the fourth quarter, we see the current resurgence in cases as a potential headwind for our business, and we are closely monitoring this to see what the impact may be for the rest of the year and if there might be any spillover into 2021. We don't expect anything like what we saw earlier in the year, as global healthcare systems know much more about how to treat COVID-19 and are better prepared to do so than they were earlier in the year. However, on the margin, we're not ruling out that there will be some impact and we tried to incorporate this into our planning assumptions for the fourth quarter and into the beginning of next year. Overall, I remain optimistic that innovation from the biopharma industry will break the back of this pandemic, with vaccines, antibodies and other therapeutics that are being developed with unprecedented speed and collaboration. One thing this pandemic has exposed is the importance of innovation, and that of course is at the core of our strategy and it's reflected in the first-in-class molecules that are advancing rapidly in our pipeline. We are pleased, of course, with the Phase II results of our first-in-class molecule sotorasib and we expect to see topline Phase III data for tezepelumab, a potential first-in-class treatment for severe asthma by year-end. We are also making good progress with several of our half-life extended BiTE molecules particularly in solid tumors like prostate and small-cell lung cancer. All the work that we do is taking place at a time when more is expected of companies than ever before. We understand these expectations and are committed to good corporate citizenship and sustainable operations. Before I turn things over to the rest of the team, let me thank our staff members around the world for their unwavering commitment to serving patients during this challenging time. Their resilience, creativity and ability to execute give me great confidence in our long-term future. Dave? Okay, April, why don't we open up the lines for questions and perhaps you could start us by reminding our callers of the procedures for asking a question. Hey, Terence. This is Bob, why don't I take the first part of your question. The short answer is no. The Omecamtiv results don't change our thinking on capital allocation. We continue to look for business development opportunities and continue to look for internal programs in cardiovascular disease. As you know, we're moving rapidly with our Phase II program directed against LP(a), so we're excited to have some advanced studies going for that molecule, and we'll continue to look for ways to invest in that franchise. Cardiovascular disease as you know, the leading killer of people on the planet. We continue to think what we need in that field is more innovation, not less. So we will continue looking for that. Yes, thank you. I'll jump in on that one. We've obviously been very transparent with our partners on how we can commercialize tezepelumab. I have to say with the many years of experience that AstraZeneca has in this therapeutic area, we continue to believe they're outstanding partner. We've worked through all the details of commercialization. AstraZeneca will indeed be putting up dedicated resources for the promotion of tezepelumab. So think about different sales reps literally in the market promoting the two different products. We will be handling many elements of the commercial process in the U.S., for example, we'll be lead on the market access negotiations and relationships, while AstraZeneca will lead on consumer marketing and professional marketing. So I think we've really put the best of the best together here and I continue to have a lot of confidence in the emphasis that our partner is placing on this really exciting molecule, both for the launch and also just strategic lifecycle management ideas that they have as well. Sure, just briefly. With nine or so weeks left in the year, we're encouraged that we continue to execute well. I think you see that in the numbers and in the progress that we're making in our market shares and in our pipeline. But we know that this is a year unlike any other, so we're trying to be prudent. As we look at the balance of the year and the beginning of next year, particularly as regards to the risk posed - the risks posed by COVID-19. So appreciate you joining our call. We'll look forward to seeing you or speaking to you in the New Year. And in the meantime, Arvind and his team are here for any questions that you might have. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave. We've seen volumes continue to improve from the initial stages of the pandemic, with Q3 global revenues growing 12% year-over-year driven by 18% volume growth. During Q3, physician-patient interactions increased to near pre-COVID levels. Across the industry in the U.S., total prescriptions are still down approximately 2% and physician visits, either in person or remote are down approximately 10% versus the pre-COVID baseline. While trends improved during the quarter, we are seeing infection rates rise in many parts of the world, which may bring additional quarter-to-quarter variability. Let me spend a few minutes to discuss our Q3 performance and outline our expectations for the remainder of 2020. In bone health, our efforts are focused on ensuring patient continuity. We grew Prolia volume by 10% year-over-year, even though osteoporosis diagnosis rates have returned to just 70% of pre-COVID levels in the U.S. COVID has also resulted in a change in historical quarterly trends for Prolia. Prior to the pandemic, the first and third quarters each year had lower sales than the second and fourth quarters. However, given the impact of the pandemic in the second quarter and the six-month dosing regimen of Prolia, we would expect year-over-year growth rates in the fourth quarter to be lower than pre-COVID growth trends. With the current rise in COVID infection rates in the U.S. and Europe, there could be additional delays in patients receiving their Prolia treatment in Q4. EVENITY sales in the U.S. grew quarter-over-quarter driven by 30% volume growth. This growth was offset by lower sales in Japan, which were partially related to timing of purchases by our partner Astellas. We believe EVENITY's unique bone-building abilities will continue to drive growth in our business as physicians appreciate its benefit risk profile in treating their post fracture patients. Repatha sales increased 22% year-over-year, driven by 60% volume growth and is the segment leader globally. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha, and given the significant unmet medical need in treating high risk cardiovascular patients, our comprehensive patient payor coverage, the convenient self-administration and the established outcomes data in the label. Moving on to Parsabiv, which is an attractive treatment for secondary HPT, supported by the convenience of its IV administration. In January 2021, reimbursement for Parsabiv will move into the dialysis bundle payment system. We've already begun to see some negative impact on Parsabiv utilization in the U.S., and we would expect this impact to continue in Q4. Transitioning to our Inflammation portfolio, total prescriptions for Otezla in the U.S. grew 11% year-over-year. Underlying volume trends remained strong. Sales were negatively impacted by lower inventory levels versus last year. We're confident that Otezla will continue its double-digit year-over-year volume growth based on its well-established safety and efficacy profile, convenient oral dosage, broad payor coverage and the lack of lab monitoring requirements. Enbrel remains the cornerstone of our Inflammation franchise and we continue to invest in Enbrel, along with our broader inflammation portfolio including Otezla, AMGEVITA and recently launched AVSOLA. Enbrel was impacted by slowing growth in rheumatology prescribing in Q3 related to COVID and experienced some share loss in the quarter while maintaining price stability year-on-year. Continued softness in rheumatology prescribing related to rising COVID infections could further impact Enbrel in the fourth quarter. Our Q3 biosimilar revenues were $480 million, supported by share growth by MVASI and KANJINTI. We've achieved leading biosimilar shares for AMGEVITA in Europe and for MVASI and KANJINTI in the U.S. Our highly efficient operating model and full complement of patient services provide an important advantage as we face additional biosimilar competitors heading into 2021. In Oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF with 55% share of volume in the quarter. Neulasta sales decreased 22% year-over-year, driven by declines in volume and net selling price. Competitive activity in long-acting filgrastim is impacting average selling price. The most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 19% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter. Overall, I'm very pleased with our Q3 performance. We remain vigilant as the pandemic continues to create uncertainty and potential disruptions in the healthcare marketplace. Amgen employees around the world are focused on ensuring continuity of care for our patients, and we will continue investing to drive growth of our innovative products, advance our geographic expansion and prepare for potential new product launches. And with that, I'll turn it over to Peter. Thanks. Evan. Look, we're really pleased with what we've been able to do with our Biosimilars business in the quarter. The team has done a really nice job this year despite COVID in establishing strong penetration into the U.S. oncology market with MVASI our Avastin biosimilar and KANJINTI, our Herceptin biosimilar. I would say with respect to the dynamic in the market, a lot of people question whether or not we had an efficient functioning biosimilar market in the U.S. because I think they were over interpreting some of the early biosimilar launches. And I think what you can see now is that we have an efficient market, that when there are \u2013 when there is a clear value on the table healthcare systems, providers and payers are able to capitalize on it. And that's what's driving of course the uptake of our biosimilars. I also think that the experience we've had in defending against biosimilar erosion on products like Neulasta has positioned us well to understand how accounts are looking to purchase biosimilars. So when we launched our own, we were able to take some advantage of that. And I would say that of the accounts that have opened up biosimilar usage generally initially we thought they might be using biosimilars for new patients going forward, but we've actually seen them use our biosimilars both for new patients and switching patients who are mid-course of treatment to biosimilars as well. So I'd say that the penetration at an account level has been deeper than we originally anticipated. And I think by now there is fairly broad adoption in the U.S. at the 340B level, the non-340B level and of course within the clinics. Now that's oncology. It's a little different in inflammation depending on the biosimilar itself whether it's a \u2013 an infused biosimilar or whether it's a self-injected or self-administered biosimilar. And I think need to watch that carefully because the two are not analogous. So I would treat each business segment as its own example and not draw comparisons from one to the other. Okay, thank you. Overall, I think the biosimilars business, as I said, has evolved really nicely and we've penetrated quite well. If I look at the oncology products in the U.S. running at 44% share currently on our Avastin biosimilar. I do think, as you see additional competitors come in, the average selling price will come down. So that's a reality that competition brings and it's related to my comment earlier about this being an efficient marketplace. I do think there is an appreciation though for what we've done at Amgen which is to have a very effective provider-focused commercial presence the same people that are talking to accounts about our innovative portfolio are talking to those same customers about our biosimilars. So all of our services that we normally have on an innovative product are available on biosimilars, and that includes patient services for things like reimbursement or co-pay assistance and I think that differentiates us. So I would anticipate us being able to continue to capture good volume albeit at some price erosion as we go into the new year. But as I said, we're at 44% share of the total bevacizumab market and slightly less than that of the trastuzumab market. So there's still a lot of headroom for growth. And I think on the inflammation side, the dynamics are a little bit different depending on whether it's a product like our Remicade biosimilar, Avsola or whether we're looking at a product like our Rituxan biosimilar. So I think we have to watch how we draw parallels on expectations. Overall, we made a big commitment to biosimilars. So we'll continue to advance new products through the clinic and into the market and we compete effectively across Europe and we're competing nicely so far in the U.S. Just transitioning to Repatha. Look we've done I think an excellent job of converting to an affordable price of Repatha. We've got about 80% access coverage across Medicaid and commercial and we're seeing really nice volume growth with 60% in the quarter, and I think we're also seeing some nice evolution outside of the U.S. where Repatha continues to gain share. The product \u2013 really with Repatha, we are scratching the surface of those that need this. There is a lot of high-risk coronary event patients who require more aggressive lipid lowering therapy. And in light of COVID, I actually think that Repatha is a unique solution. It's a self-administered product with excellent coverage and well demonstrated efficacy and safety profile and we have event reduction data in the label. So I think compared to a product that might require patients to travel to a physician office for administration in light of COVID, that's going to be a tougher task for another product to come in. So I feel good about where we are and I feel good about our growth prospects going forward. Yes. As I mentioned before, there is a strategic commitment here from our partners to Teze. They've been very supportive constructive and helpful as we've worked through the development plan and now we look beyond that to the commercialization and potential lifecycle management ideas and I think that there is a strong press from AstraZeneca to continue to really think about all of the patients that we can benefit with development of Teze. I would just say that there is a large market opportunity here in severe asthma. Having alternative mechanisms in the market is a good thing and I think that there's plenty of room for us to launch effectively there and I'm pretty sure that's how of our partners at AstraZeneca see it. Yes. Thanks Geoff. Let's narrow or reframe the question. I don't think it's a payer issue. I think we've negotiated very good access for Aimovig. It's covered broadly with very little in the way of utilization management criteria. Physician requests are being filled very well. Our percentage of paid patients is very high now. We're in the high 80% range for patients. So it's not an access restriction that's reducing the uptick of the class. There are really two things. One, is obvious, it's COVID. We are down substantially in new patients per week because of COVID and a lot of migraine sufferers unfortunately are just not seeking care. And neurology as a prescribing specialty is down more than some others like cardiology recovered nicely in the quarter. Neurology is still down in terms of total prescribing. And that's the COVID impact. And then there's another I think opportunity which we're focused on and that is to have both neurologists and patients moving quicker through older, less-effective preventative agents and to try biologic CGRPs like Aimovig, and that's really where our focus is for growth. We've seen movement there and it was going well, but we've still got a lot of work to do, as you point out. But we've got a large volume of patients, over $4 million. I think we're 15% penetrated into that patient population. So there is really no doubt in my mind that it will move. I also think, by the way the oral CGRPs are helping here with the promotional effort, communication of patients, awareness building of the benefits to the category. So they're acute promotion is also helping in the preventive space. But yes, we are focused on that. I think we've done all the right things on the communications front to payers. Now we are focused on patients and patient \u2013 providers and patients. Yes. So I'll answer your second part of your question first, Cory. The double-digit growth assumptions that we put out there did indeed assume the launch of other orals into the U.S. in a relatively similar timeframe as to what's been publicly disclosed. I think overall, as I was saying earlier, we feel really good about the position of Otezla in the market. It's a widely reimbursed product with really good market access, an affordable products from a patient perspective, a very safe product from an overall profile perspective, and I just think that new entrants into the category will not necessarily differentiate on efficacy or on safety right out of the gate. I think it's going to take some time before dermatologists who are quite frankly leery of potent biologics or other products that might have efficacy, but that might travel with some safety concerns and that's not the case with Otezla. So this familiarity with Otezla, the unique positioning of it being the first product they go to post-topical and pre-biologic, I think is going to hold up really well and we continue to invest heavily. Somebody mentioned they noticed more television advertising. We have ramped up DTC given COVID is somewhat disrupting patient behavior. And also in light of COVID, there are a lot of products in this category that require lab monitoring and Otezla doesn't. So a really good profile and I think one that will hold up well despite competition."

            "name": "David Reese",
            "content": "Thanks Bob. I'll begin with sotorasib, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor. Based on the data we have accumulated and the evolution of the field, we are extremely optimistic about the potential of sotorasib and will continue to aggressively advance the development program. Earlier this month, we reported positive topline results from our Phase II monotherapy study in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, demonstrating an objective response rate consistent with our Phase I data at 960 milligrams and promising results on other measures of efficacy, including duration of response, with more than half of the responders still on treatment at the data cutoff. Safety and tolerability were similar to previously reported data for this population and have been remarkably consistent across the 160 patients treated with our Phase II dose. Our Phase I and Phase II data are based on protocol specified intent to treat criteria as is our practice and the scans to assess efficacy parameters in Phase II have been evaluated by independent central review. We look forward to presenting the Phase II results at the World Congress on Lung Cancer taking place in January. We also reviewed with interest a data presentation made a few days ago. Based on our assessment of available efficacy and safety data, including durability measures, we remain extremely confident in our molecule. To date, we have treated over 550 patients with sotorasib and we are looking forward to discussions with the FDA and other regulatory agencies to determine the best path forward as monotherapy in patients with advanced lung cancer. We couldn't be more enthusiastic about our position as we move towards establishing sotorasib as a KRAS G12C foundational therapy. We also remain optimistic about our BiTE platform. We now have evidence of clinical activity in solid tumors, including recently presented prostate cancer data from AMG 160 which targets prostate specific membrane antigen. The benefit risk profile AMG 160 has continued to improve with additional dose optimization. AMG 757 is our half-life extended BiTE targeting DLL3, which is a very attractive target due to its differential expression in small-cell lung cancers, and we look forward to presenting initial data at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting next month. Small-cell lung cancer is a large unmet medical need globally and yet treatment options have not advanced significantly in decades. We will also investigate AMG 757 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. We expect to present data from AMG 701 targeting BCMA for multiple myeloma later in the year as well. And before leaving the BiTE platform, I wanted to mention a Phase II publication in the New England Journal of Medicine that reported deep responses and a tolerable safety profile for dasatinib induction followed by BLINCYTO consolidation in adults with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL. 60% of patients achieved a molecular response and disease free survival was 88% at 18 months, highlighting the potential of a chemotherapy free regimen. If these results are confirmed in larger trials, this could lead to a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of this disease. In cardiovascular disease, we recently released the topline results from our omecamtiv mecarbil Phase III outcome study and the results will be presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in November. In inflammation, along with AstraZeneca, we look forward to the topline results of the pivotal Tezepelumab Phase III study, Navigator, in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, which remains on track. We also expect the results from the oral corticosteroid sparing Phase III study source by the end of the year, which should complement the pivotal data. I'm happy to announce that we will be advancing our third inflammation program into Phase II development next year with AMG 592, now named Efavaleukin alfa or IL-2 mutein for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. The trial was selected for inclusion in the FDA's complex innovative trial designs pilot program, which supports the development and regulatory review of novel clinical trial designs for new therapies. In closing, I would like to thank all of the Amgen teams for executing at such a high level during the ongoing pandemic. Murdo? Thanks, Mike. Yes, and of course, we are greatly looking forward to that readout as well. What I can say is that the trial is very well powered to look at outcomes on the primary endpoint here as annualized exacerbation rates, the standard endpoint for asthma studies across the different subgroups, including the low eosinophil population. So we feel very comfortable that this will be a definitive test of tezepelumab across the entire range of patients with severe asthma. Yes. Thanks, Matt. That's certainly the combination studies are an important topic, they're moving forward quite briskly. We have I think seven cohorts open now, three or four more are coming very soon. So we feel we are testing in a range of indications. The biologically plausible and clinically relevant combinations will have data next year on a number of these. And to your point, the goal always in combination therapy beyond monotherapy is to enhance efficacy and potentially in terms of response rates, but also durability if you are cutting off avenues of tumor resistance or escape, and that's certainly our goal. We're very much guided by the biology here, and as you look at those cohorts that are coming up I think you'll see that that's the case. Yes, sure. So let me take those in order. In terms of the combinations, one thing I would caution everyone is let's not over read anything into cohorts of three or four patients, whether that's our trials or anyone else's trials. We're moving forward. We've been \u2013 what we have is a foundation of tolerability in monotherapy, which is the critical thing to build on in combinations. And I think this was put into some perspective by an editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine that accompanied the publication of our Phase 1 trial a few weeks ago and I'd refer you to that. And certainly it's very common in combination therapy development in oncology to look at all sorts of dosing and scheduling regimens, and we fully intend to do that and on priority we would intend on doing that. With regards to the analysis in tezepelumab, yes, that's correct. The analysis is powered and geared across the entire population then with also look at the low eosinophil population. So your suppositions there are correct. Yes. Well, I can't speak to directly to others data and of course, I'll allow them to do that. I will say that we've, as I mentioned, treated over 550 patients. There is no evidence whatsoever of a QT signal to date and we remain quite pleased with the overall tolerability of sotorasib. Yes. Thanks, Chris. Both important questions. It's standard in any new molecule as part of the clinical pharmacology program to examine different schedules. So we continue to do that with twice daily dosing. But one thing I'd urge everyone to do is kind of go back to basic pharmacokinetics here as we think about this field and what are the reasons to go to split dosing. Well there are really two reasons. One, if you need split dosing in order to achieve target coverage or two, if you need to split the dose because of tolerability issues. And with sotorasib, we're very convinced that we are getting target coverage throughout the dosing interval with our once-daily dosing, and of course we've got very nice tolerability at once daily dosing. And so that's really \u2013 this is I think basic pharmacology and pharmacokinetics and the science underlying that that has driven our clinical choices. In terms of CNS penetration, we did mention at ESMO we have a couple of patients with \u2013 one or two patients with CNS metastases who clearly had responses. So the question with small molecules or in CNS responses in general is always is that due to true penetration or because there is typically a highly disrupted blood brain barrier in that setting you almost always get some exposure to drug. The third potential explanation, which we continue to explore is that it's a secondary immune activation that could potentially trigger activity in the central nervous system. We are exploring this question explicitly in a cohort that we're just opening for patients with brain metastases. And so I think in through next year, we'll have a good sense of potential activity in the central nervous system. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Colin. Great question. And of course as is typical in oncology development programs, you start in later lines of therapy where patients don't have much in the way of treatment options, but certainly moving into earlier lines of therapy will be part of the development program as we move forward. I would also point out that an important part of the program in later lines is the head-to-head Phase III trial against docetaxel chemotherapy. That is very important outside of the U.S. in some jurisdictions for regulatory approval, but also in many jurisdictions for our reimbursement. And so I wouldn't also overlook the potential of that. This is a global development program and that's another important piece. Thank you. Yes. Well, let me start and then I'll hand things off to Murdo. As we discussed, the primary endpoint is powered across the entire population and also the analysis plan allows a look in the low eosinophil group. In our Phase II data, which is currently our best predictor, we showed relatively comparable efficacy regardless of eosinophil status and it certainly would be our hope that we're able to replicate that in Phase III. In terms of commercialization, let me ask Murdo to weigh in. Thanks, Kennen. I'll take that. With Omecamtiv we issued the topline results. We've got data coming out with the American Heart Association in just a couple weeks, and I think in the wake of that we will be discussing next steps. Yes. Thanks, Umer. So in terms of duration of response in and moving in earlier lines of therapy, it's very clear what the checkpoint inhibitors do. I mean typically you're going to look for 25%, 30% improvements on these sorts of efficacy measures to get into the clinically meaningful range. So as we're designing programs, those are the sorts of targets that we would generally look at. In colorectal cancer, as I've mentioned before, we fully enrolled the Phase II trial data. Next year that will inform a potential monotherapy path forward. I would want to see response rates perhaps a little better than we've observed now for monotherapy, but that'll be a discussion with folks in the field. And here, I would say there is also just a huge amount of emphasis on combination therapy to both enhance the response rate and then of course to generate duration of response. As I mentioned earlier, we've got a number of combination trials, either up and running or about to launch and some of them are directed specifically for colorectal cancer. So we're really looking forward to generating those data. But I think that's the kind of state of play right now. Yes. Thanks, Alethia. So we've been pleased with Otezla. We continue see all of our integration activities of bringing that product and being smooth uneventful, largely now under the management of Amgen employees around the world. And the field force continues to really do an outstanding job of making sure dermatologists understand the benefits of Otezla in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. I think what we've seen in the quarter is a return to customer activity, largely about 90% of pre-COVID levels. The majority of those customer interactions are in the virtual realm, about 60% of those. I think overall, we're pleased with the growth in volume in the quarter. We did see some one-time events, accounting adjustments. We had a favorable accounting adjustment in 2019 in Q3 and an unfavorable accounting adjustment in Q3 this year, creating an unfavorable compare quarter-over-quarter from prior year. And we're also seeing a bit of softness in the dermatology prescribing volume year-on-year on the basis of COVID. But I think the differentiation of having an oral versus biologics versus topicals in psoriasis is really helping us hold up well, and we continue to feel confident about our double-digit growth going forward. We've also held price nicely as we go into 2021. That's a good effect of having a differentiated product. And then overall, I think as we look at sources of growth throughout the world, our international expansion plans have been going well. We secured reimbursement in Australia. Our Japanese business really is doing well and we're looking at reimbursement and market authorization in other markets. So overall, it's been a really good growth story for us and we continue to feel good about the future. And then we will wait patiently to see if we're able to secure a mild to moderate indication next year because I think that's a patient population that could really benefit from the convenience of an oral and the safety profile that we've established of Otezla versus say more potent orals or even biologics. Yes, thanks, Robyn. We really see these as unique segments of the market. The topical segment doesn't necessarily compete with the oral segment and we do see - right now, we do see some low surface area usage. But I think as we look at our mild to moderate indication in the future, I think there would be more potential overlap with say - let's say more effective topicals for low surface areas and orals, but it's really - it's not impeding our ability to grow and I don't see them as overlapping sectors. I think when patients say they want the convenience of an oral, it's a very clear choice to go to Otezla."

Thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2020 conference call. I will report to you today on what I believe is the impressive progress in executing on the 2020 goals that we laid out for you at the start of the year. But who could have guessed them just how far and fast this pandemic would spread, or how long it might last. Our hearts go out to all of those affected, to their friends and families and to all the healthcare workers who are fighting COVID-19. The COVID crisis has affected us all. Here at ChemoCentryx, we were already at or near full enrollment in our current cycle of clinical trials when the full force of the pandemic struck, and we expect to initiate our next cycle of clinical trials next year. We have, therefore, been able to meet most of the milestones that we set out for ourselves this year, with relatively little impact, while taking actions to safeguard the health of our employees. We are continuing to make key hires and build out a team ahead of the anticipated commercial launch of avacopan in 2021. The coronavirus has led to heightened awareness of the importance of the body\u2019s own defense mechanisms and to the crucial role that the immune system plays. And as you can see from Slide 3, our discovery and development efforts focus on small molecule therapeutics that targets specific chemoattractant receptors. These are the receptors that activate inflammatory cells in autoimmune diseases. We started in renal disease, but have leveraged our science into dermatology as well and have now even branched out into a new era in oncology. At the core of it all is the belief that a precise mechanism of action helps to achieve precision medicine. Our drug candidates are designed for antiinflammatory properties without broad immunosuppression, so that the immune system can remain fully focused on its mission to resist illness and disease. This is an important differentiating feature from other currently standard therapies for the diseases in which we at ChemoCentryx are developing new medicines. Our lead candidate, avacopan, selectively targets the C5a receptor, switching off the inappropriate activation of harmful neutrophils in complement-driven diseases. In early July, as shown on Slide 4, we submitted our new drug application to the FDA for avacopan in the treatment of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. We expect to hear back from the FDA later this quarter with regard to next steps in the FDA-review process. We are working also intensively with our partner, Vifor Pharma, as we and they gear up for the potential commercialization of avacopan outside of the U.S. Vifor will pay us royalties in the teens to the mid-20s on net sales outside the United States. Vifor plans to file a marketing approval authorization with the European Medicines Agency by the end of this year 2020. And we are working closely with them as they prepare their MAA using our core technical document from the FDA preparations as the key source. Our applications to regulatory agencies and our preparations for the anticipated commercialization of avacopan are built upon the key findings in the ADVOCATE pivotal trial. As a reminder, ADVOCATE compared our new targeted therapy of avacopan, against what has been the current standard of care, which contains high and chronic doses of glucocorticoids such as prednisone. We looked at clinical effects in the avacopan therapy group in comparison to the prednisone or steroid therapy group rather in a randomized, blinded, controlled worldwide Phase III trial of ANCA vasculitis patients. We believe the ADVOCATE findings demonstrate a compelling value proposition in terms of avacopan\u2019s potential to meet the four major unmet needs of ANCA vasculitis patients. First stopping ANCA vasculitis. Avacopan therapy was statistically superior in sustaining remission of ANCA vasculitis at 52 weeks compared to the prednisone containing standard of care group. Second, eliminating the need for chronic steroid therapy and the many illnesses associated with that current chronic steroid containing standard of care. In the ADVOCATE trial, avacopan patients achieved a significant reduction in the toxicities and illnesses known to be related to steroids. Third, stopping the accumulated organ damage that comes with this deadly and debilitating disease. Avacopan therapy led to improved kidney function and its use produced a statistically significant improvement in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, a key metric of kidney function. Fourth, an improvement in quality of life. Too many ANCA patients experienced poor quality of life, feeling listless, ill, and lacking in anything like normal vitality. From ADVOCATE, there was good news here, too, a statistically significant improvement in clinically validated measurements of quality of life on avacopan therapy. And overall, avacopan also demonstrated a favorable safety result in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having fewer numbers of serious adverse events in the avacopan group than in the steroid standard of care group. Results of the ADVOCATE trial were featured in oral plenary sessions during the annual meetings of both the EULAR, or European League Against Rheumatism; and ERA-EDTA, the European Renal Association - European Dialysis and Transplant Association meetings. At ERA-EDTA, for example, Dr. David Jayne from Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge, England, presented some remarkable data on EGFR improvements from the ADVOCATE trial. Slide 5 shows that 80% of ADVOCATE patients who entered the trial had defined renal impairment. In this group, their baseline EGFR, which was well balanced between the two groups, was on average about 45 ml per min. Avacopan therapy improved that EGFR by nearly 8 ml per min over 52 weeks of therapy, which was significantly better than the prednisone containing active comparative group. In fact, the graph on the right depicts the finding that some nephrologists have described to me as remarkable. In the lowest tertile of these patients, those with EGFR less than 30 ml per min baseline and, in fact, these individuals, their baseline EGFR was about 21 ml per min. Avacopan, by the way, this baseline of this tertile is only about 5 or 6 ml per min away from being a dialysis candidate. In this group, avacopan therapy boosted their EGFR by almost 14 ml per min over the 52 weeks. This result shows that we have not only met our goal of stabilizing or preserving what kidney function remains in this disease state, and in so doing, potentially sparing patients from dialysis. But, in fact, the data suggests that avacopan may actually improve renal function over time in a very significant way. We believe that avacopan therapy offers new hope for patients suffering from ANCA vasculitis, and importantly, could rid them of the toxic consequences of the use of a steroid \u2013 of a therapy developed more than a half a century ago, steroids. There were some other subtle, but notable findings from the ADVOCATE study. One of these, for example, is that patients on avacopan therapy performed very well in the second six months of the trial. During this period, avacopan was essentially a monotherapy since the standard concomitant background therapies, such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab have ceased. The data suggests that avacopan alone may suffice in controlling ANCA vasculitis over time, perhaps without the need for repeated administrations of background immunosuppressive drugs such as rituximab. While more clinical data may be needed to draw firmer conclusions, given the importance of preserving the immune function as we anticipate vaccines in the era of COVID-19, this could be a crucial benefit. We are continuing to move forward with our plans for potential commercial launch, as you will see on Slide 6. Our aim is be \u2013 is to be ready to launch soon after FDA approval. We have secured commercial batches of avacopan that we need for launch. We continue to hire well-qualified candidates for key positions, expanding the capabilities of our commercial operation. And we broadened and deepened our knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the U.S. ANCA vasculitis market through intensive market research. We\u2019re also taking appropriate educational opportunities to present data on the disease and on the findings from the ADVOCATE study to clinicians in both nephrology, rheumatology and other relevant disciplines. And we\u2019ve initiated discussions with key payers to raise their awareness of the current unmet needs and burdens of ANCA vasculitis. We plan to field a specialty force of approximately 60 to 75 people to launch avacopan in the U.S. ANCA vasculitis is a disease that is estimated in the published literature to ravage anywhere between 40,000 and 100,000 people in the U.S., an estimated 4,000 to 9,000 cases alone, new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States. Given the strong value proposition suggested by the ADVOCATE data, we believe that avacopan\u2019s utility could extend beyond ANCA vasculitis, making avacopan a pipeline in a drug and with strong patent protection.Given the strong kidney benefit finding in ADVOCATE, we continue to refine our pipeline and expect to introduce avacopan into \u2013 for lupus nephritis into clinical development in the first-half of 2021. And as you can see from Slide 7, we expect to report top line data and two more indications this year. Indeed, avacopan\u2019s ability to stifle the activation of destructive neutrophils by jamming the C5a receptor represents a precision approach that is relevant not only in kidney diseases, but potentially outside the renal space as well. In fact, the first top line data that we will report this year is in Hidradenitis Suppurativa, the disabling skin disorder. HS is driven by neutrophils that are thought to be activated by the C5a receptor. Endovasculitis complement dysregulation is almost universal in HS patients. Our AURORA study, depicted on Slide 8, is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase IIb or clinical trial of approximately 390 patients with moderate to severe HS, with patients randomized to one of three arms. The primary endpoint is the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response Score, or HiSCR, after 12 weeks of treatment. We designed the trial to be powered to a registration grade level and decided to slightly over enroll in order to provide some cushion for anticipated COVID-related loss patient follow-up. As I mentioned earlier, the COVID crisis has affected us all. We at CCXI are no exception, but the impacts have been less grievous for us than for others. Still while the majority of our subjects had already enrolled in the AURORA trial before the full impact of the pandemic, the summer resurgence of COVID-19 has led to the renewed, if temporary restrictions of some of the clinical sites. It is, therefore, likely that this will impact somewhat the normal processes of data collection and verification that then lead to database locking and subsequent data analysis. These processes, which are routine to any clinical study, are likely to going to be modestly delayed in AURORA owing to COVID. Thus, we predict that the reporting of the 12-week top line results originally forecast for Q3 is now expected early in Q4. To be clear, no unblinded data are yet in hand. No unblinding or any other unblinded analyses have yet occurred in this trial, w are merely predicting a modest delay in reporting as a consequence of COVID delays. I\u2019m often asked how we are dealing with the placebo issue in HS. The primary endpoint assessment known as HiSCR has an unavoidable element of subjectivity. But it is the standard that the FDA expects sponsors to use in determining clinical effects in HS and ultimately, the standard by which they will assess for an approval of a new therapeutic agent. We have been very careful to attempt to minimize subjectivity in HiSCR. For example, we have carefully selected sites, which are all in the U.S., allowing a high touch approach and also in a healthcare system, which tends to keep placebo responses in check. We have engaged a training program of intensive training, standardization and monitoring. For example, first to training. Suffice it to say, we train, train, train and principal investigators had to pass a certification test on HiSCR to qualify to enroll patients. Standardization, we developed and mandated the use of standardized records and continuous worksheets across the clinical sites. And finally, monitoring. During the blinded data collection phase, our resident medical monitor scans nearly daily for anomalies in the data collection and is in frequent contact with the investigator also \u2013 who is also still blinded, and they joined the result any recording anomalies using our standard protocol. In all of these ways and more, we are scrupulously attempting to control what we can control to reduce variability and placebo response in the HiSCR assessment. Our other current avacopan trial is in another kidney indication, C3 glomerulopathy. C3G is a rare and devastating kidney disease. There is no FDA-approved therapy for C3G. ACCOLADE is a randomized, blinded controlled trial, the design of which is shown on Slide 9. The trial is unique in many ways, including that we will collect and carefully measure kidney biopsy data as a measure of efficacy, and this will be coupled with other traditional markers of kidney function. Many experts suggest that we are already in possession of the largest and most comprehensive data set, albeit still blinded, for C3G yet assembled for this life-threatening illness. We aim to announce top line data for the ACCOLADE trial by the end of this year. Innovation in life sciences does not come up without its setbacks, and our risk came with the disappointing top line results from our LUMINA-1 trial of CCX140 in focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. We don\u2019t see a way forward for CCX140 in FSGS. In the interest of biomedical innovation and completion, we will report more detailed LUMINA-1, as well as the smaller LUMINA-2 data sets in due course. On a brighter note, see Slide 10. And also in the second quarter, we announced that we have identified an orally administered checkpoint inhibitor, CCX559, formerly referred to as CCX6559, which we plan to advance in the clinical development in the first-half of this coming year in 2021. Data presented in June at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research showed that our optimized checkpoint inhibitors lead to a marked inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in vitro, and importantly, produced a potent anti-tumor effects in vitro in pharmacological models. We believe that CCX559 has the potential to be used alone or in combination with antibody therapy, or other oncology therapies. Our small molecule checkpoint inhibitor is designed to address at least two limitations of current antibody checkpoint inhibitor therapy: one, a small molecule may achieve better penetration of the tumor microenvironment, where some tumors are currently resistant to antibody therapy; two, a small molecule brings the convenience of a flexible dosing capability. Before I turn the call over to Susan Kanaya for our financial results, let me add that during the quarter, we have further strengthened our balance sheet with a follow-on offering that yielded net proceeds of almost $326 million. We report today over $0.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as of the end of the second quarter. This financial strength supplies many important degrees of freedom in pursuing our ultimate mission. We believe that we have the resources we need for the potential commercial launch of avacopan and ANCA vasculitis and beyond. We can pursue the simultaneous further development of avacopan and other high-need, high-value clinical indications, as well as additional formulations. And we can follow the science and invest in other novel and highly innovative drug candidates, such as our orally-administered checkpoint inhibitor, CCX559. My warmest thanks to all my colleagues at ChemoCentryx, especially in these difficult times, for their tireless work and advancing us to this stage and to the many clinicians involved in our clinical trials. And I think, especially the patients and their families, who have devoted so much to our controlled-blinded trials, not knowing if an active agent was part of their personal plan, but doing so for the benefit of the community as a whole. Susan?\nSusan Kanaya: Thank you, Tom. Our second quarter 2020 financial results were included in our press release today and are summarized on Slide 11. Revenue was $49.4 million for the second quarter, compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to the acceleration of revenue recognition associated with CCX140 agreement with Vifor. Following the decision to discontinue development of CCX140 in FSGS, $47.2 million of deferred revenue was recognized as contract revenue. Research and development expenses were $18.8 million for the second quarter of 2020, compared to $17.6 million in the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to patient enrollment in the avacopan AURORA trial in patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa, professional fees associated with the preparation of our avacopan NDA for ANCA-associated vasculitis and higher drug development or drug discovery expenses, including those associated with CCX55, our orally-administered small molecule PD-L1 inhibitor. These increase were partially offset by lower expenses due to the full enrollment of CCX140 LUMINA-1 trial in 2019. General and administrative expenses were $10.3 million for the second quarter, compared to $5.6 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including those associated with our commercialization planning efforts and higher professional fees. Net income for the second quarter was $20.3 million, compared to net loss of $15.2 million in the same quarter of 2019. Total shares outstanding at June 30, 2020 were approximately 68.8 million shares. Lastly, we closed the quarter with $504.6 million and reported cash, cash equivalents and investments, including the $325.7 million in net proceeds from the June 2020 equity follow-on offering of our common stock. Tom?\nThomas Schall: Thank you, Susan. To summarize, as you can see on Slide 12, we have filed an NDA for avacopan and ANCA vasculitis and our partner, Vifor, expects to file an MAA in Europe by the end of 2020. We continue to build our commercial capability. We are on track to release top line results from two further clinical trials of avacopan in patients with HS by early Q4 and with C3G by the end of the year. We are preparing for our next cycle of pipeline advancements, and we anticipate initiating clinic programs in the first-half of 2021 for our orally-administered checkpoint inhibitor, CCX559, as well as for avacopan in patients with lupus nephritis. We have attracted the financial resources that we need, with now over a $0.5 billion on the balance sheet at the end of Q2, to drive us to the next phase of our growth as we seek to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical enterprise that brings fundamentally new medicines to patients that need them most. This ChemoCentryx enterprise is built on biomedical innovation, on determination, on integrity, and on purposeful resilience. With science and data illuminating the path ahead, I look forward into a future based with the bright light of hope and prosperity. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator, and we look forward to your questions. Operator?\nQ - Steven Seedhouse: Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. My question is on the analysis of AURORA, given the different moving parts you highlighted on the call. So I was hoping if you could quantify the net impact of COVID, any discontinuations or patients missing their final visit versus over enrolling the study and where it leads you really with respect to study power? And also wondering, is the primary analysis here in ITT analysis or a protocol analysis on those patients that haven\u2019t deviated from protocol? And then last, how are you treating the patients who may have missed their final study visit because of COVID impact? Are those responses imputed from prior measurements like LCOF, or are they just sensored? Thank you.\nThomas Schall: Yes, great. Great question, Steve. So it is \u2013 all of our analyses are intended as ITT, because as I said, we made this trial kind of a registration grade trial, since it\u2019s \u2013 but even though it\u2019s a \u201cPhase II or Phase IIb trial.\u201d So our intention will be to report the stats as intent to treat. We will obviously do and have in our stats plan pre-specified various kinds of protocol analyses. So those data will be informative and meaningful as well. Currently, we\u2019ve been \u2013 and obviously, we and others have been really careful in documenting the effects of COVID on patients, particularly for primary endpoint determination, working very carefully with FDA and documenting in real-time, what we\u2019re doing with those folks. At the moment, we do not intend the last observation carry-forward necessarily for those that missed their 12-week visit owing to COVID. But they certainly will capture all the data we can from those folks, particularly if they\u2019re still on the trial and are measured thereafter. So those might be eliminating data as well. But I think the good news is that the first part of your question, which is the \u2013 I think, probably the most important part. Although, yes, it is clear that, that dropouts and some loss data owing to COVID is going to be higher than what we and others might have modeled. The fortunate news is I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to \u2013 it\u2019s not going to materially impair our ability to still have very good power in this trial. So that\u2019s, I think, for us, the excellent news. We really made a big trial with big groups. It was very highly power to detect the differences that historically, we might be led to expect and certainly highly powdered to detect statistical differences between the groups. So even a doubling, if you will, and I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the number, but even if we had twice the number of dropouts or lost data at 12 weeks, I think, we\u2019ve still got really good power discrimination. So I fundamentally believe that we\u2019ll be able to return a meaningful and clean result from the 12-week data, even with the fact that COVID has messed with some of that data a little bit. And really, the biggest impact for us is a slight delay as we get into the sites and do our data verification and collection process.\nSteven Seedhouse: I appreciate the detailed answer. Thank you.\nThomas Schall: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Dae Gon Ha with BTIG. Your line is now open.\nDae Gon Ha: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking our questions, and congrats on all the progress. So, Tom, if we can go to AURORA protocol, I just wanted to ask, can you remind us what the protocol allows in terms of antibiotic usage? Because I mean, I guess, PIONEER 1 and 2, they did have a little bit of that antibiotic usage versus non-antibiotic usage. And as we look forward in terms of the regulatory front, can you update us on your latest thought process with regards to maybe orphan drug designation or conditional filing/AA or accelerated approval based on AURORA date alone?\nThomas Schall: Sure. Thank you, Dae Gon. Without going into all the details on the antibiotic use, I can tell you that we\u2019re much closer to the PIONEER studies than we were to any other studies. We realized that concomitant antibiotic use can be a confounding feature in the short-term in ascribing effects to the HiSCR. And so we were pretty careful about looking back at what had happened in PIONEER 1 and 2 and trying to adhere to those guidelines. And also making sure that to the extent possible, we didn\u2019t have imbalances in antibiotic uses between the group. So, again, I think, we\u2019ve been very cognizant of that as a complicating feature and trying to avoid it as a complicating factor in our interpretation. Back to the regulatory strategy, so it\u2019s \u2013 the history is clear on what\u2019s gone before. We\u2019re evaluating the Hurley stage II/III patient population, as did the PIONEER studies, which were the studies as people may know, are the only Phase III pivotal trials that led to so far the single loan registration of a drug in this space, that for adalimumab, the anti-TNF drug Humira. Hence, we want to try to avail ourselves as much as we can from information from that President. So interestingly, that sponsor got an orphan drug designation for Hurley stage II/III, because that patient population is under 200,000 people in the U.S., and that is still the case. So we have \u2013 we\u2019ve been attempting and continue to work on our orphan drug designation. We don\u2019t yet have that designation yet to ChemoCentryx. But there is precedent, and we\u2019ve been certainly working on that continuously. So we yet to know if we get that orphan drug designation. But again, there is precedent for it. We fundamentally believe that Hurley stage II/III patients are still fewer than 200,000 in the United States at this juncture. So with all of that in mind, getting back to the \u2013 one of the main points of the question, we set up this trial to be big enough and highly powered enough, where we got really good data with a highly differentiated agent, particularly one which at that time was not yet in registration for another indication But we had confidence that it would be. And that\u2019s what that has come to past that we are filed \u2013 we are actually \u2013 have a filing under review for registration of avacopan and ANCA vasculitis. We were \u2013 we have been hopeful that with strong data, we could have an interesting discussion with the FDA about potentially a conditional registration or at least how to get to an accelerated path to registration, again, with strong data. So, again, without going into a lot of details, and certainly, I do not at all speak for the agency and the agency will just have to see what data we have as we will, and then we will discuss from there. I think it\u2019s really great news, though, that there\u2019s a huge \u2013 it seems to me a huge demand, not just for new therapy in HS, but new orally active therapy. And so, again, even COVID notwithstanding, but certainly prior to COVID, we really enrolled to this study very rapidly. And I think that again speaks to the eagerness of folks in this community to have a new therapy options. So we\u2019ll see how strong the data is. We\u2019ll have discussions with the agency. And in the light of \u2013 if data are positive, we will do everything that we possibly can to bring the drug to registration in this indication as quickly as possible.\nDae Gon Ha: Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Look forward to the data.\nThomas Schall: Thank you, Dae Gon.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michelle Gilson with Canaccord. Your line is now open.\nMichelle Gilson: Hi, Tom. Hi, Susan. Congratulations on the progress this quarter. I was hoping you could expand a little bit on what might be considered a clinically significant result in HS, or perhaps what is a strong enough result that would give you confidence to move the program forward either to registration or to registration-enabling studies? And then could you also help us understand what you might report in the fourth quarter as far as data goes? Maybe what per protocol analyses you might present? And if you specifically will be breaking out Humira failures, and maybe remind us of the powering of the study, if you don\u2019t mind as well?\nThomas Schall: Sure. So it\u2019s \u2013 all of those are really excellent questions, Michelle, thank you for them. We have so little precedent in the world of Hidradenitis Suppurativa in controlled trials that are informative. To really help us guide some of those answers, I\u2019ll take some guesses. And certainly, we have, again, for lack of a better term, an endpoint, which is a strong tool, but not a very sharp tool. It\u2019s not a precise tool. And the element of variability and subjectivity, again, makes it a little bit difficult to always try to compare apples-to-apples, particularly when there has only been one or two apples in the bin before. So let me say this that as a general rule, anything that gets me to a clear answer about a next step, to me is a success. So, if we see clear separation between the groups, and if some of the secondaries look also supportive, and we say to ourselves, \u201cWell, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re having a clinical effect and need a clinical benefit.\u201d That\u2019s a good answer. Hopefully, we won\u2019t get the other kind of clear answer, which is there\u2019s nothing here, but we\u2019ve done our best. But again, even a good clean answer on that side of the equation just allows us to focus on other areas that we can put our time, effort and treasure. So getting back to, we always like \u2013 people always like to say, \u201cWell, what would an interesting difference be?\u201d For me, any statistical separation, that\u2019s significant? I will say, let\u2019s look very carefully at that. And with this kind of instrument careful as we already use it as carefully as we can, that probably is meaningful. So we would, at minimum, like to see a statistical separation, obviously, with the HiSCR. And the only precedent we have about what\u2019s good for registration, what\u2019s strong enough for registration, is what we\u2019ve seen before and the one drug that\u2019s been registered. And somewhere a delta of between 20% and 30%, 25% to 30% with, obviously, the bigger number going to be the new agents. In that case, it was adalimumab over the background therapy. That\u2019s the one regulatory precedent we have for registration. So I think it could be argued that something approaching that is pretty strong data since that\u2019s all we have so far. And again, we\u2019ll just have to see how the agency thinks about these things. It\u2019s pretty clear they like they want to stay with HiSCR. They\u2019ve been very clear to the community about that. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re using. We\u2019ve \u2013 we will report essentially \u2013 and you\u2019ll recall in this trial, we\u2019ve committed to talking about the 12-week primary endpoint data. We also have some additional open \u2013 it\u2019s open label, but blinded to dose of a continued dosing for 24 weeks. So we\u2019ve got some special challenges here in trying to preserve the integrity of this data set, while presenting top line data, which will essentially be aggregate data between the groups that will tell us whether there is a difference between any of the dose groups In the placebo. So definitely, we\u2019ll have that information and that will be valuable and, in fact, will tell us whether we achieve the primary endpoint of a statistical separation between drug taking folks and placebo-taking folks. The powering on that is \u2013 was established quite early on, and I think we\u2019ve talked a little bit about it. Originally, we were powered to see about a 90% \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, 90% powered or greater to see the historical standard of a 20% difference. Again, I don\u2019t think even with all of the challenges of COVID, we probably have something pretty good, still very good power in that way. So I\u2019m not worried about a material depowering of the study in anyway. So I think, again, we\u2019ll get a clean answer. But the whole point is, if we get a nice strong resolve on the primary endpoint, we want to have a dataset of preserved integrity. So that when we take the follow-up phase, we can use the entirety of the data with a discussion with the FDA. And again, ask how could this support registration or inform a registration? So that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be talking about sometime in Q4 when we bring the data forward.\nMichelle Gilson: Okay. Thank you so much, Tom.\nThomas Schall: You\u2019re welcome, Michelle. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ted Tenthoff with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nTed Tenthoff: Thank you for all the updates. Tim, congrats on the success. It\u2019s been really an exciting year. So I\u2019m trying to understand sort of how the data \u2013 hoping that it\u2019s positive from HS and/or C3G could impact AAV approval? So it would be supplemental filings, but would you need to wait for the AAV approval to file for the other indications? I\u2019m just trying to sort of understand the sequence of that with respect to regulatory filings? Thanks so much.\nThomas Schall: Well, Ted, thank you. I hesitate to applying on regulatory details, since my regulatory expert is not on the phone today. We have an excellent team at ChemoCentryx, who does this work. But my understanding is that probably while each filing and, of course, the background materials in each filing, such as the manufacturing and chemistry controls, et cetera, obviously, the cumulative databases in other ways, safety, et cetera, those support any individual filing, probably each indication would be taken in its own turn. So \u2013 and point of fact from a pragmatic aspect, ANCA vasculitis filing will be moving along on the calendar already in its own way, in its own pace. And we\u2019ll \u2013 we probably have that process well underway by the time the other filings got put in. And again, without being entirely familiar with the details, because each of these indications is also at separate divisions within the FDA. I presume that those divisions while obviously cooperating extensively on the materials would, of course, have their own process. So I think, they\u2019re kind of quasi-independent but, of course, supported by the core technical information.\nTed Tenthoff: Well, again, it\u2019s a high quality problem, hopefully, so.\nThomas Schall: No, Thank you.\nTed Tenthoff: Thank you. Looking forward to the data, guys. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Yanan Zhu with Wells Fargo Security. Your line is now open. Excuse me, Yanan Zhu, your line is now open.\nYanan Zhu: Sorry, I was on mute. Thanks for taking the questions. Regarding the HS study design, there is a 10 mg BID or mid \u2013 kind of a mid-dose arm. Just curious, what \u2013 why was \u2013 because other \u2013 the other studies didn\u2019t include any those arms lower than 30 mg BID. So what\u2019s the reason of including that arm and what we might learn from that arm in the HS study? And also, if you could \u2013 yes, yes, so I\u2019ll take that. I have a follow up after that as well.\nThomas Schall: Sure, of course. In point of fact, in one of our Phase II development programs, we did include a 10 mg and a 30 mg dose against know avacopan, all of which was on the background therapy of standard of care. So it was kind of every group got high dose glucocorticoids in daily setting in addition to the combination of either cyclophosphamide or rituximab. So the classical glucocorticoid plus x protocol, where x is either cyclophosphamide or rituximab. So every individual in that Phase II study got that. And then we layered on either 10 mg dose or the 30 mg dose. And while that study was mostly a safety study, to see if there would be any additional safety burdens that avacopan might impose on people, should the drug be used, not that we\u2019re seeking to use it that way, but should someone ever use of avacopan in addition to what they\u2019ve been doing for all these years And then thankfully, there was no safety burden that avacopan brought to that party. We were able to look at 10 and 30 mg. Again, the power \u2013 the study was not powered for efficacy. But there were hints that what we saw with the active effective 30 mg dose in the other trials was present and apparent, even in that setting, where, of course, they were getting standard of care. So there was that to deal with in background, whereas the 10 mg dose was not quite as potent. So we do have some experience. And, of course, we have all of our calculations, both from pharmacological studies that are off-clinical and in the other healthy human volunteer studies to suggest that, at least for the target that we\u2019re going for of pharmacological coverage, essentially pharmacological inertness, if you will, of the receptor at trough levels of the drug, the 10 mg dose falls short of that. So we put it into this study as one of the arms. And essentially, this being a new indication outside the space that we were in before, we wanted to be able to speak to any questions that regulators or others might have. That would be, along the lines of, well, we see that you have some effect at this 30 mg dose. Is that really \u2013 could you go lower and still see an effect in this indication? So we just built that in. And if nothing else, that will inform the dataset. We don\u2019t think that 10 mg dose in that way will have the same pharmacological coverage at all. And so I would be gratifying if the dose response could be seen. Again, given the limitations of HiSCR, that\u2019s always a question. But we wanted to be able to demonstrate to regulators that we had explored dosing at scale in this particular indication. So that\u2019s why we put it in the trial as we did.\nYanan Zhu: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then the remaining question is regarding any safety implication from the HS study? More specifically, I think, for the ANCA vasculitis study, the ANCA\u2013 avacopan is used on top of cyclophosphamide or rituximab. So it\u2019s \u2013 the safety-wise, it\u2019s a little hard to see clearly a safety profile because of the background therapy here. I think there is a very good opportunity to demonstrate safety and it\u2019s a large data set. So could you share your thoughts on what \u2013 in addition to efficacy, what kind of safety leverage will this provide to the entire avacopan pipeline? Thanks.\nThomas Schall: Yes, very perceptive question, and you\u2019re quite right. In the ANCA patient population, they\u2019re on background therapy for their disease. They\u2019re on also an amazing number typically, an amazing number of concomitant medications to control other complications of the therapy prophylaxis for pneumocystis jirovecii as a consequence of being under high doses of glucocorticoids and/or cyclophosphamide and rituximab. So \u2013 then that has its own problem, that, that concomitant, they\u2019re trying to control their incipient diabetes and some of the bone problems with concomitant. They\u2019re really a challenged patient population. And one hopes going back to avacopan and ANCA vasculitis by removing some of the need for these broadly immunosuppressive therapies, we also get rid of some of these nasty [ph] conmeds that give them so many AEs and SAEs. But even there in ANCA, we could show 40% fewer number of severe AEs in the avacopan group versus the prednisone standard of care group. So there \u2013 is seems to be, at many levels, very good safety advantages to using avacopan. But again, we\u2019ll let regulators and others sit through the data sets, and I won\u2019t say any more about that since it\u2019s under a finding right now. But it is pretty clear to us that, that HS population is by and large notwithstanding the fact that they have this really debilitating illness, and that causes them a lot of discomfort and pain in many areas of life physically and emotionally. They are, by and large, not under the burden of quite so many concomitant medications and the safety database, although still blinded. The suggestion is that we have far fewer across the Board safety events just in this patient population full stop. And again, even in the blinded dataset, nothing that seems out of the ordinary for this patient population. So I think when the data come out, it will certainly add to \u2013 and fundamentally enhance the picture of safety around of avacopan, which we believe based on evidence today, both preclinical, off-clinical, number of species, and humans, both healthy and ANCA vasculitis population, we believe will be a very supportive data package on safety as well. So we hope it will just further enhance that package. And if there are any outstanding questions that come out of ANCA vasculitis, which in a complex patient population, there always could be. But if there are any, we\u2019ve got an equally large data set in Hidradenitis Suppurativa to check whether or not any of those kind events are evident in HS. So I think it\u2019s going to be a real benefit to our overall package and profile.\nYanan Zhu: Got it. Thank you, Tom. Very helpful.\nThomas Schall: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with SVB Leerink. Your line is now open.\nJoseph Schwartz: Thanks very much. Congrats on the progress as well. I was wondering if you could categorize or characterize your payer interactions for us in terms of how well you\u2019re finding that they appreciate the various sources of value that avacopan could deliver in terms of the total cost of patient management, maybe including a lot of the safety liabilities that you were just alluding to in the range of efficacy benefits? Are you finding that anything resonates more or less and how are you thinking about incorporating the feedback you\u2019ve obtained from payers to date in your ultimate pricing decision?\nThomas Schall: It\u2019s a great question. We \u2013 again, without going into too many details, and my commercial team, we\u2019re going to be presenting a lot of information at Health Economics Conferences as we get closer to launch. And so those will be very interesting things to watch. But I\u2019m going to say that these interactions to date have been \u2013 we\u2019ve been very pleased with how much payers actually get it in this organ in this particular orphan indication. They totally understand, maybe totally is a bit too strong. But let\u2019s just say that, we\u2019ve been impressed at how much understanding there is out there about the true cost of this kind of disease? You can go out and do the big ticket stuff like dialysis. And so the kidney data was something that was, again very pleasantly a factor in some of those conversations so far. That\u2019s obvious, right? I mean, end stage renal disease will bankrupt our Medicare system if we don\u2019t do something about it overall. It\u2019s about 9% of the total Medicare budget, far more than the entirety of the NIH budget for all medical \u2013 basic medical research, or certainly more than the NIH budget. Just for end stage renal disease, forget everything that leads up to it. But payers \u2013 even if we have to take that out of the equation, which is not \u2013 which is a big factor not to take out, but they understand the hospitalizations are \u2013 which are just a fraction of this big pie of ANCA vasculitis care. There\u2019s astonishing number of hospitalizations per year in the U.S. on the order of what 13,000 or 14,000, they\u2019re not short. It\u2019s not a day or so. It\u2019s seven to 11 days and costs ranging just the cost associated with the anchor codes in the diagnosis and hospitalizations ranging from 100,000 to 150,000. And this is just part \u2013 this is a fraction of the total cost. They get that things like glucocorticoids, maybe are cheap in the bottle, but they\u2019re super expensive to use. They get the \u2013 all the complications and the safety consequences and the absolute diminution of quality of life and the pharmacoeconomics of having people out of work, out of the \u2013 in the healthcare system all the time. So I would say, this is one of those things that you always go into a little bit fearful of the unknown. But so far, hats off to the payers, they\u2019ve been a lot more knowledgeable and a lot more on message and very receptive to the data we\u2019re presenting. So I think that\u2019s been an encouraging part of the journey so far, ad we\u2019ll have more to say about those details a little bit later on in the process.\nJoseph Schwartz: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for the insight, Tom.\nThomas Schall: Thank you very much, Joe.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Tessa Romero of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTessa Romero: Hi, Tom and Susan, this is Tessa on for Anupam. Thank you for taking our question. So on C3G, there is some competitive activity in the space. What are your thoughts around differentiation here for avacopan C5 inhibition from a mechanistic perspective? And then what is the latest thinking about epidemiology for C3G, where I think the literature can be somewhat variable? Thanks so much.\nThomas Schall: Yes, indeed, the literature is really variable. I \u2013 we have a lot of discussions, even within the enterprise about what is the most reliable idea of both incidence and prevalence, just in the U.S., let alone anywhere else in the world. It\u2019s a rare disease that much is true. There\u2019s no question. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s quite as ultra rare as some of the literature suggest that. My own inclination is maybe not. So I think that the treatable patient population in the United States is certainly accessible between \u2013 probably in the low number of thousands and that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re looking at. But it\u2019s hard to know, it is hard to know. Having said that, since there is nothing available for these people, and since they go through this really dismal progression of being young people having end-stage renal disease going into dialysis, maybe getting a transplant, usually from mom or dad, but typically mom, having that transplant fail within a few short years from the same underlying condition going back in dialysis. I mean, this is a bitty \u2013 a really bad grim cycle and very expensive, obviously, for the patients, their families and then, of course, for the healthcare system. So it\u2019s definitely very worthwhile approaching this problem and approaching it from a couple of different angles. I fundamentally hope that we can all find even in a rare disease like that. I think any approach that wins or any couple of approaches that wins is real progress and it will help everybody, because frankly, C3 glomerulopathy, again, one of its mysteries since it\u2019s so rare, is it really one disorder or how many disorders is it? I mean, we keep collapsing different features of kidney disease with complement dysregulation under new titles and C3G is the latest one. I just think of it, generally speaking, as a complement regulated \u2013 I\u2019m sorry complement dysregulated glomerulopathy. So as to differentiation, no one else is attacking what I think is the fundamental question is like, why does the kidney develop this massive inflammatory and eventually self destructive feature at the level of biopsy? And it\u2019s not just that you have all these protein deposits and \u2013 in the part of C3G that used to be called dense deposit disease. It\u2019s not just sort of gunking up the glomeruli. I mean, there is active destruction, I think. And so we know that complement is dysregulated. There is ample evidence for C5a receptor. C5a is more difficult, in my opinion, to detect either at the level of histochemistry or even with soluble detection in the periphery. But C5b-9 is definitely present in these patients. So there\u2019s lots of evidence of terminal complement activation leading to what would be a C5a presence and we believe it\u2019s there in the kidney as well, fundamentally. So we\u2019re the only game in town for stopping what we think is neutrophil-mediated destruction or other granulocytes mediating some of this destruction, other approaches? Yes, there are some and there\u2019s some in the complement intervention space. I think that our orally active drug validated at the level of another very difficult and complicated disease involving the kidneys ANCA vasculitis and validated robustly has to derisk our approach somewhat. And the question will be, is all C3G the same kind of disorder? Or are there going to be subsets that will be more amenable to treatment with one modality versus another? And that will play out, I think, over this next year. But make no mistake, as you know, some of these other approaches have been frustrated and it\u2019s really difficult to understand what\u2019s happening in this disorder. It\u2019s one of the reasons that when we set out, we intentionally decided to do something different. And we said, \u201cLook, C3G is, you can have presumptive C3G and then we do have a lot of biopsy work in this area. So let\u2019s take biopsies. Let\u2019s confirm that you have C3G at the level of biopsy at least and then let\u2019s look again at six months. That\u2019s a real investment on the part of patients and clinicians. But there\u2019s real good evidence that you can \u2013 if you get a histological improvement in and around the glomerulus, that matters, and that may well ultimately then fall into line with reduction in proteinuria, which is sustained, as well as an improvement over time in EGFR. And really, by bringing all these features together, including this biopsy endpoint, we think we\u2019ll be able, for the first time in the history of this disorder, to marry all these features together from a really good blinded data set, collected, blinded, evaluated in the case of histology by a central laboratory, and this should be very powerful. So I think we\u2019re going to have a lot to offer in terms of just knowledge, and I hope I\u2019m very sanguine and you need bullish about therapeutic benefit for some of these people with avacopan.\nTessa Romero: Great. Thanks, Tom, for taking our question.\nThomas Schall: Thank you, Tessa.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ed White with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is now open.\nEd White: Thank you. Hi, Tom. Hi, Susan.\nThomas Schall: Hello, Ed.\nEd White: So just a couple of questions. First on ACCOLADE. You\u2019re expecting the top line data by the end of the year. Is that only Stratum 1 or will you be seeing some Stratum 2 data as well?\nThomas Schall: That\u2019s a \u2013 again, a very insightful question. Ed, thank you very much for bringing that up. So I \u2013 it\u2019s notable when we talk about the ACCOLADE trial design. And I think we alluded to that on one of the slides. I reminded people again of this biopsy. We \u2013 originally, there\u2019s no approved therapy. So there\u2019s no regulatory path here, by the way, and I think most people understand that. When we set up this trial, there was a \u2013 some really good literature at the time. And this is by way of Stratum 1 and Stratum 2, so that people understand this a little bit better. There was good literature that, that suggested that if you had bonafide C3 glomerulopathy, i.e., active lesions and destruction in your kidney glomeruli, you were probably likely also to have a biomarker of high levels of C5b-9 or soluble MAC complex in your periphery, in your blood, your circulation. And this was a biomarker that was a stable, fairly easy to measure, because C5b-9 is stable and there are good essays for it. And so it would kind of make good sense, right? You\u2019ve got a complement dysregulated kidney disease and there\u2019s a nice biomarker in the blood. So maybe that\u2019s going to be helpful for diagnosis and knowing whether we\u2019re having a therapeutic benefit. So originally, the trial was designed just for those people that have had a relatively high level of C5b-9 in the periphery. As we got the trial design launched and consulted with FDA, there were some other papers that came out that had a kind of opposite point of view. It said, basically said, actually, all the actions in the kidney, don\u2019t worry about what\u2019s happening in the blood, because you could have C3G and have fairly low levels of confidence \u2013 of complement activation markers in the blood, including C5b-9. So what we decided to do is actually get that second Stratum, which is low soluble MAC complex in the trial, so that in a way we could definitively answer the question. And after all, if we had the Stratum 1 trial and got a great result, the next question would be, we\u2019ll do another trial in people with low soluble MAC complex and see if you get the same result. And so we just thought we do it all in one. Now why do I tell you all these things? The fact is when you have presumptive C3G and you then \u2013 and that\u2019s what we do, we look for presumptive C3G, we screen people, we then next take \u2013 we next take their measurements on soluble MAC complex low or high. And then the last step we do is biopsy prove, because that\u2019s the most invasive step. And so, by the \u2013 at least by the standards of this trial design, which was done with consultation with the leading nephrologists in the world in this area, what we know is this. It seems that the original hypothesis is more correct. If you have biopsy proven C3 glomerulopathy, you are likely to present clinically with this marker of high soluble MAC complex. And, in fact, if you have low soluble MAC complex, even if you clinically at presumptive for the C3G, you convert at the level of biopsy, which is the last step at a much smaller rate. So all of that is by way of saying that we will have virtually all of the target of the original Stratum 1. And the Stratum 2, there will be less data only because far fewer people actually have C3G when they have low soluble MAC complex. That\u2019s what our trial design data suggests so far. We\u2019ve haven\u2019t unblinded anything other than knowing that they simply don\u2019t come out on biopsy with C3G anywhere near as frequently when they have low soluble MAC. So we will put out all the data we have in the world, which, again, is probably the bulk of the data that we had from clinical trials on C3G. And we\u2019ve already answered, I think, or at least provided new information on a fundamental clinical question, which was the controversy between soluble MAC high or low, does that equate to C3G in the kidney? That\u2019s a level of biopsy, the level of biopsy. The high soluble MAC complex is much more correlated with C3G.\nEd White: Great. Thank you.\nThomas Schall: So I won\u2019t give you the detailed numbers yet, but we\u2019ll have all the data when we talk about that, at least, for the six-month primary endpoint.\nEd White: Great, fantastic. Thanks for all the information. And maybe just a far simpler question with a short answer. So with the expectations of 60 to 75 specialty field sales force, I\u2019m just wondering where you are in the hiring?\nThomas Schall: We\u2019re doing, I think, a great job of the hiring. Again, we\u2019ve really got a great commercial organization, young, dynamic, quite experienced and a lot of product experience and launches under their belt. So the infrastructure at the executive team level is very much in place. And now that \u2013 now we\u2019re just bringing on accordingly and in the appropriate time, the actual sales reps and medical science liaisons to bring them in with the appropriate timing. But the whole hiring plan is totally in effect, and we\u2019re well on our way to bring in many of those people that will be involved in that field force.\nEd White: Great. Thanks, Tom.\nThomas Schall: Thank you, Ed.\nOperator: I\u2019m now showing no further questions. And I would like to turn the call back to Thomas Schall for closing remarks.\nThomas Schall: Well, thank you, operator. And again, I wish to thank everyone who has been on the call today. Again, it\u2019s been a very exciting, although challenging year for many of us in the industry. But we\u2019re making good progress. I very much look forward to updating you as we execute further on these 2020 plans. And again, thank you all for your time and attention today. You may now disconnect. Bye-bye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Schall",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good afternoon to everyone listening. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2020 conference call. I will report to you today on what I believe is the impressive progress in executing on the 2020 goals that we laid out for you at the start of the year. But who could have guessed them just how far and fast this pandemic would spread, or how long it might last. Our hearts go out to all of those affected, to their friends and families and to all the healthcare workers who are fighting COVID-19. The COVID crisis has affected us all. Here at ChemoCentryx, we were already at or near full enrollment in our current cycle of clinical trials when the full force of the pandemic struck, and we expect to initiate our next cycle of clinical trials next year. We have, therefore, been able to meet most of the milestones that we set out for ourselves this year, with relatively little impact, while taking actions to safeguard the health of our employees. We are continuing to make key hires and build out a team ahead of the anticipated commercial launch of avacopan in 2021. The coronavirus has led to heightened awareness of the importance of the body's own defense mechanisms and to the crucial role that the immune system plays. And as you can see from Slide 3, our discovery and development efforts focus on small molecule therapeutics that targets specific chemoattractant receptors. These are the receptors that activate inflammatory cells in autoimmune diseases. We started in renal disease, but have leveraged our science into dermatology as well and have now even branched out into a new era in oncology. At the core of it all is the belief that a precise mechanism of action helps to achieve precision medicine. Our drug candidates are designed for antiinflammatory properties without broad immunosuppression, so that the immune system can remain fully focused on its mission to resist illness and disease. This is an important differentiating feature from other currently standard therapies for the diseases in which we at ChemoCentryx are developing new medicines. Our lead candidate, avacopan, selectively targets the C5a receptor, switching off the inappropriate activation of harmful neutrophils in complement-driven diseases. In early July, as shown on Slide 4, we submitted our new drug application to the FDA for avacopan in the treatment of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. We expect to hear back from the FDA later this quarter with regard to next steps in the FDA-review process. We are working also intensively with our partner, Vifor Pharma, as we and they gear up for the potential commercialization of avacopan outside of the U.S. Vifor will pay us royalties in the teens to the mid-20s on net sales outside the United States. Vifor plans to file a marketing approval authorization with the European Medicines Agency by the end of this year 2020. And we are working closely with them as they prepare their MAA using our core technical document from the FDA preparations as the key source. Our applications to regulatory agencies and our preparations for the anticipated commercialization of avacopan are built upon the key findings in the ADVOCATE pivotal trial. As a reminder, ADVOCATE compared our new targeted therapy of avacopan, against what has been the current standard of care, which contains high and chronic doses of glucocorticoids such as prednisone. We looked at clinical effects in the avacopan therapy group in comparison to the prednisone or steroid therapy group rather in a randomized, blinded, controlled worldwide Phase III trial of ANCA vasculitis patients. We believe the ADVOCATE findings demonstrate a compelling value proposition in terms of avacopan's potential to meet the four major unmet needs of ANCA vasculitis patients. First stopping ANCA vasculitis. Avacopan therapy was statistically superior in sustaining remission of ANCA vasculitis at 52 weeks compared to the prednisone containing standard of care group. Second, eliminating the need for chronic steroid therapy and the many illnesses associated with that current chronic steroid containing standard of care. In the ADVOCATE trial, avacopan patients achieved a significant reduction in the toxicities and illnesses known to be related to steroids. Third, stopping the accumulated organ damage that comes with this deadly and debilitating disease. Avacopan therapy led to improved kidney function and its use produced a statistically significant improvement in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, a key metric of kidney function. Fourth, an improvement in quality of life. Too many ANCA patients experienced poor quality of life, feeling listless, ill, and lacking in anything like normal vitality. From ADVOCATE, there was good news here, too, a statistically significant improvement in clinically validated measurements of quality of life on avacopan therapy. And overall, avacopan also demonstrated a favorable safety result in this serious and life-threatening disease, with fewer subjects having fewer numbers of serious adverse events in the avacopan group than in the steroid standard of care group. Results of the ADVOCATE trial were featured in oral plenary sessions during the annual meetings of both the EULAR, or European League Against Rheumatism; and ERA-EDTA, the European Renal Association - European Dialysis and Transplant Association meetings. At ERA-EDTA, for example, Dr. David Jayne from Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England, presented some remarkable data on EGFR improvements from the ADVOCATE trial. Slide 5 shows that 80% of ADVOCATE patients who entered the trial had defined renal impairment. In this group, their baseline EGFR, which was well balanced between the two groups, was on average about 45 ml per min. Avacopan therapy improved that EGFR by nearly 8 ml per min over 52 weeks of therapy, which was significantly better than the prednisone containing active comparative group. In fact, the graph on the right depicts the finding that some nephrologists have described to me as remarkable. In the lowest tertile of these patients, those with EGFR less than 30 ml per min baseline and, in fact, these individuals, their baseline EGFR was about 21 ml per min. Avacopan, by the way, this baseline of this tertile is only about 5 or 6 ml per min away from being a dialysis candidate. In this group, avacopan therapy boosted their EGFR by almost 14 ml per min over the 52 weeks. This result shows that we have not only met our goal of stabilizing or preserving what kidney function remains in this disease state, and in so doing, potentially sparing patients from dialysis. But, in fact, the data suggests that avacopan may actually improve renal function over time in a very significant way. We believe that avacopan therapy offers new hope for patients suffering from ANCA vasculitis, and importantly, could rid them of the toxic consequences of the use of a steroid \u2013 of a therapy developed more than a half a century ago, steroids. There were some other subtle, but notable findings from the ADVOCATE study. One of these, for example, is that patients on avacopan therapy performed very well in the second six months of the trial. During this period, avacopan was essentially a monotherapy since the standard concomitant background therapies, such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab have ceased. The data suggests that avacopan alone may suffice in controlling ANCA vasculitis over time, perhaps without the need for repeated administrations of background immunosuppressive drugs such as rituximab. While more clinical data may be needed to draw firmer conclusions, given the importance of preserving the immune function as we anticipate vaccines in the era of COVID-19, this could be a crucial benefit. We are continuing to move forward with our plans for potential commercial launch, as you will see on Slide 6. Our aim is be \u2013 is to be ready to launch soon after FDA approval. We have secured commercial batches of avacopan that we need for launch. We continue to hire well-qualified candidates for key positions, expanding the capabilities of our commercial operation. And we broadened and deepened our knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the U.S. ANCA vasculitis market through intensive market research. We're also taking appropriate educational opportunities to present data on the disease and on the findings from the ADVOCATE study to clinicians in both nephrology, rheumatology and other relevant disciplines. And we've initiated discussions with key payers to raise their awareness of the current unmet needs and burdens of ANCA vasculitis. We plan to field a specialty force of approximately 60 to 75 people to launch avacopan in the U.S. ANCA vasculitis is a disease that is estimated in the published literature to ravage anywhere between 40,000 and 100,000 people in the U.S., an estimated 4,000 to 9,000 cases alone, new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States. Given the strong value proposition suggested by the ADVOCATE data, we believe that avacopan's utility could extend beyond ANCA vasculitis, making avacopan a pipeline in a drug and with strong patent protection.Given the strong kidney benefit finding in ADVOCATE, we continue to refine our pipeline and expect to introduce avacopan into \u2013 for lupus nephritis into clinical development in the first-half of 2021. And as you can see from Slide 7, we expect to report top line data and two more indications this year. Indeed, avacopan's ability to stifle the activation of destructive neutrophils by jamming the C5a receptor represents a precision approach that is relevant not only in kidney diseases, but potentially outside the renal space as well. In fact, the first top line data that we will report this year is in Hidradenitis Suppurativa, the disabling skin disorder. HS is driven by neutrophils that are thought to be activated by the C5a receptor. Endovasculitis complement dysregulation is almost universal in HS patients. Our AURORA study, depicted on Slide 8, is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase IIb or clinical trial of approximately 390 patients with moderate to severe HS, with patients randomized to one of three arms. The primary endpoint is the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response Score, or HiSCR, after 12 weeks of treatment. We designed the trial to be powered to a registration grade level and decided to slightly over enroll in order to provide some cushion for anticipated COVID-related loss patient follow-up. As I mentioned earlier, the COVID crisis has affected us all. We at CCXI are no exception, but the impacts have been less grievous for us than for others. Still while the majority of our subjects had already enrolled in the AURORA trial before the full impact of the pandemic, the summer resurgence of COVID-19 has led to the renewed, if temporary restrictions of some of the clinical sites. It is, therefore, likely that this will impact somewhat the normal processes of data collection and verification that then lead to database locking and subsequent data analysis. These processes, which are routine to any clinical study, are likely to going to be modestly delayed in AURORA owing to COVID. Thus, we predict that the reporting of the 12-week top line results originally forecast for Q3 is now expected early in Q4. To be clear, no unblinded data are yet in hand. No unblinding or any other unblinded analyses have yet occurred in this trial, w are merely predicting a modest delay in reporting as a consequence of COVID delays. I'm often asked how we are dealing with the placebo issue in HS. The primary endpoint assessment known as HiSCR has an unavoidable element of subjectivity. But it is the standard that the FDA expects sponsors to use in determining clinical effects in HS and ultimately, the standard by which they will assess for an approval of a new therapeutic agent. We have been very careful to attempt to minimize subjectivity in HiSCR. For example, we have carefully selected sites, which are all in the U.S., allowing a high touch approach and also in a healthcare system, which tends to keep placebo responses in check. We have engaged a training program of intensive training, standardization and monitoring. For example, first to training. Suffice it to say, we train, train, train and principal investigators had to pass a certification test on HiSCR to qualify to enroll patients. Standardization, we developed and mandated the use of standardized records and continuous worksheets across the clinical sites. And finally, monitoring. During the blinded data collection phase, our resident medical monitor scans nearly daily for anomalies in the data collection and is in frequent contact with the investigator also \u2013 who is also still blinded, and they joined the result any recording anomalies using our standard protocol. In all of these ways and more, we are scrupulously attempting to control what we can control to reduce variability and placebo response in the HiSCR assessment. Our other current avacopan trial is in another kidney indication, C3 glomerulopathy. C3G is a rare and devastating kidney disease. There is no FDA-approved therapy for C3G. ACCOLADE is a randomized, blinded controlled trial, the design of which is shown on Slide 9. The trial is unique in many ways, including that we will collect and carefully measure kidney biopsy data as a measure of efficacy, and this will be coupled with other traditional markers of kidney function. Many experts suggest that we are already in possession of the largest and most comprehensive data set, albeit still blinded, for C3G yet assembled for this life-threatening illness. We aim to announce top line data for the ACCOLADE trial by the end of this year. Innovation in life sciences does not come up without its setbacks, and our risk came with the disappointing top line results from our LUMINA-1 trial of CCX140 in focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. We don't see a way forward for CCX140 in FSGS. In the interest of biomedical innovation and completion, we will report more detailed LUMINA-1, as well as the smaller LUMINA-2 data sets in due course. On a brighter note, see Slide 10. And also in the second quarter, we announced that we have identified an orally administered checkpoint inhibitor, CCX559, formerly referred to as CCX6559, which we plan to advance in the clinical development in the first-half of this coming year in 2021. Data presented in June at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research showed that our optimized checkpoint inhibitors lead to a marked inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in vitro, and importantly, produced a potent anti-tumor effects in vitro in pharmacological models. We believe that CCX559 has the potential to be used alone or in combination with antibody therapy, or other oncology therapies. Our small molecule checkpoint inhibitor is designed to address at least two limitations of current antibody checkpoint inhibitor therapy: one, a small molecule may achieve better penetration of the tumor microenvironment, where some tumors are currently resistant to antibody therapy; two, a small molecule brings the convenience of a flexible dosing capability. Before I turn the call over to Susan Kanaya for our financial results, let me add that during the quarter, we have further strengthened our balance sheet with a follow-on offering that yielded net proceeds of almost $326 million. We report today over $0.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as of the end of the second quarter. This financial strength supplies many important degrees of freedom in pursuing our ultimate mission. We believe that we have the resources we need for the potential commercial launch of avacopan and ANCA vasculitis and beyond. We can pursue the simultaneous further development of avacopan and other high-need, high-value clinical indications, as well as additional formulations. And we can follow the science and invest in other novel and highly innovative drug candidates, such as our orally-administered checkpoint inhibitor, CCX559. My warmest thanks to all my colleagues at ChemoCentryx, especially in these difficult times, for their tireless work and advancing us to this stage and to the many clinicians involved in our clinical trials. And I think, especially the patients and their families, who have devoted so much to our controlled-blinded trials, not knowing if an active agent was part of their personal plan, but doing so for the benefit of the community as a whole. Susan? Thank you, Susan. To summarize, as you can see on Slide 12, we have filed an NDA for avacopan and ANCA vasculitis and our partner, Vifor, expects to file an MAA in Europe by the end of 2020. We continue to build our commercial capability. We are on track to release top line results from two further clinical trials of avacopan in patients with HS by early Q4 and with C3G by the end of the year. We are preparing for our next cycle of pipeline advancements, and we anticipate initiating clinic programs in the first-half of 2021 for our orally-administered checkpoint inhibitor, CCX559, as well as for avacopan in patients with lupus nephritis. We have attracted the financial resources that we need, with now over a $0.5 billion on the balance sheet at the end of Q2, to drive us to the next phase of our growth as we seek to become a fully integrated pharmaceutical enterprise that brings fundamentally new medicines to patients that need them most. This ChemoCentryx enterprise is built on biomedical innovation, on determination, on integrity, and on purposeful resilience. With science and data illuminating the path ahead, I look forward into a future based with the bright light of hope and prosperity. With that, I will now turn the call back over to the operator, and we look forward to your questions. Operator? Yes, great. Great question, Steve. So it is \u2013 all of our analyses are intended as ITT, because as I said, we made this trial kind of a registration grade trial, since it's \u2013 but even though it's a \u201cPhase II or Phase IIb trial.\u201d So our intention will be to report the stats as intent to treat. We will obviously do and have in our stats plan pre-specified various kinds of protocol analyses. So those data will be informative and meaningful as well. Currently, we've been \u2013 and obviously, we and others have been really careful in documenting the effects of COVID on patients, particularly for primary endpoint determination, working very carefully with FDA and documenting in real-time, what we're doing with those folks. At the moment, we do not intend the last observation carry-forward necessarily for those that missed their 12-week visit owing to COVID. But they certainly will capture all the data we can from those folks, particularly if they're still on the trial and are measured thereafter. So those might be eliminating data as well. But I think the good news is that the first part of your question, which is the \u2013 I think, probably the most important part. Although, yes, it is clear that, that dropouts and some loss data owing to COVID is going to be higher than what we and others might have modeled. The fortunate news is I don't think it's going to \u2013 it's not going to materially impair our ability to still have very good power in this trial. So that's, I think, for us, the excellent news. We really made a big trial with big groups. It was very highly power to detect the differences that historically, we might be led to expect and certainly highly powdered to detect statistical differences between the groups. So even a doubling, if you will, and I'm not saying that's the number, but even if we had twice the number of dropouts or lost data at 12 weeks, I think, we've still got really good power discrimination. So I fundamentally believe that we'll be able to return a meaningful and clean result from the 12-week data, even with the fact that COVID has messed with some of that data a little bit. And really, the biggest impact for us is a slight delay as we get into the sites and do our data verification and collection process. Thank you. Sure. Thank you, Dae Gon. Without going into all the details on the antibiotic use, I can tell you that we're much closer to the PIONEER studies than we were to any other studies. We realized that concomitant antibiotic use can be a confounding feature in the short-term in ascribing effects to the HiSCR. And so we were pretty careful about looking back at what had happened in PIONEER 1 and 2 and trying to adhere to those guidelines. And also making sure that to the extent possible, we didn't have imbalances in antibiotic uses between the group. So, again, I think, we've been very cognizant of that as a complicating feature and trying to avoid it as a complicating factor in our interpretation. Back to the regulatory strategy, so it's \u2013 the history is clear on what's gone before. We're evaluating the Hurley stage II/III patient population, as did the PIONEER studies, which were the studies as people may know, are the only Phase III pivotal trials that led to so far the single loan registration of a drug in this space, that for adalimumab, the anti-TNF drug Humira. Hence, we want to try to avail ourselves as much as we can from information from that President. So interestingly, that sponsor got an orphan drug designation for Hurley stage II/III, because that patient population is under 200,000 people in the U.S., and that is still the case. So we have \u2013 we've been attempting and continue to work on our orphan drug designation. We don't yet have that designation yet to ChemoCentryx. But there is precedent, and we've been certainly working on that continuously. So we yet to know if we get that orphan drug designation. But again, there is precedent for it. We fundamentally believe that Hurley stage II/III patients are still fewer than 200,000 in the United States at this juncture. So with all of that in mind, getting back to the \u2013 one of the main points of the question, we set up this trial to be big enough and highly powered enough, where we got really good data with a highly differentiated agent, particularly one which at that time was not yet in registration for another indication But we had confidence that it would be. And that's what that has come to past that we are filed \u2013 we are actually \u2013 have a filing under review for registration of avacopan and ANCA vasculitis. We were \u2013 we have been hopeful that with strong data, we could have an interesting discussion with the FDA about potentially a conditional registration or at least how to get to an accelerated path to registration, again, with strong data. So, again, without going into a lot of details, and certainly, I do not at all speak for the agency and the agency will just have to see what data we have as we will, and then we will discuss from there. I think it's really great news, though, that there's a huge \u2013 it seems to me a huge demand, not just for new therapy in HS, but new orally active therapy. And so, again, even COVID notwithstanding, but certainly prior to COVID, we really enrolled to this study very rapidly. And I think that again speaks to the eagerness of folks in this community to have a new therapy options. So we'll see how strong the data is. We'll have discussions with the agency. And in the light of \u2013 if data are positive, we will do everything that we possibly can to bring the drug to registration in this indication as quickly as possible. Thank you, Dae Gon. Sure. So it's \u2013 all of those are really excellent questions, Michelle, thank you for them. We have so little precedent in the world of Hidradenitis Suppurativa in controlled trials that are informative. To really help us guide some of those answers, I'll take some guesses. And certainly, we have, again, for lack of a better term, an endpoint, which is a strong tool, but not a very sharp tool. It's not a precise tool. And the element of variability and subjectivity, again, makes it a little bit difficult to always try to compare apples-to-apples, particularly when there has only been one or two apples in the bin before. So let me say this that as a general rule, anything that gets me to a clear answer about a next step, to me is a success. So, if we see clear separation between the groups, and if some of the secondaries look also supportive, and we say to ourselves, \u201cWell, it's clear that we're having a clinical effect and need a clinical benefit.\u201d That's a good answer. Hopefully, we won't get the other kind of clear answer, which is there's nothing here, but we've done our best. But again, even a good clean answer on that side of the equation just allows us to focus on other areas that we can put our time, effort and treasure. So getting back to, we always like \u2013 people always like to say, \u201cWell, what would an interesting difference be?\u201d For me, any statistical separation, that's significant? I will say, let's look very carefully at that. And with this kind of instrument careful as we already use it as carefully as we can, that probably is meaningful. So we would, at minimum, like to see a statistical separation, obviously, with the HiSCR. And the only precedent we have about what's good for registration, what's strong enough for registration, is what we've seen before and the one drug that's been registered. And somewhere a delta of between 20% and 30%, 25% to 30% with, obviously, the bigger number going to be the new agents. In that case, it was adalimumab over the background therapy. That's the one regulatory precedent we have for registration. So I think it could be argued that something approaching that is pretty strong data since that's all we have so far. And again, we'll just have to see how the agency thinks about these things. It's pretty clear they like they want to stay with HiSCR. They've been very clear to the community about that. So that's what we're using. We've \u2013 we will report essentially \u2013 and you'll recall in this trial, we've committed to talking about the 12-week primary endpoint data. We also have some additional open \u2013 it's open label, but blinded to dose of a continued dosing for 24 weeks. So we've got some special challenges here in trying to preserve the integrity of this data set, while presenting top line data, which will essentially be aggregate data between the groups that will tell us whether there is a difference between any of the dose groups In the placebo. So definitely, we'll have that information and that will be valuable and, in fact, will tell us whether we achieve the primary endpoint of a statistical separation between drug taking folks and placebo-taking folks. The powering on that is \u2013 was established quite early on, and I think we've talked a little bit about it. Originally, we were powered to see about a 90% \u2013 I'm sorry, 90% powered or greater to see the historical standard of a 20% difference. Again, I don't think even with all of the challenges of COVID, we probably have something pretty good, still very good power in that way. So I'm not worried about a material depowering of the study in anyway. So I think, again, we'll get a clean answer. But the whole point is, if we get a nice strong resolve on the primary endpoint, we want to have a dataset of preserved integrity. So that when we take the follow-up phase, we can use the entirety of the data with a discussion with the FDA. And again, ask how could this support registration or inform a registration? So that's what we'll be talking about sometime in Q4 when we bring the data forward. You're welcome, Michelle. Thank you. Well, Ted, thank you. I hesitate to applying on regulatory details, since my regulatory expert is not on the phone today. We have an excellent team at ChemoCentryx, who does this work. But my understanding is that probably while each filing and, of course, the background materials in each filing, such as the manufacturing and chemistry controls, et cetera, obviously, the cumulative databases in other ways, safety, et cetera, those support any individual filing, probably each indication would be taken in its own turn. So \u2013 and point of fact from a pragmatic aspect, ANCA vasculitis filing will be moving along on the calendar already in its own way, in its own pace. And we'll \u2013 we probably have that process well underway by the time the other filings got put in. And again, without being entirely familiar with the details, because each of these indications is also at separate divisions within the FDA. I presume that those divisions while obviously cooperating extensively on the materials would, of course, have their own process. So I think, they're kind of quasi-independent but, of course, supported by the core technical information. No, Thank you. Sure, of course. In point of fact, in one of our Phase II development programs, we did include a 10 mg and a 30 mg dose against know avacopan, all of which was on the background therapy of standard of care. So it was kind of every group got high dose glucocorticoids in daily setting in addition to the combination of either cyclophosphamide or rituximab. So the classical glucocorticoid plus x protocol, where x is either cyclophosphamide or rituximab. So every individual in that Phase II study got that. And then we layered on either 10 mg dose or the 30 mg dose. And while that study was mostly a safety study, to see if there would be any additional safety burdens that avacopan might impose on people, should the drug be used, not that we're seeking to use it that way, but should someone ever use of avacopan in addition to what they've been doing for all these years And then thankfully, there was no safety burden that avacopan brought to that party. We were able to look at 10 and 30 mg. Again, the power \u2013 the study was not powered for efficacy. But there were hints that what we saw with the active effective 30 mg dose in the other trials was present and apparent, even in that setting, where, of course, they were getting standard of care. So there was that to deal with in background, whereas the 10 mg dose was not quite as potent. So we do have some experience. And, of course, we have all of our calculations, both from pharmacological studies that are off-clinical and in the other healthy human volunteer studies to suggest that, at least for the target that we're going for of pharmacological coverage, essentially pharmacological inertness, if you will, of the receptor at trough levels of the drug, the 10 mg dose falls short of that. So we put it into this study as one of the arms. And essentially, this being a new indication outside the space that we were in before, we wanted to be able to speak to any questions that regulators or others might have. That would be, along the lines of, well, we see that you have some effect at this 30 mg dose. Is that really \u2013 could you go lower and still see an effect in this indication? So we just built that in. And if nothing else, that will inform the dataset. We don't think that 10 mg dose in that way will have the same pharmacological coverage at all. And so I would be gratifying if the dose response could be seen. Again, given the limitations of HiSCR, that's always a question. But we wanted to be able to demonstrate to regulators that we had explored dosing at scale in this particular indication. So that's why we put it in the trial as we did. Yes, very perceptive question, and you're quite right. In the ANCA patient population, they're on background therapy for their disease. They're on also an amazing number typically, an amazing number of concomitant medications to control other complications of the therapy prophylaxis for pneumocystis jirovecii as a consequence of being under high doses of glucocorticoids and/or cyclophosphamide and rituximab. So \u2013 then that has its own problem, that, that concomitant, they're trying to control their incipient diabetes and some of the bone problems with concomitant. They're really a challenged patient population. And one hopes going back to avacopan and ANCA vasculitis by removing some of the need for these broadly immunosuppressive therapies, we also get rid of some of these nasty [ph] conmeds that give them so many AEs and SAEs. But even there in ANCA, we could show 40% fewer number of severe AEs in the avacopan group versus the prednisone standard of care group. So there \u2013 is seems to be, at many levels, very good safety advantages to using avacopan. But again, we'll let regulators and others sit through the data sets, and I won't say any more about that since it's under a finding right now. But it is pretty clear to us that, that HS population is by and large notwithstanding the fact that they have this really debilitating illness, and that causes them a lot of discomfort and pain in many areas of life physically and emotionally. They are, by and large, not under the burden of quite so many concomitant medications and the safety database, although still blinded. The suggestion is that we have far fewer across the Board safety events just in this patient population full stop. And again, even in the blinded dataset, nothing that seems out of the ordinary for this patient population. So I think when the data come out, it will certainly add to \u2013 and fundamentally enhance the picture of safety around of avacopan, which we believe based on evidence today, both preclinical, off-clinical, number of species, and humans, both healthy and ANCA vasculitis population, we believe will be a very supportive data package on safety as well. So we hope it will just further enhance that package. And if there are any outstanding questions that come out of ANCA vasculitis, which in a complex patient population, there always could be. But if there are any, we've got an equally large data set in Hidradenitis Suppurativa to check whether or not any of those kind events are evident in HS. So I think it's going to be a real benefit to our overall package and profile. Thank you. It's a great question. We \u2013 again, without going into too many details, and my commercial team, we're going to be presenting a lot of information at Health Economics Conferences as we get closer to launch. And so those will be very interesting things to watch. But I'm going to say that these interactions to date have been \u2013 we've been very pleased with how much payers actually get it in this organ in this particular orphan indication. They totally understand, maybe totally is a bit too strong. But let's just say that, we've been impressed at how much understanding there is out there about the true cost of this kind of disease? You can go out and do the big ticket stuff like dialysis. And so the kidney data was something that was, again very pleasantly a factor in some of those conversations so far. That's obvious, right? I mean, end stage renal disease will bankrupt our Medicare system if we don't do something about it overall. It's about 9% of the total Medicare budget, far more than the entirety of the NIH budget for all medical \u2013 basic medical research, or certainly more than the NIH budget. Just for end stage renal disease, forget everything that leads up to it. But payers \u2013 even if we have to take that out of the equation, which is not \u2013 which is a big factor not to take out, but they understand the hospitalizations are \u2013 which are just a fraction of this big pie of ANCA vasculitis care. There's astonishing number of hospitalizations per year in the U.S. on the order of what 13,000 or 14,000, they're not short. It's not a day or so. It's seven to 11 days and costs ranging just the cost associated with the anchor codes in the diagnosis and hospitalizations ranging from 100,000 to 150,000. And this is just part \u2013 this is a fraction of the total cost. They get that things like glucocorticoids, maybe are cheap in the bottle, but they're super expensive to use. They get the \u2013 all the complications and the safety consequences and the absolute diminution of quality of life and the pharmacoeconomics of having people out of work, out of the \u2013 in the healthcare system all the time. So I would say, this is one of those things that you always go into a little bit fearful of the unknown. But so far, hats off to the payers, they've been a lot more knowledgeable and a lot more on message and very receptive to the data we're presenting. So I think that's been an encouraging part of the journey so far, ad we'll have more to say about those details a little bit later on in the process. Thank you very much, Joe. Yes, indeed, the literature is really variable. I \u2013 we have a lot of discussions, even within the enterprise about what is the most reliable idea of both incidence and prevalence, just in the U.S., let alone anywhere else in the world. It's a rare disease that much is true. There's no question. I don't know if it's quite as ultra rare as some of the literature suggest that. My own inclination is maybe not. So I think that the treatable patient population in the United States is certainly accessible between \u2013 probably in the low number of thousands and that's kind of what we're looking at. But it's hard to know, it is hard to know. Having said that, since there is nothing available for these people, and since they go through this really dismal progression of being young people having end-stage renal disease going into dialysis, maybe getting a transplant, usually from mom or dad, but typically mom, having that transplant fail within a few short years from the same underlying condition going back in dialysis. I mean, this is a bitty \u2013 a really bad grim cycle and very expensive, obviously, for the patients, their families and then, of course, for the healthcare system. So it's definitely very worthwhile approaching this problem and approaching it from a couple of different angles. I fundamentally hope that we can all find even in a rare disease like that. I think any approach that wins or any couple of approaches that wins is real progress and it will help everybody, because frankly, C3 glomerulopathy, again, one of its mysteries since it's so rare, is it really one disorder or how many disorders is it? I mean, we keep collapsing different features of kidney disease with complement dysregulation under new titles and C3G is the latest one. I just think of it, generally speaking, as a complement regulated \u2013 I'm sorry complement dysregulated glomerulopathy. So as to differentiation, no one else is attacking what I think is the fundamental question is like, why does the kidney develop this massive inflammatory and eventually self destructive feature at the level of biopsy? And it's not just that you have all these protein deposits and \u2013 in the part of C3G that used to be called dense deposit disease. It's not just sort of gunking up the glomeruli. I mean, there is active destruction, I think. And so we know that complement is dysregulated. There is ample evidence for C5a receptor. C5a is more difficult, in my opinion, to detect either at the level of histochemistry or even with soluble detection in the periphery. But C5b-9 is definitely present in these patients. So there's lots of evidence of terminal complement activation leading to what would be a C5a presence and we believe it's there in the kidney as well, fundamentally. So we're the only game in town for stopping what we think is neutrophil-mediated destruction or other granulocytes mediating some of this destruction, other approaches? Yes, there are some and there's some in the complement intervention space. I think that our orally active drug validated at the level of another very difficult and complicated disease involving the kidneys ANCA vasculitis and validated robustly has to derisk our approach somewhat. And the question will be, is all C3G the same kind of disorder? Or are there going to be subsets that will be more amenable to treatment with one modality versus another? And that will play out, I think, over this next year. But make no mistake, as you know, some of these other approaches have been frustrated and it's really difficult to understand what's happening in this disorder. It's one of the reasons that when we set out, we intentionally decided to do something different. And we said, \u201cLook, C3G is, you can have presumptive C3G and then we do have a lot of biopsy work in this area. So let's take biopsies. Let's confirm that you have C3G at the level of biopsy at least and then let's look again at six months. That's a real investment on the part of patients and clinicians. But there's real good evidence that you can \u2013 if you get a histological improvement in and around the glomerulus, that matters, and that may well ultimately then fall into line with reduction in proteinuria, which is sustained, as well as an improvement over time in EGFR. And really, by bringing all these features together, including this biopsy endpoint, we think we'll be able, for the first time in the history of this disorder, to marry all these features together from a really good blinded data set, collected, blinded, evaluated in the case of histology by a central laboratory, and this should be very powerful. So I think we're going to have a lot to offer in terms of just knowledge, and I hope I'm very sanguine and you need bullish about therapeutic benefit for some of these people with avacopan. Thank you, Tessa. Hello, Ed. That's a \u2013 again, a very insightful question. Ed, thank you very much for bringing that up. So I \u2013 it's notable when we talk about the ACCOLADE trial design. And I think we alluded to that on one of the slides. I reminded people again of this biopsy. We \u2013 originally, there's no approved therapy. So there's no regulatory path here, by the way, and I think most people understand that. When we set up this trial, there was a \u2013 some really good literature at the time. And this is by way of Stratum 1 and Stratum 2, so that people understand this a little bit better. There was good literature that, that suggested that if you had bonafide C3 glomerulopathy, i.e., active lesions and destruction in your kidney glomeruli, you were probably likely also to have a biomarker of high levels of C5b-9 or soluble MAC complex in your periphery, in your blood, your circulation. And this was a biomarker that was a stable, fairly easy to measure, because C5b-9 is stable and there are good essays for it. And so it would kind of make good sense, right? You've got a complement dysregulated kidney disease and there's a nice biomarker in the blood. So maybe that's going to be helpful for diagnosis and knowing whether we're having a therapeutic benefit. So originally, the trial was designed just for those people that have had a relatively high level of C5b-9 in the periphery. As we got the trial design launched and consulted with FDA, there were some other papers that came out that had a kind of opposite point of view. It said, basically said, actually, all the actions in the kidney, don't worry about what's happening in the blood, because you could have C3G and have fairly low levels of confidence \u2013 of complement activation markers in the blood, including C5b-9. So what we decided to do is actually get that second Stratum, which is low soluble MAC complex in the trial, so that in a way we could definitively answer the question. And after all, if we had the Stratum 1 trial and got a great result, the next question would be, we'll do another trial in people with low soluble MAC complex and see if you get the same result. And so we just thought we do it all in one. Now why do I tell you all these things? The fact is when you have presumptive C3G and you then \u2013 and that's what we do, we look for presumptive C3G, we screen people, we then next take \u2013 we next take their measurements on soluble MAC complex low or high. And then the last step we do is biopsy prove, because that's the most invasive step. And so, by the \u2013 at least by the standards of this trial design, which was done with consultation with the leading nephrologists in the world in this area, what we know is this. It seems that the original hypothesis is more correct. If you have biopsy proven C3 glomerulopathy, you are likely to present clinically with this marker of high soluble MAC complex. And, in fact, if you have low soluble MAC complex, even if you clinically at presumptive for the C3G, you convert at the level of biopsy, which is the last step at a much smaller rate. So all of that is by way of saying that we will have virtually all of the target of the original Stratum 1. And the Stratum 2, there will be less data only because far fewer people actually have C3G when they have low soluble MAC complex. That's what our trial design data suggests so far. We've haven't unblinded anything other than knowing that they simply don't come out on biopsy with C3G anywhere near as frequently when they have low soluble MAC. So we will put out all the data we have in the world, which, again, is probably the bulk of the data that we had from clinical trials on C3G. And we've already answered, I think, or at least provided new information on a fundamental clinical question, which was the controversy between soluble MAC high or low, does that equate to C3G in the kidney? That's a level of biopsy, the level of biopsy. The high soluble MAC complex is much more correlated with C3G. So I won't give you the detailed numbers yet, but we'll have all the data when we talk about that, at least, for the six-month primary endpoint. We're doing, I think, a great job of the hiring. Again, we've really got a great commercial organization, young, dynamic, quite experienced and a lot of product experience and launches under their belt. So the infrastructure at the executive team level is very much in place. And now that \u2013 now we're just bringing on accordingly and in the appropriate time, the actual sales reps and medical science liaisons to bring them in with the appropriate timing. But the whole hiring plan is totally in effect, and we're well on our way to bring in many of those people that will be involved in that field force. Thank you, Ed. Well, thank you, operator. And again, I wish to thank everyone who has been on the call today. Again, it's been a very exciting, although challenging year for many of us in the industry. But we're making good progress. I very much look forward to updating you as we execute further on these 2020 plans. And again, thank you all for your time and attention today. You may now disconnect. Bye-bye."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom. Our second quarter 2020 financial results were included in our press release today and are summarized on Slide 11. Revenue was $49.4 million for the second quarter, compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2019. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to the acceleration of revenue recognition associated with CCX140 agreement with Vifor. Following the decision to discontinue development of CCX140 in FSGS, $47.2 million of deferred revenue was recognized as contract revenue. Research and development expenses were $18.8 million for the second quarter of 2020, compared to $17.6 million in the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to patient enrollment in the avacopan AURORA trial in patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa, professional fees associated with the preparation of our avacopan NDA for ANCA-associated vasculitis and higher drug development or drug discovery expenses, including those associated with CCX55, our orally-administered small molecule PD-L1 inhibitor. These increase were partially offset by lower expenses due to the full enrollment of CCX140 LUMINA-1 trial in 2019. General and administrative expenses were $10.3 million for the second quarter, compared to $5.6 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, including those associated with our commercialization planning efforts and higher professional fees. Net income for the second quarter was $20.3 million, compared to net loss of $15.2 million in the same quarter of 2019. Total shares outstanding at June 30, 2020 were approximately 68.8 million shares. Lastly, we closed the quarter with $504.6 million and reported cash, cash equivalents and investments, including the $325.7 million in net proceeds from the June 2020 equity follow-on offering of our common stock.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce, Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood you may now begin.\nArvind Sood: Okay. Thanks, Ian. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our Q1 call. I hope you and your families are staying safe. We are -- positioned with the COVID-19 pandemic. I know, I speak on behalf of all my colleagues at Amgen when I say that it's a source of great pride that we work in an industry that can be a part of the solution. Before we start, I would like to recognize those who are new in their coverage of Amgen, including Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research; Carter Gould of Barclays; and Michael Schmidt of Guggenheim. Welcome. Over the past few weeks I've talked with many of you and you have expressed concerns and pose questions about how this COVID pandemic will impact our business, including supply chain, clinical trials, commercial operations and growth outlook. As our growth outlook will be defined by how these variables unfold in the future, we have modified the order of presenters today, so you can get a good sense of how we are dealing with the uncertainties and remedial actions we are taking to run our business effectively. Our CEO, Bob Bradway will commence the call with some opening comments; followed by our Head of R&D, Dave Reese who will provide a pipeline update; our Head of Commercial Operations, Murdo Gordon will give you a state of the business; and then our CFO, Peter Griffith will bring it all together by helping you understand what all this means in terms of our growth outlook. By the way consistent with the recommendations for social distancing, we are all in different locations today. So please bear with us as we are doing the best we can. Just a quick reminder that we'll use non-GAAP financial measures in today's presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. I would direct you to our 10-K and subsequent filings, which identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?\nBob Bradway: Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to acknowledge upfront that this has been an extraordinary quarter for all of us. Global pandemic, economic disruption like none of us have seen before, and of course financial volatility that has been dizzying at times. But I hope you're keeping well and we're certainly grateful to you for joining the call -- results we're managing through the COVID disruption quite well and feel we're operating from a position of strength with a healthy balance sheet, a strong portfolio of products and an organization that has proven itself time and again to be innovative, resilient and able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. I want to take a few moments to share how we've been responding to COVID-19 and then we can dive into the details of the first quarter and what we see for the remainder of the year. We've mobilized our company around four priorities. First, taking care of our staff, our 23,000 staff around the world; second, continuing to serve patients with an uninterrupted supply of our commercial and clinical medicines; third, leveraging our core genetics immunology and antibody expertise in the fight against COVID-19; and finally, supporting the communities where we live and work. Our first priority from the beginning of the pandemic has been to ensure the safety of our people and their families. To encourage social distancing, Amgen staff worldwide are mostly working from home now. We're encouraged that in a few markets, conditions have improved to the point where we've begun returning our people to the workplace and we hope to expand our back to the workplace activities in the coming -- I would also note that about a quarter of our staff are engaged in essential manufacturing and R&D activities that have required them to continue coming to the workplace every day. We're taking every possible measure to keep these employees safe and we're grateful to them for their commitments to patients into our business. All our staff are performing really well as you can see from our results. At a time when health care systems around the world are being stretched to their limits, we're committed to working collaboratively with our partners in the health care ecosystem. We need to make sure that we're both responding to COVID-19 and meeting the ongoing needs of other seriously ill patients -- health care crisis that we as a society never intended. From a supply chain perspective, we've not experienced any significant disruptions and we don't currently anticipate any shortages of our medicines due to COVID-19. With respect to clinical trials, our pivotal studies including for AMG 510, Otezla, tezepelumab and omecamtiv mecarbil are fully enrolled and expected to read out this year as previously announced. Other programs such as our BiTEs in oncology have also continued to progress and we're encouraged by the accumulating data there. Where programs have been interrupted by the COVID pandemic, we're busy making plans to get them restarted as soon as appropriate from a patient safety and regulatory perspective. By now, it's clear that overcoming this pandemic will require innovative science. While the virus may have gotten the jump on us at the outset, the good news is that the community of innovative biopharmaceutical companies is moving at a speed and scale never seen before and we're gaining ground on the virus with each passing day. While our research does not include antivirals, we have a role to play in this battle leveraging our genetics, immunology and antibody expertise to do so. As previously announced, we're harnessing the molecular epidemiology work done by our deCODE subsidiary and working with our partners at Adaptive Biotechnologies to develop an antibody to prevent or treat COVID-19. If we're successful, our industry-leading manufacturing capabilities will play an important role in helping us meet the needs of patients. In addition, based on its mechanism of action, Otezla might help prevent the respiratory distress seen in late-stage COVID patients. As Dave Reese will explain in a moment, we'll be exploring this question in clinical trials imminently. And we've long prioritized being a good citizen within the health care ecosystem and within the communities where we live and work -- by COVID-19 has been devastating for many. While we certainly have been impacted by the pandemic at Amgen, we recognize that we're in a fortunate position and we're committed to doing our part to help during this time of need. Toward that end, the Amgen Foundation is supporting COVID-19 in a variety of ways with a focus on communities where we have a significant presence. To give you just one example, we donated testing equipment in Ventura County, our home county that effectively has doubled the testing capacity for COVID-19 here. Looking forward, we're confident in the future. We were in a strong position heading into the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect to stay strong as we come through the other side of this. We remain focused on delivering sustained long-term growth and we're confident in our outlook for that. As I've already noted, we have a number of important innovative medicines advancing our pipeline and the key programs remain on track from a timing perspective. Our integration of Otezla has been seamless. In Japan, we have now successfully completed the integration of our Astellas partnership. And we're already well advanced and collaborating effectively with our colleagues at Beijing and China. All this gives me confidence that we're executing effectively around the world despite the challenges of COVID-19. Finally, -- a fact that will enable us to continue our capital allocation principles, which to remind you are to invest in innovation internally and externally while returning significant capital to our shareholders. Though the pandemic is still very fluid and to be sure the first few weeks of April have clearly shown some signs of disruption, the combination of our results from the first quarter and our expectation of an improving outlook for global health care activity give us confidence that the guidance we provided earlier in the year still incorporates the likely range of outcomes for our business in 2020. Peter will give you more color on this shortly. Amgen's strength has always come from its people. Like me they believe in the power of science to make a difference in the world. We often talk about this being the biocentury, the golden age of innovation for biology. We may have met our challenge of the century in SARS-COVID-2, but I hope however bleak this pandemic may seem at times, that all of you share our optimism, this virus will ultimately yield to the relentless efforts of the biopharmaceutical industry, we're rustle it to ground. I'm proud of the team at Amgen for coming together to support each other and all those we serve during such a challenging time. I'm proud also of the work we are doing with our industry colleagues to tackle the COVID-19 challenge. With that, let me turn over to Dave Reese, who will provide a pipeline update. Dave?\nDave Reese: Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. In light of the evolving COVID-19 epidemic, the structure of today's R&D update will differ from my usual approach. Some of the first quarter highlights can be found within our press release and accompanying presentation and, of course, I'll be happy to address questions on any other aspects of our pipeline following our general comments. I don't have to tell you that we're in the midst of the biggest public health crisis of our lifetimes, which presents unprecedented challenges in patient care and clinical development. Therefore, today my comments will focus primarily on our R&D operations and clinical trial execution in the current environment, where our first principle is to ensure the safety and well-being of patients and health care providers taking part in our clinical trials. With respect to key late-stage trials that are scheduled to read out this year, we have been working closely with our collaborators at AstraZeneca and Cytokinetics on the execution of our pivotal studies for tezepelumab and omecamtiv mecarbil respectively, both of which have completed enrollment. We currently do not expect any significant delays and continue to expect completion of these studies this year. We believe we will have high-quality data from both of these trials. This is also the case with our potentially pivotal Phase II monotherapy study for AMG 510, now known as sotorasib in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, which is also fully enrolled. As I mentioned last quarter, we will be collecting at least six months of response data in these patients and continue to expect these results later this year. I would note that the Phase III trial of Otezla in mild to moderate psoriasis also remains on track and we expect data from that study in the coming weeks. As previously disclosed, we have temporarily paused enrollment in clinical trials, where there is uncertainty around the ability of sites to ensure subject safety or data integrity. Patients already enrolled in our studies continue to receive study drug and we remain focused on supporting our clinical investigators to ensure appropriate care of these patients in a safe manner consistent with clinical site and agency guidelines. We're actively working with regulators and implemented study procedures as appropriate that are consistent with the recent FDA guidelines, including remote monitoring, virtual follow-up, alternative locations for assessment and home delivery of investigational product. We continue to make decisions study-by-study and site-by-site to minimize risk to the patients and facilities and to maintain trial integrity. For example, enrollment continues in certain studies where there is the potential for a significant benefit in a serious life-threatening conditions and where site resources allow new patients to be safely enrolled and closely monitored. Such trials include, but certainly not limited to our HL -- half-life extended BiTE programs targeting BCMA and to L3 and PSMA and we look forward to sharing data from these studies later this year. In other studies such as our sotorasib Phase I combination study with Keytruda and the Phase III confirmatory study where we have paused enrollment to ensure patient safety, time lines may be impacted and I'll provide updates as the situation develops and we gain more clarity. There is ongoing interest from investigators to provide their patients' access to investigational therapies, with potential for significant benefit and we are working to continue to study start-up activities for sotorasib and across our entire portfolio to allow rapid site activation. We look forward to resuming enrollment in pod studies and initiating subject to enrollment in new studies over the coming weeks and months, as soon as it is safe and feasible to do so. As we look forward to this year's clinical study readouts, we will be working with representatives of medical conferences and journals to ensure continued dissemination of important data to the medical community in a peer-reviewed environment, as we anticipate that many congresses will be virtual through the end of 2020. In any case, we have provided -- we are committed to providing data updates in a timely manner. We're also continuing to prioritize programs across our preclinical and clinical portfolios as you might expect. For instance based on the progress of our half-life extended BiTE molecules, we have stopped development of the first generation continuous infusion PSMA and BCMA BiTE programs. In research essential work has continued and we are begging to ramp laboratory activities across the organization as the situation facedly permit in various geographies. I\u2019m also please to report that our BeiGene collaboration is on track, and this quarter we began to transition certain functional activities to BeiGene including non-promotional activities through in-line products and some local regulatory responsibilities in China. I\u2019d like to close by saying the few words about how we\u2019re leveraging our expertise and therapeutic antibody development and immunology in the fight against COVID-19. Our recently announced collaboration with Adaptive Biotechnologies to identifying neutralizing antibodies to the coronavirus from the public COVID-19 patient is now actively under way. We view Adaptive as a world-class expertise in the mean profiling, combined with Amgen expertise in immunology and antibody engineering and manufacturing as a unique opportunity to contribute to what an unprecedented industry response to this pandemic. We are working intently to identify the highest quality therapeutic candidates as fast as we can and we'll take advantage of frequent interactions offered by regulatory authorities. In our view, there will likely be more than one generation of antibody therapeutics and our aim is to develop the highest possible quality candidates. In addition to our efforts to develop a therapeutic antibody, we have also been engaged in discussions with multiple groups conducting platform trials in COVID-19 and anticipate that Otezla will enter the clinic in the coming weeks to be investigated as a potential immunomodulatory treatment in adult patients with the disease. Finally, we are contributing actively to collaborative efforts to advance therapeutics for COVID-19, including ACTIV, the public-private partnership with the NIH. I want to close by acknowledging our staff, are working tirelessly and selflessly under these challenging circumstances to deliver for our patients. Their commitment and execution have been exemplary and I can't thank them enough. I'd now like to turn things over to Murdo Gordon.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We started the year with strong volume-driven growth of 15% on a global basis with 10% in the U.S. and 32% ex-U.S. Growth was generated broadly across our portfolio of newer products more than offsetting declines in our mature brands. Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, I want to start by sharing our views on how disruptions in the global health care system may impact our business, and then I'll walk through what we're seeing at the product level and what actions we are taking. Like others in our sector, we're seeing varying degrees of impact from COVID-19 across our portfolio as physician-patient interactions are interrupted. These reduced interactions have led to some delays in diagnosis and treatment, which in turn reduces new patient starts. Data from IQVIA suggests that patient office visits have declined by over 50%, although some of this is being offset by telemedicine and telehealth services. Data also show that some patients refilled prescriptions early and that there was a modest benefit of approximately $100 million from inventory in the quarter. Finally, increased utilization of patient affordability programs and changes in segment mix due to increased U.S. unemployment could negatively impact U.S. net prices. Treatments like Prolia that require in office administration by a health care provider have been negatively impacted. On the other hand, the product like Otezla may benefit given that it provides a convenient oral option for patients compared with injectable or IV biologics, some of which require monitoring. Despite this disruption, our teams are responding to customer needs via remote interactions. We're identifying innovative solutions to help patients and we're supplying products reliably and consistently. Now let me review some product details beginning with Prolia on Slide 12. Prolia grew 10% year-over-year from higher volume. Strong demand growth in January and February was consistent with prior years. In March, we began to see a negative impact on Prolia in office injections and have since observed a substantial step down in utilization versus prior years. In more recent weeks, we're beginning to see signs of stabilization and we'll be able to provide more clarity on this when we report our Q2 results in July. The importance of treating osteoporosis in patients who are at high-risk of fractures is critical. Our teams are working to address continuity of care issues and exploring novel solutions such as alternate sites of care, mobile nurse-administered injections, prescription fills at specialty and retail pharmacies. We're also working with policymakers and advocacy organizations to address treatment challenges in this environment. Moving to Evenity, which launched in Japan and the U.S. in the first half of 2019. Evenity posted $100 million in sales during the first quarter, driven by continued uptick. In Japan, which represents roughly two-thirds of Evenity sales, we've attained shares similar to those established anabolic therapies. In the U.S., we saw an acceleration in demand trends with improvements in persistence in Q1 as clinics gained more experience. As patients complete their one year cycle of therapy with Evenity, we will work with healthcare providers to help transition these patients to Prolia. Evenity and Prolia are a complementary set of options to address the 9 million fractures that occur worldwide in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients and our teams are focused on ensuring these patients are not compromised during this pandemic. Moving to Repatha. We're off to a strong start in 2020. Our efforts over the past 18 months to improve access and affordability have yielded strong results as Q1 sales grew by 62% year-over-year, driven by 98% volume growth versus the same period last year. New-to-brand prescriptions in the U.S. steadily improved in Q1, growing 51% year-over-year and we held 80% market share exiting the quarter. As we appreciate in our last earnings call, Part D contracting to improve access and affordability resulted in a step down in Repatha's net selling price in Q1. We expect net selling price to be relatively stable for the remainder of the year. On to Aimovig on Slide 15. On a year-over-year basis, net sales grew 20% with underlying volume growth of 46%. Aimovig remains the market leader with 48% total prescription share. To date, almost 330,000 patients have been prescribed Aimovig by more than 33,000 prescribers. With the recent addition to CVS National Preferred Formulary, we now have access to 93% of covered lives, which led to a 19% growth quarter-over-quarter in new-to-brand prescriptions. Net price was sequentially lower due to expanded access with CVS and higher co-pay utilization that occurs each year in the first quarter. These factors were partially offset by the proportion of paid prescriptions increasing to almost 90%, up from 81% in Q4 of 2019. Next to our inflammation portfolio starting with Otezla. Integration has been seamless evidenced by 23% year-over-year growth driven by volume. These results coupled with planned label expansion give us confidence in our ability to realize the full global potential of Otezla, as an affordable option with a very well-defined efficacy and safety profile. In the current COVID environment Otezla provides a convenient oral option for patients. It's conducive to telemedicine and does not require lab monitoring. Moving to Enbrel. Sales were $1.2 billion in Q1 and included a $70 million year-over-year benefit from favorable changes in accounting estimates related to sales deductions. Consistent with prior trends, prescription volumes declined 5% year-over-year. We continue to expect a limited benefit from net selling price in 2020 versus 2019. In this environment, we're supporting Enbrel's strong continuing base of patients in maintaining their course of therapy through disruptions and out-of-pocket cost barriers. As you know, Enbrel has been on the market for over 20 years and does not require routine lab monitoring. Now to slide 18. Another contributor to our inflammation franchise is Amgevita, which for three consecutive quarters as the number one adalimumab Biosimilar in Europe recording $86 million of sales in Q1. Switching to our hematology and oncology business, our innovative portfolio of six brands collectively totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter growing by 11% year-over-year. Certain products like XGEVA may be impacted in the current environment due to disruptions in physician-patient interactions. Although others including Neulasta Onpro and our oncology biosimilars MVASI and KANJINTI provide greater value. Let me highlight some of our larger products. KYPROLIS grew 14% year-over-year led by a 21% increase in U.S. sales, which was driven by expanded use in second and third-line multiple myeloma. Neulasta declined 40% year-over-year recall that Q1 of 2019 benefited from a $98 million BARDA order, which did not repeat this quarter. OnPro continues to be the preferred choice and has held quarter-over-quarter share at 54% despite facing an additional competitor. The revised NCCN guidelines recommend increased use of G-CSFs to minimize the risk of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients. Onpro provides a unique value proposition, particularly, now as patients can receive their G-CSF treatment without having to return to their site of care. Our two oncology biosimilars MVASI and KANJINTI generated $234 million in sales globally in the first quarter. In the U.S., they sold $108 million and $96 million respectively with market shares exiting Q1 at or above 27%. We continue to see encouraging adoption rates in clinics with hospital adoption accelerating. These biosimilars are increasingly valuable given the cost savings that they provide. Switching to nephrology, starting on slide 24. Given the serious nature of end-stage renal disease patients require dialysis treatments three days per week. Therefore, we're not seeing a meaningful impact on the use of Amgen medications in these patients that would attribute to COVID-19. In Q1 EPOGEN sales declined 29% primarily due to lower net selling price from our contractual commitment with DaVita and approximately $20 million of unfavorable changes in accounting estimates. Sensipar sales declined 42% year-over-year due to the impact of generic competition. As a reminder, supplemental patent protection certificates for cinacalcet have now expired in major EU markets, which could result in a significant decline in ex-U.S. sales in 2020. Parsabiv grew by 39% year-over-year in the first quarter. Independent and midsize dialysis providers already utilize Parsabiv for a majority of their calcimimetic patients. While FMC and DaVita continue to increase adoption. In summary, I'm truly inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees who are helping patients and health care providers in this unprecedented time. And with that I'd like to turn over to Peter.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing our results and guidance, I would like to take a moment to build on Bob's comments regarding the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and provide additional insights into how we are responding to and navigating through the associated macroeconomic challenges. First, we confront these challenges from a position of strength. Our fundamentals are strong with over $8 billion of cash and investments and a business that generated $2 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter we are in a strong financial -- remain committed to our capital allocation principles shown on slide 28, which start with investing in internal innovation. We will patiently evaluate external business development opportunities that clear our hurdle rate and are consistent with our areas of therapeutic focus. Our capital expenditures remain a high priority including our industry-leading environmentally friendly next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Rhode Island. We will continue to return capital to our shareholders. Our capital allocation principles will continue to build on our efficient capital structure which results in an optimal weighted average cost of capital. Now I will briefly walk through our first quarter financial results before discussing our 2020 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 29 of the slide deck. The first quarter marked another period of solid performance as we grew volumes 15% increased investments in the business and delivered 17% year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth. Q1 revenues at $6.2 billion increased 11% year-over-year. In the quarter we saw worldwide product sales increased 12% to $5.9 billion as our portfolio transitioned with strong growth from our newer products outpacing declines in our mature products. Now on to the rest of the P&L. Total operating expense for the quarter increased 7% year-over-year. For the full year, we now expect total operating expenses to grow in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year on an absolute basis. On a non-GAAP basis cost of sales as a percent of product sales decreased by 1.6 percentage points to 13.1%, driven primarily by lower manufacturing costs partially offset by an increase in milestone expense. For the full year we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be generally consistent with 2019. Research and development expenses of $927 million were 8% higher due to higher spending on Otezla and AMG 510, partially offset by cost recoveries from our collaboration with BeiGene. For the full year we also expect R&D spend on an absolute basis to increase as we invest in our innovative pipeline and new Otezla indications. With these increases partially offset by R&D recoveries received from our BeiGene collaboration. SG&A expenses increased 12% -- Otezla. And for the full year we continue to expect SG&A spend to increase primarily due to Otezla spend. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating income at $3.2 billion increased 15% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 53.9% for the quarter compared to 52.4% in Q1 of 2019. Other income and expenses were a net $335 million expense in Q1. This is unfavorable by $177 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year change was due to lower interest income on cash balances, as well as market fluctuations of publicly traded securities held in our venture portfolio. We anticipate non-GAAP other income and expense to be a net expense toward the upper end of the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion range, we previously provided. Recall that we will begin recording under the equity method of accounting our share of BeiGene's profit or loss beginning in Q2. The non-GAAP tax rate decreased 1.8 percentage points versus Q1, 2019 to 12.8%. Non-GAAP net income was $2.5 million -- a 17% year-over-year for the first quarter supported by a 5% reduction in share count versus Q1 2019. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 30, during Q1 2020, we generated strong cash flow reflecting a diversified portfolio of products coupled with an industry-leading cost structure. Free cash flow was $2.0 billion in Q1, 2020 versus $1.7 billion in Q1 2019. In Q1 2020, we returned a total of $1.9 billion to shareholders through dividend payments totaling over $900 million and over $900 million to repurchase 4.3 million shares at an average price of $219 per share. For the remainder of the year, we plan to maintain our quarterly dividend of $1.60 per share, and we'll execute opportunistic share repurchases that will result in an amount at the lower end of our previous guidance of $3 billion to $5 billion for 2020. Cash and investments totaled $8 billion at the end of Q1 2020, a decrease of $18.3 billion from the end of Q1 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by the Otezla and BeiGene transactions, cash returned to shareholders in the form of share repurchases -- as well as net debt repayments, partially offset by free cash flow generated during the period. Additionally, I note in Q2 2020, we plan to make $1.75 billion payment in debt payment, debt maturity payments. We issued $5 billion of long-term debt in February in order to take advantage of market conditions for refinancing our long-term debt maturities in 2020 and partially those in 2021. We will continue to be opportunistic with strong access to capital markets. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter totaled $31.8 billion, and carries a weighted average interest rate of 3.7 -- years. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2020 starting on slide 31. Our guidance provided in January contemplated a broad range of outcomes. Due to the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 impact, we expect some degree of uncertainty in quarterly revenue and earnings over the year. We currently expect that we will see the greatest impact later in Q2 with stabilization and then partial recovery occurring during the second half of the year. And now turning to slide 32, we are reaffirming our guidance with a revenue range of $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion and a non-GAAP EPS range of $14.85 to $15.6. We will be monitoring the business as the dynamics underlying these assumptions evolve across Q2 and we'll review our latest perspectives with you at our next earnings call. We are now guiding to capital expenditures of $600 million versus our prior guidance of $700 million, reflecting a change in the timing of spend, rather than a change to our investment plans. Additionally, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 13.5% to 14.5% for the full year. This concludes the financial update. I've been with Amgen, a little over six months, and it's the privilege to serve patients every day here by supporting and enabling the Amgen difference. And each day during this COVID-19 disruption, I'm reminded that innovation is the miracle drug. With that, I'll turn it back over to Bob for some closing remarks.\nBob Bradway: Well, before my closing remarks, we'll go to Q&A. So let's have Ian, let's open it up for Q&A, remind our callers of the process that we'll follow. Thanks.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Jay, your line is open.\nJay Olson: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. And thank you for the work that you're doing to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. I wanted to ask about the non-GAAP operating margin. It ticked up nicely in the first quarter. And I noticed that, you lowered the OpEx expected growth rate slightly. So, I was wondering, how do you expect the operating margin to evolve over the course of 2020? And do you expect that higher operating margin to be sustainable in a post COVID-19 world? Thank you.\nPeter Griffith: Jay, thank you for the question, it\u2019s a good. As I indicated, we do project that for the full year, our total OpEx will grow in the high single-digit percentage range. We are confident in our cost structure and our productivity work here at Amgen. So I think our operating margin speaks for itself and we expect it to be an industry-leading cost margin going forward in 2020. And of course, we don't give any guidance beyond 2020 on the margin.\nBob Bradway: Just to state the obvious Jay we would have liked to have spent more in Q1 but we were getting a little bit disrupted there as you know at the end of the quarter. So we'll see what it's like for the remaining three quarters of the year.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is open.\nTim Anderson: Thank you very much. My question is something that's probably a thorn in your side which is the ongoing Enbrel patent challenge and that's one of the bigger events for the company in 2020 the appeals court ruling. And I'm sure you're confident in your positioning on how that will play out. But these things are never certain. So, I'm wondering if you can just help us describe what Plan B would be in the event that Sandoz actually prevails as your largest product I'm guessing you had some sort of contingency plan in place. I know it's a low probability event, but any perspective would be helpful?\nDave Reese: Tim, we're not going to go into details on that. Obviously, we continue to feel confident in the intellectual property around Enbrel. So, let's leave it at that for now. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Chris, your line is open.\nChris Raymond: Hey thanks. So, I know you guys have talked about the collaboration with Adaptive in your antibody program. But just -- there are a lot of folks I think that are working on similar sort of purpose-built products Regeneron and peer and others. I wonder if you could give a little bit more color on what differentiates what you guys are doing. And maybe also a little more color on time lines in terms of being in the clinic et cetera? Thanks.\nDave Reese: Thanks Chris, Dave Reese here. I'll take that question. Yes. So, as you know there are a number of efforts going forward to develop therapeutic antibodies. And what we're trying to do I think that is potentially unique here is number one combine Adaptive's capabilities in immuno-profiling with our immunology and particularly our genetics work based out of deCODE. Our goal also is to really identify a very high-quality therapeutic candidate and it's my belief that there may well be more than one generation of antibody therapeutics entering the clinic. So, as we think about this we want to balance speed of development which of course is important with generating the highest quality candidate. And as work progresses we are up and running in the laboratory but we will provide guidance as -- in terms of clinical timelines as that work unfolds. But that collaboration is actively proceeding right now.\nBob Bradway: Chris maybe I could just add a comment about manufacturing. Obviously, -- a lot of protein. We have great expertise in manufacturing at scale. And we think one of the things we can bring to the party here is our ability to supply a vast number of patients with our antibody.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Geoff your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: Afternoon guys. Thanks for the question. I guess one for Bob. When you had the first full quarter of Otezla in the mix and now it looks like you have a pretty competitive growth profile in the industry from a top and bottom-line perspective? So, I know that's obviously fully expected but does either the growth acceleration or the volatility from COVID effect, your attitude towards BD, I'm just thinking about maybe a step-up in the number of deals or maybe increasing appetite for larger ones in this environment? Thank you.\nDave Reese: I think the environment is pretty fluid still Geoff. So, I wouldn't try to -- I'm not sure I'd like to declare an answer to your question at the moment. But other than to reiterate that -- and we think we're in a strong position. We've talked about our balance sheet we talked about our desire to allocate capital to our internal innovation as well as the external innovation. And as you know we're pretty focused on our strategy and we'll look to see whether there are things externally that can help us strengthen our chosen areas. But maybe the other thing I would add just as a way to reiterate my appreciation of my Amgen colleagues is we had three very significant and successful integrations in the first quarter. So, it was a priority for us as a company to get off to a good start with Otezla and with BeiGene and with our Japan transaction and we really feel we've done that over the first four months of the year. So, I feel good about that.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies. Michael, your line is open. \nMichael Yee: Thank you for the question. And congrats on all the progress and appreciate the color during this tough time. My question was for David. On AMG 510 of course you didn't mention you have an updated at ASCO. Can you just remind us how to think about colorectal cancer as a monotherapy? I guess what was new there? And then excluding lung and colorectal there's an update there. Can you just remind us what would be the relevance there? And then the timing on the combos which is -- which are not at ASCO what to think about there and timing? I appreciate the update.\nDave Reese : Thanks, Michael. Yes. A series of questions regarding AMG 510, we're continuing to enroll monotherapy patients with colorectal cancer. And as I've indicated before, we're going to look at those data, I would say, over the coming few months to determine whether we feel there's an appropriate monotherapy path forward in colorectal cancer or whether combination therapy is most appropriate. With respect to other non-lung cancer, non-colorectal cancer indications, we are -- there are other malignancies such as a small percentage of pancreatic cancer, appendiceal cancer and endometrial cancer and we will be able to provide updates on ASCO on some of those tumors and response data. And then finally in terms of the combination therapy trial these are some of the trials that we -- some of them we paused because they were either just initiating or had just initiated. We're getting ready to ramp back up. So I would expect first data with the earliest later this year perhaps the very first part of next year on those. But we're confident that we're not experiencing significant disruptions across the program in totality and we're happy -- we're quite happy actually with its progress.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Terence, your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a follow-up for me on AMG 510. I know you guys have guided to the Phase 2 lung cancer data in the middle part of this year. Just wondering now as we're closer to the data if you could share any perspective on what you view as kind of the efficacy bar here? Is Cyramza the right bar? Or should we think about higher efficacy here given it's a targeted drug? Thank you.\nDave Reese: Thanks Terence. This is Dave. Yes. In terms of the timing of the date, I'd point out that what we've indicated is that we want at least six months of response data on all patients. And given that the last patients were enrolled towards the end of the last year that it takes a month or two typically for responses to develop. You can see that that pushes it into the second half of the year in terms of when we expect the data readout. We're absolutely on track and we're not experiencing any I would say substantial hiccups in the Phase 2 monotherapy study. We do want robust duration of response and progression-free survival data as part of that package. And I think those endpoints along with response rate to address the second part of your question will be an important part of the package in this Phase 2 monotherapy study.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Yaron Werber with Cowen. Yaron, your line is open.\nYaron Werber: Great. Thanks for taking my question as well. I have an AMG 510 question as well. The Phase 3, David the study obviously is fairly sizable. It's 650 patients head-to-head against docetaxel. And I think it kind of drew some questions as to why was that docetaxel really used as the control and not Cyramza in combo? And maybe give us a little bit of sense why is this study so sizable? Is it -- should we read into your expectation on OR? Or is it really about trying to powered for survival? Thank you.\nDave Reese: Yes. Thanks Yaron for the question. In terms of the comparator arm this was -- this choice was based on what remains -- one of the standards of care docetaxel around the world the discussions with regulatory authorities and investigators and we feel that that's an appropriate comparator here. The sample size calculations were driven by the desire to be able to robustly test for overall survival. And so the second part of your statement there is correct. If this was powered on overall survival.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew, your line is open.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a question around stocking dynamics for the quarter. I know you called out a couple of one-time items and what you thought was the benefit from COVID. Could you maybe just put that in context? Obviously, normally in the first quarter you see a lot of destocking across the product lines, did you not see that typical destocking? And so could that be also a potential benefit that's going to come out through the year? Maybe you could just comment on that? Thanks.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Hi, Matthew, it's Murdo. Yes, as I mentioned, we saw about $100 million of stocking inventory build I should say in the first quarter which happened across markets. The only other element that I would maybe compare in contrast to some other companies that are reporting, our business given that it's predominantly specialty biologics, I know a fair amount of physician administration products didn't necessarily have the same extent of early prescription fills and patient 90-day fills, that would have been an additional pull forward for some other companies. As they reported they blended that dynamic with end customer and wholesale inventory build. So the $100 million refers to end customer and wholesaler inventory, specifically. On products like Otezla, we may have had some pull forward from some early fills and maybe 90-day scripts. And we'll just have to wait and see how that works through in Q2.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with SunTrust Robinson. Robyn, your line is open.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Hi, guys. Thank you so much and great work on running the business in this time. So can I take a broader step back question? I know we've been focused on a lot of specific questions. You guys have had a lot of experience then this financial crisis and people switching from a commercial payer to a Medicare or government payer. Help us think about how you managed that? How you get people quickly to switch? And how you manage the impact of that? And then secondly for telemedicine, how comfortable are prescribers writing to Evenity? And how do you think that telemedicine really impacts your business? I know that's a new one for you? Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Robyn before Murdo answers, let me make sure we heard that you said how comfortable are we writing or are doctors writing? Did you say Evenity prescriptions in telemedicine?\nRobyn Karnauskas: Yes. Yes. Like telemedicine aspect is new for all of us. We're trying to understand how that will impact businesses. And obviously you have many products that could be prescribed of telemedicine. So those are two aspects it would be great.\nMurdo Gordon: Right. Yes Robyn, if I could just clarify further on the first part of your question, is your question related to opening up government access like we've done over the last little while? Or is it the transition of people potentially from commercial to a government benefit because of COVID-19?\nRobyn Karnauskas: It's really transition. So what a lot of people are asking is what -- if we transition given a potential a lot of people at work they're going to transition to a government-based plan, you've been through this before. So you're one of the few companies that can probably tell us how you manage that? And how you'll run the business and you think the impact might be?\nMurdo Gordon: Okay. No that's helpful. Thanks for the clarification. So let's start with that topic. On the -- first off, our overall Medicaid portion of our business right now is quite low. It's less than 10% of our total revenue. And the majority of our products beyond that are reimbursed through Medicare Part B and D with or about 50% of our total business being reimbursed through commercial. So it's that commercial piece as you rightly point out that is likely or a portion of that is likely to transition to a government channel. Now the thing that's harder to predict is at what rate? So as people who become unemployed and an important distinction is furloughed, they retain benefits for a period of time if they opt into Cobra and furloughed employees are often still on their self-insured company employee plan sponsored plan. So there's a time lag that's going to occur before people transition to either a state exchange or a Medicaid benefit. So I think the impact could be a delayed one, more like towards the end of this year and into 2021. And of course, trying to pin down the actual numbers of Americans that are going to end up in an unemployment benefits is hard to peg right now. So those are the two things. It's the total bolus and the rate of change. I've heard some commentary and read some things that would appear to indicate people expect it earlier. Our perspective is that some of these patients and people will transition over time and it will more likely be a delay to an effect into 2021. On telemedicine, I would just say that there's a variety of maturity of high telemedicine is used by therapeutic area. If you think about mental health and I would argue even in neurology, telemedicine is already used quite extensively even pre-COVID. And I would say that the uptake for telemedicine and evaluating someone like a migraine patient is going to be relatively straightforward as it would be perhaps for a dermatology patient. So in the case of neurology, migraine would be Aimovig and then for dermatology it would be Otezla. You mentioned Evenity, of course Evenity is primarily prescribed post fracture, so patients are likely to be in a clinic or a hospital setting. And so the ability for the physician to evaluate the patient and prescribe Evenity is probably pretty straightforward related to that acute event. But we're watching it closely. We actually -- because of Aimovig and other brands that -- where telemedicine was already being used fairly extensively, we had some experience here that goes back over a year and we've been scaling our experience there now. So I think Amgen will be on the front foot when it comes to building out our capabilities in that area.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Ronny, your line is open.\nRonny Gal: Hi. Good evening. And let me add my thanks to Dave and for all the work you're doing on COVID-19. Two, if I may. First for David, the PD-1 and you expanded that work a couple of times you started about 40 patients now you have about 270 patients. What -- given that you're originally a little bit skeptical at Amgen about PD-1, is this just looking for ways to leverage the same protocol to do more? And what does that mean about your ability to bring that product to market and timing? And then to Murdo, you've done fabulously well with about -- as I -- by my count you did about $320 million this quarter. Now, we have Pfizer coming in the United States, they've taken a bit more extra price decreases what is that -- what's your expectation for the rest of the year? And if you can also mention what you guys are doing with your REMICADE biosimilar kind of an interesting product?\nDave Reese: Well thanks, Ronnie. This is Dave. I'll start with the PD-1 question for AMG 404. We continue to develop AMG 404 primarily as a combination partner for our pipeline agents. This is a Phase I umbrella study and we added cohorts to study additional indications where the tumors in question have well described PD-1 sensitivity that will limit the need we hope for single-arm data in future trials and ultimately we think we'll probably need on the order of 200 give or take monotherapy patients to support the standard safety package for AMG 404. So all of that put together expansion of the Phase I trial allowed us an efficient way to generate appropriate data.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. And when it comes to our biosimilars business, we are pleased with the run rate of over $300 million in the quarter. I would say -- I would attribute our success first and foremost to Amgen's reputation as a high-quality biologics manufacturer. I think that is something that differentiates us and is perceived well by our customers. Our experience in Europe was a very positive one. We applied those lessons learned to our U.S. launches of the two oncology biosimilars. And I think it shows you that the biosimilars market is functioning well in the United States. I would also say that the biosimilar business model for Amgen is very much integrated with our innovative products. So the same people who are defending Neulasta, the same account managers who are defending Neulasta day-in day-out and making sure that the benefit of Onpro is understood by our customers are the same people who are establishing the uptake curve for MVASI and KANJINTI. So those account relationships that we've cultivated over many, many years in oncology have been extremely valuable. And our relationships at the payer-provider level, I think have helped us extend that trajectory nicely. I would also say that our patient services are exemplary and we have the very same patient services that we have for a product like KYPROLIS or XGEVA we apply to our biosimilars business as well. And then you mentioned, I think Avsola, which is our Remicade biosimilar. We do intend to launch that this year. And that product will help strengthen what is already a strong immunotherapy portfolio for us and will help us broaden out that customer perspective. And again that product will be integrated with our innovative autoimmune portfolio.\nBob Bradway: Ian, let's take the next question. And it's getting -- and as it's getting late on the East Coast, if I can just ask everybody to please limit yourself to one question. Ian, let's go on with the next one.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next one is from the line of Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse. Evan, your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. And, kind of, a follow-up from what you were just talking about Murdo. So how has the pandemic impact of the uptick of biosimilars? Have you seen an acceleration in adoption to save cost? Or if centers really delayed uptake given potentially overwhelmed systems? Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: So it's a bit early to tell. So take my comments with a very few weeks of experience here. I would say so far we have not seen a negative effect on our uptake. If anything we're seeing a steepening of our uptake curve. The one thing I will say that we haven't yet assessed that could happen is the total cycles of bevacizumab, or the total cycles of trastuzumab could be impacted. So from a share of molecule perspective, we're very pleased what we're watching is the total number of infusions of each of the molecules going forward.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Dane Leone with Raymond James. Dane?\nDane Leone: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions and the update. I just want to ask a business development question and I'll just keep it to one here. When you're thinking about ramping up your efforts of KRAS, obviously, the initial data set is great for how you're thinking about the target oncology space. Thinking about that and then also thinking about the bolt-on with the Otezla that you did to start broadening out how you think about immunology, where do you want to go in those respective areas from a biz dev perspective? I mean, there's a lot of room you guys still have to work with especially in target oncology. Should we be expecting more bolt-on acquisitions within these two areas over the course of 2020?\nBob Bradway: I don't know about the course of 2020, Dane. We're -- those are two areas of keen interest for us for sure, oncology and inflammation. And we will continue to look for attractive innovative assets that we think we can add value to. The trick is always to be able to license or acquire molecules at a price that leaves return for our shareholders and we're pretty comprehensive in the way we assess the marketplace and we'll continue to keep an active watch and see whether there are some things that might be a good fit.\nDane Leone: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Umer, your line is open. Umer, you may have us on mute. And moving on to the next question is from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Alethia, your line is open.\nAlethia Young: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I guess, I just wanted to know when you think about the Otezla, some of the benefits you are seeing with the orals maybe in the might be COVID, do you think that might be a sustainable turn? Thanks\nMurdo Gordon: Alethia, I just want to clarify, its Murdo here. You are talking about clinical trial activity with those as well.\nAlethia Young: No, not that activity.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes, we\u2019re -- look we continue to watch the weekly trends. We\u2019re listening to what our customer are telling us and we definitely think that we\u2019ve got a little bit of buffer supporting Otezla right now because it is a convenient oral option. It's got great market excess coverage. It's affordable. We\u2019re -- obviously also we mentioned the end of last year that we were putting in additional primary care effort to broaden the promotional effort behind Otezla and I think that\u2019s also helping. So we\u2019re feeling good about it and I think it\u2019s the ideal kind of product or time like this where a lot of patients are concerned about visiting healthcare professional.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Geoffrey, your line is open.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. Follow up for Murdo, another question. You highlighted some of the softness that you\u2019re seeing in March and then continuing to April for some of the office injectables. Could you give us a sense of which product you think are most likely to be most significantly affected. I think you particularly highlighted the Prolia visits that might be down as much as 50% to those relative specialties. Is that what we should be expecting for Prolia in Q2?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes I think -- thank you, Geoff. I think what I mentioned was the patient visits were down 50%. Prolia were maybe not has impacted yet on Evenity or definitely the products that we\u2019re seeing most impact in our portfolio. If you think about the physician administered products for Amgen and three business, we have our business. We have our nephrology business. We have our oncology business. Bone is by far the business that is being impacted the most. Obviously, it\u2019s partly to do with the age and vulnerability of patients and we\u2019re spending a lot of time working on alternate sites of care and proving continuity of care, setting up mobile programs where nurses can visit patients homes and administer and we\u2019re working with the administration CMS policy, advocates to try and improve the buy-and-bill access to that home injection channel as well. Nephrology is holding up well. Obviously in renal disease these patients have to have their dialysis is life sustaining. So those volumes are holding up well. The providers there have been very good at collaborating and providing safe isolated sites of care for patients. And then oncology, it's down but not nearly as much as the bone. So that gives you a relative order of understanding of how we're seeing it.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory, your line is open.\nCory Kasimov: Great. Good evening guys. Thanks for taking my question. Given the importance of this growth portfolio to the overall business, I wanted to better understand the underlying dynamics for Aimovig. We look at it I mean despite the leading share position and an increase in paid prescriptions sales have seemingly fallen short of expectations for the last few quarters. Is this just a function of lower net price with the broader access? Or is there something else going on that we're all missing?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks Cory. Look, we're very pleased with Aimovig's share performance. And we did have to do quite a bit of work over the course of the year to get to that 90% paid level. And now we have 93% of covered lives. So we're pretty pleased about that basis. I think what we're counting on for growth going forward because we expect price to stabilize throughout the course of the balance of the year is we're coming on unlocking additional patient volume. We've got over four million potential CGRP patient candidates out there. Physicians tend to persist with older oral products and aren't yet adopting CGRP products at the rate that we think that they could and should be to help ease the suffering of chronic migraine sufferer. So that's where we're focused. We're focused on unlocking the future potential volume now that these products and particularly Aimovig has a very affordable access coverage in the market.\nOperator: And it appears that we have Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI back on. Umer, your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi. I just learned how to unmute myself. So thank you so much. David, one question for you, if I may. I think it will be very helpful for investors to understand if you're optimistic on the durability of response with KRAS monotherapy? And if you're starting to develop a view whether a MEK or a PD-1 as a better combination partner? Thank you so much. \nDave Reese: Thank you, Umer, for the question. Yes. I mean, I think duration of response is one of the critical questions and that's why I indicated that -- the Phase II trial I think is going to give us the definitive answer there. That will -- and we wish to have enough follow-up to very robustly address both duration of response and progression-free survival. In terms of the combinations, I think it's perhaps a little too early to pick favorites. We are looking at a number of combinations, which is typical for oncology programs. All of those are based on an underlying biologic rationale. And as I indicated, we'll be generating data in that program in combinations over the course of this year.\nOperator: And next we have a question from the line of Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim. Michael, your line is open.\nMichael Schmidt: Hi, guys. Good evening and thanks for taking my question. I had a high-level question on the biosimilar business, which has been going really well for Amgen. I'm just wondering, as we see sort of the biosimilar market mature longer-term and then as we see potentially more product launch within these markets, I guess, what is your view on the long-term price erosion relative to brand? And how should we think about a potential floor relative to the manufacturing and development costs in the biosimilar area? Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Michael. The one thing I mentioned earlier in response to the question of biosimilars was the Amgen experience in knowing how to make biologics at scale in a very efficient way. So we have really good margins on this business. And I think going by our experience in Europe, where I would argue that the price degradation has probably been faster than it will be in the U.S., even with multiple competitors, we've been able to compete effectively for volume and we've been able to retain a very profitable business there. We, obviously, don't have a lot of analogs in the U.S. to understand the rate of change, so I'm going to hold back from speculating on what the future will hold. But there are clear things here that the more competitors you have compressed in the early phase of a biosimilar launch path, the more likely there is to be some precipitous price erosion. We're fortunate that we were early in the U.S. with both MVASI and KANJINTI and able to establish a very strong foothold in the market. I'll also repeat it, I said it earlier, but I do think that the biosimilar market is alive and well in the U.S. and functioning as you would hope free markets would.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Carter, your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Thanks for fitting me in. I guess, maybe, just a bigger picture question around sort of the lasting impact of COVID. When you guys think around, either shift to manufacturing strategy, location, bigger picture questions on footprint and, I guess, as well as commercialization models, I guess, it's just a really kind of a bigger picture question when we return to normal, would that look different to sort of your infrastructure and business model, is how you have set it up historically? Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Yes. That's a really interesting question, Carter, and one that I think we'll get a lot of attention once things have settled down a little bit. It's still awfully fluid to be trying to predict how the experience of COVID-19 will affect our industry or our business model. But we'd be happy to engage with you on that topic at greater length, again, when the dust has settled a little bit. But fundamentally for us, our supply chain is in great shape. We, unlike some of our peers in the industry predominantly manufacture in the U.S. obviously -- even the people who work for us there are U.S. citizens and so we have the benefit that the vast majority nearly all of our manufacturing is done in the U.S. That supply chain questions a little bit less relevant for us and some of our industry peers. But I do think that this isn't going to be the last viral challenge that we face as a society and I think we'll all be trying to improve our business continuity planning and thinking when we come out of this to make sure that we're in a strong position as possible to avoid interruptions from events like this. But I think there will be a lot of learning across the whole economy, including the biotech economy. So we look forward to talking, you've got the right time.\nOperator: And next we have a question from the line of Mohit Bansal with Citi. Mohit, your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress. I have a quick question regarding your IL-2 mutant program. What is your level of excitement around this program? Seems like you have two fully enrolled trial at this point. Should we expect to see any data from this program later this year? Thank you.\nDave Reese: Thanks Mohit. Dave here. Yes, we remain keenly interested in AMG 592 IL-2 mutant, we're enrolling trials going forward and we'd expect data over the course of the year or perhaps early next year. Some of those trials we did temporarily pause because of the reluctance of investigators to start patients on new immunomodulatory agents in the course of the epidemic. But we remain quite interested in that program and we'll provide guidance as to when we're going to get data readout as we move forward.\nOperator: And next we have a question from the line of Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets. Kennen, your line is open.\nKennen MacKay: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe for Peter or Bob. Actually I'd love to hear Dr. Reese perspective. I was wondering where are you seeing the most opportunity for M&A and really where you're focused there? And Dave I had hoped to include you in that question really just to get your perspective on where some of the most interesting biology and chemistry is taking place now and what Bob have referred to so eloquently as the golden age of biotechnology? Thanks so much.\nBob Bradway: Well, Dave, since I have I talked a little bit about M&A business development already on the call, why don't we let you take a crack at this. So, what areas, what mechanisms are most intriguing to you and your R&D colleagues at the moment?\nDave Reese: Yes, I think it is a golden age and I would approach it from two perspectives. There are new platforms. And our Head of Research, she has published a very great article in nature a week or two ago. I'd encourage all of you to read about what we call an induced proximity platform. This is a new suite of technologies that we think can open up much of the undependable space, so that sort of business development remains of great interest to us. And then as we've said before, I think there's a ferment of activity across the therapeutic areas of great interest to us and that will continue to be a focus going forward.\nOperator: And next we have a question from the line of Salim Syed with Mizuho. Salim, your line is open.\nSalim Syed: Great. Thanks so much for that question guys. Bob maybe just one for you just a high level one. Given your discussions with folks in Washington, obviously the rhetoric in biotech and pharma, as well has been pretty negative over the last few years especially around drug pricing etcetera. And I'm wondering with given this COVID-19 has that changed the rhetoric at all in your view? And is there anything sustainably positive that can carry on post-COVID in terms of rhetoric coming out of Washington in your view? Thank you. \nBob Bradway: Well I think everybody recognizes that we're going to need science and innovation to lead us out of this challenge that we find ourselves in globally. So -- importance of innovation and a little bit of humility perhaps in all camps about how hard it is to have the right innovation available for the world at the right time. So the good news is that the government, innovators, academia everybody are working together at a speed and a scale that I've never seen in my career. So I think that's a good sign and hopefully we'd be able to look back on this one day and say that it works. We've got a special ecosystem in particular in this country. And hopefully, we'll be able to look back and say when we faced the biggest challenge of our lifetimes the industry came through and delivered what we needed. And if we're able to do that I think it inevitably will help remind everybody that we haven't generated all the innovation we need as a society. There are still lots of areas of unmet medical need. And again, the more we can do to address it the better. But the question of drug pricing is not going to go away but hopefully there'll be some respect for how profoundly important innovation is.\nArvind Sood: And let's take one last question if there's a quick one. After which I'll ask Bob to make some concluding comments.\nOperator: Very well. Our final question is from the line of Jim Birchenough with Wells Fargo Securities. Jim your line is open.\nNick Abbott: Good afternoon. It's Nick on for Jim. Thanks all very much for squeezing us in. You had mentioned earlier in your prepared comments about Otezla, the role of Otezla in COVID. Can you just elaborate on that? And is this in the acute setting? Or perhaps is there an opportunity for patients who have ongoing organ dysfunction after they leave hospital maybe due to inflammation?\nDave Reese: Well thanks James, this is Dave. Yes we think it's actually -- there will be utility in studying Otezla in a variety of settings ranging from for example hospitalized patients but those that are not yet in the ICU to attempt to prevent progression to more serious disease as well as those with more serious disease. And so again we're in active discussions or have committed to platform trials. The one real guiding principle we have here is that we want these to be rigorous studies to provide the highest quality answers.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Let me just wrap up recognizing that it's pushing on 7:00 on the East Coast. Again let me reiterate our appreciation for you joining the call. I hope what you take away from the call is that, we delivered a solid quarter one. We feel we're executing the business. Well our objective will be to remain an effective steward of the business through the short term. We want to be a leading corporate citizen through this challenging period as well and we will remain focused on delivering long-term growth by advancing innovation in those areas that you're familiar with at Amgen. So thank you all. Keep safe. Look forward to catching up with you on the next quarterly call.\nArvind Sood: Thanks everybody. Myself and the IR team will be around for some time. So feel free to reach out to us. Thanks again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you greatly for joining us for Amgen's First Quarter 2020 Financial Results Conference Call. This does conclude the call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. Before reviewing our results and guidance, I would like to take a moment to build on Bob's comments regarding the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and provide additional insights into how we are responding to and navigating through the associated macroeconomic challenges. First, we confront these challenges from a position of strength. Our fundamentals are strong with over $8 billion of cash and investments and a business that generated $2 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter we are in a strong financial -- remain committed to our capital allocation principles shown on slide 28, which start with investing in internal innovation. We will patiently evaluate external business development opportunities that clear our hurdle rate and are consistent with our areas of therapeutic focus. Our capital expenditures remain a high priority including our industry-leading environmentally friendly next-generation biomanufacturing facility in Rhode Island. We will continue to return capital to our shareholders. Our capital allocation principles will continue to build on our efficient capital structure which results in an optimal weighted average cost of capital. Now I will briefly walk through our first quarter financial results before discussing our 2020 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 29 of the slide deck. The first quarter marked another period of solid performance as we grew volumes 15% increased investments in the business and delivered 17% year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth. Q1 revenues at $6.2 billion increased 11% year-over-year. In the quarter we saw worldwide product sales increased 12% to $5.9 billion as our portfolio transitioned with strong growth from our newer products outpacing declines in our mature products. Now on to the rest of the P&L. Total operating expense for the quarter increased 7% year-over-year. For the full year, we now expect total operating expenses to grow in the high single-digit percentage range year-over-year on an absolute basis. On a non-GAAP basis cost of sales as a percent of product sales decreased by 1.6 percentage points to 13.1%, driven primarily by lower manufacturing costs partially offset by an increase in milestone expense. For the full year we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be generally consistent with 2019. Research and development expenses of $927 million were 8% higher due to higher spending on Otezla and AMG 510, partially offset by cost recoveries from our collaboration with BeiGene. For the full year we also expect R&D spend on an absolute basis to increase as we invest in our innovative pipeline and new Otezla indications. With these increases partially offset by R&D recoveries received from our BeiGene collaboration. SG&A expenses increased 12% -- Otezla. And for the full year we continue to expect SG&A spend to increase primarily due to Otezla spend. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating income at $3.2 billion increased 15% from prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 53.9% for the quarter compared to 52.4% in Q1 of 2019. Other income and expenses were a net $335 million expense in Q1. This is unfavorable by $177 million on a year-over-year basis. This year-over-year change was due to lower interest income on cash balances, as well as market fluctuations of publicly traded securities held in our venture portfolio. We anticipate non-GAAP other income and expense to be a net expense toward the upper end of the $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion range, we previously provided. Recall that we will begin recording under the equity method of accounting our share of BeiGene's profit or loss beginning in Q2. The non-GAAP tax rate decreased 1.8 percentage points versus Q1, 2019 to 12.8%. Non-GAAP net income was $2.5 million -- a 17% year-over-year for the first quarter supported by a 5% reduction in share count versus Q1 2019. Turning next to cash flow and the balance sheet on Slide 30, during Q1 2020, we generated strong cash flow reflecting a diversified portfolio of products coupled with an industry-leading cost structure. Free cash flow was $2.0 billion in Q1, 2020 versus $1.7 billion in Q1 2019. In Q1 2020, we returned a total of $1.9 billion to shareholders through dividend payments totaling over $900 million and over $900 million to repurchase 4.3 million shares at an average price of $219 per share. For the remainder of the year, we plan to maintain our quarterly dividend of $1.60 per share, and we'll execute opportunistic share repurchases that will result in an amount at the lower end of our previous guidance of $3 billion to $5 billion for 2020. Cash and investments totaled $8 billion at the end of Q1 2020, a decrease of $18.3 billion from the end of Q1 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by the Otezla and BeiGene transactions, cash returned to shareholders in the form of share repurchases -- as well as net debt repayments, partially offset by free cash flow generated during the period. Additionally, I note in Q2 2020, we plan to make $1.75 billion payment in debt payment, debt maturity payments. We issued $5 billion of long-term debt in February in order to take advantage of market conditions for refinancing our long-term debt maturities in 2020 and partially those in 2021. We will continue to be opportunistic with strong access to capital markets. Debt outstanding at the end of the quarter totaled $31.8 billion, and carries a weighted average interest rate of 3.7 -- years. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2020 starting on slide 31. Our guidance provided in January contemplated a broad range of outcomes. Due to the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 impact, we expect some degree of uncertainty in quarterly revenue and earnings over the year. We currently expect that we will see the greatest impact later in Q2 with stabilization and then partial recovery occurring during the second half of the year. And now turning to slide 32, we are reaffirming our guidance with a revenue range of $25.0 billion to $25.6 billion and a non-GAAP EPS range of $14.85 to $15.6. We will be monitoring the business as the dynamics underlying these assumptions evolve across Q2 and we'll review our latest perspectives with you at our next earnings call. We are now guiding to capital expenditures of $600 million versus our prior guidance of $700 million, reflecting a change in the timing of spend, rather than a change to our investment plans. Additionally, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 13.5% to 14.5% for the full year. This concludes the financial update. I've been with Amgen, a little over six months, and it's the privilege to serve patients every day here by supporting and enabling the Amgen difference. And each day during this COVID-19 disruption, I'm reminded that innovation is the miracle drug. With that, I'll turn it back over to Bob for some closing remarks. Jay, thank you for the question, it's a good. As I indicated, we do project that for the full year, our total OpEx will grow in the high single-digit percentage range. We are confident in our cost structure and our productivity work here at Amgen. So I think our operating margin speaks for itself and we expect it to be an industry-leading cost margin going forward in 2020. And of course, we don't give any guidance beyond 2020 on the margin."

            "name": "Dave Reese",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. In light of the evolving COVID-19 epidemic, the structure of today's R&D update will differ from my usual approach. Some of the first quarter highlights can be found within our press release and accompanying presentation and, of course, I'll be happy to address questions on any other aspects of our pipeline following our general comments. I don't have to tell you that we're in the midst of the biggest public health crisis of our lifetimes, which presents unprecedented challenges in patient care and clinical development. Therefore, today my comments will focus primarily on our R&D operations and clinical trial execution in the current environment, where our first principle is to ensure the safety and well-being of patients and health care providers taking part in our clinical trials. With respect to key late-stage trials that are scheduled to read out this year, we have been working closely with our collaborators at AstraZeneca and Cytokinetics on the execution of our pivotal studies for tezepelumab and omecamtiv mecarbil respectively, both of which have completed enrollment. We currently do not expect any significant delays and continue to expect completion of these studies this year. We believe we will have high-quality data from both of these trials. This is also the case with our potentially pivotal Phase II monotherapy study for AMG 510, now known as sotorasib in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, which is also fully enrolled. As I mentioned last quarter, we will be collecting at least six months of response data in these patients and continue to expect these results later this year. I would note that the Phase III trial of Otezla in mild to moderate psoriasis also remains on track and we expect data from that study in the coming weeks. As previously disclosed, we have temporarily paused enrollment in clinical trials, where there is uncertainty around the ability of sites to ensure subject safety or data integrity. Patients already enrolled in our studies continue to receive study drug and we remain focused on supporting our clinical investigators to ensure appropriate care of these patients in a safe manner consistent with clinical site and agency guidelines. We're actively working with regulators and implemented study procedures as appropriate that are consistent with the recent FDA guidelines, including remote monitoring, virtual follow-up, alternative locations for assessment and home delivery of investigational product. We continue to make decisions study-by-study and site-by-site to minimize risk to the patients and facilities and to maintain trial integrity. For example, enrollment continues in certain studies where there is the potential for a significant benefit in a serious life-threatening conditions and where site resources allow new patients to be safely enrolled and closely monitored. Such trials include, but certainly not limited to our HL -- half-life extended BiTE programs targeting BCMA and to L3 and PSMA and we look forward to sharing data from these studies later this year. In other studies such as our sotorasib Phase I combination study with Keytruda and the Phase III confirmatory study where we have paused enrollment to ensure patient safety, time lines may be impacted and I'll provide updates as the situation develops and we gain more clarity. There is ongoing interest from investigators to provide their patients' access to investigational therapies, with potential for significant benefit and we are working to continue to study start-up activities for sotorasib and across our entire portfolio to allow rapid site activation. We look forward to resuming enrollment in pod studies and initiating subject to enrollment in new studies over the coming weeks and months, as soon as it is safe and feasible to do so. As we look forward to this year's clinical study readouts, we will be working with representatives of medical conferences and journals to ensure continued dissemination of important data to the medical community in a peer-reviewed environment, as we anticipate that many congresses will be virtual through the end of 2020. In any case, we have provided -- we are committed to providing data updates in a timely manner. We're also continuing to prioritize programs across our preclinical and clinical portfolios as you might expect. For instance based on the progress of our half-life extended BiTE molecules, we have stopped development of the first generation continuous infusion PSMA and BCMA BiTE programs. In research essential work has continued and we are begging to ramp laboratory activities across the organization as the situation facedly permit in various geographies. I'm also please to report that our BeiGene collaboration is on track, and this quarter we began to transition certain functional activities to BeiGene including non-promotional activities through in-line products and some local regulatory responsibilities in China. I'd like to close by saying the few words about how we're leveraging our expertise and therapeutic antibody development and immunology in the fight against COVID-19. Our recently announced collaboration with Adaptive Biotechnologies to identifying neutralizing antibodies to the coronavirus from the public COVID-19 patient is now actively under way. We view Adaptive as a world-class expertise in the mean profiling, combined with Amgen expertise in immunology and antibody engineering and manufacturing as a unique opportunity to contribute to what an unprecedented industry response to this pandemic. We are working intently to identify the highest quality therapeutic candidates as fast as we can and we'll take advantage of frequent interactions offered by regulatory authorities. In our view, there will likely be more than one generation of antibody therapeutics and our aim is to develop the highest possible quality candidates. In addition to our efforts to develop a therapeutic antibody, we have also been engaged in discussions with multiple groups conducting platform trials in COVID-19 and anticipate that Otezla will enter the clinic in the coming weeks to be investigated as a potential immunomodulatory treatment in adult patients with the disease. Finally, we are contributing actively to collaborative efforts to advance therapeutics for COVID-19, including ACTIV, the public-private partnership with the NIH. I want to close by acknowledging our staff, are working tirelessly and selflessly under these challenging circumstances to deliver for our patients. Their commitment and execution have been exemplary and I can't thank them enough. I'd now like to turn things over to Murdo Gordon. Tim, we're not going to go into details on that. Obviously, we continue to feel confident in the intellectual property around Enbrel. So, let's leave it at that for now. Thanks. Thanks Chris, Dave Reese here. I'll take that question. Yes. So, as you know there are a number of efforts going forward to develop therapeutic antibodies. And what we're trying to do I think that is potentially unique here is number one combine Adaptive's capabilities in immuno-profiling with our immunology and particularly our genetics work based out of deCODE. Our goal also is to really identify a very high-quality therapeutic candidate and it's my belief that there may well be more than one generation of antibody therapeutics entering the clinic. So, as we think about this we want to balance speed of development which of course is important with generating the highest quality candidate. And as work progresses we are up and running in the laboratory but we will provide guidance as -- in terms of clinical timelines as that work unfolds. But that collaboration is actively proceeding right now. I think the environment is pretty fluid still Geoff. So, I wouldn't try to -- I'm not sure I'd like to declare an answer to your question at the moment. But other than to reiterate that -- and we think we're in a strong position. We've talked about our balance sheet we talked about our desire to allocate capital to our internal innovation as well as the external innovation. And as you know we're pretty focused on our strategy and we'll look to see whether there are things externally that can help us strengthen our chosen areas. But maybe the other thing I would add just as a way to reiterate my appreciation of my Amgen colleagues is we had three very significant and successful integrations in the first quarter. So, it was a priority for us as a company to get off to a good start with Otezla and with BeiGene and with our Japan transaction and we really feel we've done that over the first four months of the year. So, I feel good about that. Thanks, Michael. Yes. A series of questions regarding AMG 510, we're continuing to enroll monotherapy patients with colorectal cancer. And as I've indicated before, we're going to look at those data, I would say, over the coming few months to determine whether we feel there's an appropriate monotherapy path forward in colorectal cancer or whether combination therapy is most appropriate. With respect to other non-lung cancer, non-colorectal cancer indications, we are -- there are other malignancies such as a small percentage of pancreatic cancer, appendiceal cancer and endometrial cancer and we will be able to provide updates on ASCO on some of those tumors and response data. And then finally in terms of the combination therapy trial these are some of the trials that we -- some of them we paused because they were either just initiating or had just initiated. We're getting ready to ramp back up. So I would expect first data with the earliest later this year perhaps the very first part of next year on those. But we're confident that we're not experiencing significant disruptions across the program in totality and we're happy -- we're quite happy actually with its progress. Thanks Terence. This is Dave. Yes. In terms of the timing of the date, I'd point out that what we've indicated is that we want at least six months of response data on all patients. And given that the last patients were enrolled towards the end of the last year that it takes a month or two typically for responses to develop. You can see that that pushes it into the second half of the year in terms of when we expect the data readout. We're absolutely on track and we're not experiencing any I would say substantial hiccups in the Phase 2 monotherapy study. We do want robust duration of response and progression-free survival data as part of that package. And I think those endpoints along with response rate to address the second part of your question will be an important part of the package in this Phase 2 monotherapy study. Yes. Thanks Yaron for the question. In terms of the comparator arm this was -- this choice was based on what remains -- one of the standards of care docetaxel around the world the discussions with regulatory authorities and investigators and we feel that that's an appropriate comparator here. The sample size calculations were driven by the desire to be able to robustly test for overall survival. And so the second part of your statement there is correct. If this was powered on overall survival. Well thanks, Ronnie. This is Dave. I'll start with the PD-1 question for AMG 404. We continue to develop AMG 404 primarily as a combination partner for our pipeline agents. This is a Phase I umbrella study and we added cohorts to study additional indications where the tumors in question have well described PD-1 sensitivity that will limit the need we hope for single-arm data in future trials and ultimately we think we'll probably need on the order of 200 give or take monotherapy patients to support the standard safety package for AMG 404. So all of that put together expansion of the Phase I trial allowed us an efficient way to generate appropriate data. Thank you, Umer, for the question. Yes. I mean, I think duration of response is one of the critical questions and that's why I indicated that -- the Phase II trial I think is going to give us the definitive answer there. That will -- and we wish to have enough follow-up to very robustly address both duration of response and progression-free survival. In terms of the combinations, I think it's perhaps a little too early to pick favorites. We are looking at a number of combinations, which is typical for oncology programs. All of those are based on an underlying biologic rationale. And as I indicated, we'll be generating data in that program in combinations over the course of this year. Thanks Mohit. Dave here. Yes, we remain keenly interested in AMG 592 IL-2 mutant, we're enrolling trials going forward and we'd expect data over the course of the year or perhaps early next year. Some of those trials we did temporarily pause because of the reluctance of investigators to start patients on new immunomodulatory agents in the course of the epidemic. But we remain quite interested in that program and we'll provide guidance as to when we're going to get data readout as we move forward. Yes, I think it is a golden age and I would approach it from two perspectives. There are new platforms. And our Head of Research, she has published a very great article in nature a week or two ago. I'd encourage all of you to read about what we call an induced proximity platform. This is a new suite of technologies that we think can open up much of the undependable space, so that sort of business development remains of great interest to us. And then as we've said before, I think there's a ferment of activity across the therapeutic areas of great interest to us and that will continue to be a focus going forward. Well thanks James, this is Dave. Yes we think it's actually -- there will be utility in studying Otezla in a variety of settings ranging from for example hospitalized patients but those that are not yet in the ICU to attempt to prevent progression to more serious disease as well as those with more serious disease. And so again we're in active discussions or have committed to platform trials. The one real guiding principle we have here is that we want these to be rigorous studies to provide the highest quality answers."

            "name": "Bob Bradway",
            "content": "Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to acknowledge upfront that this has been an extraordinary quarter for all of us. Global pandemic, economic disruption like none of us have seen before, and of course financial volatility that has been dizzying at times. But I hope you're keeping well and we're certainly grateful to you for joining the call -- results we're managing through the COVID disruption quite well and feel we're operating from a position of strength with a healthy balance sheet, a strong portfolio of products and an organization that has proven itself time and again to be innovative, resilient and able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. I want to take a few moments to share how we've been responding to COVID-19 and then we can dive into the details of the first quarter and what we see for the remainder of the year. We've mobilized our company around four priorities. First, taking care of our staff, our 23,000 staff around the world; second, continuing to serve patients with an uninterrupted supply of our commercial and clinical medicines; third, leveraging our core genetics immunology and antibody expertise in the fight against COVID-19; and finally, supporting the communities where we live and work. Our first priority from the beginning of the pandemic has been to ensure the safety of our people and their families. To encourage social distancing, Amgen staff worldwide are mostly working from home now. We're encouraged that in a few markets, conditions have improved to the point where we've begun returning our people to the workplace and we hope to expand our back to the workplace activities in the coming -- I would also note that about a quarter of our staff are engaged in essential manufacturing and R&D activities that have required them to continue coming to the workplace every day. We're taking every possible measure to keep these employees safe and we're grateful to them for their commitments to patients into our business. All our staff are performing really well as you can see from our results. At a time when health care systems around the world are being stretched to their limits, we're committed to working collaboratively with our partners in the health care ecosystem. We need to make sure that we're both responding to COVID-19 and meeting the ongoing needs of other seriously ill patients -- health care crisis that we as a society never intended. From a supply chain perspective, we've not experienced any significant disruptions and we don't currently anticipate any shortages of our medicines due to COVID-19. With respect to clinical trials, our pivotal studies including for AMG 510, Otezla, tezepelumab and omecamtiv mecarbil are fully enrolled and expected to read out this year as previously announced. Other programs such as our BiTEs in oncology have also continued to progress and we're encouraged by the accumulating data there. Where programs have been interrupted by the COVID pandemic, we're busy making plans to get them restarted as soon as appropriate from a patient safety and regulatory perspective. By now, it's clear that overcoming this pandemic will require innovative science. While the virus may have gotten the jump on us at the outset, the good news is that the community of innovative biopharmaceutical companies is moving at a speed and scale never seen before and we're gaining ground on the virus with each passing day. While our research does not include antivirals, we have a role to play in this battle leveraging our genetics, immunology and antibody expertise to do so. As previously announced, we're harnessing the molecular epidemiology work done by our deCODE subsidiary and working with our partners at Adaptive Biotechnologies to develop an antibody to prevent or treat COVID-19. If we're successful, our industry-leading manufacturing capabilities will play an important role in helping us meet the needs of patients. In addition, based on its mechanism of action, Otezla might help prevent the respiratory distress seen in late-stage COVID patients. As Dave Reese will explain in a moment, we'll be exploring this question in clinical trials imminently. And we've long prioritized being a good citizen within the health care ecosystem and within the communities where we live and work -- by COVID-19 has been devastating for many. While we certainly have been impacted by the pandemic at Amgen, we recognize that we're in a fortunate position and we're committed to doing our part to help during this time of need. Toward that end, the Amgen Foundation is supporting COVID-19 in a variety of ways with a focus on communities where we have a significant presence. To give you just one example, we donated testing equipment in Ventura County, our home county that effectively has doubled the testing capacity for COVID-19 here. Looking forward, we're confident in the future. We were in a strong position heading into the COVID-19 pandemic and we expect to stay strong as we come through the other side of this. We remain focused on delivering sustained long-term growth and we're confident in our outlook for that. As I've already noted, we have a number of important innovative medicines advancing our pipeline and the key programs remain on track from a timing perspective. Our integration of Otezla has been seamless. In Japan, we have now successfully completed the integration of our Astellas partnership. And we're already well advanced and collaborating effectively with our colleagues at Beijing and China. All this gives me confidence that we're executing effectively around the world despite the challenges of COVID-19. Finally, -- a fact that will enable us to continue our capital allocation principles, which to remind you are to invest in innovation internally and externally while returning significant capital to our shareholders. Though the pandemic is still very fluid and to be sure the first few weeks of April have clearly shown some signs of disruption, the combination of our results from the first quarter and our expectation of an improving outlook for global health care activity give us confidence that the guidance we provided earlier in the year still incorporates the likely range of outcomes for our business in 2020. Peter will give you more color on this shortly. Amgen's strength has always come from its people. Like me they believe in the power of science to make a difference in the world. We often talk about this being the biocentury, the golden age of innovation for biology. We may have met our challenge of the century in SARS-COVID-2, but I hope however bleak this pandemic may seem at times, that all of you share our optimism, this virus will ultimately yield to the relentless efforts of the biopharmaceutical industry, we're rustle it to ground. I'm proud of the team at Amgen for coming together to support each other and all those we serve during such a challenging time. I'm proud also of the work we are doing with our industry colleagues to tackle the COVID-19 challenge. With that, let me turn over to Dave Reese, who will provide a pipeline update. Dave? Well, before my closing remarks, we'll go to Q&A. So let's have Ian, let's open it up for Q&A, remind our callers of the process that we'll follow. Thanks. Just to state the obvious Jay we would have liked to have spent more in Q1 but we were getting a little bit disrupted there as you know at the end of the quarter. So we'll see what it's like for the remaining three quarters of the year. Chris maybe I could just add a comment about manufacturing. Obviously, -- a lot of protein. We have great expertise in manufacturing at scale. And we think one of the things we can bring to the party here is our ability to supply a vast number of patients with our antibody. Robyn before Murdo answers, let me make sure we heard that you said how comfortable are we writing or are doctors writing? Did you say Evenity prescriptions in telemedicine? Ian, let's take the next question. And it's getting -- and as it's getting late on the East Coast, if I can just ask everybody to please limit yourself to one question. Ian, let's go on with the next one. I don't know about the course of 2020, Dane. We're -- those are two areas of keen interest for us for sure, oncology and inflammation. And we will continue to look for attractive innovative assets that we think we can add value to. The trick is always to be able to license or acquire molecules at a price that leaves return for our shareholders and we're pretty comprehensive in the way we assess the marketplace and we'll continue to keep an active watch and see whether there are some things that might be a good fit. Yes. That's a really interesting question, Carter, and one that I think we'll get a lot of attention once things have settled down a little bit. It's still awfully fluid to be trying to predict how the experience of COVID-19 will affect our industry or our business model. But we'd be happy to engage with you on that topic at greater length, again, when the dust has settled a little bit. But fundamentally for us, our supply chain is in great shape. We, unlike some of our peers in the industry predominantly manufacture in the U.S. obviously -- even the people who work for us there are U.S. citizens and so we have the benefit that the vast majority nearly all of our manufacturing is done in the U.S. That supply chain questions a little bit less relevant for us and some of our industry peers. But I do think that this isn't going to be the last viral challenge that we face as a society and I think we'll all be trying to improve our business continuity planning and thinking when we come out of this to make sure that we're in a strong position as possible to avoid interruptions from events like this. But I think there will be a lot of learning across the whole economy, including the biotech economy. So we look forward to talking, you've got the right time. Well, Dave, since I have I talked a little bit about M&A business development already on the call, why don't we let you take a crack at this. So, what areas, what mechanisms are most intriguing to you and your R&D colleagues at the moment? Well I think everybody recognizes that we're going to need science and innovation to lead us out of this challenge that we find ourselves in globally. So -- importance of innovation and a little bit of humility perhaps in all camps about how hard it is to have the right innovation available for the world at the right time. So the good news is that the government, innovators, academia everybody are working together at a speed and a scale that I've never seen in my career. So I think that's a good sign and hopefully we'd be able to look back on this one day and say that it works. We've got a special ecosystem in particular in this country. And hopefully, we'll be able to look back and say when we faced the biggest challenge of our lifetimes the industry came through and delivered what we needed. And if we're able to do that I think it inevitably will help remind everybody that we haven't generated all the innovation we need as a society. There are still lots of areas of unmet medical need. And again, the more we can do to address it the better. But the question of drug pricing is not going to go away but hopefully there'll be some respect for how profoundly important innovation is. Okay. Let me just wrap up recognizing that it's pushing on 7:00 on the East Coast. Again let me reiterate our appreciation for you joining the call. I hope what you take away from the call is that, we delivered a solid quarter one. We feel we're executing the business. Well our objective will be to remain an effective steward of the business through the short term. We want to be a leading corporate citizen through this challenging period as well and we will remain focused on delivering long-term growth by advancing innovation in those areas that you're familiar with at Amgen. So thank you all. Keep safe. Look forward to catching up with you on the next quarterly call."

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We started the year with strong volume-driven growth of 15% on a global basis with 10% in the U.S. and 32% ex-U.S. Growth was generated broadly across our portfolio of newer products more than offsetting declines in our mature brands. Given the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, I want to start by sharing our views on how disruptions in the global health care system may impact our business, and then I'll walk through what we're seeing at the product level and what actions we are taking. Like others in our sector, we're seeing varying degrees of impact from COVID-19 across our portfolio as physician-patient interactions are interrupted. These reduced interactions have led to some delays in diagnosis and treatment, which in turn reduces new patient starts. Data from IQVIA suggests that patient office visits have declined by over 50%, although some of this is being offset by telemedicine and telehealth services. Data also show that some patients refilled prescriptions early and that there was a modest benefit of approximately $100 million from inventory in the quarter. Finally, increased utilization of patient affordability programs and changes in segment mix due to increased U.S. unemployment could negatively impact U.S. net prices. Treatments like Prolia that require in office administration by a health care provider have been negatively impacted. On the other hand, the product like Otezla may benefit given that it provides a convenient oral option for patients compared with injectable or IV biologics, some of which require monitoring. Despite this disruption, our teams are responding to customer needs via remote interactions. We're identifying innovative solutions to help patients and we're supplying products reliably and consistently. Now let me review some product details beginning with Prolia on Slide 12. Prolia grew 10% year-over-year from higher volume. Strong demand growth in January and February was consistent with prior years. In March, we began to see a negative impact on Prolia in office injections and have since observed a substantial step down in utilization versus prior years. In more recent weeks, we're beginning to see signs of stabilization and we'll be able to provide more clarity on this when we report our Q2 results in July. The importance of treating osteoporosis in patients who are at high-risk of fractures is critical. Our teams are working to address continuity of care issues and exploring novel solutions such as alternate sites of care, mobile nurse-administered injections, prescription fills at specialty and retail pharmacies. We're also working with policymakers and advocacy organizations to address treatment challenges in this environment. Moving to Evenity, which launched in Japan and the U.S. in the first half of 2019. Evenity posted $100 million in sales during the first quarter, driven by continued uptick. In Japan, which represents roughly two-thirds of Evenity sales, we've attained shares similar to those established anabolic therapies. In the U.S., we saw an acceleration in demand trends with improvements in persistence in Q1 as clinics gained more experience. As patients complete their one year cycle of therapy with Evenity, we will work with healthcare providers to help transition these patients to Prolia. Evenity and Prolia are a complementary set of options to address the 9 million fractures that occur worldwide in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients and our teams are focused on ensuring these patients are not compromised during this pandemic. Moving to Repatha. We're off to a strong start in 2020. Our efforts over the past 18 months to improve access and affordability have yielded strong results as Q1 sales grew by 62% year-over-year, driven by 98% volume growth versus the same period last year. New-to-brand prescriptions in the U.S. steadily improved in Q1, growing 51% year-over-year and we held 80% market share exiting the quarter. As we appreciate in our last earnings call, Part D contracting to improve access and affordability resulted in a step down in Repatha's net selling price in Q1. We expect net selling price to be relatively stable for the remainder of the year. On to Aimovig on Slide 15. On a year-over-year basis, net sales grew 20% with underlying volume growth of 46%. Aimovig remains the market leader with 48% total prescription share. To date, almost 330,000 patients have been prescribed Aimovig by more than 33,000 prescribers. With the recent addition to CVS National Preferred Formulary, we now have access to 93% of covered lives, which led to a 19% growth quarter-over-quarter in new-to-brand prescriptions. Net price was sequentially lower due to expanded access with CVS and higher co-pay utilization that occurs each year in the first quarter. These factors were partially offset by the proportion of paid prescriptions increasing to almost 90%, up from 81% in Q4 of 2019. Next to our inflammation portfolio starting with Otezla. Integration has been seamless evidenced by 23% year-over-year growth driven by volume. These results coupled with planned label expansion give us confidence in our ability to realize the full global potential of Otezla, as an affordable option with a very well-defined efficacy and safety profile. In the current COVID environment Otezla provides a convenient oral option for patients. It's conducive to telemedicine and does not require lab monitoring. Moving to Enbrel. Sales were $1.2 billion in Q1 and included a $70 million year-over-year benefit from favorable changes in accounting estimates related to sales deductions. Consistent with prior trends, prescription volumes declined 5% year-over-year. We continue to expect a limited benefit from net selling price in 2020 versus 2019. In this environment, we're supporting Enbrel's strong continuing base of patients in maintaining their course of therapy through disruptions and out-of-pocket cost barriers. As you know, Enbrel has been on the market for over 20 years and does not require routine lab monitoring. Now to slide 18. Another contributor to our inflammation franchise is Amgevita, which for three consecutive quarters as the number one adalimumab Biosimilar in Europe recording $86 million of sales in Q1. Switching to our hematology and oncology business, our innovative portfolio of six brands collectively totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter growing by 11% year-over-year. Certain products like XGEVA may be impacted in the current environment due to disruptions in physician-patient interactions. Although others including Neulasta Onpro and our oncology biosimilars MVASI and KANJINTI provide greater value. Let me highlight some of our larger products. KYPROLIS grew 14% year-over-year led by a 21% increase in U.S. sales, which was driven by expanded use in second and third-line multiple myeloma. Neulasta declined 40% year-over-year recall that Q1 of 2019 benefited from a $98 million BARDA order, which did not repeat this quarter. OnPro continues to be the preferred choice and has held quarter-over-quarter share at 54% despite facing an additional competitor. The revised NCCN guidelines recommend increased use of G-CSFs to minimize the risk of febrile neutropenia in cancer patients. Onpro provides a unique value proposition, particularly, now as patients can receive their G-CSF treatment without having to return to their site of care. Our two oncology biosimilars MVASI and KANJINTI generated $234 million in sales globally in the first quarter. In the U.S., they sold $108 million and $96 million respectively with market shares exiting Q1 at or above 27%. We continue to see encouraging adoption rates in clinics with hospital adoption accelerating. These biosimilars are increasingly valuable given the cost savings that they provide. Switching to nephrology, starting on slide 24. Given the serious nature of end-stage renal disease patients require dialysis treatments three days per week. Therefore, we're not seeing a meaningful impact on the use of Amgen medications in these patients that would attribute to COVID-19. In Q1 EPOGEN sales declined 29% primarily due to lower net selling price from our contractual commitment with DaVita and approximately $20 million of unfavorable changes in accounting estimates. Sensipar sales declined 42% year-over-year due to the impact of generic competition. As a reminder, supplemental patent protection certificates for cinacalcet have now expired in major EU markets, which could result in a significant decline in ex-U.S. sales in 2020. Parsabiv grew by 39% year-over-year in the first quarter. Independent and midsize dialysis providers already utilize Parsabiv for a majority of their calcimimetic patients. While FMC and DaVita continue to increase adoption. In summary, I'm truly inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees who are helping patients and health care providers in this unprecedented time. And with that I'd like to turn over to Peter. Yes. Hi, Matthew, it's Murdo. Yes, as I mentioned, we saw about $100 million of stocking inventory build I should say in the first quarter which happened across markets. The only other element that I would maybe compare in contrast to some other companies that are reporting, our business given that it's predominantly specialty biologics, I know a fair amount of physician administration products didn't necessarily have the same extent of early prescription fills and patient 90-day fills, that would have been an additional pull forward for some other companies. As they reported they blended that dynamic with end customer and wholesale inventory build. So the $100 million refers to end customer and wholesaler inventory, specifically. On products like Otezla, we may have had some pull forward from some early fills and maybe 90-day scripts. And we'll just have to wait and see how that works through in Q2. Right. Yes Robyn, if I could just clarify further on the first part of your question, is your question related to opening up government access like we've done over the last little while? Or is it the transition of people potentially from commercial to a government benefit because of COVID-19? Okay. No that's helpful. Thanks for the clarification. So let's start with that topic. On the -- first off, our overall Medicaid portion of our business right now is quite low. It's less than 10% of our total revenue. And the majority of our products beyond that are reimbursed through Medicare Part B and D with or about 50% of our total business being reimbursed through commercial. So it's that commercial piece as you rightly point out that is likely or a portion of that is likely to transition to a government channel. Now the thing that's harder to predict is at what rate? So as people who become unemployed and an important distinction is furloughed, they retain benefits for a period of time if they opt into Cobra and furloughed employees are often still on their self-insured company employee plan sponsored plan. So there's a time lag that's going to occur before people transition to either a state exchange or a Medicaid benefit. So I think the impact could be a delayed one, more like towards the end of this year and into 2021. And of course, trying to pin down the actual numbers of Americans that are going to end up in an unemployment benefits is hard to peg right now. So those are the two things. It's the total bolus and the rate of change. I've heard some commentary and read some things that would appear to indicate people expect it earlier. Our perspective is that some of these patients and people will transition over time and it will more likely be a delay to an effect into 2021. On telemedicine, I would just say that there's a variety of maturity of high telemedicine is used by therapeutic area. If you think about mental health and I would argue even in neurology, telemedicine is already used quite extensively even pre-COVID. And I would say that the uptake for telemedicine and evaluating someone like a migraine patient is going to be relatively straightforward as it would be perhaps for a dermatology patient. So in the case of neurology, migraine would be Aimovig and then for dermatology it would be Otezla. You mentioned Evenity, of course Evenity is primarily prescribed post fracture, so patients are likely to be in a clinic or a hospital setting. And so the ability for the physician to evaluate the patient and prescribe Evenity is probably pretty straightforward related to that acute event. But we're watching it closely. We actually -- because of Aimovig and other brands that -- where telemedicine was already being used fairly extensively, we had some experience here that goes back over a year and we've been scaling our experience there now. So I think Amgen will be on the front foot when it comes to building out our capabilities in that area. Yes. And when it comes to our biosimilars business, we are pleased with the run rate of over $300 million in the quarter. I would say -- I would attribute our success first and foremost to Amgen's reputation as a high-quality biologics manufacturer. I think that is something that differentiates us and is perceived well by our customers. Our experience in Europe was a very positive one. We applied those lessons learned to our U.S. launches of the two oncology biosimilars. And I think it shows you that the biosimilars market is functioning well in the United States. I would also say that the biosimilar business model for Amgen is very much integrated with our innovative products. So the same people who are defending Neulasta, the same account managers who are defending Neulasta day-in day-out and making sure that the benefit of Onpro is understood by our customers are the same people who are establishing the uptake curve for MVASI and KANJINTI. So those account relationships that we've cultivated over many, many years in oncology have been extremely valuable. And our relationships at the payer-provider level, I think have helped us extend that trajectory nicely. I would also say that our patient services are exemplary and we have the very same patient services that we have for a product like KYPROLIS or XGEVA we apply to our biosimilars business as well. And then you mentioned, I think Avsola, which is our Remicade biosimilar. We do intend to launch that this year. And that product will help strengthen what is already a strong immunotherapy portfolio for us and will help us broaden out that customer perspective. And again that product will be integrated with our innovative autoimmune portfolio. So it's a bit early to tell. So take my comments with a very few weeks of experience here. I would say so far we have not seen a negative effect on our uptake. If anything we're seeing a steepening of our uptake curve. The one thing I will say that we haven't yet assessed that could happen is the total cycles of bevacizumab, or the total cycles of trastuzumab could be impacted. So from a share of molecule perspective, we're very pleased what we're watching is the total number of infusions of each of the molecules going forward. Alethia, I just want to clarify, its Murdo here. You are talking about clinical trial activity with those as well. Yes, we're -- look we continue to watch the weekly trends. We're listening to what our customer are telling us and we definitely think that we've got a little bit of buffer supporting Otezla right now because it is a convenient oral option. It's got great market excess coverage. It's affordable. We're -- obviously also we mentioned the end of last year that we were putting in additional primary care effort to broaden the promotional effort behind Otezla and I think that's also helping. So we're feeling good about it and I think it's the ideal kind of product or time like this where a lot of patients are concerned about visiting healthcare professional. Yes I think -- thank you, Geoff. I think what I mentioned was the patient visits were down 50%. Prolia were maybe not has impacted yet on Evenity or definitely the products that we're seeing most impact in our portfolio. If you think about the physician administered products for Amgen and three business, we have our business. We have our nephrology business. We have our oncology business. Bone is by far the business that is being impacted the most. Obviously, it's partly to do with the age and vulnerability of patients and we're spending a lot of time working on alternate sites of care and proving continuity of care, setting up mobile programs where nurses can visit patients homes and administer and we're working with the administration CMS policy, advocates to try and improve the buy-and-bill access to that home injection channel as well. Nephrology is holding up well. Obviously in renal disease these patients have to have their dialysis is life sustaining. So those volumes are holding up well. The providers there have been very good at collaborating and providing safe isolated sites of care for patients. And then oncology, it's down but not nearly as much as the bone. So that gives you a relative order of understanding of how we're seeing it. Yes. Thanks Cory. Look, we're very pleased with Aimovig's share performance. And we did have to do quite a bit of work over the course of the year to get to that 90% paid level. And now we have 93% of covered lives. So we're pretty pleased about that basis. I think what we're counting on for growth going forward because we expect price to stabilize throughout the course of the balance of the year is we're coming on unlocking additional patient volume. We've got over four million potential CGRP patient candidates out there. Physicians tend to persist with older oral products and aren't yet adopting CGRP products at the rate that we think that they could and should be to help ease the suffering of chronic migraine sufferer. So that's where we're focused. We're focused on unlocking the future potential volume now that these products and particularly Aimovig has a very affordable access coverage in the market. Yes. Thanks, Michael. The one thing I mentioned earlier in response to the question of biosimilars was the Amgen experience in knowing how to make biologics at scale in a very efficient way. So we have really good margins on this business. And I think going by our experience in Europe, where I would argue that the price degradation has probably been faster than it will be in the U.S., even with multiple competitors, we've been able to compete effectively for volume and we've been able to retain a very profitable business there. We, obviously, don't have a lot of analogs in the U.S. to understand the rate of change, so I'm going to hold back from speculating on what the future will hold. But there are clear things here that the more competitors you have compressed in the early phase of a biosimilar launch path, the more likely there is to be some precipitous price erosion. We're fortunate that we were early in the U.S. with both MVASI and KANJINTI and able to establish a very strong foothold in the market. I'll also repeat it, I said it earlier, but I do think that the biosimilar market is alive and well in the U.S. and functioning as you would hope free markets would."

I will now like to turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Schall: Thank you, Bill. Good afternoon to everyone listening. Thank you for joining us. Please move to slide three in our presentation. Today I will cover three important topics that highlight our recent success and outline the significant milestones we expect throughout 2022.  First, we'll take a look at our progress in the early weeks following the U.S. launch of TAVNEOS in ANCA-associated vasculitis. Second, I\u2019ll update you on our plan to broaden TAVNEOS into our pipeline and our drug, including next steps that we expect to take at Lupus nephritis, severe hidradenitis suppurativa and C3 glomerulopathy. And third, we\u2019ll discuss recent progress we\u2019ve made and next steps for our unique, orally active, small molecule PD-L1, PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor CCX559 for which we expect initial Phase I data this year.  Moving to slide four, you can see that 2021 was an historic year in our corporate journey. After over 20 years since the founding of ChemoCentryx we've navigated the uncertain and uncharted territory at the frontiers of science, and achieved our longstanding goal of bringing our first medicine to patients, suffering from a devastating and debilitating disease.  Following FDA approval, we launched TAVNEOS as an adjunctive treatment for use in patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis on October 18, leaving us 51 business days in the quarter r post launch. As we launched, we took a final step in our vertical integration. We now constitute and integrate U.S. biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and now markets innovative medicines of our own devising.  It was a long and arduous journey to get here with some 17 years working on the TAVNEOS program alone. But the human rewards in bringing something truly different, to under serviced people, such as those enduring ANCA-associated vasculitis have made it all worthwhile.  January of this year brought another significant advance with the EU approval of TAVNEOS. This means that TAVNEOS is now approved in the U.S., in Europe and Japan for ANCA-associated vasculitis indications. Further European approval triggered a milestone payment of $45 million from our partner Vifor Pharma. We are pleased to share that Vifor launched TAVNEOS in Germany on February 15 of this year, with additional territories expected in the first half of 2022. As a reminder, Vifor will pay ChemoCentryx royalties in the teens to the mid-20\u2019s on ex-US sales of one aggregate net sales line.  Back to the United States as shown on slide five, we set out to develop our commercial infrastructure in the months leading up to approval, including the hiring and meticulous training of professionals in medical science liaison physicians, as a sales representative, and in other key roles. As we approached the launch, our initial marketing focus was multi-faceted by design. First and foremost, we sought to educate physicians on the TAVNEOS approved label and supporting clinical data, raising awareness through a hybrid approach of in-person and virtual meetings that provided flexibility in these times of COVID.  Through our commercial team, we are initially focusing on the top prescribing physicians. We calculated that a combined field force of about 75 would sufficiently cover the approximately 3,400 clinicians, comprising key external experts, top prescribers and community specialists who collectively are responsible for roughly 80% of all ANCA-associated vasculitis prescriptions in the United States.  Further, we recognize the importance of working closely with patients, listening to advocacy groups and other active voices in the vasculitis community that it welcomed the arrival of a modern, orally administered and mechanistically targeted medication, which was designed from the start with their disease at mind. Too often orphan diseased patients seem to feel that they languished in a seldom visited treatment backwater, receiving occasionally repurposed drugs that may provide benefits to their condition, but were not designed specifically for that purpose. TAVNEOS was and is different.  Now through branded campaigns we plan to educate appropriate patients on the TAVNEOS safety and efficacy profile, while also employing unbranded campaigns to provide disease awareness. These efforts are designed to support patients in having appropriate conversations with their healthcare professionals. Through these mechanisms we have activated a continuous positive feedback loop that will help inform our actions as we move forward, soliciting and obtaining prescriber and patient experiences in order to support continuous improvement of our commercial and outreach efforts. Let us now move to slide six. As we reflect on our first few weeks post U.S. launch. I am pleased to report encouraging progress. While the headline number is the top line revenue for Q4, which came in at approximately $1 million, including limited channel supply for our agreements with specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy selling TAVNEOS, we have stated before that we believe the best way to track our progress for the first few quarters is by focusing on three key performance indicators.  Specifically during the fourth quarter, these metrics include the following: We received 127 patients start forms or patient referrals from 102 unique prescribers. At the end of Q4, there were 90 patients on drugs and the conversion rate of patient start forms, to patient on drugs was 71%. The result in these key metrics, mark promising progress for a rare disease such as ANCA-associated vasculitis, especially when considering that the launch took place mid-quarter preceding a major holiday season and that was of course impacted by the arrival of an Omicron wave of COVID even before the Delta surge had finally end. As we move through the current order, which will eventually be the first full quarter of commercial activity. The leading indicators are favorable for our expected upward growth curves.  Moving to slide seven, we have superimposed the progress across key metrics from the beginning of the first quarter, i.e., through January. Accordingly, between the launch and January 31, we received 179 patients start forms from 140 unique prescribers and there were 141 patients on drug, representing the 79% conversion rate for patients start forms of PSFs.  Since we are still at quite an early stage, I will also share with you today more largely qualitative color and context and we expect to give you a future quarters, when the qualitative - I'm sorry when the quantitative data will paint a more complete picture than it does today.  On side eight for example, let us look at some of the prescribing patterns that we are seeing. Through January 31, as it relates to what types of physicians are prescribing TAVNEOS we estimate 66% of the prescriptions are coming from Rheumatologists, 28% from Nephrologists and 6% from other treating physicians, such as pulmonologists. As it relates to where these referrals are coming from, while we are pleased with the traction across centers of excellence, we are particularly enthusiastic about the in-roads we made within the community setting as well. This success is in-part a testament to our commercial teams reach, supplemented by the unaided awareness of TAVNEOS that has continued to blossom, since the advocate trial pivotal results were initially released in the New England Journal of Medicine last year.  We are also pleased to share that approximately 33% of positions are repeat prescribers, through January 31. We believe this suggest physicians are having positive first experiences, which we hope to continue to build upon.  Additionally, the time it takes to convert patients start forms, to patients on reimbursed medication is now tracking in line with our expectations, taking approximately four weeks to obtain a payer coverage decision, which we anticipate will continue to decrease over time. What's more, initial feedback from healthcare providers suggest that they are experiencing success now in obtaining reimbursements based on prior authorization, and if necessary appeals for appropriate patients who meet the criteria outlined in our FDA approved label.  As these patients await coverage decisions, we have provided mechanisms for immediate access to treatment for eligible patients through or support program. While we continue to support access per plan via such patient support programs, we are now seeing an ever greater share of paid models as the launch progresses.  Having launched into the unique environment, I\u2019m very pleased with our progress to-date. Apart from the obvious constraints on the availability of in-person as opposed to virtual visits, whether by our reps to physicians or by patients to physicians the Omicron wave led to staff shortages amongst healthcare workers, which in turn means that physicians continue to face capacity challenges seeing their patients in person.  We acknowledge that this is not a phenomenon unique to ChemoCentryx and in any case we plan for an orderly progression in the quarters following the launch, rather than a bold list of early patients which could have distorted the true growth picture. In short, we believe that TAVNEOS has the potential to become a blockbuster drugs at peak in our first indication alone. In the meantime, I look forward to updating you again in a couple of months when we release our full Q1 results. Let us now turn to slide nine, where we will look beyond our current commercial efforts. We have an exciting year ahead from a clinical development perspective as we aim to expand our patient reach by developing TAVNEOS as a pipeline and a drugs and also by advancing our novel-orally administered PD-L1, PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor known as CCX559.  In 2021 as you know, we prioritized and focused on ANCA-associated vasculitis approval. In Q4 we were busy building up a New World class clinical development organization led by Dr. Rita Jain who joined ChemoCentryx full time in October as our Chief Medical Officer, in addition to her role as Director on our Board, a position she has held since March of 2019.  Dr. Jain has enjoyed a distinguished medical academic and corporate career, and is an outstanding leader to take our development efforts to the next level. She will also oversee the post marketing studies on TAVNEOS in ANCA-associated vasculitis which is likely to yield useful supplementary data of interest to physicians and payers.  Moving to slide 10, the biological rationale for TAVNEOS across several underserved inflammatory and autoimmune disorders is compelling, given us unique ability to selectively inhibit the C5a receptor, preserving other functions and components of the immune system.  I will remind us, TAVNEOS was designed to be an anti-inflammatory agent based on its mechanism of action and not broadly immuno-suppressant. Throughout 2022, our focus includes three indicating, lupus nephritis, severe hidradenitis suppurativa and C3 glomerulopathy.  First, we plan to meet with the FDA to discuss our plans for lupus nephritis, a disease in which uncontrolled complement activation has been implicated in kidney destruction. Once steps have been agreed upon, we anticipate initiating a clinical development program for TAVNEOS in patients with lupus nephritis in 2022. This should be followed in close order by another meeting with the FDA to discuss our plans for a pivotal Phase III trials of TAVNEOS in patients with severe hidradenitis suppurativa or HS, which we hope to initiate in the second half of this year.  As you will recall, in our Phase II AURORA trial in HS, TAVNEOS showed a statistically significant improvement over placebo in a pre-specified subgroup of early stage 3 HS patients. To investigate and understand that clinical result, our research at ChemoCentryx has now provided evidence for clear differences at the molecular, the cellular and the histological level between more moderate HS disease for example early Stage 2, versus severe or early Stage 3 HS, a key differentiating feature appears to be a greater involvement of the C5a, C5a receptor access in early Stage 3 disease, versus milder forms of HS. Our data will be discussed at the upcoming dermatology conferences this year.  As for C3G, later in 2022 we plan to meet the FDA to discuss our accolade trial results of TAVNEOS in the very rare kidney disease or C3 glomerulopathy data from which we have here previously. The accolade trial with the largest, blinded randomized controlled study conducted to-date in this indication, and we are keen to review the effects demonstrated in this study with the FDA, such as the evidence for slowing of fibrotic progression indicated by the endpoint of the C3G histologic index of disease chronicity and other effects seen with TAVNEOS administration.  We don't propose to invest in additional large scale clinical work in C3G in the absence of some defined path forward by which TAVNEOS might be used as this indication, due to the long and costly nature of such trials involving for example, serial kidney biopsies, at baseline at other time points, along with the challenges of patient recruitment in this very rare disease. We are hopeful that the data will inform a positive discussion with the FDA and this potentially life threatening disease for which there are no approved therapies.  Last, let me say a few words about CCX559. Our potent orally administered PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitor which entered first in human studies into Q3 of 2021. As seen on slide 11, after dosing multiple cancer patients, we can confirm that the drug is poorly absorbed well at levels that are approximately proportional to dose, and appearing generally well tolerated to-date. Additionally, a number of indicators confirm that immune cell activation is occurring.  Given the physical limitations of large molecules, that is anti-checkpoint antibody therapy example, which may not penetrate the tumor microenvironment well, a small molecule medication has the potential to establish itself in several niches in what many believe could be a fairly short time frame, providing a beachhead from which we could substantially expand clinical development on CCX559 in this very valuable area.  We plan to present initial data from the dose escalation phase of this CCX559 Phase I study in upcoming oncology meetings starting with the AACR in April and we expect to enter a phase Ib/II clinical trial in the second half of this year.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Susan Kanaya to outline our healthy financial situation heading into 2022, which is sufficient to progress our TAVNEOS launch efforts as expected for the [inaudible] activities. Susan?\nSusan Kanaya: Thank you, Tom. Our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results were included in our press release today and are summarized on slide 12. Total revenue for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021 were $2.3 million and $32.2 million, compared to $4.4 million and $64.9 million in the same period in 2020.  TAVNEOS U.S. net product sales were approximately $1 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Product supply revenue contributed $1.3 million and $1.8 million for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 respectively.  Collaboration and license revenue was $29.1 million for the full year of 2021 compared to $64.4 million in 2020. Cost of sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 was $302,000. Cost incurred from manufacturing campaigns initiated prior to the October 2021 FDA approval of TAVNEOS were recorded as research and development expense. Research and development expenses were $18.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $21.2 million for the same period last year. Full year 2021 research and development expenses were $83.0 million, compared to $77.9 million in 2020. These increases were primarily attributable to the manufacture of commercial drug supply in anticipation of the launch of TAVNEOS in ANCA vasculitis and higher research and discovery expenses, including those associated with the development of CCX559. Selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses were $23.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $12.7 million for the same period in 2020. Full year 2021 SG&A expenses were $78.9 million compared to $42.2 million in 2020. These increases were principally due to higher employee-related expenses associated with commercialization planning efforts and the launch of TAVNEOS in 2021. Net loss for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 were $40.5 million and $131.8 million, compared to net losses of $29.9 million and $55.4 million for the respective periods in 2020. Total shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021 were approximately 70.4 million shares. We closed 2021 with approximately $352.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. This year-end balance excludes the $45 million milestone for the EU approval of TAVNEOS received from Vifor in the first quarter of 2022. Lastly, for 2022 we expect to utilized cash and investments in the range of $120 million to $140 million. Tom?\nTom Schall : Thank you, Susan. Moving to slide 13, before opening up to your questions, let me briefly summarize where we are. After a watershed year in which ChemoCentryx arrived upon the world stage as an integrated bio pharmaceutical company, we have positive feedback from the TAVNEOS launch and the leading indicators of further growth are favorable. We are focusing on our pipeline in a drug approach for TAVNEOS, aided by a world class clinical development function and have advances of lupus nephritis, severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and C3 glomerulopathy in our sites for 2022. CCX559 is progressing through Phase I with initial clinical data to be presented this year and we are in a strong financial position to execute right across the scope of our enterprise. As we join the ranks of commercially integrated U.S. biopharmaceutical companies. I am happy to report that the landmark here of 2021 has positioned ChemoCentryx well.  Our enterprise has traveled far to bring the benefits of medical innovation to clinicians and especially the patients that we serve. We\u2019re also aiming to provide returns for our shareholders. And as momentous as 2021 was for the company, we have only just begun.  I will now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Seedhouse of Raymond James. Your line is open. \nRyan Deschner: Hi there! This is Ryan Deschner on for Steve Seedhouse. I just want to ask, if you guys can give us anymore quantitative detail on patient start forms or on the demand in general seen in the month of February relative to January \u201922. And then also, when do you expect to reach a majority proportion of paid scripts. Thank you. \nA - Dr. Thomas Schall: Yeah, so thanks very much for that question. So we're not providing progress beyond the additional month of Q1 just yet, but again to remind you through January the patient start forms reached 179; patients on drugs reached 141, representing almost an 80%, 79% conversion rate, and we had 140 unique prescribers. So I think we're quite happy with that conversion rate.  That\u2019s accelerating over where we were in Q4, which indicates to us that physicians are having success getting patients on therapy. We're also happy to see 33% repeat prescribers, which suggests to us that physicians are having a positive first experience. And further, we're \u2013 we see the time to coverage decisions are down now to approximately four weeks on average, and that's down from our initial expectation of four to six weeks. So all those indicators are going in the right direction and I think we're pleased with that.  We have an increasing number, an ever increasing number of paid prescriptions as we go forward, and again, we imagine that early on we were making an investment in the patient support programs appropriately to get eligible and appropriate patients on the drug as quickly as possible, with as few barriers, and we think that investment will pay off, and in future quarters I will tell you just how big that ever increasing percentage of paid prescriptions will be. \nRyan Deschner: That\u2019s helpful, thank you very much. And actually if I can squeeze one more quick one in. How many scripts does each patient receive on average; sort of a one for three months\u2019 supply off the bat or how does that work? Thank you.\nA - Dr. Thomas Schall: So essentially we have one month\u2019s prescription and then we renew those. \nRyan Deschner: Okay, thank you very much. \nA - Dr. Thomas Schall: Welcome. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dae Gon Ha of Stifel. Your line is open.\nDae Gon Ha: Good afternoon! Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll stick to one question, but a multipart one if I could if I may. So with regards to the separate, I guess your market research, 66% being Rhum\u2019s and 28% being nephrologists. I guess how are you thinking about marketing wise strategically targeting nephrologists to gain a broader following in that cohort. And also as you think broadly about sort of the feedback you were getting from both, rheumatologists and nephrologists, is there any kind of reluctance or more, I guess stronger affinity by one group of doc's versus the other? Thanks. \nA - Dr. Thomas Schall: Thank you, Dae Gon. Yeah, you know it's true we see more rheumatologists, maybe slightly more than we might have modeled. Having said that, these are very complicated patients and frequently they see more than one specialist, where \u2013 and again, not infrequently their primary doctors are rheumatologists. So even if they have kidney manifestations and are seeing a nephrologist, they will go back very frequently to the rheumatologist and as who writes \u2013 that\u2019s who is writing the script. So I think that that explains in part some of that predominance of the rheumatology part of the equation. Having said that, we're very keen on helping nephrologists as well understand the benefits of the drug. As you know published data suggests that it has a quite marked effect on eGFR improvements, and I think that as the experience in the nephrology community expands and we've already heard some interesting first experiences in nephrology cases and when you start hearing about those either peer-to-peer or at major upcoming meetings in Europe and the United States, I fundamentally think you'll get a lot more attention from nephrology. I\u2019d also say this, look, it's quite early days and this \u2013 the now, the preponderance of rheumatology script writer's versus nephrology may in fact be somewhat exaggerated at this early point. So we'll just have to see how that goes going forward. \nDae Gon Ha: Tom, I'm really sorry. If I can squeeze in one more question, the January trend that you provided today does seem like there is some sense of acceleration in terms of PSS and POD\u2019s. So can you maybe speak to what you're seeing there and the dynamics and to what extent has omicron been still a headwind if you will as you commented two months ago at a competitor conference. Thanks. \nA - Dr. Thomas Schall: You're absolutely right. Look, I think the acceleration looks good. I mean in January alone what did we add, about 50 more patients start forms, so you have 152 and about 50 additional patients on drug just in January alone. Those are really good trends, right. So those things are things that I'm very happy with. Look, let's talk about COVID. COVID is and will be a major factor for all of us and for some time to come. No matter what happens with the current wave of omicron, even if it disappeared tomorrow, nothing is going to change quickly and how COVID has impacted how we can interact in clinical settings, not just we as sponsors, but patients and physician as well. So we can't be naive about that, that's for sure. Having said that, you know I think that despite launching TAVNEOS in Q4 into like a sub quarter and major holidays and the omicron emergence, I think we were really pleased even with the Q4 trends at the breadth of the TAVNEOS prescribers, which includes not just the so called external experts, but the community physicians as well, and yes, both in rheumatology and nephrology.  So look, it has impacted, COVID has and omicron has impacted certainly MSL access and Rep access to sites, especially at the large academic centers or centers of excellence. About 40% of our calls have been in-person and even in January so far with even a bit less than 40%. But that's okay; we planned for virtual visits to continue; we had planned when we were launching to have a hybrid approach. Our team has the tools needed to connect either in-person or online, so we hope that we'll be able to be providers when, how and where they need to be met. So I think overall we got the situation well in hand. \nDae Gon Ha: Great! Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on all the progress. \nDr. Thomas Schall: Thank you, Dae Gon. \nOperator: Thank you. Up next we have Michelle Gilson of Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. \nMichelle Gilson: Hi! Thank you for taking my questions. I guess Tom, just wanted to clarify, the numbers of patients on drugs, that's not necessarily patients on paid drug, right?\nA - Dr. Thomas Schall: No, that\u2019s correct.\nMichelle Gilson: Okay, and then\u2026\nDr. Thomas Schall: That would be all patients on drug at this point.\nMichelle Gilson: Alright, sounds good. And then, could you kind of walk us through you know the timeline of patients of the submission of start forms, to beginning of treatment, and then you know \u2013 did you give \u2013 I don't think I heard you give us any numbers on like kind of the average time that you're seeing reimbursement.  And you know could you also maybe Tosh, one for you. Could you outline for us your strategy around positioning and you know what your core messaging is to physicians around TAVENOS and selecting appropriate patients. \nDr. Thomas Schall: Excellent timed question Michelle. Let's try to take it all in sequence there. So we have \u2013 you're quite correct. Patients on drugs includes all patients on drugs, including those that benefited from our patients spot programs and patient assistance programs. Now you will recall maybe from previous discussions that we had very carefully considered our plan to make sure we were trying to remove as many barriers as possible or early and immediate access to drugs for eligible and appropriate patients, those who are eligible and early, right.  So that's why, early on we knew that the patient support programs, including patient assistance where there is the ability to get on temporary supplies of unpaid medication was so important, and one of the reasons that we continue to indicate that our metrics in the early quarters are most importantly patient start form, patient on drugs and conversion rate. And then that, the revenue line will lag a little while, but overall we believe that lag will be much higher because of these early investments through patient support programs.  So the number of paid folks as we go along grows and that's a trend we're seeing through Q4 and into the, as I mentioned \u2013 into the early parts of Q1 where we've analyzed the data quite closely. Now the time therefore to get people on drugs, again by design, is as we can provide that support and provide services to clinics and patients, can be very short, because again patients assistance can happen before the time that a decision is made on getting the coverage inactive, so that's important.  We have noticed again, that the time to getting coverage is now dropping as an average, it's about four weeks, but you know it\u2019s a wide range. It can be like basically the same day up to several weeks, but about four weeks. So that's a figure that I mentioned, and that's very reasonable because patient access and patient support programs are really designed around that sort of four week window at this early phase of the launch. So I think all of those are clicking in nicely with the program we designed and the metrics are coming out as if the performance in the real world is mirroring fairly well our model performance.  And Tosh, I will turn it over to you for the other part or parts of that question of Michelle about message points for HCPs, etc.\nTausif Butt : Thank you, Tom. So Michelle, I\u2019ll have a crack at your question. So now in terms of positioning and patient time, first of all just to review for everybody. Our positioning and promotion is in line with our FDA approved label. So we are essentially talking to physicians about newly diagnosed patients and relapsing patients, as long as they are both severe and active and TAVNEOS could be an appropriate option to add to their existing standard of care and at the same time reminding them that TAVNEOS does not eliminate glucocorticoids.  In terms of the key messages, we try to keep it really straightforward and hopefully compelling to these physicians. We remind them essentially what we did in the advocate study, which is number one, we\u2019ve replaced the standard glucocorticoids that they utilize for these patients, and when we did that at six months we remind them that TAVNEOS was equivalent or not inferior to the standard of care, and at a 12 months this improved to superiority of the standard of care, and in addition of that there are a few other secondary benefits.  There was a reduction in relapsed rates, an improvement in kidney function as measured by eGFR, an improvement in quality of life, a reduction in glucocorticoid related adverse events, and all this achieved with an 86% mean reduction in glucocorticoids alone. That essentially is the nutshell of the story in 30 seconds. Now clearly we then engage into Q&A with those physicians, but that essentially is a message that we're focusing on. \nMichelle Gilson: Okay. And have you been able to engage a good number of physicians in that 400 top prescriber groups that you guys have outlined Tosh. \nTausif Butt : Yes in terms of outreach, we have \u2013 though January we reached just under 60% of those top 350,000 customers and we continue to get more reach into the months of February.  And the top 400, yes we\u2019ve interacted \u2013 yes, we have interacted with the majority of those as you know, prelaunch with the MSL, and post launch with the MSL and our reps. \nMichelle Gilson: Okay. Thank you so much for taking my question. \nDr. Thomas Schall: Thank you, Michelle. \nOperator: Thank you. And next we have a question from the line of Joseph Schwartz of SVB Leerink. Your line is open. \nUnidentified Analyst : Hi all! This is Will on for Joe. Thank you for taking our questions today and congrats on your recent progress. So one for us, from what we\u2019ve seen in our own K-world [ph] checks and as we saw in the metrics reported today, there are clearly some physicians who are very early adopters of TAVNEOS, which is great to see. So we're wondering what defines an early adopter relative to the later adopters and what do you think the later adopters want to see in order to prescribe TAVNEOS. Any thoughts here would be appreciated. Thank you. \nDr. Thomas Schall: Yeah I, have some impressions. I guess I would say, let's just call them impressions we don't yet have enough data to have sort of granular evidence. But our early adopters, many of them were experienced with the drug in clinical trials. So they were very aware of the way TAVNEOS is used and has been used in those trials. They are very intimately aware of the advocate Phase III pivotal trial result and they are up-to-date on the findings that were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  So I would say many, though not all fit that profile. So I would \u2013 some, there is another group that is a little bit worried about in the era of COVID just how immune-compromised ANCA-associated vasculitis patient maybe as a consequence of their standard therapies, including B-cell depletion. So there are some that are wondering if TAVNEOS could have a role in helping these individuals particularly in a time of COVID and so there is a lot of outreach there. And then there's the third group, which again is a little \u2013 is a pleasant surprise at this point, early as we are in the launch. But these are the community physicians who have a great degree of unaided awareness about TAVNEOS and what the effects of TAVNEOS may well be for their patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis. So we see a healthy proportion from that group, and I think that that's quite encouraging.  Fundamentally I see a lot of interest in the Nephrology community, notwithstanding the \u2013 what looks like a somewhat skewing to rheumatologist being the prescribers in the majority of the script so far. But Nephrologists have been very interested and very vocal with some of their early experiences. So I don't know how public those are yet, but I hope that they'll be coming out in discussions at meetings for the Nephrology community in Europe and in other meetings to come and I hope you'll be hearing about some of those, certainly those case studies from some of the leading Nephrologists that have used TAVNEOS in their patients. And I think that sumps up most of my impressions. \nUnidentified Analyst : Great! Thank you. And if I could sneak in one quick follow-up. Are there any common questions that the sales force are getting or any kind of pattern here that you could talk about? Thank you. \nDr. Thomas Schall: Well I think \u2013 sure, I mean this is a new drug. Clearly people are very curious about how to use it. The label is fairly broad and leaves a lot to the physician's judgment discretion. So physicians are asking questions such as, how do I use this with my current medication on this patient? How do I use it, do I need to start glucocorticoids or reduced glucocorticoids in context of prescribing TAVNEOS and essentially how do I get people started on TAVNEOS. So it\u2019s those kind of things that are questions about access as well and I think we've been able to address appropriately all those questions. \nUnidentified Analyst : Great! Thanks again. \nOperator: Thank you. And up next we have Yanan Zhu of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nYanan Zhu: Hi! Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the progress. So first of all I wanted to understand a little bit better the conversion rate for the fourth quarter. That 71% number obviously indicates a 29% of patients did not convert. Could you touch upon what might be the reason for patient not go on to therapy and then for the January number, interestingly I think as you alluded to, you have a 50 new patients starts form and then 50 more patients on drug, suggesting perhaps 100% of the patients have converted. Could you say whether that's the correct interpretation and what's your expectation for the conversion rate going forward? \nDr. Thomas Schall: Well, all very good questions Yanan and thank you. You know some of it may just be from Q4, a timing issue. So there could have been folks that got patient starts sort of late in the quarter, and then spilled over into the New Year.  So I think what we're seeing is all these kind of rolling, basically rolling averages. So the lag time from conversion earlier, sometimes just talk is the question of again access, well early access was being worked out and refined, also while early discussions around coverage were being worked out, etc. So we expect and we have seen a reduction in the time from the original four to six weeks down to four weeks as people go into the system, and I think that's reflected in an increasing conversion.  I would hesitate to put a number on where we would like to be, but I can say that a conversion rate of around 80% is fairly good and you know most people that get on the drug are eligible for the drug, they fit squarely in the labeled indication, occasionally you'll get someone who either is eligible for the drug or cannot get into the system and even the patient access program is not suitable for them, and those are the reasons that you might have lack of certain conversions. \nYanan Zhu: Okay, got it. Thank you. And if I may ask about any initial feedback on efficacy that you hear from the prescribers and how much of that 33% repeat prescribers do you think is driven by physicians seeing signs of efficacy. Thank you. \nDr. Thomas Schall: Well, you know it\u2019s too early. One, I would hesitate to speculate. Secondly, I think it\u2019s too early to say about the repeat prescribers. Look, I think its good news obviously that we are seeing increasing numbers of repeat prescribers, and again that trend seems to be accelerating in the appropriate direction, so we are encouraged by that.  I am very much hoping that we'll start hearing some early reports on efficacy at the upcoming nephrology meetings, and I would hope that maybe you'll hear some things that you are. I don't know that as a fact, but I do know that a lot of the major players will be at the European, both European League of Rheumatology Meeting and the European Renal Association meetings in a couple of months.  And I would be very interested to hear what some of those folks have to say, because I know they seem to have some patients on therapy. So maybe we'll hear as early as that, maybe there'll be some letters about case studies coming up in the not too distant future. It's really more up to what the investigators decide to do and how they are going to disseminate their information. So I hope that we'll hear a lot more about that in the very near future. \nYanan Zhu: Great! I'm looking forward to those information. Thank you, Tom. Congrats again.\nDr. Thomas Schall: Thank you, Yanan. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed White of H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open. \nEd White: Thanks for taking my question. So you had mentioned this core programs Tom. I'm just curious as to the amount of free drugs given in the fourth quarter; perhaps the dollar value if you have it or the number of patients and then what your outlook is for the year. Thanks. \nDr. Thomas Schall: Sure thing Ed. So we are not giving a lot of detail around the patient support and patient assistance programs. I think it's a little bit, it\u2019s a little bit early to talk about that. Sufficed to say, we have said we have said we made a considerate investment in patient support, patient assistance program, and I think that is paying off for us. I think we're seeing rapid access to drugs matters.  I will give you a little bit more granularity on this. So as we go through January, again, we're seeing an increasing amount of now patients on paid medication. Over one-third of the patients are now on paid medication and that number and proportion seems to be increasing, ever increasing. That is pretty much right in line where we thought it would be at this quite early stage of the launch, and we are happy with the trend line.  Now, we will continue to support appropriate patient access, again with limited and temporary patient access to unpaid product, but again we think that's the appropriate investment as that ought to translate to an ever greater share a paid bottles as the launch progresses, and particularly as folks then get their prescriptions refilled and repeated and they work through the system. So I think we're right on track with where we want to be and I think the trend lines are well within our models at this point. \nEd White: Okay, great. Thanks Tom. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Tenthoff of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. \nEdward Tenthoff : Great! Thank you very much for taking my question. My congratulations too! Really impressed with where you are. In the long term I think it speaks to the profile of the drug.  I wanted to get a sense a little bit for the patient experience. It maybe early, but I'm trying to get a sense for how quickly patients are feeling better, how quickly they can actually start to see some of these kidney function improvements, and there wereimprovements in the other organ systems. How quickly they can start actually \u2013 a physician will actually start to reduce the steroid dose. A lot of really good question, but I wanted to get a sense for sort of what the patient might experience on TAVNEOS. Thanks guys. \nDr. Thomas Schall: Thank you very much. Yes, we know from our clinical work what we have been able to show in the controlled studies. Too early, and we don't have enough real world evidence, although we do have some anecdotes. But we know in our clinical work that we \u2013 for example if you just look at for patients with kidney dysfunction. If you look at the amount of protein in the urine, as measured in a variety of ways, but just say urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, we have shown in many \u2013 well, there are three controlled studies that we ran, and certainly the two were then called. Avacopan was used in the absence of that the daily scheduled oral prednisone taper.  You know we see a really marked reduction in proteinuria within a week, certainly by two weeks; significantly different from those persons that are only on standard of care therapy, which includes high dose prednisone taper. So that can happen within a couple weeks, and if you're a kidney patient with a nephrologist, you're probably being watched very carefully if your Glomerular Infiltration rate is degrading, because that really is the fear and you'll be first watched for proteinuria, may be doing that at home with a simple dip stick test.  So the patient is likely to see results in fairly short order if real world matches what the controlled trials helps. We also know in controlled trials that as a population you start to see an increase in estimated glomerular inflammation rate, which is based on the levels of Serum Creatinine, that's a question that starts with serum creatinine. So as serum creatinine goes down, then estimated glomerular filtration rate is going up. And what we see is, that can start happening quite rapidly as well, at least with population studies from the controlled trials. You know within about four weeks people start to see some inflections in there EGFR. I mean again, if your kidney patient that\u2019s super important.  Now we've also heard about the reports and I think there's a couple of case studies where even a reverse trend of declining eGFR can happened quite considerably, more swiftly than that. So we\u2019ll be \u2013 I think there are some abstracts out there that have been published or accepted. It will be interesting to see more of those reports. So for the patients speaking to their nephrologists, those are all very encouraging signs and they can happen quite rapidly.  We know in terms of patient reported quality of life, again in the Phase II studies. You know even by four weeks we started to see improvements in patients sense of wellbeing, increased vitality. Certainly those were very firmly established by week 12 in the Phase II studies, week 26 in the Phase III study and continuing improvement out at week 52.  So in short, I think the data does support the idea that patients on TAVNEOS ought to actually feel better in fairly short order and whereas when they are on the totaled standard therapy, reporting, self-reporting any improvement in how they feel about their disease, is really rare and I don't know if there are many studies, controlled studies where it's actually been report. So I think that's going to be an interesting feature of the program. We\u2019ll see what the real world tells us in pretty short order.\nEdward Tenthoff : Great! Thanks for that color Tom. \nDr. Thomas Schall: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And next we have Anupam Rama of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAnupam Rama: Hey guys! Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a quick one for me with some parts, which is you talked a lot about some of the dynamic for patient start forms, patients on drugs, you talked about some of the reimbursement trends. I guess specific to 1Q, how are you thinking about some of the seasonal dynamics around the order the quarter give, any growth in that, and it sounds like you have scripts being written for one month. Thanks so much. \nDr. Thomas Schall: Yeah so, Tosh do you have feelings about the trends in Q1 in seasonal dynamics? \nTausif Butt : I think its scripts related to one month. Typically they are approved for depending on the [inaudible] for a period of six months to one year. So we don't have any concerns about the scripting issued for one month.  In terms of trends into Q1, look as Tom alluded to or not really \u2013 Tom just shared with you, we launched to-date, as of end of Jan 31, you can see the continued acceleration that we see in January and we look forward to sharing more details of that acceleration in February and March at the end of Q1 earning. When we look at January launch to-date we are encouraged. \nAnupam Rama: Thanks so much. \nDr. Thomas Schall: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I see no further questions in the queue. I will turn the call back over to Thomas Schall for closing remarks.\nDr. Thomas Schall: Well, thank you very much and thanks everyone for joining our call today. Thanks also for the very stimulating and insightful questions and you may now disconnect. Bye now.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day!",

            "name": "A - Dr. Thomas Schall",
            "content": "Yeah, so thanks very much for that question. So we're not providing progress beyond the additional month of Q1 just yet, but again to remind you through January the patient start forms reached 179; patients on drugs reached 141, representing almost an 80%, 79% conversion rate, and we had 140 unique prescribers. So I think we're quite happy with that conversion rate.  That's accelerating over where we were in Q4, which indicates to us that physicians are having success getting patients on therapy. We're also happy to see 33% repeat prescribers, which suggests to us that physicians are having a positive first experience. And further, we're \u2013 we see the time to coverage decisions are down now to approximately four weeks on average, and that's down from our initial expectation of four to six weeks. So all those indicators are going in the right direction and I think we're pleased with that.  We have an increasing number, an ever increasing number of paid prescriptions as we go forward, and again, we imagine that early on we were making an investment in the patient support programs appropriately to get eligible and appropriate patients on the drug as quickly as possible, with as few barriers, and we think that investment will pay off, and in future quarters I will tell you just how big that ever increasing percentage of paid prescriptions will be. So essentially we have one month's prescription and then we renew those. Welcome. Thank you, Dae Gon. Yeah, you know it's true we see more rheumatologists, maybe slightly more than we might have modeled. Having said that, these are very complicated patients and frequently they see more than one specialist, where \u2013 and again, not infrequently their primary doctors are rheumatologists. So even if they have kidney manifestations and are seeing a nephrologist, they will go back very frequently to the rheumatologist and as who writes \u2013 that's who is writing the script. So I think that that explains in part some of that predominance of the rheumatology part of the equation. Having said that, we're very keen on helping nephrologists as well understand the benefits of the drug. As you know published data suggests that it has a quite marked effect on eGFR improvements, and I think that as the experience in the nephrology community expands and we've already heard some interesting first experiences in nephrology cases and when you start hearing about those either peer-to-peer or at major upcoming meetings in Europe and the United States, I fundamentally think you'll get a lot more attention from nephrology. I'd also say this, look, it's quite early days and this \u2013 the now, the preponderance of rheumatology script writer's versus nephrology may in fact be somewhat exaggerated at this early point. So we'll just have to see how that goes going forward. You're absolutely right. Look, I think the acceleration looks good. I mean in January alone what did we add, about 50 more patients start forms, so you have 152 and about 50 additional patients on drug just in January alone. Those are really good trends, right. So those things are things that I'm very happy with. Look, let's talk about COVID. COVID is and will be a major factor for all of us and for some time to come. No matter what happens with the current wave of omicron, even if it disappeared tomorrow, nothing is going to change quickly and how COVID has impacted how we can interact in clinical settings, not just we as sponsors, but patients and physician as well. So we can't be naive about that, that's for sure. Having said that, you know I think that despite launching TAVNEOS in Q4 into like a sub quarter and major holidays and the omicron emergence, I think we were really pleased even with the Q4 trends at the breadth of the TAVNEOS prescribers, which includes not just the so called external experts, but the community physicians as well, and yes, both in rheumatology and nephrology.  So look, it has impacted, COVID has and omicron has impacted certainly MSL access and Rep access to sites, especially at the large academic centers or centers of excellence. About 40% of our calls have been in-person and even in January so far with even a bit less than 40%. But that's okay; we planned for virtual visits to continue; we had planned when we were launching to have a hybrid approach. Our team has the tools needed to connect either in-person or online, so we hope that we'll be able to be providers when, how and where they need to be met. So I think overall we got the situation well in hand. No, that's correct."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Dr. Thomas Schall",
            "content": "Thank you, Dae Gon. That would be all patients on drug at this point. Excellent timed question Michelle. Let's try to take it all in sequence there. So we have \u2013 you're quite correct. Patients on drugs includes all patients on drugs, including those that benefited from our patients spot programs and patient assistance programs. Now you will recall maybe from previous discussions that we had very carefully considered our plan to make sure we were trying to remove as many barriers as possible or early and immediate access to drugs for eligible and appropriate patients, those who are eligible and early, right.  So that's why, early on we knew that the patient support programs, including patient assistance where there is the ability to get on temporary supplies of unpaid medication was so important, and one of the reasons that we continue to indicate that our metrics in the early quarters are most importantly patient start form, patient on drugs and conversion rate. And then that, the revenue line will lag a little while, but overall we believe that lag will be much higher because of these early investments through patient support programs.  So the number of paid folks as we go along grows and that's a trend we're seeing through Q4 and into the, as I mentioned \u2013 into the early parts of Q1 where we've analyzed the data quite closely. Now the time therefore to get people on drugs, again by design, is as we can provide that support and provide services to clinics and patients, can be very short, because again patients assistance can happen before the time that a decision is made on getting the coverage inactive, so that's important.  We have noticed again, that the time to getting coverage is now dropping as an average, it's about four weeks, but you know it's a wide range. It can be like basically the same day up to several weeks, but about four weeks. So that's a figure that I mentioned, and that's very reasonable because patient access and patient support programs are really designed around that sort of four week window at this early phase of the launch. So I think all of those are clicking in nicely with the program we designed and the metrics are coming out as if the performance in the real world is mirroring fairly well our model performance.  And Tosh, I will turn it over to you for the other part or parts of that question of Michelle about message points for HCPs, etc. Thank you, Michelle. Yeah I, have some impressions. I guess I would say, let's just call them impressions we don't yet have enough data to have sort of granular evidence. But our early adopters, many of them were experienced with the drug in clinical trials. So they were very aware of the way TAVNEOS is used and has been used in those trials. They are very intimately aware of the advocate Phase III pivotal trial result and they are up-to-date on the findings that were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  So I would say many, though not all fit that profile. So I would \u2013 some, there is another group that is a little bit worried about in the era of COVID just how immune-compromised ANCA-associated vasculitis patient maybe as a consequence of their standard therapies, including B-cell depletion. So there are some that are wondering if TAVNEOS could have a role in helping these individuals particularly in a time of COVID and so there is a lot of outreach there. And then there's the third group, which again is a little \u2013 is a pleasant surprise at this point, early as we are in the launch. But these are the community physicians who have a great degree of unaided awareness about TAVNEOS and what the effects of TAVNEOS may well be for their patients with severe ANCA-associated vasculitis. So we see a healthy proportion from that group, and I think that that's quite encouraging.  Fundamentally I see a lot of interest in the Nephrology community, notwithstanding the \u2013 what looks like a somewhat skewing to rheumatologist being the prescribers in the majority of the script so far. But Nephrologists have been very interested and very vocal with some of their early experiences. So I don't know how public those are yet, but I hope that they'll be coming out in discussions at meetings for the Nephrology community in Europe and in other meetings to come and I hope you'll be hearing about some of those, certainly those case studies from some of the leading Nephrologists that have used TAVNEOS in their patients. And I think that sumps up most of my impressions. Well I think \u2013 sure, I mean this is a new drug. Clearly people are very curious about how to use it. The label is fairly broad and leaves a lot to the physician's judgment discretion. So physicians are asking questions such as, how do I use this with my current medication on this patient? How do I use it, do I need to start glucocorticoids or reduced glucocorticoids in context of prescribing TAVNEOS and essentially how do I get people started on TAVNEOS. So it's those kind of things that are questions about access as well and I think we've been able to address appropriately all those questions. Well, all very good questions Yanan and thank you. You know some of it may just be from Q4, a timing issue. So there could have been folks that got patient starts sort of late in the quarter, and then spilled over into the New Year.  So I think what we're seeing is all these kind of rolling, basically rolling averages. So the lag time from conversion earlier, sometimes just talk is the question of again access, well early access was being worked out and refined, also while early discussions around coverage were being worked out, etc. So we expect and we have seen a reduction in the time from the original four to six weeks down to four weeks as people go into the system, and I think that's reflected in an increasing conversion.  I would hesitate to put a number on where we would like to be, but I can say that a conversion rate of around 80% is fairly good and you know most people that get on the drug are eligible for the drug, they fit squarely in the labeled indication, occasionally you'll get someone who either is eligible for the drug or cannot get into the system and even the patient access program is not suitable for them, and those are the reasons that you might have lack of certain conversions. Well, you know it's too early. One, I would hesitate to speculate. Secondly, I think it's too early to say about the repeat prescribers. Look, I think its good news obviously that we are seeing increasing numbers of repeat prescribers, and again that trend seems to be accelerating in the appropriate direction, so we are encouraged by that.  I am very much hoping that we'll start hearing some early reports on efficacy at the upcoming nephrology meetings, and I would hope that maybe you'll hear some things that you are. I don't know that as a fact, but I do know that a lot of the major players will be at the European, both European League of Rheumatology Meeting and the European Renal Association meetings in a couple of months.  And I would be very interested to hear what some of those folks have to say, because I know they seem to have some patients on therapy. So maybe we'll hear as early as that, maybe there'll be some letters about case studies coming up in the not too distant future. It's really more up to what the investigators decide to do and how they are going to disseminate their information. So I hope that we'll hear a lot more about that in the very near future. Thank you, Yanan. Sure thing Ed. So we are not giving a lot of detail around the patient support and patient assistance programs. I think it's a little bit, it's a little bit early to talk about that. Sufficed to say, we have said we have said we made a considerate investment in patient support, patient assistance program, and I think that is paying off for us. I think we're seeing rapid access to drugs matters.  I will give you a little bit more granularity on this. So as we go through January, again, we're seeing an increasing amount of now patients on paid medication. Over one-third of the patients are now on paid medication and that number and proportion seems to be increasing, ever increasing. That is pretty much right in line where we thought it would be at this quite early stage of the launch, and we are happy with the trend line.  Now, we will continue to support appropriate patient access, again with limited and temporary patient access to unpaid product, but again we think that's the appropriate investment as that ought to translate to an ever greater share a paid bottles as the launch progresses, and particularly as folks then get their prescriptions refilled and repeated and they work through the system. So I think we're right on track with where we want to be and I think the trend lines are well within our models at this point. Thank you very much. Yes, we know from our clinical work what we have been able to show in the controlled studies. Too early, and we don't have enough real world evidence, although we do have some anecdotes. But we know in our clinical work that we \u2013 for example if you just look at for patients with kidney dysfunction. If you look at the amount of protein in the urine, as measured in a variety of ways, but just say urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, we have shown in many \u2013 well, there are three controlled studies that we ran, and certainly the two were then called. Avacopan was used in the absence of that the daily scheduled oral prednisone taper.  You know we see a really marked reduction in proteinuria within a week, certainly by two weeks; significantly different from those persons that are only on standard of care therapy, which includes high dose prednisone taper. So that can happen within a couple weeks, and if you're a kidney patient with a nephrologist, you're probably being watched very carefully if your Glomerular Infiltration rate is degrading, because that really is the fear and you'll be first watched for proteinuria, may be doing that at home with a simple dip stick test.  So the patient is likely to see results in fairly short order if real world matches what the controlled trials helps. We also know in controlled trials that as a population you start to see an increase in estimated glomerular inflammation rate, which is based on the levels of Serum Creatinine, that's a question that starts with serum creatinine. So as serum creatinine goes down, then estimated glomerular filtration rate is going up. And what we see is, that can start happening quite rapidly as well, at least with population studies from the controlled trials. You know within about four weeks people start to see some inflections in there EGFR. I mean again, if your kidney patient that's super important.  Now we've also heard about the reports and I think there's a couple of case studies where even a reverse trend of declining eGFR can happened quite considerably, more swiftly than that. So we'll be \u2013 I think there are some abstracts out there that have been published or accepted. It will be interesting to see more of those reports. So for the patients speaking to their nephrologists, those are all very encouraging signs and they can happen quite rapidly.  We know in terms of patient reported quality of life, again in the Phase II studies. You know even by four weeks we started to see improvements in patients sense of wellbeing, increased vitality. Certainly those were very firmly established by week 12 in the Phase II studies, week 26 in the Phase III study and continuing improvement out at week 52.  So in short, I think the data does support the idea that patients on TAVNEOS ought to actually feel better in fairly short order and whereas when they are on the totaled standard therapy, reporting, self-reporting any improvement in how they feel about their disease, is really rare and I don't know if there are many studies, controlled studies where it's actually been report. So I think that's going to be an interesting feature of the program. We'll see what the real world tells us in pretty short order. Thank you. Yeah so, Tosh do you have feelings about the trends in Q1 in seasonal dynamics? Thank you. Well, thank you very much and thanks everyone for joining our call today. Thanks also for the very stimulating and insightful questions and you may now disconnect. Bye now."

After a watershed year in which ChemoCentryx arrived upon the world stage as an integrated bio pharmaceutical company, we have positive feedback from the TAVNEOS launch and the leading indicators of further growth are favorable. We are focusing on our pipeline in a drug approach for TAVNEOS, aided by a world class clinical development function and have advances of lupus nephritis, severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and C3 glomerulopathy in our sites for 2022. CCX559 is progressing through Phase I with initial clinical data to be presented this year and we are in a strong financial position to execute right across the scope of our enterprise. As we join the ranks of commercially integrated U.S. biopharmaceutical companies. I am happy to report that the landmark here of 2021 has positioned ChemoCentryx well.  Our enterprise has traveled far to bring the benefits of medical innovation to clinicians and especially the patients that we serve. We're also aiming to provide returns for our shareholders. And as momentous as 2021 was for the company, we have only just begun.  I will now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator."

            "name": "Thomas Schall",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. Good afternoon to everyone listening. Thank you for joining us. Please move to slide three in our presentation. Today I will cover three important topics that highlight our recent success and outline the significant milestones we expect throughout 2022.  First, we'll take a look at our progress in the early weeks following the U.S. launch of TAVNEOS in ANCA-associated vasculitis. Second, I'll update you on our plan to broaden TAVNEOS into our pipeline and our drug, including next steps that we expect to take at Lupus nephritis, severe hidradenitis suppurativa and C3 glomerulopathy. And third, we'll discuss recent progress we've made and next steps for our unique, orally active, small molecule PD-L1, PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor CCX559 for which we expect initial Phase I data this year.  Moving to slide four, you can see that 2021 was an historic year in our corporate journey. After over 20 years since the founding of ChemoCentryx we've navigated the uncertain and uncharted territory at the frontiers of science, and achieved our longstanding goal of bringing our first medicine to patients, suffering from a devastating and debilitating disease.  Following FDA approval, we launched TAVNEOS as an adjunctive treatment for use in patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis on October 18, leaving us 51 business days in the quarter r post launch. As we launched, we took a final step in our vertical integration. We now constitute and integrate U.S. biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and now markets innovative medicines of our own devising.  It was a long and arduous journey to get here with some 17 years working on the TAVNEOS program alone. But the human rewards in bringing something truly different, to under serviced people, such as those enduring ANCA-associated vasculitis have made it all worthwhile.  January of this year brought another significant advance with the EU approval of TAVNEOS. This means that TAVNEOS is now approved in the U.S., in Europe and Japan for ANCA-associated vasculitis indications. Further European approval triggered a milestone payment of $45 million from our partner Vifor Pharma. We are pleased to share that Vifor launched TAVNEOS in Germany on February 15 of this year, with additional territories expected in the first half of 2022. As a reminder, Vifor will pay ChemoCentryx royalties in the teens to the mid-20's on ex-US sales of one aggregate net sales line.  Back to the United States as shown on slide five, we set out to develop our commercial infrastructure in the months leading up to approval, including the hiring and meticulous training of professionals in medical science liaison physicians, as a sales representative, and in other key roles. As we approached the launch, our initial marketing focus was multi-faceted by design. First and foremost, we sought to educate physicians on the TAVNEOS approved label and supporting clinical data, raising awareness through a hybrid approach of in-person and virtual meetings that provided flexibility in these times of COVID.  Through our commercial team, we are initially focusing on the top prescribing physicians. We calculated that a combined field force of about 75 would sufficiently cover the approximately 3,400 clinicians, comprising key external experts, top prescribers and community specialists who collectively are responsible for roughly 80% of all ANCA-associated vasculitis prescriptions in the United States.  Further, we recognize the importance of working closely with patients, listening to advocacy groups and other active voices in the vasculitis community that it welcomed the arrival of a modern, orally administered and mechanistically targeted medication, which was designed from the start with their disease at mind. Too often orphan diseased patients seem to feel that they languished in a seldom visited treatment backwater, receiving occasionally repurposed drugs that may provide benefits to their condition, but were not designed specifically for that purpose. TAVNEOS was and is different.  Now through branded campaigns we plan to educate appropriate patients on the TAVNEOS safety and efficacy profile, while also employing unbranded campaigns to provide disease awareness. These efforts are designed to support patients in having appropriate conversations with their healthcare professionals. Through these mechanisms we have activated a continuous positive feedback loop that will help inform our actions as we move forward, soliciting and obtaining prescriber and patient experiences in order to support continuous improvement of our commercial and outreach efforts. Let us now move to slide six. As we reflect on our first few weeks post U.S. launch. I am pleased to report encouraging progress. While the headline number is the top line revenue for Q4, which came in at approximately $1 million, including limited channel supply for our agreements with specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy selling TAVNEOS, we have stated before that we believe the best way to track our progress for the first few quarters is by focusing on three key performance indicators.  Specifically during the fourth quarter, these metrics include the following: We received 127 patients start forms or patient referrals from 102 unique prescribers. At the end of Q4, there were 90 patients on drugs and the conversion rate of patient start forms, to patient on drugs was 71%. The result in these key metrics, mark promising progress for a rare disease such as ANCA-associated vasculitis, especially when considering that the launch took place mid-quarter preceding a major holiday season and that was of course impacted by the arrival of an Omicron wave of COVID even before the Delta surge had finally end. As we move through the current order, which will eventually be the first full quarter of commercial activity. The leading indicators are favorable for our expected upward growth curves.  Moving to slide seven, we have superimposed the progress across key metrics from the beginning of the first quarter, i.e., through January. Accordingly, between the launch and January 31, we received 179 patients start forms from 140 unique prescribers and there were 141 patients on drug, representing the 79% conversion rate for patients start forms of PSFs.  Since we are still at quite an early stage, I will also share with you today more largely qualitative color and context and we expect to give you a future quarters, when the qualitative - I'm sorry when the quantitative data will paint a more complete picture than it does today.  On side eight for example, let us look at some of the prescribing patterns that we are seeing. Through January 31, as it relates to what types of physicians are prescribing TAVNEOS we estimate 66% of the prescriptions are coming from Rheumatologists, 28% from Nephrologists and 6% from other treating physicians, such as pulmonologists. As it relates to where these referrals are coming from, while we are pleased with the traction across centers of excellence, we are particularly enthusiastic about the in-roads we made within the community setting as well. This success is in-part a testament to our commercial teams reach, supplemented by the unaided awareness of TAVNEOS that has continued to blossom, since the advocate trial pivotal results were initially released in the New England Journal of Medicine last year.  We are also pleased to share that approximately 33% of positions are repeat prescribers, through January 31. We believe this suggest physicians are having positive first experiences, which we hope to continue to build upon.  Additionally, the time it takes to convert patients start forms, to patients on reimbursed medication is now tracking in line with our expectations, taking approximately four weeks to obtain a payer coverage decision, which we anticipate will continue to decrease over time. What's more, initial feedback from healthcare providers suggest that they are experiencing success now in obtaining reimbursements based on prior authorization, and if necessary appeals for appropriate patients who meet the criteria outlined in our FDA approved label.  As these patients await coverage decisions, we have provided mechanisms for immediate access to treatment for eligible patients through or support program. While we continue to support access per plan via such patient support programs, we are now seeing an ever greater share of paid models as the launch progresses.  Having launched into the unique environment, I'm very pleased with our progress to-date. Apart from the obvious constraints on the availability of in-person as opposed to virtual visits, whether by our reps to physicians or by patients to physicians the Omicron wave led to staff shortages amongst healthcare workers, which in turn means that physicians continue to face capacity challenges seeing their patients in person.  We acknowledge that this is not a phenomenon unique to ChemoCentryx and in any case we plan for an orderly progression in the quarters following the launch, rather than a bold list of early patients which could have distorted the true growth picture. In short, we believe that TAVNEOS has the potential to become a blockbuster drugs at peak in our first indication alone. In the meantime, I look forward to updating you again in a couple of months when we release our full Q1 results. Let us now turn to slide nine, where we will look beyond our current commercial efforts. We have an exciting year ahead from a clinical development perspective as we aim to expand our patient reach by developing TAVNEOS as a pipeline and a drugs and also by advancing our novel-orally administered PD-L1, PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor known as CCX559.  In 2021 as you know, we prioritized and focused on ANCA-associated vasculitis approval. In Q4 we were busy building up a New World class clinical development organization led by Dr. Rita Jain who joined ChemoCentryx full time in October as our Chief Medical Officer, in addition to her role as Director on our Board, a position she has held since March of 2019.  Dr. Jain has enjoyed a distinguished medical academic and corporate career, and is an outstanding leader to take our development efforts to the next level. She will also oversee the post marketing studies on TAVNEOS in ANCA-associated vasculitis which is likely to yield useful supplementary data of interest to physicians and payers.  Moving to slide 10, the biological rationale for TAVNEOS across several underserved inflammatory and autoimmune disorders is compelling, given us unique ability to selectively inhibit the C5a receptor, preserving other functions and components of the immune system.  I will remind us, TAVNEOS was designed to be an anti-inflammatory agent based on its mechanism of action and not broadly immuno-suppressant. Throughout 2022, our focus includes three indicating, lupus nephritis, severe hidradenitis suppurativa and C3 glomerulopathy.  First, we plan to meet with the FDA to discuss our plans for lupus nephritis, a disease in which uncontrolled complement activation has been implicated in kidney destruction. Once steps have been agreed upon, we anticipate initiating a clinical development program for TAVNEOS in patients with lupus nephritis in 2022. This should be followed in close order by another meeting with the FDA to discuss our plans for a pivotal Phase III trials of TAVNEOS in patients with severe hidradenitis suppurativa or HS, which we hope to initiate in the second half of this year.  As you will recall, in our Phase II AURORA trial in HS, TAVNEOS showed a statistically significant improvement over placebo in a pre-specified subgroup of early stage 3 HS patients. To investigate and understand that clinical result, our research at ChemoCentryx has now provided evidence for clear differences at the molecular, the cellular and the histological level between more moderate HS disease for example early Stage 2, versus severe or early Stage 3 HS, a key differentiating feature appears to be a greater involvement of the C5a, C5a receptor access in early Stage 3 disease, versus milder forms of HS. Our data will be discussed at the upcoming dermatology conferences this year.  As for C3G, later in 2022 we plan to meet the FDA to discuss our accolade trial results of TAVNEOS in the very rare kidney disease or C3 glomerulopathy data from which we have here previously. The accolade trial with the largest, blinded randomized controlled study conducted to-date in this indication, and we are keen to review the effects demonstrated in this study with the FDA, such as the evidence for slowing of fibrotic progression indicated by the endpoint of the C3G histologic index of disease chronicity and other effects seen with TAVNEOS administration.  We don't propose to invest in additional large scale clinical work in C3G in the absence of some defined path forward by which TAVNEOS might be used as this indication, due to the long and costly nature of such trials involving for example, serial kidney biopsies, at baseline at other time points, along with the challenges of patient recruitment in this very rare disease. We are hopeful that the data will inform a positive discussion with the FDA and this potentially life threatening disease for which there are no approved therapies.  Last, let me say a few words about CCX559. Our potent orally administered PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitor which entered first in human studies into Q3 of 2021. As seen on slide 11, after dosing multiple cancer patients, we can confirm that the drug is poorly absorbed well at levels that are approximately proportional to dose, and appearing generally well tolerated to-date. Additionally, a number of indicators confirm that immune cell activation is occurring.  Given the physical limitations of large molecules, that is anti-checkpoint antibody therapy example, which may not penetrate the tumor microenvironment well, a small molecule medication has the potential to establish itself in several niches in what many believe could be a fairly short time frame, providing a beachhead from which we could substantially expand clinical development on CCX559 in this very valuable area.  We plan to present initial data from the dose escalation phase of this CCX559 Phase I study in upcoming oncology meetings starting with the AACR in April and we expect to enter a phase Ib/II clinical trial in the second half of this year.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Susan Kanaya to outline our healthy financial situation heading into 2022, which is sufficient to progress our TAVNEOS launch efforts as expected for the [inaudible] activities.

Collaboration and license revenue was $29.1 million for the full year of 2021 compared to $64.4 million in 2020. Cost of sales for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 was $302,000. Cost incurred from manufacturing campaigns initiated prior to the October 2021 FDA approval of TAVNEOS were recorded as research and development expense. Research and development expenses were $18.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $21.2 million for the same period last year. Full year 2021 research and development expenses were $83.0 million, compared to $77.9 million in 2020. These increases were primarily attributable to the manufacture of commercial drug supply in anticipation of the launch of TAVNEOS in ANCA vasculitis and higher research and discovery expenses, including those associated with the development of CCX559. Selling, general and administrative or SG&A expenses were $23.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $12.7 million for the same period in 2020. Full year 2021 SG&A expenses were $78.9 million compared to $42.2 million in 2020. These increases were principally due to higher employee-related expenses associated with commercialization planning efforts and the launch of TAVNEOS in 2021. Net loss for the fourth quarter and full year 2021 were $40.5 million and $131.8 million, compared to net losses of $29.9 million and $55.4 million for the respective periods in 2020. Total shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021 were approximately 70.4 million shares. We closed 2021 with approximately $352.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. This year-end balance excludes the $45 million milestone for the EU approval of TAVNEOS received from Vifor in the first quarter of 2022. Lastly, for 2022 we expect to utilized cash and investments in the range of $120 million to $140 million. Tom?"

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question and answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks.  In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\nArvind Sood: Erica (ph) Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to our Q3 call. I think the 3 key themes for this quarter are continued execution, pipeline advancement, and preparedness to long [Indiscernible] new products. Let's get started.  The slides have been posted. A quick reminder that we use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO Bob Bradway. Bob (ph).\nBob Bradway: Okay, hello, everyone and thank you for joining our call. It was another solid quarter of growth for Amgen with total revenues rising 4% driven by volume growth of 8%, which reflects the strong global demand for many of our innovative medicines such as Repatha and Prolia as well as for our high-quality biosimilars. Earnings per share for the quarter grew 11%, thanks to disciplined management of our operating expenses. Shifting to the future. As we begin to see beyond COVID-19, I believe we've set ourselves up well to deliver attractive growth over the long term.  By way of example, I'll draw your attention to our immunology and oncology portfolios, where we are building on our successful track record through a combination of internally generated innovation and strategic business development, which we expect to contribute to our long-term growth. In inflammation, we're very excited about Tezepelumab, a first-in-class treatment for severe asthma that we hope to launch in the U.S. next year.  Given that millions of patients for whom existing asthma therapies are inadequate, we believe Tezepelumab will be a significant growth driver for us for years to come. This product builds on our many years of success in inflammation. First with ENBREL and now, of course with Otezla. We remain optimistic about the growth potential of Otezla.  And as the next step, we are eagerly awaiting an expanded indication in the U.S. for mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, particularly at a time when concerns have emerged for some potential new competitors. We also continue to grow Otezla globally with the product now available in over 40 countries, up from 32 countries when we acquired it.  Looking a bit further into the future, we expect to bring AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to Humira, to the U.S. in 2023. We expect to replicate the success we've had with the AMGEVITA in many other markets around the world. We're also enthusiastic about AMG 451, phase three ready, potential first-in-class treatment for atopic dermatitis that we're studying with our partners Kyowa Kirin, as well as a number of Amgen discovered therapies currently in Phase 2 for lupus and celiac disease.  In oncology, we're happy with the recent launch in the U.S. of LUMAKRAS, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor, which treats non-small cell lung cancer. And we look forward to additional approvals and launches in major markets around the world as we roll forward. LUMAKRAS joins a portfolio of medicines already generating some $10 billion a year in sales. Several of these Medicines delivered double-digit sales growth in the third quarter, including KYPROLIS, BLINCYTO, and [Indiscernible]. Looking ahead, we're excited about the growth potential of several other oncology assets in our pipeline. We have initiated already our first Phase III trial for Bemarituzumab, a potential first-in-class molecule to treat gastric and gastro esophageal junction cancers. We're also making good progress with several of our internally discovered solid BiTE -- solid tumor BiTE molecules, including one for prostate cancer and another for small cell lung cancer.  In short, we have a number of products now on the market with plenty of room to grow, more coming over the next several years from our pipeline, a compelling discovery research engine to continuously replenish that pipeline, and the wherewithal to take advantage of compelling business development opportunities as they arise. All that gives me confidence in our ability to serve more patients around the world, and to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders.  On a final note, I would like to take my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to patients and to our business. We were delighted to be named last week by Fortune Magazine as one of the 25 best workplaces in the world. And that's a reflection of our people in the passion and excellence they bring to their work. David, let me turn it over to you.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. I would like to begin by welcoming our new colleagues from Teneobio who bring expertise and technologies that will accelerate our innovation. One of our core areas of interest in research and molecular engineering is the development of multi-specific drugs to make undruggable targets tractable.  The Teneobio acquisition combined with our previous incorporation of new evolution and its DNA encoded library technology, provides capabilities to develop both large and small molecule multi-specifics, and is a good example of how we're combining internal and external sources of innovation to advance the R&D portfolio.  More than 60% of the molecules in our pre -clinical pipeline multi-specifics, we will have more to say as those programs advance. Across R&D, we have focused on building a portfolio of complementary assets in certain disease areas to help drive the long-term growth of the Company. Turning to our clinical programs, I will highlight a few areas where we have made significant progress and are advancing multiple first-in-class molecules.  In oncology, one key area of focus is lung cancer. As you'll hear from Murdo (PH), the LUMAKRAS launch is off to an excellent start and the clinical programs remain on track. We have initiated the Phase 2 study of LUMAKRAS mono-therapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer for patients with STK11 mutant and or PD-L1 negative tumors.  We continue to expect the top-line results from the Phase three confirmatory study versus docetaxel, as well as data from our PD-1 combination and ship combination cohorts in the first half of next year. In the TearLab Numab or AMG B-757 Bite program targeting DLL3 in small cell lung cancer for some patients with very advanced disease in the Phase 1 trial have now had responses lasting over a year, supporting our potentially registrational Phase 2 study, which we intend to launch by year-end. Finally, in squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we will initiate a Phase 1B study of bemarituzumab directed against FGFR2b in the coming months. Turning to gastrointestinal cancers, we will begin enrolling a Phase 3 trial of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in 3L+ Colorectal Cancer in the coming weeks.  In first-line gastric cancer, we have initiated the first multiple Phase 3 studies with bemarituzumab, with additional trials starts in the coming months. These studies will address regional differences in the treatment of gastric cancer by exploring Bemarituzumab in combination with either backbone chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor.  Prostate cancer is another area of focus in oncology. With the acquisition of Teneobio, we now have 2 distinct bi-specific T-Cell engager technologies targeting PSMA. We anticipate decision enabling data from the expansion cohort in the 8-cap [Indiscernible] AMG 160 program in the first half of next year and are now exploring outpatient administration.  AMG 340, formerly TNB 585 continues to progress through dose escalation and we anticipate having informative data by the middle of next year as well, allowing us to determine the best path forward for one or both of these PSMA molecules. Finally, rounding out our prostate cancer portfolio is AMG 509 targeting Steap1 which is also progressing through dose escalation. We anticipate having decision-making data next year.  In inflammation, we spoke at length a few weeks ago about the increasing activity in our portfolio of both innovative and biosimilar molecules, regulatory approvals and launches expected in each of the next several years. In the Tezepelumab program, regulatory reviews in severe asthma are proceeding with an FDA action date in the first quarter of 2022.  Studies in 3 additional indications are in progress to investigate the utility of Tezepelumab across a range of inflammatory diseases. In skin autoimmune diseases, the FDA review of Otezla for mild-to-moderate psoriasis continues with a PDUFA date in December. A few weeks ago, we presented results from a Phase II study of AMG 451/KHK4083, the first-in-class dual action anti-OX40 anti body we're developing for atopic dermatitis in collaboration with Kyowa Kirin. These data were very well received by the medical community as there is a clear need for innovative therapies with differentiated mechanisms of action for these patients. We have had productive regulatory interactions on the program and plan to launch Phase III trials in the first half of 2022.  Finally, we also expect Phase III data from biosimilar candidates [Indiscernible] STELARA, EYLEA, and Soliris in the inflammation portfolio next year. In cardiometabolic disease in atherosclerosis through [Indiscernible] trial, Phase III outcomes study of approximately 12,000 patients at high-cardiovascular risk, but without prior myocardial infarction or stroke, is expected to complete enrollment in the coming weeks.  Olpasiran a small interfering RNA targeting lipoprotein(a) and our first RNA-based therapy remains on track to readout Phase 2B data by the middle of 2022 and provides a potential complement to Repatha in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by serving patients whose pathology is not driven by LDL cholesterol.  In conclusion, with an innovative portfolio where approximately 3/4 of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential, and the growing portfolio of biosimilars, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients, and growth for shareholders over the near and long term. Murdo.\nMurdo Gordon: Thank you, Dave (ph). Third quarter product sales increased 4% year-over-year. Volumes increased 8% globally, and we had record quarterly sales for several of our key products including EVENITY, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, and Nplate. Our ex-U.S. business grew 19% with volume growth of 25% year-over-year. We continue to execute our volume-driven growth strategy and see gradual recovery in our business from the impact of the pandemic.  During the early part of Q3, we saw [Indiscernible] in patient care dynamics due to a surge in COVID-19. As we progress through the quarter, we saw improvement in patient visits and diagnosis. Total customer activity improved during Q3, however, face-to-face customer interactions remained below 2019 levels.  Now, let me review some product details beginning with our general medicine portfolio, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha, and Aimovig. Overall revenue for our general medicine portfolio grew 22% year-over-year, with 24% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 15% year-over-year, driven by double-digit volume growth.  In the third quarter, new and repeat patient demand continued to improve as Osteoporosis diagnosis rates reached over 90% of pre - COVID levels. EVENITY which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio had record sales of $149 million for the third quarter driven by strong volume growth. Given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of postmenopausal women, EVENITY provides an excellent therapy to build bone first.  Moving to Repatha, which remains the global leader in the PCSK9 class. Repatha sales increased 33% year-over-year driven by 42% volume growth. In the U.S. we saw 64% year-over-year volume growth. This was partially offset by lower net selling price stemming from an increase in the number of Medicare Part D patients receiving Repatha and who entered the donut hole.  Outside the U.S. volumes grew 24% year-over-year. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high-risk cardiovascular patients. Moving to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales increased 13% year-over-year with 7% volume growth. Since its launch, Otezla has been used by over 750,000 patients globally.  And in the U.S. it is the leader in bio-naive psoriasis patient share. Otezla has 92% commercial payer coverage and is an affordable, safe, and efficacious option for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients. We are now preparing for the anticipated U.S. approval of the mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication in the fourth quarter when we will have the opportunity for the first time to promote the use of Otezla in this patient population. ENBREL sales decreased 3% year-over-year driven by a 2% decline in volume. This is the second straight quarter of slowing volume declines thanks to ENBREL's long track record of efficacy and safety. Together with our partner AstraZeneca, we're preparing for the launch of tezepelumab in the U.S. with an expected PDUFA date in early Q1 2022. Our Salesforce is fully staffed, trained, and has been deployed to provide disease state education. We're actively engaging with payers to ensure access to patients for this breakthrough medicine. We look forward to bringing Tezepelumab to the 2.5 million people around the world who live with severe uncontrolled asthma.  Moving to the hematology and oncology business, sales of our 6 innovative products and our [Indiscernible] KANJINTI biosimilars, collectively totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter, growing 12% year-over-year. Several brands had record sales in the quarter, including Hytiva, KYPROLIS, Nplate, and BLINCYTO. Neulasta Onpro maintained 50% volume share in the quarter and continues to be the preferred choice for physicians and patients. The most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 38% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. Going forward, we expect increased competition to result in continued net price on volume erosion.  Our launch of LUMAKRAS is off to a strong start with revenues of $36 million in Q3 and cumulative sales of $45 million through the end of the third quarter. LUMAKRAS has been prescribed by over 500 oncologists in both academic and community settings. A majority of clinical laboratories have updated their testing reports to reflect KRAS G12C as an actionable mutation.  And approximately 75% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer are now being tested for the mutation at the time of diagnosis. Having been a part of several lung cancer launches in my career, I'm very pleased with the LUMAKRAS launch uptake in the U.S. Thanks to our broad player access and the positive reaction from the oncology community.  I would say the U.S. health authorities have also approval LUMAKRAS in Canada and LUMAKRAS in the U.K. Overall; I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, our record sales across a number of products, and our increasing levels of customer activity. And with that, I will turn it to Peter.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Murdo. I will briefly walk through our third quarter financial results before discussing 2021 guidance. Our team\u2019s quality of execution during the past 18 challenging months continues to provide us with the strength to make timely, prudent investments as we see them in both internal and external innovation that will deliver long-term growth. Let's now turn to the business. The third quarter marked another period of solid performance with year-over-year revenue growth of 4% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 11%. As Murdo described, strong volume growth continued in the quarter with 8% year-over-year growth driven by Prolia, EVENITY, and Repatha and in BLINCYTO. In addition, this quarter includes $147 million of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions previously recorded. In the third quarter last year, the favorable estimated sales deductions were $36 million, resulting in $111 million year-over-year benefit in this quarter.  Our established products, which include Neulasta, Neupogen, Epogen, Aranesp, [Indiscernible] and Sensipar declined 21% year-over-year, driven by volume declines and lower net selling price. These products will continue to contribute meaningful cash flows to our broader portfolio and also to innovation.  We do expect increased competition to result in additional erosion of these established products. Other revenues at $386 million increased 21% year-over-year, primarily driven by shipments of the COVID-19 antibody therapy to Lilly. We expect full-year 2021 other revenues to be in a range of 1.5 to 1.7 billion. Third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year.  As continued focus on execution, productivity, and efficiency fueled investments to drive long-term growth. Including the third quarter's share of the approximately $200 million of operating expenses expected for the full year related to the Rodeo, Five Prime and Teneobio acquisitions, as well as the Kyowa Kirin collaboration. Through focused expense discipline, we now expect full-year operating expenses on an absolute basis to increase approximately 3 to 4% over last year, inclusive of the approximately $200 million related to these transactions. We will continue to execute on opportunities to allocate capital to important internal and external innovation opportunities.  On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 15.8% driven primarily by product mix, including COVID-19 antibodies shipments to Lilly. For the full-year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales, 16 to 17%. Non-GAAP R&D spends in the quarter decreased 4% year-over-year.  For the full year, we expect non-GAAP R&D spend will increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range as we progress our innovative pipeline programs, including the launch of registration enabling trials in lung and gastric cancer. Non-GAAP SG&A expense in the quarter decreased 5%, and we expect the full-year to also decline as we continue our focus on execution efficiency and digitalization.  Non-GAAP, other income and expense, net expenses increased on a year-over-year basis due to increased losses from our 20% share of Beijing's results recorded under the equity method of accounting one quarter in arrears. We expect full-year net expense in the range of $1.3 to $1.4 billion.  We have financial flexibility with $12.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet and strong cash flows. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was a $1.76 per share, an increase of 10% over last year. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2021, we have invested in internal and external innovation to advance our pipeline in 2021 and continue to set ourselves up well for long-term growth. Moving to revenue, based on underlying market dynamics, we are updating our 2021 revenue guidance range to $25.8 billion to $26.2 billion. We are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $16.50 to $17.10. Our non-GAAP tax rate range is updated to 13.0% to 14.0%.  Our capital expenditure guidance remains at $900 million and our capital expenditures continue to include investments supporting our environmental activities, and also support our commitment to attain carbon neutrality. We expect share repurchases for 2021 to be in the upper end of our range of 3 to 5 billion.  We executed effectively in the third quarter and are well-positioned for long-term growth. Before turning it over to Bob (ph), I'd like to thank and recognize our 24,000 AMGN colleagues around the world for delivering another strong quarter of execution. Bob (ph).\nBob Bradway: Thank you, Peter (ph). Why don't we open up the call now for questions and let's remind our callers of the procedures and the request that we limit our questions to just 1 on the first go. Thanks.\nOperator: As a reminder [Operator Instruction]. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Yee with Jefferies.\nMichael Yee: Hey guys. Good afternoon. Good evening. Just a question about the financials and how to think about go-forward, it's sort of a high-level question, but as you think about the results this year, sort of the narrowing of guidance this year, a Company that typically seems to come in on the higher-end and I know there's a COVID pandemic ongoing. How do you think about the push and pull dynamics as we enter 2022? I know you don't give 2022 guidance, so I would just love for you to comment on the high level, realizing we're in a pandemic. Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Yeah, Michael, you're right. We're not going to get to 2022 guidance at this point. I think what you can see are we continued to manage the business effectively. That's I think reflected in the 4% on the top-line and 11% on the bottom-line EPS growth. And we we'll continue to invest in opportunities that we think can deliver growth. We're very clear that as we look at the future we expect to be able to deliver growth for our shareholders and we'll have more to say about that when we give guidance for the next period.\nMichael Yee: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nAspen: Hey guys, it's Aspen [ph] on for Geoff. Thanks for the question. So you previously talked about over 3,000 patient number treated with LUMAKRAS that include some patients on studies. I guess I just want to get a sense of what percentage of that maybe the nonpaying bolus has been converted over the paying and maybe what's the timeline for moving through the rest of that mess. Thanks.\nMurdo Gordon: Hi it's Murdo, thanks for the question. We are roughly at about 75% of early access programs or patients who were enrolled in clinical trials converting to commercial supply. The two major markets where that's happening the U.S. obviously and, and in France. Well, we've not been approved in Europe yet. We do have access to the ATU program in France where patients coming out of our early access program can roll into the ATU program where we're actually a booking revenue.\nAspen: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler.\nChris Raymond: Thank you. I have a question on Aimovig or maybe more strategically your neurology presence. Just for the drug, obviously revenue in script trends is stalled and I think it's pretty obvious that the oral CGRPs that are having an impact on the market. Murdo I noticed that you skipped over that one in the prepared comments.  Maybe just talk about your commitment to neurology now with this market dynamic. Is this a category that we should expect more investment in from a product offering standpoint or is there maybe some other plan here that you could maybe talk about? Thanks.\nMurdo Gordon: Sure. Thanks, Chris. The first thing I would say is, Aimovig continues to be an important product to help patients suffering from migraine, and we continue to believe that there is a large population of migraine sufferers who have yet to be helped by the advent of the CGRP category.  Obviously as the market leaders in subcutaneous category of CGRP products, we have given up share to the orals as they've come into the market, but they've also expanded the market beyond the preventive setting and into the acute setting, and even the preventative setting has grown with the advent of the oral.  We expect that the market still has quite a bit of growth and headroom for growth. We expect to be able to continue to maintain our leadership share position in total prescriptions. We have over five years now of safety and efficacy data in the market. We continue now to have all of the U.S. commercial responsibility for Aimovig given recent work to consolidate what Novartis was previously contributing. So we've actually increased our neurology presence in the last few months.  And then the last piece that we're excited about is we are awaiting our head-to-head superiority data versus topiramate to be published and after which we'll be able to promote that to general neurologists, headache specialists, and even the many primary care physicians who are using Aimovig to help their patients who are chronic migraine sufferers. So a bit of headroom, you're right on the oral evolution taking some growth out and also a little bit of net price in the quarter taking some growth out as well.\nBob Bradway: Strategically, we'll continue to look and see if we can find products that fit well with the franchise that we're building, we'll continue to look for those.\nChris Raymond: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I feel like Amgen went through this period of getting a fair amount of credit for the clinical development in LUMAKRAS program. And we might be entering that phase where a lot of competitors have clinical stage programs on KRAS and we're about to get a lot of data over the next few months. And I guess my question is: What's your best case on how the clinical data across the field shakes out. Is this going to be a PD-1 situation where everybody is about the same or could you end up seeing approaches like wrath on inhibitors etc. to look any different on resistance mutations? And a follow-up to that also, I feel like as we think about Amgen's leadership on KRAS target in the first place, should we expect Amgen to file INDs on other KRAS mutations like G12D or G12C? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Umer, this is Dave. As you mentioned, of course there are multiple competitors coming behind LUMAKRAS. We feel very good about our position. I've not seen anything to tell us we don't have a really outstanding molecule, and many of those are very early, just starting dose escalation. I think it's premature to speculate on potential differentiated mechanism of action or these sorts of things. We also have a very broad-based global program.  As we mentioned, we're now under regulatory review, I think at last count it's now in over 15 jurisdictions or countries including EMEA and Japan where reviews are progressing and those are of course 2 very large markets. So I feel very good about where we are. We've got a large combination therapy program. There\u2019s a lot to learn yet, it took 40 years to get into the clinic and we're sorting out a lot of biology. But I feel very good about the molecule we've got and where we are.\nBob Bradway: Dave, you want to say anything else about our G12D or B program?\nDavid Reese: Oh sorry. Thanks for the reminder. In terms of -- we are interested in other targets, as many of you know, there are 7 or 8, and specific KRAS mutations that are now potentially attractable although they are different on a structural basis and each one possess distinct challenges. We do have some work ongoing and as that progresses, we will say more about that publicly.\nUmer Raffat: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Cowen.\nGabe Daoud: Hey, this is Gabe on for Yaron. Thanks for taking my question. Just for LUMAKRAS to follow-up. So for the data with pembro, that's expected in the first half of next year, can you kind of give us some maybe set the stage a little bit for whether the data will be mature enough for to get a good look at efficacy.  What we have TPS status available for all patients? And then just for the second ship to combination arm that you recently added, any insight you could share into the thinking behind adding TNO -155. Was there any difference in the profile compared to the rev med molecule that you would highlight that might be a better overlap with LUMAKRAS? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks Gabe [ph]. The -- in terms of the what I would say broadly the checkpoint inhibitor combination data, we do expect to have a fulsome enough dataset when we have everything together and present at some point in the first half of next year to I think give good insights to the field about what these combinations look like.  In terms of the various SHP2 inhibitors for which we're pursuing combinations. There are some biochemical differences between those drugs. And I think it's well worth our while given the potential importance and the mechanistic rationale of SHP2 as a combination target for us to examine those various molecules, and so we're pressing forward on all fronts. Thank you.\nGabe Daoud: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Very much for taking my question. Maybe just another slightly big-picture one, Bob and Murdo. I know you pay close attention to what's going on in DC and IBM sitting, where do you think that we're close to having a deal on drug pricing reform and particularly, could you give us a sense of what the financial impact on Amgen would be of the proposed Part D changes.  And then secondly, do you believe that you have any molecules that would be subject to negotiation under the proposed part of negotiation of part B -- selected part B drugs in the current language. Thanks.\nBob Bradway: Thanks, Jeff. It's obviously very premature for anybody to pretend like they know what the shape of the I mean, legislation will be. I don't think anybody has really seen any meaningful draft language. What we are aware of course, is that there's some tweeting and some back and forth between the house and the Senate, including moderates in both, suggesting that they're close in that they think they have a framework that they can align around.  So it will need to wait and see the details. And as you would expect, we will be focused on seeing whether what they're proposing leads to better access for patients to medicine and whether it does that while preserving the ecosystem that enables all of us to innovate the way we do and the way we think we need to for the country. Stay tuned, Geoff, again, it's very premature. I know you guys would love to have a picture that you could share with your investors and a picture that would make some sense, but I think anybody trying to draw one at this point is really doing it in the way of sculpting fog.\nGeoffrey Porges: Okay, thank you.\nBob Bradway: Okay, thanks Geoff.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if we could just touch a little bit on your outlook for product guidance, it looks like you raised other revenue guidance, but you also took down the high end of your total Company guidance and maybe you could just talk about, and that looks like about $800 million swing if you add the two together. So maybe you could just talk about what's the driver there and where you're seeing the pressure. Thanks.\nPeter Griffith: Matthew (ph). Thank you. Peter, here. Listen on the revenue range, were -- 258 to 262 reflects the latest market dynamics as Murdo (ph) shared with you. Volume growth year-over-year from products Prolia, Otezla, Repatha, EVENITY biosimilars. Competition against the mature products, as I mentioned, but could create cash flow producers for us.  The sharper recovery we'd anticipated early hasn't materialized at the rate we projected, but the recovery continues that is steady but more gradual rate as Murdo described for you. So we continue to build into guidance. The mid-single-digit net price declines in '21 and we've got other revenue at [Indiscernible].  The increase year-over-year driven primarily by the Lilly manufacturing reimbursement profit share, which began in the second quarter as we\u2019ve said? And so those are the dynamics around the top side of the guidance.\nBob Bradway: I just Matt, I'd like to observe that relative to the beginning of the year when we gave the original guidance, COVID impact has lingered longer than, I think we thought when we looked at this at the beginning of the year, in particular in terms of the face to face visits and the number of patient diagnosis inside doctor's offices. By now looking through the retrospective scope, it's pretty clear that the surge had an impact on the number of patients going to see the doctors and in turn, prescriptions being written.  So I don't think we're experiencing anything different from our peers, but at the start of the year we were hopeful that vaccines and other things might have made us or enabled us to be further along in saying goodbye to this pandemic than I think we are right now. But again, otherwise, business is performing well and consistent with where we hope to end of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nAlethia Young: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe to follow up a little bit along with that. Can you talk a little bit about with Repatha and Aimovig, some of the selling price pressure you've seen and do you think that it's a slow step down or is it something that just will happen more periodically? Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Alethia, did you say Repatha and Aimovig is that what you're asking?\nAlethia Young: Yeah.\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah. Okay. Sure. So Repatha in the quarter is more a function of what we've been able to do since lowering the price in terms of increasing our penetration in the Medicare Part D population. So we've seen some really nice growth there. But what happens when you grow in Medicare Part D is you also grow in the number of patients that enter the donut hole. And that's what we're really seeing in Q3, and we expect that to continue in Q4.  The good news side of that equation is we're growing nicely in Medicare. We're seeing much less patient abandonment in Medicare. And that should be a compounding source of growth for us on a go-forward basis. But I would expect a pattern of Q3 and Q4, net price drag as a function of the Medicare Part D coverage gap, unless of course that changes in whatever is brewing in DC. But that's how it's happened right now. On Aimovig it's a little bit different.  It's just -- it's really the annualization of contracted business with PBMs in general. There has been fairly competitive activity there to maintain preferred formulary positions on national PBMs. And we don't have the same amount of volume growth on Aimovig, but we do expect that to be more stable going forward. So overall, I think our major price effects have stabilized and we're actually now seeing some good top-line volume dropped to the bottom.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Olson with Oppenheimer.\nJay Olson: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Are there any color you could provide on the pace of enrollment for the Phase 2 study or pass and also any comments you could share, on how you anticipate the competitive landscape to evolve in the Lico Protein, any market with [Indiscernible] potentially getting approved before pasarin Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Yeah, thanks, Jay. In terms of the Phase 2 study, it has actually completed enrollment. Of course these patients have followed for some time. And as I noted in my remarks, we expect data in the middle of 2022. We're quite pleased with the long-term follow-up we've seen from the Phase 1 trial in terms of Olpasiran lowering and the preliminary safety profile of the molecule. That program is on track, or if anything a little ahead of schedule. As you know there is another molecule ahead of us. We have a slightly different mechanism. As a small interfering RNA we like the molecule quite a bit. This is a large population of patients. If you recall that about 50%\nMurdo Gordon: Of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is not driven by LDL cholesterol and probably the majority of that is LP little a driven. So we believe there are many, many patients around the world that can be served by LP literally lowering agents. And so we're quite eager to see the full phase 2b data.\nJay Olson: Great, thanks for taking the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. So we typically ask you about the negative impact of a potential deal in Washington. I was wondering if we can reverse it and talk about the benefits. So to the extent there are any -- a deal which limits patients out of pocket costs, other drug will benefit from increased use here?  What other drugs will you see significant abandonment in Medicare Part D that might take -- might get more use. And second, you've started interchangeability trial for your Humira biosimilars. Can you just talk a little bit about your change of perspective here? Do you believe that interchangeability will be required longer-term to participate in this market and if not, what's the justification for the drug?\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks Ronny. It's Murdo. So hypothetically speaking, should there be an out-of-pocket cap for patients in Part D introduced in some change in legislation, I think it would help in our portfolio. We've been advocates for changes to Part D in that regard for quite a while, where we do think that the out-of-pocket expenditures and the list price equation for co-pays for patients are disincentives to drug appearance and maybe even for initial fill.  So I think products like Repatha, where we are largely a Medicare Part D population could benefit from out-of-pocket caps. Now, it depend obviously what that travels with. Does it travel with more commitment from the manufacturer in the catastrophic phase where we pick up more of the top, so it needs to be equated with other things that could be in any proposed legislation?  But I hope that out-of-pocket caps come into play because I think patients who are in Part D are sometimes treated poorly, and are sub optimally treated because of that. And it would improve their affordability.  To the question on the AMGEVITA interchangeability study, we continue to feel very good about our opportunity with AMGEVITA being in that first wave and potentially alone in the first wave of biosimilars launches to Humira in the U.S., affords us an opportunity to work with payers, work with the PBMs, and with providers to establish a leadership position.  We look at every parameter of bio-similar products and this is experienced from AMGEVITA itself in Europe, but it's also experienced from our other bio-similar portfolio. In the U.S. and we look at things like latex, Reese citrate free. We look at needle gauge, we look at device, and of course we look at interchangeability. So while we don't think it's essential, we think it's just another attribute of the product that could augment our success in that launch in 2023. So that's really why we've initiated the trial running.\nRonny Gal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets.\nSudan Loganathan: Hi, this is Sudan Logan Nathan [ph] on for Kennen. Thank you in advance for taking our question. So first I wanted to ask on LUMAKRAS, so how much of impacts are you expecting democrats having on the updated top end revenue guidance that you updated for 2021? And then taking into account any competition entering the market in 2022, how do you plan to formulate wherever we do guidance based on that for 2022?  And then secondly, in regards to the LUMAKRAS perspective, BICS third-line Combo program for colorectal cancer. Looking forward how this could -- what could this mean for Vectibix? If approved, do we expect some growth in that program if this combination gets through to approval?  And then thirdly, just wanted to ask about the antibody manufacturing agreement with a [Indiscernible] COVID-19. Is that still something we can expect to be included in the other revenue line item going forward, any updates on that, just based on the pandemic environment?\nArvind Sood: Let's take the first question, and we can answer that, and the rest, call me later, this is Arvind from Investor Relations and we can address those questions separately. So maybe we can address the question about LUMAKRAS.\nBob Bradway: I think it was [Indiscernible]\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah.\nBob Bradway: -- Revenue and competition.\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah, more of a commercial question. We obviously don't provide product level revenue guidance, but I'll say this: I've worked on oncology for many years now, and I've been a part of some important lung cancer product launches. And this launch, after 40 years of trying to solve the KRAS G12C conundrum in lung cancer, this launch has been very special and the team has done an excellent job of executing across the payer customers, our provider customers, and of course, for patients and I was very proud of what our R&D organization was able to do in the speed at which they brought this product to market.  And I feel that the medical and commercial organizations have taken the customer-facing stage and the go-to-market stage of this launch extremely seriously and with a lot of responsibility, and so far, it's early days, but so far they've done very, very well. And so I'm pleased with the trajectory.  What we're seeing is many academic centers are changing their testing protocols in lung cancer so that everybody knows if their KRAS G12C status. Many large community oncology networks have done the same. Now we still have a few large community oncology networks to go. So we will be working on those in the fourth quarter. But I couldn't be more pleased with the way in which we've entered the market. And I think that bodes well for our ability to establish a strong leadership position and help many, many patients who are unfortunately progressing from first-lane into second-lane disease before competitors come in.  It's hugely rewarding to launch a product like this where you hear stories of patients who have been told that their options are limited and that they should sign up for hospice care coming at a hospice and getting treated with LUMAKRAS with commercial drugs and responding. And the drug is working well in the marketplace.  We're hearing those anecdotal stories coming back from prescribers and we will continue to do everything within our power to continue to launch LUMAKRAS quickly around the world and help many, many more patients.\nArvind Sood: Right, thanks, Murdo. Erica, let's take the next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe a glass half empty one and a glass half full one. I'll start with the glass half empty. When I look at what's going on with your business, I mean, I think what we've heard on the call a lot is pricing pressure despite your growth and your great marketing strategy. And then you've got a pipeline that's got a lot of competitors that are going to compete with it, because there are a lot of people out there with either similar molecules or competing molecules. On that question is how -- any change in strategy for development and picking the next-generation R&D candidates going forward, or any tool kits or platform that you might need to develop a drug. And then the half-full question is, you have this great opportunity in [Indiscernible]. You did a great job with LUMAKRAS developing that drug. Can you talk a little bit about marketing strategy? Could you have competition here, but you could stay head of that competition with all the drugs that you're developing, walk us through -- remind us of the strategy at Amgen for making sure that you're the dominant player, even in a multi-player environment. Thanks.\nBob Bradway: Maybe we just go in reverse order. Murdo, why don't you start and then Dave can finish?\nMurdo Gordon: Well, not to belabor the point, but again, I worked in the oncology field for a number of years and what I've seen since coming to Amgen is real strength in the legacy of Amgen, which is of course the supportive care products that we have. We've augmented that recently with the launch of our biosimilar portfolio and then most recently of course with the launch of LUMAKRAS.  And when I sit down with CEOs of cancer networks or academic cancer centers, they are very interested in talking to Amgen and they are also interested in talking to us about the very rich pipeline of products that Dave Reese and his R&D colleagues are developing. So I think we're very much a leader in oncology. I think that our commercial position with innovative.  Products and biosimilars and launches of new therapeutics put us in a very strong account position. And I think in a world where a lot of care is delivered in community oncology, our relationships there are extremely strong.  I've been able to make some customer visits this year despite some of the interruptions of the pandemic and most of my visits have been in support of the LUMAKRAS launch, and I can tell you they have been very, very good at working with us to develop testing programs, look back programs, entering flags and EMRs, making sure patients are flagged for treatment.  And it's those systems and those processes that being first on the ground, we should be able to build and sustain. Longer-term, of course, it will be the continuation of being first with indications and being broad in the development of the asset and then supporting it with additional products in lung cancer that Dave is developing in our pipeline.\nDavid Reese: Great. Thanks, Robyn. In terms of tool kits, we could obviously talk probably for hours about the tool kits that we've got in discovery, research, and our clinical trials. Let me focus on just a couple of things for the purposes of this discussion, we are building what I think is an industry leading capability and what I call human data. Which means the collection, integration, and interrogation of data ranging from various omic data? Genomic data, transcriptome data, proteomic data, through clinical trials data, through real-world evidence in real-world data. And it's one of our core belief that the coming few decades will be one by those who understand how to make use of, and in particular analyze for giant tsunami of data that is now starting to wash over us. Now that data of course generates drug targets and pathways. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are building extensive capabilities for the development of multi-specific molecules. Either small molecules, large molecules, or hybrid molecules. About 80% to 85% of the currently validated targets are currently not approachable with existing technologies.  And we are building the capability to go after what I think will be a good fraction of those undruggable target. So I feel great about the platforms that we've gotten [Indiscernible] and am continuing to build on a lot more on this over the next year or 2.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JP Morgan.\nGavin: Hi, this is Gavin on for Cory. Thanks for taking our question. Maybe one for Murdo. Just curious about the expected impact of Tesla's mild-to-moderate label expansion. Specifically, should we expect an immediate uptake in 2022 or just something that will be a little more gradual?  And then secondly, just geographic expansion which underscores a key strategy for the growth profile for this product. And rest of the world has been around 20% of total sales there, just curious if that trend is going to continue.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thank you, Gavin. When we acquired Otezla, I thought it would be a really good adds to the portfolio and our strength in immunology both with dermatology and with rheumatology. And obviously we had to make a certain set of assumptions about how that product would evolve in our ownership. And so far I have to say I'm even more pleased with the strength that the product brings to Amgen.  We've been successful as you highlight in demonstrating the product's efficacy and safety in the mild-to-moderate patient setting, which is a perfect sweet spot for this product, given the convenience of its oral dosing, given the well demonstrated safety and efficacy of the product. We also recently had a decision on the patent for Otezla, which definitely helps make a very strategic product for us, a very important product for the growth of the Company.  And the fit is just perfect. We have integrated the legacy Celgene team fully into Amgen. We've got both ENBREL and Otezla now being promoted in rheumatology and dermatology. And we've seen volume growth improve and most markedly in the last part of Q3, but that continue into Q4.  We didn't plan on a pandemic when we did the transaction obviously, but we've weathered it well, the team has sustained focus and we are well-prepared for the mild-to-moderate launch. We are anticipating a decision on that soon from the FDA. We have the resources available, we have the teams trained, and we have an increased footprint in dermatology in anticipation of the approval.  And we expect to ability to execute very effectively. We also have very, very strong payer coverage here and we think that the majority of these mild-to-moderate patients, and we're targeting a specific subset. We're targeting those patients that have larger body surface area or very difficult to treat areas with topical. That's about a 1.5 million patient population. It's a large opportunity, but we think that the profile of the product, the price point of the product versus biologics puts us in a very, very strong position to treat these patients. The other thing I would add that we expect to benefit from somewhat more so in the PsA area versus psoriasis, but the safety concerns of the JAKs right now, quite frankly, are helping Otezla and the overall perception of our safety and our efficacy. And I think that might bond well for future competition that's currently in the process I guess of being filed with the FDA.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Great, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to change it up a little bit, I wanted to ask around the line extension strategy for tezepelumab and EOE, how you think about the attractiveness of EOE given that it's increasingly caught the attention of larger biopharma. And I guess alongside that, when your partner disclosed the orphan [Indiscernible] designation, they talked about a planned Phase III. Should that be the expectation that you'll move straight to Phase III versus doing some Phase II work here? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Carter. Eosinophil like esophagitis or EOE, as it's called in the field is an increasingly diagnosed condition. Patients with heartburn now who typically would've been diagnosed with Reflux over the previous decade, a fair number of those are now recognized to have [Indiscernible], given the mechanism of action of Tezepelumab, given what we've seen in some of our biomarker and tissue acquisition off studies in asthma, based on eosinophil depletion in target tissue.  This makes a lot of sense, and that is why with our partners, we are carrying this forward into Phase 3 based on the Phase 1 data that we have generated. So I think the evidence package across the molecule here that supports that.\nArvind Sood: Erica, as we're getting close to the top of the hour, why don't we take one more question after [Indiscernible] ask Bob to make some concluding comments.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim.\nKelcy: Hey, this is Kelcy on for Michael. I thanks for taking our question. Could you maybe just discuss kind of your latest thoughts around potential accelerated approval opportunity in the front-line setting for lung cancer? And maybe when you might expect to have kind of a clear path forward one way or the other from the FDA. Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Thanks for the question. The FDA has Jim been generally clear that in the first-line setting, randomized data are required. We are, as I indicated, conducting a trial in patients with STK11 and/or PD-L1 negative or low tumors where checkpoint inhibitors are not particularly effective. When we have those phase II data available, Of course, if we saw interesting data, we would have the appropriate discussions with regulators. But I think the general expectation is that barring significant results, 1, we'll expect randomized trials in front line lung cancer.\nKelcy: Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Let me thank all of you again for you -- for joining our call and we look forward to having opportunity to meet with you in the New Year when we report on the fourth quarter. We obviously have a lot of exciting things happening between now and then.  Again, starting we expect [Indiscernible] expanded label for Otezla to be followed by the launch label for Tezepelumab, and the beginnings of a number of new Phase III trial programs, as we indicated on the call. So, exciting time for us, look forward to a gathering with you in the New Year. Again, thanks for your support.\nArvind Sood: Great. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: And this concludes Amgen's third quarter 2021 financial results conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Murdo. I will briefly walk through our third quarter financial results before discussing 2021 guidance. Our team's quality of execution during the past 18 challenging months continues to provide us with the strength to make timely, prudent investments as we see them in both internal and external innovation that will deliver long-term growth. Let's now turn to the business. The third quarter marked another period of solid performance with year-over-year revenue growth of 4% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 11%. As Murdo described, strong volume growth continued in the quarter with 8% year-over-year growth driven by Prolia, EVENITY, and Repatha and in BLINCYTO. In addition, this quarter includes $147 million of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions previously recorded. In the third quarter last year, the favorable estimated sales deductions were $36 million, resulting in $111 million year-over-year benefit in this quarter.  Our established products, which include Neulasta, Neupogen, Epogen, Aranesp, [Indiscernible] and Sensipar declined 21% year-over-year, driven by volume declines and lower net selling price. These products will continue to contribute meaningful cash flows to our broader portfolio and also to innovation.  We do expect increased competition to result in additional erosion of these established products. Other revenues at $386 million increased 21% year-over-year, primarily driven by shipments of the COVID-19 antibody therapy to Lilly. We expect full-year 2021 other revenues to be in a range of 1.5 to 1.7 billion. Third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses were flat year-over-year.  As continued focus on execution, productivity, and efficiency fueled investments to drive long-term growth. Including the third quarter's share of the approximately $200 million of operating expenses expected for the full year related to the Rodeo, Five Prime and Teneobio acquisitions, as well as the Kyowa Kirin collaboration. Through focused expense discipline, we now expect full-year operating expenses on an absolute basis to increase approximately 3 to 4% over last year, inclusive of the approximately $200 million related to these transactions. We will continue to execute on opportunities to allocate capital to important internal and external innovation opportunities.  On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 15.8% driven primarily by product mix, including COVID-19 antibodies shipments to Lilly. For the full-year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales, 16 to 17%. Non-GAAP R&D spends in the quarter decreased 4% year-over-year.  For the full year, we expect non-GAAP R&D spend will increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range as we progress our innovative pipeline programs, including the launch of registration enabling trials in lung and gastric cancer. Non-GAAP SG&A expense in the quarter decreased 5%, and we expect the full-year to also decline as we continue our focus on execution efficiency and digitalization.  Non-GAAP, other income and expense, net expenses increased on a year-over-year basis due to increased losses from our 20% share of Beijing's results recorded under the equity method of accounting one quarter in arrears. We expect full-year net expense in the range of $1.3 to $1.4 billion.  We have financial flexibility with $12.9 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet and strong cash flows. Additionally, our third quarter dividend was a $1.76 per share, an increase of 10% over last year. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2021, we have invested in internal and external innovation to advance our pipeline in 2021 and continue to set ourselves up well for long-term growth. Moving to revenue, based on underlying market dynamics, we are updating our 2021 revenue guidance range to $25.8 billion to $26.2 billion. We are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $16.50 to $17.10. Our non-GAAP tax rate range is updated to 13.0% to 14.0%.  Our capital expenditure guidance remains at $900 million and our capital expenditures continue to include investments supporting our environmental activities, and also support our commitment to attain carbon neutrality. We expect share repurchases for 2021 to be in the upper end of our range of 3 to 5 billion.  We executed effectively in the third quarter and are well-positioned for long-term growth. Before turning it over to Bob (ph), I'd like to thank and recognize our 24,000 AMGN colleagues around the world for delivering another strong quarter of execution. Bob (ph). Matthew (ph). Thank you. Peter, here. Listen on the revenue range, were -- 258 to 262 reflects the latest market dynamics as Murdo (ph) shared with you. Volume growth year-over-year from products Prolia, Otezla, Repatha, EVENITY biosimilars. Competition against the mature products, as I mentioned, but could create cash flow producers for us.  The sharper recovery we'd anticipated early hasn't materialized at the rate we projected, but the recovery continues that is steady but more gradual rate as Murdo described for you. So we continue to build into guidance. The mid-single-digit net price declines in '21 and we've got other revenue at [Indiscernible].  The increase year-over-year driven primarily by the Lilly manufacturing reimbursement profit share, which began in the second quarter as we've said? And so those are the dynamics around the top side of the guidance."

            "name": "Bob Bradway",
            "content": "Okay, hello, everyone and thank you for joining our call. It was another solid quarter of growth for Amgen with total revenues rising 4% driven by volume growth of 8%, which reflects the strong global demand for many of our innovative medicines such as Repatha and Prolia as well as for our high-quality biosimilars. Earnings per share for the quarter grew 11%, thanks to disciplined management of our operating expenses. Shifting to the future. As we begin to see beyond COVID-19, I believe we've set ourselves up well to deliver attractive growth over the long term.  By way of example, I'll draw your attention to our immunology and oncology portfolios, where we are building on our successful track record through a combination of internally generated innovation and strategic business development, which we expect to contribute to our long-term growth. In inflammation, we're very excited about Tezepelumab, a first-in-class treatment for severe asthma that we hope to launch in the U.S. next year.  Given that millions of patients for whom existing asthma therapies are inadequate, we believe Tezepelumab will be a significant growth driver for us for years to come. This product builds on our many years of success in inflammation. First with ENBREL and now, of course with Otezla. We remain optimistic about the growth potential of Otezla.  And as the next step, we are eagerly awaiting an expanded indication in the U.S. for mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis, particularly at a time when concerns have emerged for some potential new competitors. We also continue to grow Otezla globally with the product now available in over 40 countries, up from 32 countries when we acquired it.  Looking a bit further into the future, we expect to bring AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to Humira, to the U.S. in 2023. We expect to replicate the success we've had with the AMGEVITA in many other markets around the world. We're also enthusiastic about AMG 451, phase three ready, potential first-in-class treatment for atopic dermatitis that we're studying with our partners Kyowa Kirin, as well as a number of Amgen discovered therapies currently in Phase 2 for lupus and celiac disease.  In oncology, we're happy with the recent launch in the U.S. of LUMAKRAS, our first-in-class KRAS G12C inhibitor, which treats non-small cell lung cancer. And we look forward to additional approvals and launches in major markets around the world as we roll forward. LUMAKRAS joins a portfolio of medicines already generating some $10 billion a year in sales. Several of these Medicines delivered double-digit sales growth in the third quarter, including KYPROLIS, BLINCYTO, and [Indiscernible]. Looking ahead, we're excited about the growth potential of several other oncology assets in our pipeline. We have initiated already our first Phase III trial for Bemarituzumab, a potential first-in-class molecule to treat gastric and gastro esophageal junction cancers. We're also making good progress with several of our internally discovered solid BiTE -- solid tumor BiTE molecules, including one for prostate cancer and another for small cell lung cancer.  In short, we have a number of products now on the market with plenty of room to grow, more coming over the next several years from our pipeline, a compelling discovery research engine to continuously replenish that pipeline, and the wherewithal to take advantage of compelling business development opportunities as they arise. All that gives me confidence in our ability to serve more patients around the world, and to deliver strong financial performance for our shareholders.  On a final note, I would like to take my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to patients and to our business. We were delighted to be named last week by Fortune Magazine as one of the 25 best workplaces in the world. And that's a reflection of our people in the passion and excellence they bring to their work. David, let me turn it over to you. Thank you, Peter (ph). Why don't we open up the call now for questions and let's remind our callers of the procedures and the request that we limit our questions to just 1 on the first go. Thanks. Yeah, Michael, you're right. We're not going to get to 2022 guidance at this point. I think what you can see are we continued to manage the business effectively. That's I think reflected in the 4% on the top-line and 11% on the bottom-line EPS growth. And we we'll continue to invest in opportunities that we think can deliver growth. We're very clear that as we look at the future we expect to be able to deliver growth for our shareholders and we'll have more to say about that when we give guidance for the next period. Strategically, we'll continue to look and see if we can find products that fit well with the franchise that we're building, we'll continue to look for those. Dave, you want to say anything else about our G12D or B program? Thanks, Jeff. It's obviously very premature for anybody to pretend like they know what the shape of the I mean, legislation will be. I don't think anybody has really seen any meaningful draft language. What we are aware of course, is that there's some tweeting and some back and forth between the house and the Senate, including moderates in both, suggesting that they're close in that they think they have a framework that they can align around.  So it will need to wait and see the details. And as you would expect, we will be focused on seeing whether what they're proposing leads to better access for patients to medicine and whether it does that while preserving the ecosystem that enables all of us to innovate the way we do and the way we think we need to for the country. Stay tuned, Geoff, again, it's very premature. I know you guys would love to have a picture that you could share with your investors and a picture that would make some sense, but I think anybody trying to draw one at this point is really doing it in the way of sculpting fog. Okay, thanks Geoff. I just Matt, I'd like to observe that relative to the beginning of the year when we gave the original guidance, COVID impact has lingered longer than, I think we thought when we looked at this at the beginning of the year, in particular in terms of the face to face visits and the number of patient diagnosis inside doctor's offices. By now looking through the retrospective scope, it's pretty clear that the surge had an impact on the number of patients going to see the doctors and in turn, prescriptions being written.  So I don't think we're experiencing anything different from our peers, but at the start of the year we were hopeful that vaccines and other things might have made us or enabled us to be further along in saying goodbye to this pandemic than I think we are right now. But again, otherwise, business is performing well and consistent with where we hope to end of the year. Alethia, did you say Repatha and Aimovig is that what you're asking? Yeah, thanks, Jay. In terms of the Phase 2 study, it has actually completed enrollment. Of course these patients have followed for some time. And as I noted in my remarks, we expect data in the middle of 2022. We're quite pleased with the long-term follow-up we've seen from the Phase 1 trial in terms of Olpasiran lowering and the preliminary safety profile of the molecule. That program is on track, or if anything a little ahead of schedule. As you know there is another molecule ahead of us. We have a slightly different mechanism. As a small interfering RNA we like the molecule quite a bit. This is a large population of patients. If you recall that about 50% I think it was [Indiscernible] -- Revenue and competition. Maybe we just go in reverse order. Murdo, why don't you start and then Dave can finish? Let me thank all of you again for you -- for joining our call and we look forward to having opportunity to meet with you in the New Year when we report on the fourth quarter. We obviously have a lot of exciting things happening between now and then.  Again, starting we expect [Indiscernible] expanded label for Otezla to be followed by the launch label for Tezepelumab, and the beginnings of a number of new Phase III trial programs, as we indicated on the call. So, exciting time for us, look forward to a gathering with you in the New Year. Again, thanks for your support."

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave (ph). Third quarter product sales increased 4% year-over-year. Volumes increased 8% globally, and we had record quarterly sales for several of our key products including EVENITY, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, and Nplate. Our ex-U.S. business grew 19% with volume growth of 25% year-over-year. We continue to execute our volume-driven growth strategy and see gradual recovery in our business from the impact of the pandemic.  During the early part of Q3, we saw [Indiscernible] in patient care dynamics due to a surge in COVID-19. As we progress through the quarter, we saw improvement in patient visits and diagnosis. Total customer activity improved during Q3, however, face-to-face customer interactions remained below 2019 levels.  Now, let me review some product details beginning with our general medicine portfolio, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha, and Aimovig. Overall revenue for our general medicine portfolio grew 22% year-over-year, with 24% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 15% year-over-year, driven by double-digit volume growth.  In the third quarter, new and repeat patient demand continued to improve as Osteoporosis diagnosis rates reached over 90% of pre - COVID levels. EVENITY which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio had record sales of $149 million for the third quarter driven by strong volume growth. Given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of postmenopausal women, EVENITY provides an excellent therapy to build bone first.  Moving to Repatha, which remains the global leader in the PCSK9 class. Repatha sales increased 33% year-over-year driven by 42% volume growth. In the U.S. we saw 64% year-over-year volume growth. This was partially offset by lower net selling price stemming from an increase in the number of Medicare Part D patients receiving Repatha and who entered the donut hole.  Outside the U.S. volumes grew 24% year-over-year. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high-risk cardiovascular patients. Moving to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales increased 13% year-over-year with 7% volume growth. Since its launch, Otezla has been used by over 750,000 patients globally.  And in the U.S. it is the leader in bio-naive psoriasis patient share. Otezla has 92% commercial payer coverage and is an affordable, safe, and efficacious option for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients. We are now preparing for the anticipated U.S. approval of the mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication in the fourth quarter when we will have the opportunity for the first time to promote the use of Otezla in this patient population. ENBREL sales decreased 3% year-over-year driven by a 2% decline in volume. This is the second straight quarter of slowing volume declines thanks to ENBREL's long track record of efficacy and safety. Together with our partner AstraZeneca, we're preparing for the launch of tezepelumab in the U.S. with an expected PDUFA date in early Q1 2022. Our Salesforce is fully staffed, trained, and has been deployed to provide disease state education. We're actively engaging with payers to ensure access to patients for this breakthrough medicine. We look forward to bringing Tezepelumab to the 2.5 million people around the world who live with severe uncontrolled asthma.  Moving to the hematology and oncology business, sales of our 6 innovative products and our [Indiscernible] KANJINTI biosimilars, collectively totaled $1.8 billion in the quarter, growing 12% year-over-year. Several brands had record sales in the quarter, including Hytiva, KYPROLIS, Nplate, and BLINCYTO. Neulasta Onpro maintained 50% volume share in the quarter and continues to be the preferred choice for physicians and patients. The most recent published average selling price for Neulasta in the U.S. declined 38% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. Going forward, we expect increased competition to result in continued net price on volume erosion.  Our launch of LUMAKRAS is off to a strong start with revenues of $36 million in Q3 and cumulative sales of $45 million through the end of the third quarter. LUMAKRAS has been prescribed by over 500 oncologists in both academic and community settings. A majority of clinical laboratories have updated their testing reports to reflect KRAS G12C as an actionable mutation.  And approximately 75% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer are now being tested for the mutation at the time of diagnosis. Having been a part of several lung cancer launches in my career, I'm very pleased with the LUMAKRAS launch uptake in the U.S. Thanks to our broad player access and the positive reaction from the oncology community.  I would say the U.S. health authorities have also approval LUMAKRAS in Canada and LUMAKRAS in the U.K. Overall; I'm pleased with our results for the quarter, our record sales across a number of products, and our increasing levels of customer activity. And with that, I will turn it to Peter. Hi it's Murdo, thanks for the question. We are roughly at about 75% of early access programs or patients who were enrolled in clinical trials converting to commercial supply. The two major markets where that's happening the U.S. obviously and, and in France. Well, we've not been approved in Europe yet. We do have access to the ATU program in France where patients coming out of our early access program can roll into the ATU program where we're actually a booking revenue. Sure. Thanks, Chris. The first thing I would say is, Aimovig continues to be an important product to help patients suffering from migraine, and we continue to believe that there is a large population of migraine sufferers who have yet to be helped by the advent of the CGRP category.  Obviously as the market leaders in subcutaneous category of CGRP products, we have given up share to the orals as they've come into the market, but they've also expanded the market beyond the preventive setting and into the acute setting, and even the preventative setting has grown with the advent of the oral.  We expect that the market still has quite a bit of growth and headroom for growth. We expect to be able to continue to maintain our leadership share position in total prescriptions. We have over five years now of safety and efficacy data in the market. We continue now to have all of the U.S. commercial responsibility for Aimovig given recent work to consolidate what Novartis was previously contributing. So we've actually increased our neurology presence in the last few months.  And then the last piece that we're excited about is we are awaiting our head-to-head superiority data versus topiramate to be published and after which we'll be able to promote that to general neurologists, headache specialists, and even the many primary care physicians who are using Aimovig to help their patients who are chronic migraine sufferers. So a bit of headroom, you're right on the oral evolution taking some growth out and also a little bit of net price in the quarter taking some growth out as well. Yeah. Okay. Sure. So Repatha in the quarter is more a function of what we've been able to do since lowering the price in terms of increasing our penetration in the Medicare Part D population. So we've seen some really nice growth there. But what happens when you grow in Medicare Part D is you also grow in the number of patients that enter the donut hole. And that's what we're really seeing in Q3, and we expect that to continue in Q4.  The good news side of that equation is we're growing nicely in Medicare. We're seeing much less patient abandonment in Medicare. And that should be a compounding source of growth for us on a go-forward basis. But I would expect a pattern of Q3 and Q4, net price drag as a function of the Medicare Part D coverage gap, unless of course that changes in whatever is brewing in DC. But that's how it's happened right now. On Aimovig it's a little bit different.  It's just -- it's really the annualization of contracted business with PBMs in general. There has been fairly competitive activity there to maintain preferred formulary positions on national PBMs. And we don't have the same amount of volume growth on Aimovig, but we do expect that to be more stable going forward. So overall, I think our major price effects have stabilized and we're actually now seeing some good top-line volume dropped to the bottom. Of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is not driven by LDL cholesterol and probably the majority of that is LP little a driven. So we believe there are many, many patients around the world that can be served by LP literally lowering agents. And so we're quite eager to see the full phase 2b data. Thanks Ronny. It's Murdo. So hypothetically speaking, should there be an out-of-pocket cap for patients in Part D introduced in some change in legislation, I think it would help in our portfolio. We've been advocates for changes to Part D in that regard for quite a while, where we do think that the out-of-pocket expenditures and the list price equation for co-pays for patients are disincentives to drug appearance and maybe even for initial fill.  So I think products like Repatha, where we are largely a Medicare Part D population could benefit from out-of-pocket caps. Now, it depend obviously what that travels with. Does it travel with more commitment from the manufacturer in the catastrophic phase where we pick up more of the top, so it needs to be equated with other things that could be in any proposed legislation?  But I hope that out-of-pocket caps come into play because I think patients who are in Part D are sometimes treated poorly, and are sub optimally treated because of that. And it would improve their affordability.  To the question on the AMGEVITA interchangeability study, we continue to feel very good about our opportunity with AMGEVITA being in that first wave and potentially alone in the first wave of biosimilars launches to Humira in the U.S., affords us an opportunity to work with payers, work with the PBMs, and with providers to establish a leadership position.  We look at every parameter of bio-similar products and this is experienced from AMGEVITA itself in Europe, but it's also experienced from our other bio-similar portfolio. In the U.S. and we look at things like latex, Reese citrate free. We look at needle gauge, we look at device, and of course we look at interchangeability. So while we don't think it's essential, we think it's just another attribute of the product that could augment our success in that launch in 2023. So that's really why we've initiated the trial running. Yeah. Yeah, more of a commercial question. We obviously don't provide product level revenue guidance, but I'll say this: I've worked on oncology for many years now, and I've been a part of some important lung cancer product launches. And this launch, after 40 years of trying to solve the KRAS G12C conundrum in lung cancer, this launch has been very special and the team has done an excellent job of executing across the payer customers, our provider customers, and of course, for patients and I was very proud of what our R&D organization was able to do in the speed at which they brought this product to market.  And I feel that the medical and commercial organizations have taken the customer-facing stage and the go-to-market stage of this launch extremely seriously and with a lot of responsibility, and so far, it's early days, but so far they've done very, very well. And so I'm pleased with the trajectory.  What we're seeing is many academic centers are changing their testing protocols in lung cancer so that everybody knows if their KRAS G12C status. Many large community oncology networks have done the same. Now we still have a few large community oncology networks to go. So we will be working on those in the fourth quarter. But I couldn't be more pleased with the way in which we've entered the market. And I think that bodes well for our ability to establish a strong leadership position and help many, many patients who are unfortunately progressing from first-lane into second-lane disease before competitors come in.  It's hugely rewarding to launch a product like this where you hear stories of patients who have been told that their options are limited and that they should sign up for hospice care coming at a hospice and getting treated with LUMAKRAS with commercial drugs and responding. And the drug is working well in the marketplace.  We're hearing those anecdotal stories coming back from prescribers and we will continue to do everything within our power to continue to launch LUMAKRAS quickly around the world and help many, many more patients. Well, not to belabor the point, but again, I worked in the oncology field for a number of years and what I've seen since coming to Amgen is real strength in the legacy of Amgen, which is of course the supportive care products that we have. We've augmented that recently with the launch of our biosimilar portfolio and then most recently of course with the launch of LUMAKRAS.  And when I sit down with CEOs of cancer networks or academic cancer centers, they are very interested in talking to Amgen and they are also interested in talking to us about the very rich pipeline of products that Dave Reese and his R&D colleagues are developing. So I think we're very much a leader in oncology. I think that our commercial position with innovative.  Products and biosimilars and launches of new therapeutics put us in a very strong account position. And I think in a world where a lot of care is delivered in community oncology, our relationships there are extremely strong.  I've been able to make some customer visits this year despite some of the interruptions of the pandemic and most of my visits have been in support of the LUMAKRAS launch, and I can tell you they have been very, very good at working with us to develop testing programs, look back programs, entering flags and EMRs, making sure patients are flagged for treatment.  And it's those systems and those processes that being first on the ground, we should be able to build and sustain. Longer-term, of course, it will be the continuation of being first with indications and being broad in the development of the asset and then supporting it with additional products in lung cancer that Dave is developing in our pipeline. Yes. Thank you, Gavin. When we acquired Otezla, I thought it would be a really good adds to the portfolio and our strength in immunology both with dermatology and with rheumatology. And obviously we had to make a certain set of assumptions about how that product would evolve in our ownership. And so far I have to say I'm even more pleased with the strength that the product brings to Amgen.  We've been successful as you highlight in demonstrating the product's efficacy and safety in the mild-to-moderate patient setting, which is a perfect sweet spot for this product, given the convenience of its oral dosing, given the well demonstrated safety and efficacy of the product. We also recently had a decision on the patent for Otezla, which definitely helps make a very strategic product for us, a very important product for the growth of the Company.  And the fit is just perfect. We have integrated the legacy Celgene team fully into Amgen. We've got both ENBREL and Otezla now being promoted in rheumatology and dermatology. And we've seen volume growth improve and most markedly in the last part of Q3, but that continue into Q4.  We didn't plan on a pandemic when we did the transaction obviously, but we've weathered it well, the team has sustained focus and we are well-prepared for the mild-to-moderate launch. We are anticipating a decision on that soon from the FDA. We have the resources available, we have the teams trained, and we have an increased footprint in dermatology in anticipation of the approval.  And we expect to ability to execute very effectively. We also have very, very strong payer coverage here and we think that the majority of these mild-to-moderate patients, and we're targeting a specific subset. We're targeting those patients that have larger body surface area or very difficult to treat areas with topical. That's about a 1.5 million patient population. It's a large opportunity, but we think that the profile of the product, the price point of the product versus biologics puts us in a very, very strong position to treat these patients. The other thing I would add that we expect to benefit from somewhat more so in the PsA area versus psoriasis, but the safety concerns of the JAKs right now, quite frankly, are helping Otezla and the overall perception of our safety and our efficacy. And I think that might bond well for future competition that's currently in the process I guess of being filed with the FDA."

            "name": "David Reese",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. I would like to begin by welcoming our new colleagues from Teneobio who bring expertise and technologies that will accelerate our innovation. One of our core areas of interest in research and molecular engineering is the development of multi-specific drugs to make undruggable targets tractable.  The Teneobio acquisition combined with our previous incorporation of new evolution and its DNA encoded library technology, provides capabilities to develop both large and small molecule multi-specifics, and is a good example of how we're combining internal and external sources of innovation to advance the R&D portfolio.  More than 60% of the molecules in our pre -clinical pipeline multi-specifics, we will have more to say as those programs advance. Across R&D, we have focused on building a portfolio of complementary assets in certain disease areas to help drive the long-term growth of the Company. Turning to our clinical programs, I will highlight a few areas where we have made significant progress and are advancing multiple first-in-class molecules.  In oncology, one key area of focus is lung cancer. As you'll hear from Murdo (PH), the LUMAKRAS launch is off to an excellent start and the clinical programs remain on track. We have initiated the Phase 2 study of LUMAKRAS mono-therapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer for patients with STK11 mutant and or PD-L1 negative tumors.  We continue to expect the top-line results from the Phase three confirmatory study versus docetaxel, as well as data from our PD-1 combination and ship combination cohorts in the first half of next year. In the TearLab Numab or AMG B-757 Bite program targeting DLL3 in small cell lung cancer for some patients with very advanced disease in the Phase 1 trial have now had responses lasting over a year, supporting our potentially registrational Phase 2 study, which we intend to launch by year-end. Finally, in squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we will initiate a Phase 1B study of bemarituzumab directed against FGFR2b in the coming months. Turning to gastrointestinal cancers, we will begin enrolling a Phase 3 trial of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in 3L+ Colorectal Cancer in the coming weeks.  In first-line gastric cancer, we have initiated the first multiple Phase 3 studies with bemarituzumab, with additional trials starts in the coming months. These studies will address regional differences in the treatment of gastric cancer by exploring Bemarituzumab in combination with either backbone chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor.  Prostate cancer is another area of focus in oncology. With the acquisition of Teneobio, we now have 2 distinct bi-specific T-Cell engager technologies targeting PSMA. We anticipate decision enabling data from the expansion cohort in the 8-cap [Indiscernible] AMG 160 program in the first half of next year and are now exploring outpatient administration.  AMG 340, formerly TNB 585 continues to progress through dose escalation and we anticipate having informative data by the middle of next year as well, allowing us to determine the best path forward for one or both of these PSMA molecules. Finally, rounding out our prostate cancer portfolio is AMG 509 targeting Steap1 which is also progressing through dose escalation. We anticipate having decision-making data next year.  In inflammation, we spoke at length a few weeks ago about the increasing activity in our portfolio of both innovative and biosimilar molecules, regulatory approvals and launches expected in each of the next several years. In the Tezepelumab program, regulatory reviews in severe asthma are proceeding with an FDA action date in the first quarter of 2022.  Studies in 3 additional indications are in progress to investigate the utility of Tezepelumab across a range of inflammatory diseases. In skin autoimmune diseases, the FDA review of Otezla for mild-to-moderate psoriasis continues with a PDUFA date in December. A few weeks ago, we presented results from a Phase II study of AMG 451/KHK4083, the first-in-class dual action anti-OX40 anti body we're developing for atopic dermatitis in collaboration with Kyowa Kirin. These data were very well received by the medical community as there is a clear need for innovative therapies with differentiated mechanisms of action for these patients. We have had productive regulatory interactions on the program and plan to launch Phase III trials in the first half of 2022.  Finally, we also expect Phase III data from biosimilar candidates [Indiscernible] STELARA, EYLEA, and Soliris in the inflammation portfolio next year. In cardiometabolic disease in atherosclerosis through [Indiscernible] trial, Phase III outcomes study of approximately 12,000 patients at high-cardiovascular risk, but without prior myocardial infarction or stroke, is expected to complete enrollment in the coming weeks.  Olpasiran a small interfering RNA targeting lipoprotein(a) and our first RNA-based therapy remains on track to readout Phase 2B data by the middle of 2022 and provides a potential complement to Repatha in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by serving patients whose pathology is not driven by LDL cholesterol.  In conclusion, with an innovative portfolio where approximately 3/4 of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential, and the growing portfolio of biosimilars, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients, and growth for shareholders over the near and long term. Murdo. Thanks, Umer, this is Dave. As you mentioned, of course there are multiple competitors coming behind LUMAKRAS. We feel very good about our position. I've not seen anything to tell us we don't have a really outstanding molecule, and many of those are very early, just starting dose escalation. I think it's premature to speculate on potential differentiated mechanism of action or these sorts of things. We also have a very broad-based global program.  As we mentioned, we're now under regulatory review, I think at last count it's now in over 15 jurisdictions or countries including EMEA and Japan where reviews are progressing and those are of course 2 very large markets. So I feel very good about where we are. We've got a large combination therapy program. There's a lot to learn yet, it took 40 years to get into the clinic and we're sorting out a lot of biology. But I feel very good about the molecule we've got and where we are. Oh sorry. Thanks for the reminder. In terms of -- we are interested in other targets, as many of you know, there are 7 or 8, and specific KRAS mutations that are now potentially attractable although they are different on a structural basis and each one possess distinct challenges. We do have some work ongoing and as that progresses, we will say more about that publicly. Yes. Thanks Gabe [ph]. The -- in terms of the what I would say broadly the checkpoint inhibitor combination data, we do expect to have a fulsome enough dataset when we have everything together and present at some point in the first half of next year to I think give good insights to the field about what these combinations look like.  In terms of the various SHP2 inhibitors for which we're pursuing combinations. There are some biochemical differences between those drugs. And I think it's well worth our while given the potential importance and the mechanistic rationale of SHP2 as a combination target for us to examine those various molecules, and so we're pressing forward on all fronts. Thank you. Great. Thanks, Robyn. In terms of tool kits, we could obviously talk probably for hours about the tool kits that we've got in discovery, research, and our clinical trials. Let me focus on just a couple of things for the purposes of this discussion, we are building what I think is an industry leading capability and what I call human data. Which means the collection, integration, and interrogation of data ranging from various omic data? Genomic data, transcriptome data, proteomic data, through clinical trials data, through real-world evidence in real-world data. And it's one of our core belief that the coming few decades will be one by those who understand how to make use of, and in particular analyze for giant tsunami of data that is now starting to wash over us. Now that data of course generates drug targets and pathways. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are building extensive capabilities for the development of multi-specific molecules. Either small molecules, large molecules, or hybrid molecules. About 80% to 85% of the currently validated targets are currently not approachable with existing technologies.  And we are building the capability to go after what I think will be a good fraction of those undruggable target. So I feel great about the platforms that we've gotten [Indiscernible] and am continuing to build on a lot more on this over the next year or 2. Thanks, Carter. Eosinophil like esophagitis or EOE, as it's called in the field is an increasingly diagnosed condition. Patients with heartburn now who typically would've been diagnosed with Reflux over the previous decade, a fair number of those are now recognized to have [Indiscernible], given the mechanism of action of Tezepelumab, given what we've seen in some of our biomarker and tissue acquisition off studies in asthma, based on eosinophil depletion in target tissue.  This makes a lot of sense, and that is why with our partners, we are carrying this forward into Phase 3 based on the Phase 1 data that we have generated. So I think the evidence package across the molecule here that supports that. Thanks for the question. The FDA has Jim been generally clear that in the first-line setting, randomized data are required. We are, as I indicated, conducting a trial in patients with STK11 and/or PD-L1 negative or low tumors where checkpoint inhibitors are not particularly effective. When we have those phase II data available, Of course, if we saw interesting data, we would have the appropriate discussions with regulators. But I think the general expectation is that barring significant results, 1, we'll expect randomized trials in front line lung cancer."

        "content": "Operator: This is Erica and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to make sure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\nArvind Sood: Erica, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to our Q2 call. I think the 3 key themes for this quarter are great execution in a challenging environment, pipeline advancement, and smart and strategic business development. Lots to cover, so let's jump right in. Slides are up. A quick reminder that we will use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation. And some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob?\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello everyone and thank you for joining our call. Through the first six months of the year, Amgen has continued to execute well, driving demand for our current products globally while also paving the way for growth from future products. Total revenues in the second quarter increased 5% over the prior year, and 11% over the prior quarter. We achieved this growth despite the lingering effects of COVID-19 and increased competition in many of our therapeutic categories.  We continue to see strong volume-driven growth from Repatha, Otezla, Prolia, and EVENITY, and a number of our oncology biosimilar -- oncology medicines as well, all of which address significant health challenges. We also saw strong growth in the quarter from our biosimilars, supporting our commitment to deliver value to healthcare systems around the world. We generated volume growth of 22% outside the United States, and we're particularly encouraged by our progress in the Asia-Pacific region, where two notable approvals in the second quarter should provide additional growth moving forward.  In China, our partner BeiGenesecured approval for Kyprolis, which joins BLINCYTO and XGEVA in our oncology collaboration there. And in Japan, the approval of Aimovig for migraine marks another important milestone for us in that market. In the U.S., we're excited by the strong launch of LUMAKRAS, which is providing hope to lung cancer patients in need of new treatment options. We\u2019ve very pleased with the enthusiasm LUMAKRAS has generated in the oncology community.  We're also excited that the FDA granted priority review to Tezepelumab, further confirming our belief that it offers significant advantages over currently available treatment alternatives for people with severe asthma, a debilitating disease that affects millions worldwide. We've long sought to complement our internal innovation efforts with the best available external innovation. And in the first half of this year, we've executed on several compelling business development transactions which fits squarely in our stated areas of interest.  The acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics and our partnership with Kyowa Kirin, for example, have added to potential first-in-class phase 3 ready assets in cancer and inflammation, two therapeutic categories where there remains a high unmet need. The acquisition of Teneobio, which Dave will address in a moment, will significantly strengthen our protein engineering capabilities across therapeutic areas. Our strong balance sheet and cash flows will enable us to take advantage of additional business development opportunities like these as they arise.  All the work we do is focused on advancing our mission to serve patients and to do so in a way that helps to address the many challenges facing society. You may have seen our recently announced plans to invest approximately $1 billion to build two new manufacturing facilities, one in North Carolina and the other in Ohio, to meet the demand for our medicines. Both facilities will utilize cutting-edge technologies to be much more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional plants, supporting our goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2027.  Both plants will also draw from very diverse talent pools as we, along with a number of other large companies that are part of the OneTen coalition, look to collectively hire 1 million black Americans into well-paying jobs over the next 10 years. You can learn more about our commitment to good corporate citizenship by reading our ESG report, which can be found in the responsibility section of Amgen.com. Finally, before I turn things over to Murdo, let me thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to serving patients around the world and delivering strong performance across all aspects of our business. Murdo, over to you.\nMurdo Gordon: Thank you, Bob. Second-quarter product sales increased 3% year-over-year. Volumes increased 8%, driven by double-digit growth across a number of our products, including Prolia, Repatha, and our biosimilar products MVASI and KANJINTI. Our ex-U.S. business grew 18% with a volume growth of 22% year-over-year. We continued to see a gradual recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Q2 when compared to Q1 2021. Patient visits and lab test procedure trends continued to improve but remained below pre-COVID-19 levels.  We remain focused on customer execution. Overall, U.S. field activity improved quarter-over-quarter reaching 80% of pre-COVID levels. Face-to-face customer interactions are increasing and accounted for 60% of activity during the second quarter. Over the course of the pandemic, the cumulative decline in diagnoses has suppressed the volume of new patients starting treatment, which we expect will continue to impact our business during the second half of the year. Now let me review some product details beginning with our innovative portfolio. In bone health, Prolia increased 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by volume growth.  In the second quarter, osteoporosis diagnoses rates remained at approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels. We remain focused on driving patient growth and are optimistic about Prolia's strength in the second half of the year. EVENITY sales increased 30% year-over-year, driven by 32% volume growth. In the U.S., sales nearly doubled year-over-year as we saw an acceleration in demand trends driven by new and continuing patients. We believe EVENITY 's unique bone-building attributes will continue to drive revenue growth.  Moving to Repatha, which has reached more than 1 million patients since launch. Repatha sales increased 43% year-over-year driven by 49% volume growth, and we maintained U.S. and global share leadership in the PCSK9 class. In the U.S., total volumes grew 37% year-over-year, and outside the U.S., volumes grew 66% year-over-year. Volume growth in the quarter was partially offset by lower net selling price resulting from an increase in Medicare Part D patients receiving Repatha and entering the coverage gap. Looking forward, we expect some ongoing reduction in global net selling price on a sequential basis.  Overall, we're confident in our ability to grow Repatha to help more patients at risk of developing a heart attack or a stroke. Now on to Aimovig, which grew 24% quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net sales declined 16%. Volumes grew 11% but were more than offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions In the U.S., Aimovig TRx volume grew 7% year-on-year, and the brand maintained total prescription share leadership among subcutaneous CGRPs. Looking ahead, we see continued rebate pressure as oral CGRPs compete for a share in the market.  To date, more than half a million patients worldwide have been prescribed Aimovig. We believe Aimovig has significant potential to help many more patients suffering from chronic migraine given the clinical data that will be published soon, showing Aimovig\u2019s superiority versus topiramate. Moving to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales were $534 million in the quarter, with 5% volume growth more than offset by unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling price. In the U.S., Otezla maintained first-line share leadership in psoriasis. New-to-brand prescription volumes grew 10% year-over-year, even as patient visits to dermatologists remained 15% below pre-pandemic levels.  The number of new patients who started treatment with Otezla in Q2 was near pre-pandemic levels, but those gains were largely offset by a lower percentage of 90-day prescription fills and lower prescription refill rates for Otezla. We expect the post pandemic recovery in the dermatology segment will progress over the coming quarters. Looking forward, we're preparing for the anticipated approval of mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication in the U.S. later this year, and for the launch of Otezla in China.  ENBREL sales decreased 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower net selling prices and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. On a year-over-year basis, volumes declined by 1% supported by ENBREL's long track record of efficacy and safety. Turning to biosimilars, Q2 sales were $567 million driven by strong volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We continue to hold leading biosimilar shares in Europe for AMGEVITA, and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI.  For the remainder of the year, we expect worldwide biosimilar volume growth to be offset by declines in net selling price due to increased competition. Longer term, growth for biosimilars will come from expansion of existing products in new markets and launches of additional biosimilar molecules such as Amgevita in the U.S. and biosimilars Soliris, STELARA, and EYLEA. In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF with 52% volume share in the quarter. Sales declined 18% year-over-year driven by lower net selling price and lower volume.  This was partially offset by a $75 million year-over-year benefit from favorable changes in reimbursement mix. Neulasta's U.S. average selling price declined 35% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. We expect this trend will continue throughout 2021 driven by intensifying competition. KYPROLIS sales increased 11% year-over-year, primarily driven by volume growth and net selling price. Moving forward, we expect growth from KYPROLIS use in combination with CD38 antibodies, including DARZALEX and SARCLISA. I'd like to take this opportunity to comment on our recent launch of LUMAKRAS, which is off to a strong start with unaided brand awareness increasing 20 points since launch.  KRAS testing in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer now stands at 70%, and 46 of the top 50 testing labs now identify KRAS G12C as actionable in their laboratories. We're very pleased with the positive reaction from the oncology community, and we will be working closely with them to ensure access for patients who can benefit from this breakthrough medicine. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q2 execution given the sustained impact of COVID-19 on our business, closely monitor the course of the pandemic and its impact on patients and physician behavior during the second half of the year, maintain our focus on execution to ensure our medicines continue to reach the patients they can benefit. And with that, I will turn it over to Dave.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Murdo. And good afternoon, everyone. We made several important advances in R&D last quarter. I will begin with our acquisition of Teneobio, which will strengthen Amgen's leadership in developing engineered protein-based medicines to treat patients with serious illnesses. There are three important components to the acquisition. First, Teneobio's core antibody technology will enable the development of multi-specific biologics directed against targets in a wide range of diseases across our key therapeutic areas. Tenebio's antibody platform offers capabilities complementary to our [Indiscernible].  It is genetically modified to express human IgG molecules comprising only a heavy chain, A small single-chain antigen-binding BH domains from these molecules are soluble, and stable, and can be easily strung together like beads on a string to generate multispecific molecules. In addition, Teneobio also brings a novel lower affinity CD3 engaging technology that complements our BiTE platform. The availability of a second CD3 engager will allow us to broaden our bi-specifics capabilities and enable customization of the T-Cell engaging domain, depending on the disease and target.  Finally, we're acquiring clinical and pre-clinical oncology programs directed against high-value targets of interest, which we specifically selected based on our own discovery efforts and target validation. These include a Phase 1 bispecific antibody for prostate cancer that complements Acapatamab AMG 160, also targeting PSMA and amg 509 are targeting steep one which was recently granted fast-track designation by the FDA. Turning to oncology, we continue to Advance LUMAKRAS registration around the globe, with regulatory reviews and progress in multiple jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan.  Feedback from the medical community on the LUMAKRAS launched in the U.S. has been overwhelmingly positive. and I've heard personally from oncologists who are excited to have LUMAKRAS available and are heavily screening their patients for KRAS G12C mutations. I'm pleased to report that more than 2,000 patients have received LUMAKRAS across more than 000 sites, and 900 investigators or treating physicians, including through our global early access programs. In the LUMAKRAS development program, we continue to advance our broad-based combination efforts.  Initial data from our Vectibix combination in colorectal cancer have been accepted for presentation at ESMO in September and the MEK and oral EGFR combination abstracts will be submitted to a medical meeting in the fourth quarter. To expand our LUMAKRAS experience for SHP2 [Indiscernible] along with our ongoing collaboration with Revolution Medicines, we have also entered into a collaboration with Novartis for our SHP2 combination trial. Updates from our monotherapy, non-small cell lung cancer study, including additional biomarker analyses, as well as data in patients with stable brain metastases, have been accepted for presentation at the World Congress on lung cancer.  Recall that we are also investigating LUMAKRAS in patients with active brain metastases. We also plan on initiating a Phase II first-line non-small cell lung cancer study in patients with PD-L1 negative and or STK11 mutant tumors in the third quarter. In the Bemarituzumab program, we are having good discussions with regulators on the Phase 3 gastric cancer development path and plan to initiate a registration program by year-end. This will include two phases three trials. One investigating the utility of Bemarituzumab in combination with chemotherapy.  And the other evaluating the addition of Bemarituzumab to chemotherapy and the checkpoint inhibitor. We are also planning to potentially pivotal Phase II study with [Indiscernible], AMG 757. Our half-life extended BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. And we look forward to discussing the next steps with regulators in the coming weeks. I am also pleased to report that we have completed enrollment in the castrate-resistant prostate cancer expansion cohort for [Indiscernible] or AMG 160.  In inflammation, continuing our leadership in dermatology, we are working closely with Kyowa Kirin to advance AMG 451, also known as KHK4083, a first-in-class OX40 antibody into Phase 3 for atopic dermatitis. We look forward to the presentation of the Phase 2 atopic dermatitis data at the annual meeting of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology at the end of September, as well as, initiating discussions with regulators on our Phase 3 development plans in the coming months.  In addition, the FDA accepted the Otezla supplemental filing for mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Finally, we and our partners, AstraZeneca, we're very pleased that the FDA granted Tezepelumab priority review for the treatment of asthma, reflecting significant unmet medical need. In closing. I would like to thank the entire organization for continuing to advance important medicines for our patients. Peter?\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Dave. And good day, everyone. I will briefly walk through our second-quarter financial results before discussing 2021 guidance. The second quarter marked another period of solid performance as we grew volumes 8%, increased investment in both internal and external innovation, and delivered 4% year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth. As stated earlier, Q2 revenues at 6.5 billion increased 5% year-over-year. Other revenues at 412 million increased 38% year-over-year, primarily driven by shipments of the COVID 19 antibody therapy to Lilly. We continue to expect full-year 2021 other revenues to be in the range of 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion.  The second quarter's non-GAAP operating expenses increased 15% year-over-year as we continue to make investments to drive growth and maximize shareholder value. We expect full-year operating expenses, including approximately $200 million of operating expenses related to the Rodeo, Five Prime, and Teneobio acquisitions, and also to the [Indiscernible] collaboration on an absolute basis to increase about 6% to 7% over last year. While delivering a full-year operating margin of roughly 50%.  On a non-GAAP basis, the cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 4.1% points on a year-over-year basis to 16.9%, driven primarily by product mix, including COVID-19 antibody shipments to Lilly, as well as, profit share and royalties. For the full year, we continue to expect the cost of sales as the percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Our cost of sales has increased as products with royalties and product share, profit share payments have increased. As a reminder, a few of our products subject to royalties are Aimovig and biosimilars such as MVASI, RIABNI, and KANJINTI.  Those subject to profit-sharing arrangements are Evenity and tezepelumab upon approval at launch. Non-GAAP R&D spending increased 11% year-over-year due to investments in [Indiscernible] acquired in Q2 as part of the Five Prime acquisition and increased investments in discovery research. For the full year, we continue to expect non-GAAP R&D spend. We'll increase as we progress our innovative early and late-stage pipeline programs. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to decline. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were favorable by $146 million on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to our portion of BeiGene 's results, which we record one quarter in arrears.  Q1 Beijing results reflect the upfront payment Beijing received in connection with a collaboration agreement. We expect our Q3 and Q4 non-GAAP other income and expense to be more in range with our Q1 and expect full-year net expense in the range of 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion. Now, turning to the outlook for the business for 2021. we are excited by our pipeline. This innovation is augmented and balanced by the business development that we have announced this year. Based on underlying market dynamics and our investment plans, we are reaffirming our 2021 revenue guidance range of 25.8 billion to 26.6 billion.  And our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $16 to $17. Notwithstanding absorbing roughly $200 million. operating expenses mentioned above related to business development activities, including Five Prime, Rodeo, Teneobio, and the Kyowa Kirin collaboration. These ranges reflect uncertainty continuing in the second half of the year related to emerging variance Patient visits and lab test procedure trends in the United States continue to improve, but still remain below pre-COVID-19 levels.  Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance remains unchanged at 13.5% to 14.5%. Our capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at $900 million and our capital expenditures continue to reflect our investments in our manufacturing and related facilities, including improving their environmental footprint. Investments in digital technologies throughout our business, and increasing ESG investments. We expect share repurchases for 2021 to be in the upper range of $3 billion to $5 billion. This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Bob for Q&A.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Erica, let's open the lines for questions. Maybe you could remind our callers of the procedure and our [Indiscernible] for them to ask 1 question so that we have the opportunity to get through everybody who has a desire to ask a question of us. And I feel sure our callers would like to know that it's Arvind's birthday today, so bear that in mind when you ask questions here this afternoon. Okay. Erica, open them up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. And your first question is from Yaron Werber with Cowen and Company.\nGabe Daoud: Hi. This is Gabe on for Yaron. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter. My question is focused on the LUMAKRAS study in first-line lung cancer in patients with low PD-L1 and/or STK 11. Could you just talk about the, I guess your benchmarks for historical comparisons in the STK11 and G12C co-mutants, and what you would use as your reference there and any updates on your discussions with regulators? In the past, you mentioned that there could be a need for head-to-head studies in the future and what those can look like, what the comparison arms would be. Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Dave. So, as we mentioned, as you pointed out, this study in first-line, non-small cell lung cancer will be conducted in patients who are either a PD-L1 negative or STK 11 mutant. These are populations of patients, of course, who -- patients who don't typically benefit from checkpoint inhibitors, where there's really, we think a lot of residual unmet medical need. In fact, STK 11 mutational status may help confer resistance to checkpoint inhibition. So, that is the population that we're targeting.  Whether this can be potentially registration enabling or not, I think it's too early to speculate. The FDA has generally been clear that in first-line lung cancer, they wish to see randomized trials. So, one would have to anticipate having a pretty spectacular efficacy readout to lead to registration based on a single-arm Phase 2 trial. Obvious -- if we saw compelling data, we would have the appropriate conversations going forward. Okay. The next question.\nOperator: Your next question is from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I just really wanted to focus on Arvind's age today.\nBob Bradway: You and me both.\nArvind Sood: Turned 30.\nBob Bradway: You and me both. All right, what can we do for you?\nUmer Raffat: Congratulations. My question today was on the KRAS and really around whether there's any -- if you could just remind us of the plan for the interim is for the ongoing phase 3 study as well as whether there is any primary analysis limited to PD-L1 negative subset in particular. I'm quite intrigued that the first-line Phase 2 trial is limited to PD-L1 negative or STK 11. Thank you very much.\nDavid Reese: Yes. In terms of the Phase 3 trial, I think the best way to think about that, Umer, is that we expect data in the first half of next year. And given the general rapidity of progression of patients historically in second and third line lung cancer to standard therapy, the utility of an interim analysis may not be particularly useful, meaning the primary analysis often falls very quickly after an interim analysis. So, of course, we'll take a look at that and get a better sense in the second half of the year of the event rates.  But, I would really point to the primary analysis in the first half of next year as the major event. And then in first-line, as I said, we think that there is significant unmet medical need in the PD-L1 negative STK 11 mutant -- and/or STK 11 mutant population, given the relative refractoriness of those tumors to currently available treatments. And so, we're very much looking forward to getting that study launched shortly on and seeing the data readout. We'll provide guidance on timelines as soon as enrollment is really underway.\nUmer Raffat: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer.\nJay Olson: Hey, happy birthday, Arvind, and thank you so much for taking the questions. I'm curious about the combination data of LUMAKRAS with Vectibix. Will that be in colorectal cancer only or should we expect to see combination data in non-small cell lung cancer? And related to that, can you comment on the potential for that combination data to drive incremental use of Vectibix? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Jay. Given the regimen that we're studying, you can expect that most of the patients that have been enrolled on that particular combination of LUMAKRAS and Vectibix will have colorectal cancer given the backbone of Vectibix here, although the trial is open across malignancies for treating physicians to enroll patients if they feel that regimen may be appropriate. In terms of driving uptake of Vectibix, I don't want to speculate on that. Our job here is really to generate these combination data and see if -- we think we can really drive things forward, particularly in colorectal cancer.\nOperator: Your next question is from Salim Syed with Mizuho.\nSalim Syed: Great. Thanks so much for the question, guys, and I'll add my Happy Birthday, Arvind. Me and you are both 30. So, I just wanted to focus on the tax petition if I can. So, it seems like this notice of deficiency was not just for one year, but it was for three years; 2010, 2011, and 2012. So, I'm just curious there is a pattern here and how you guys are doing the accounting and is triggering this notice of deficiencies. And I guess the underlying question here is should we be expecting -- I noticed the deficiency or [Indiscernible] for 2013 through '20. And then just curious what the interest rate is that the IRS would impose here. Thank you.\nPeter Griffith: Salim, thank you. It's Peter. And on your question around the IRS matter, the dispute. Look, these notices are related to a transfer pricing dispute with the IRS regarding the allocation of the profits between the U.S. and the territory of Puerto Rico. So, you can see we have a difference of opinion on the value of the significant risks and the complexity we undertake with activities performed at our Puerto Rico facility.  We strongly believe the IRS' position is without merit, and we have appropriate tax reserves, and this dispute will take several years to resolve. I would like to note Salim that Puerto Rico is our flagship manufacturing facility, responsible for the majority of Amgen's global manufacturing. We're proud of our Puerto Rico operations, very proud of them, and our colleagues there. We've had a major manufacturing presence in Puerto Rico for about 30 years.  We have more than 2,200 highly skilled colleagues in Puerto Rico and who produce very sophisticated biologic medicines for patients all over the world with serious diseases. We've invested nearly $4 billion to expand and modernize those facilities in Puerto Rico, and we're proud to be consistently recognized as one of the island's best and most responsible employers. So, on the matter of interest rate, I'll have to refer you to the IRS for that, but that's the IRS matter in brief.\nSalim Syed: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Great, thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe another one for Peter. I was just wondering if you can comment on the margins longer term. I noticed you called out that royalty and profit splits are going to be increasing here, given some of the newer products you're launching, but how should we think about that 50% operating margin this year and the cadence on the forward? Thank you.\nPeter Griffith: Terence, thank you. And, as always, we don't give long-term margin guidance, but what I'd really like to say, our Northstar around this, we always pause and think about our objective is to grow our after-tax cash flows for the enterprise versus targeting specific operating margin or OpEx growth rates. So, we're going to continue to make prudent investments that lead to that objective. So, I would just note, we're continuing to invest in internal, external innovation.  You've seen the fruits of that in the second quarter, the launches of new products, broader digitalization efforts. Secondly, we highlighted our expectation that R&D expenses are going to grow year-over-year as we increase our spend on AMG 160 and AMG 757 and dose-expansion. We\u2019re going to rapidly advance those assets in the prostate in small cell lung cancer. We have three biosimilars in Phase III, three inflam in Phase II. Third, I'll just note Terence that we're absorbing the upfront costs related to the acquisition of Rodeo, as well as the cost of the Five Prime acquisition. our recent collaboration with Kyowa Kirin, and our recently announced the acquisition of Teneobio, which we do expect to close in the second half of 2021. We also plan to rapidly progress these Phase 3 ready molecules in the development of bema and KHK4083. We began being higher manufacturing costs in Q2.  Those were related to the Lilly COVID antibody effort. Net adds to the OpEx build for the rest of the year or two. But on a year-over-year basis, remember, we're comparing as depressed spend in Q2 and Q3 2020 due to COVID. So, at the end of the day, there's any number of financial metrics that we expect to be measured on by our investors and the analysts, and and we take pride in knowing that we want to end up really at the top of the group in terms of our operating efficiency. So that's very important to us. So, you can rest assured that we'll continue to stay focused on that.\nOperator: Your next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Dave, I was wondering if you could just comment on the IL-2 mutein. I know we're going to see some of the data here for SLE towards the end of the year, but it looks like you've started Phase 2 and you're also looking at UC, just maybe broadly on the profile and what you think you need to generate on Phase 2b to have that be a competitive asset?\nDavid Reese: Yeah, thanks, Matt. I'm glad you brought up AMG 592, our IL-2 mutein. Just to remind everyone, this is a molecule designed to enhance the number and function of T regulatory cells, some of the key modulatory cells in the immune system. In many autoimmune diseases, the T regulatory access is out of whack. As you mentioned, we anticipate sharing Phase 1b data in lupus at a medical meeting towards the end of the year. And we'll look forward there -- being able to share those data with you. In addition, a Phase II trial in lupus is actively enrolling now.  And then finally, as you mentioned, Matt, we are launching a study in ulcerative colitis, another autoimmune disorder, in which there's quite a bit of evidence of dysregulation of the [Indiscernible] So I think it's really the Phase 2 readouts here that will be critical as we accrue those data. As always, we'll look to make sure that we are adding something to what is standardly available. In lupus, there remains a very large residual unmet medical need.  There was an approval within the last day or two, of course, but only the second drug in 40 years and a very large patient population, they're still requiring active medicines are ulcerative colitis particularly for a long-term remission is also an area with substantial unmet medical needs. So, it's full speed ahead in the IL-2 mutein program. We'll look forward to sharing this data with you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Afternoon guys. Thanks for the question and happy birthday, Arvind. Commercial question on Otezla for Murdo. And so, when you look at the growth in the first half of this year, how much of a factor was COVID versus, say, competition or pricing? And do you think any of these headwinds could impact the upcoming launch when you look at the mild to the moderate disease-patient population? Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, I would say throughout the course of last year, we saw a slowdown in the number of bio-naive psoriasis patients moving into the market based on COVID disruption to patient visits. And given that Otezla is an early option in the treatment of psoriasis, we were impacted by that, I would say more than the biologics which tend to gain growth from Otezla and from each other. So that slowdown in the new patient diagnoses last year compounds our growth rate this year. The good news of the quarter is we saw new patient trends tick up. So, we did see 10% growth in new patients, prescribed new-to-brand prescriptions in the quarter.  However, this was somewhat offset by an increase in the number of patients that switched away from Otezla to another treatment. And we think that that was pent-up treatment decision-making that didn't happen because patients weren't going to see their dermatologists last year. There were some price reductions mostly related to our co-pay programs, but that's usually a good indication of new patients starting.  So, overall, I would say it's primarily COVID impact. With respect to other products coming in, I'm not sure how to answer that. What I can say is we continue to like our share position, that our share has held in the share of bio-naive psoriasis patients, and we continue to feel optimistic about the growth of Otezla given the pending indication in mild-to-moderate patients, which should come hopefully by the end of this year. Teams continue to execute well. Our field execution, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is improving. And we're very focused on making sure we continue to grow Otezla over the long haul.\nGeoff Meacham: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Hi. Good afternoon. And thank you for taking my question. Let's start with the immunology team here. You guys are developing both STELARA and [Indiscernible] for 2023 2024's biosimilars. And given you going to be both sides of the innovation in a similar world, I was wondering if you had a thought about the long-term trajectory of pricing in the immunology markets. That is, without giving specific numbers, do you -- should we begin to see something along the lines of what we see with diabetes with ongoing gradual price decreases. It's like how do you think about this market long term?\nBob Bradway: Murdo, do you want to [Indiscernible]?\nMurdo Gordon: : Sure. Thanks for the question, Ronny. I'm hesitant to go out too far. What we are seeing, of course, and inflammation right now, there is a lot of new entrants, a lot of new mechanisms, and a lot of competition which is increasing. the gross-to-nets, that new [Indiscernible] have to pay to secure access. We're also seeing increased management by the large national PBMs of national formularies as to which mechanisms get placed in a preferred status versus being held in reserve after patients fail in earlier lines of therapy.  So, if we take rheumatoid arthritis as an example, I do see TNS continuing to entrench themselves in that first-line position, and novel mechanisms are likely to be in the second and perhaps even third line after patients have failed to have a resolution of their RA symptoms or improve the progression of their disease. In the biosimilar dynamics, I think we're seeing now the increase in interest from both payers, and PBMs, and providers, given some of the trends that we're seeing with the early biosimilars in the inflammation category. And I do think that interest in biosimilars will increase.  And I think that biosimilar penetration of parent molecule or originator molecule will accelerate with the new entrant. So, we're expecting that to be the condition on the [Indiscernible] by the time we launch AMGEVITA In the U.S. But overall, I would just come back to the strength that we have as a Company given our portfolio of innovator or originator molecules enhanced with the presence of our biosimilar portfolio. And I think that affords us an opportunity to serve many patients across a host of autoimmune diseases, as well as serve -- providers, payors, and PBMs with a lot of value to deliver to the healthcare system.\nOperator: Your next question is from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Thank you. Thank you very much for taking the question. I'll continue with the biosimilar guidance. Specifically, on Denosumab, what are you thinking in terms of the first biosimilar coming in for which is also an excuse me. And then would you expect the erosion trajectory for a brand of Prolia and XGEVA to be similar to, for example, [Indiscernible] or so the erosion of the oncology biologics or would you expect it to be more gradual, or faster just wondering what you think the trajectory will look like?\nMurdo Gordon: : Thanks Geoffrey, for the question. I would say, it's again, hard to project into the future as to how the healthcare system's payors and providers will change in their adoption of biosimilars. But I think given that Denosumab is a Part B product, the oncology biosimilar curves would be a close approximation of what we defining for.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Yee with Jefferies.\nMichael Yee: Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. We had a two-parter for David, on [Indiscernible] You have upcoming data for MEK plus or minus EGFR. Just wanted to understand in the context, how to interpret that data, what is good data, and is the goal to significantly increase response rate and PFS beyond democrats alone. Maybe just help us right-size how to think about that study. And you also announced that you expanded a combination with the Novartis SHP2, is that just diversifying and spreading it around or how to think about SHP2 if you have done a second collaboration there. Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Mike. Let me start with the second part first. You're exactly right. That's simply diversifying our experience. We're moving forward as I noted with both Revolution Medicines on combination as well as this new collaboration with Novartis [Indiscernible] we look forward to both datasets. In terms of the MEK or EGFR combinations, as I've said before, in terms of response rate, it's going to vary by line of therapy and indication in terms of what sort of increments that you want to see.  But generally, 10%, 20%, 30% relative improvement in response rates and progression-free survival, certainly beyond first-line, is typically what we would want to see and those are the rough sort of benchmarks that we'll use. And on these first cohorts, of course, the critical thing upfront is safety and determining appropriate doses, and then moving into expansion cohorts for efficacy. Thanks again.\nMichael Yee: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nAlethia Young: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And happy birthday to one of the best in IR games. And cheers to you, Arvind.\nArvind Sood: Thank you, Alethia.\nAlethia Young: I wanted to get a little bit of flavor on Repatha, and I know you're seeing very nice volume growth, but like continued kind of pricing pressure or discounting pressure. Do you think we're kind of hitting a stabilization point? I know you've talked about the little bit of sequential deceleration, but if you can give us some flavor on how to think about when that might start to the right size and stabilize and see real growth from the volume that you're generating.\nMurdo Gordon: : Yes. Thanks. Alethia. We're quite happy with the performance of Repatha and us now to really treat a large number of patients, we reached a million patients now with Repatha. So quite a milestone. The overall dynamic that is dragging price down is really a U.S. Part D patient dynamic, as patients enter into the coverage gap or as we sometimes refer to the donut hole. And as we expand our percentage or share of business in the Part D or Medicare Part D business and segment of the market.  We will see some net-negative price drag quarter-over-quarter. Now, it's not -- not going to be as precipitous as the price changes that we've made historically. So, our volume is outpacing that and we will see that drop to the net sales lines. So overall, good evolution. We're also seeing nice growth on Repatha ex-U.S. where the price is relatively stable year on year. So that part of the mix is helping bolster price evolution over time as well. But some slight drag will continue. But again, it's a good sign because it means we're expanding that Medicare pool of patients much more rapidly than we did historically.\nAlethia Young: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets.\nKennen MacKay: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just would love to get a perspective on [Indiscernible] combinations you're most excited about currently for LUMAKRAS, whether it's more in line with previously with the oral and antibody MEK inhibitors, to the M2 inhibitor maybe, or with the Novartis collaboration. does the SHP2 now take the top seat? And then just 1 quick question on the biosimilar pipeline, when do you see the earliest that you might be able to launch your biosimilar EYLEA, it's ABP 938? Thanks so much and congrats on the [Indiscernible].\nDavid Reese: Yeah. Maybe I'll start with the question on combinations. Of course, the ones we like the best are the ones that work and that's what we're testing right now. It would actually -- all of these combinations have been selected for one or another reason or both. One, most importantly, is a biological possibility. so, reason to believe in either additive or synergistic effects.  And then two, if combining molecules are part of a background regimen, and so we think we're really covering the waterfront in terms of indications of interest with relevant combinations here. And at this point, Ken and I, I think it's really an empirical matter of generating the data. And of course, I will share that as we've outlined.\nMurdo Gordon: : And, Ken, and we haven't announced our timing on EYLEA, but we are moving quickly in the enrollment of that program and we anticipate being early in the sequence of launches for that product.\nKennen MacKay: Fair enough. Thanks, Murdo. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Good afternoon. I'll pass on my happy birthday wishes to Arvind too. I wanted to ask about your OX40 program. I know it's moving into Phase III next year. Just wanted to see any further color on the population or dosing you're looking to move forward with it in Phase III. And if the lingering uncertainty over the JAKS, as in any way changed or evolved your, your underlying assumptions around that market, would be helpful? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yeah. Thanks, Carter. We're very enthusiastic about this molecule. Atopic dermatitis is a disease with widespread prevalence actually in global populations. despite existing therapies. We think there is a very large amount of residual net medical need. Patients often cycle through therapies. Given the novel mechanism of action, we're targeting the OX40 pathway. We think there is quite a big opportunity to have a real impact in this field.  As I mentioned, we'll be presenting the Phase 2b data at the end of September at one of the major European dermatology meetings and I think there you'll get a sense of our thoughts on dosing and what things may look like going forward, and of course, as we have discussions with regulators, we'll outline our plans on the phase 3 program, which will in all likelihood be a suite of studies. Let me ask Murdo to comment a little further here.\nMurdo Gordon: : Yeah, Carter, we obviously pay close attention to the JAKs safety concerns as raised on the Xeljanz data and applied some reduction in JAK penetration assumptions to the AD market when we were evaluating the attractiveness of the OX40 asset. And I think that was one of the drivers here. We [Indiscernible] that the biologic still has a large role to play. We think initially the OX40 asset will establish perhaps a second-line opportunity in the market. And we can expand from there. But the portion of the market that we think will be addressed by JAKs is probably smaller than was once considered.\nOperator: Your next question is from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.\nCory Kasimov: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And most importantly, happy birthday to Arvind. I wanted to go back to the line of questioning around the LUMAKRAS combination work and ask specifically about what you're doing with PD-1s at this point, when you expect to have an update there. And is it really still just about trying to figure out the dosing currently before you move forward? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yeah. Thanks, Cory. As we've discussed before, we're looking at both direct combinations and sequential therapy here. So, I think you can see -- you can expect to see data from both of those sometime through the first half of next year or so as we accumulate enough data to define what the relevant path forward is with a checkpoint inhibitor. So more to come there, but we continue to actively work on these development programs.\nCory Kasimov: Okay. Thank you, David.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler.\nAllison Bratzel: Hi. This is Alli Bratzel on for Chris this afternoon. Thanks for taking our question. Just on PD, you've had a lot of activity in the oncology and inflammation space. Just any color on how you're prioritizing other areas of interest on the development side versus opportunities to bolster some of your more legacy commercial franchises like renal. And then maybe more specifically on renal, how are you thinking about your longer-term strategy or prioritization for investing in the franchise via internal or external innovation. Thanks.\nBob Bradway: So Alli, I'll just repeat what I've said many times before, which is that our business development efforts are focused on the areas where we have an ongoing strong research presence and/or commercial presence. So, you're right, we've been active in oncology and in the immunology area. We continue to look for opportunities in both those spaces as well as in general medicine.  And to the extent that we see things that we think we're going to add value to in nephrology or bone health, or the migraine area, we'll look there as well. So active efforts are underway and we look, again, across the marketplace actively. We'll focus on how we can earn a return for our shareholders from the assets that we might license or acquire. Are you just -- just sorry? Just quickly. I don't think I addressed your nephrology question. We don't have as much active research in nephrology and bone at the moment.  And because we haven't seen internally opportunities to advance novel therapies there, we think the medicines we have are addressing the needs in the marketplace very effectively, but to the extent that there are things outside of Amgen that fit well with our 30-years of leadership, for example, nephrology or with our global leadership in bone, and we pay close attention to that as well.\nOperator: Your next question is from Dane Leone with Raymond James.\nDane Leone: : Hi. Thank you for taking the questions and my congratulations to Arvind. Hope you have a fun birthday tonight after the call, so I'll keep it brief. My questions on Tarlatamab. Question from me here is what you guys think you need to see as you're planning for this Phase 2 study? Obviously, initial data seems encouraging from the first 52 patients you had earlier this year.  But where do you want to think about positioning this drug in the different lines of small-cell lung cancer now, and what have you may be seeing as the dose escalation studies progressed since maybe we've seen the last data update that has you thinking about a pivotal study now? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yes, thanks, Dane, I think to take the last part of your question. what we've seen are ongoing response rates consistent with -- response rates consistent with the data that you saw from the later cohorts that we presented a month or 2 ago. And in addition, we've actually been impressed with the duration of response. Most of these patients are third line plus, which, as you know, is a very aggressive disease in small cell lung cancer. And durable responses here are vanishing rare. So that I think is in addition.  What really gives us encouragement here. As we discussed the potential registrational path with the FDA in the coming weeks, I think we will focus on the patient population, but I think the initial foray is likely to be those later lines of therapy. We are moving forward in our development program now and are actively investigating earlier lines of therapy as well. That is clearly the end game that we're pointing for with Tarlatamab. And given the sort of activity that we're seeing in the clinic right now.\nDane Leone: : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim.\nMichael Schmidt: Hi, guys. I have 1 more on LUMAKRAS. Thanks for taking my question. And Arvind, congrats [Indiscernible] as well. So, I guess, hypothetically, should be efficacy safety profile of the LUMAKRAS inhibitor combinations turn out to be insufficient, which I guess could be possible. What are other likely avenues to positively enable access to a broad first-line KRAS non-smoker lung cancer indication? Should we think about potential chemo combinations or are there others that are logical come to mind? Thanks so much.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Michael. I think you're exactly right. With the chemotherapy combinations, number one. And then going into biomarker selected populations. As we've discussed in terms of our planned upcoming first-line [Indiscernible] which we'll be launching on shortly. And so, should checkpoint inhibitor combinations not be feasible, I would expect that we would piece together other routes to first-line to find patients who are most likely to benefit.\nMichael Schmidt: Great, thanks so much.\nBob Bradway: Erica, as we're pushing up against the top of the hour, why don't we take our final 2 questions.\nOperator: Okay. Your next question is from Brian Skorney with Baird.\nBrian Skorney: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question and happy birthday, Arvind. Thinking a little more on the disclosed notice of deficiency today. I think last year you also received an [Indiscernible] and modified [Indiscernible] related to 2013 through 2015 and are also under investigation for 2016 through 2018 by the IRS and just seems like this all-related issue is around profit allegation in Puerto Rico.  So, I was wondering if you could just walk through the next steps in terms of the tax for a petition. Can they -- can the petition to be heard in tax court fail? And if it does go to court and the decision goes against you, does that sort of established precedence for the other years as well. And based on the IRS calculation methodology for 2010, for 2012, have you run that same calculation to establish what number bound of liabilities for 2013 through now would be?\nPeter Griffith: Yes. Brian, thank you for the question. Look, we filed a petition with the U.S. tax [Indiscernible]. In this case, it could take several years to resolve. The IRS is also proposing significant adjustments to 2013 and '15, relate to similar issues. As you know. We disagree, strongly disagree with the proposed adjustments.  We're pursuing a resolution with the IRS Administrative Appeals Office on that. The IRS, as you notice, they're currently auditing the years 2016 through '18., so yes, we're sure they'll take the same position for the other periods under audit. We believe that we have adequate reserves for that.\nBrian Skorney: Great, thank you.\nBob Bradway: Hey, let's go to the final question.\nOperator: Your final question is from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nAndrew Galler: Hey, this is Andrew Galler on for Tim. I just wanted to ask one question on [Indiscernible]. So, given your partner AstraZeneca officially discontinued atopic dermatitis last week, can you talk about any impact on your competitive positioning? The decision Eastern availed to look asthma, do be given the high coincidence of atopic conditions?\nDavid Reese: I mean, I think the short answer here is no, and we remain extremely bullish about tezepelumab, given its activity across a range of patients with asthma, regardless of eosinophil count. As we mentioned, we were granted priority review by the FDA. Clearly an acknowledgment of the potential fit of this medicine with a large residual unmet medical need. So that's [Indiscernible]. That doesn't really give us positive [Indiscernible].\nBob Bradway: Okay, Erica. Well, let me just thank our callers for joining the call today. We're excited about the second half of the year, a lot going on here. And so, we look forward to having the opportunity to gather with you in October and update you on the next quarter. Appreciate your interest in Amgen. Thank you.\nArvind Sood: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes Amgen's Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. And good day, everyone. I will briefly walk through our second-quarter financial results before discussing 2021 guidance. The second quarter marked another period of solid performance as we grew volumes 8%, increased investment in both internal and external innovation, and delivered 4% year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth. As stated earlier, Q2 revenues at 6.5 billion increased 5% year-over-year. Other revenues at 412 million increased 38% year-over-year, primarily driven by shipments of the COVID 19 antibody therapy to Lilly. We continue to expect full-year 2021 other revenues to be in the range of 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion.  The second quarter's non-GAAP operating expenses increased 15% year-over-year as we continue to make investments to drive growth and maximize shareholder value. We expect full-year operating expenses, including approximately $200 million of operating expenses related to the Rodeo, Five Prime, and Teneobio acquisitions, and also to the [Indiscernible] collaboration on an absolute basis to increase about 6% to 7% over last year. While delivering a full-year operating margin of roughly 50%.  On a non-GAAP basis, the cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 4.1% points on a year-over-year basis to 16.9%, driven primarily by product mix, including COVID-19 antibody shipments to Lilly, as well as, profit share and royalties. For the full year, we continue to expect the cost of sales as the percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Our cost of sales has increased as products with royalties and product share, profit share payments have increased. As a reminder, a few of our products subject to royalties are Aimovig and biosimilars such as MVASI, RIABNI, and KANJINTI.  Those subject to profit-sharing arrangements are Evenity and tezepelumab upon approval at launch. Non-GAAP R&D spending increased 11% year-over-year due to investments in [Indiscernible] acquired in Q2 as part of the Five Prime acquisition and increased investments in discovery research. For the full year, we continue to expect non-GAAP R&D spend. We'll increase as we progress our innovative early and late-stage pipeline programs. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to decline. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were favorable by $146 million on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to our portion of BeiGene 's results, which we record one quarter in arrears.  Q1 Beijing results reflect the upfront payment Beijing received in connection with a collaboration agreement. We expect our Q3 and Q4 non-GAAP other income and expense to be more in range with our Q1 and expect full-year net expense in the range of 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion. Now, turning to the outlook for the business for 2021. we are excited by our pipeline. This innovation is augmented and balanced by the business development that we have announced this year. Based on underlying market dynamics and our investment plans, we are reaffirming our 2021 revenue guidance range of 25.8 billion to 26.6 billion.  And our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $16 to $17. Notwithstanding absorbing roughly $200 million. operating expenses mentioned above related to business development activities, including Five Prime, Rodeo, Teneobio, and the Kyowa Kirin collaboration. These ranges reflect uncertainty continuing in the second half of the year related to emerging variance Patient visits and lab test procedure trends in the United States continue to improve, but still remain below pre-COVID-19 levels.  Our non-GAAP tax rate guidance remains unchanged at 13.5% to 14.5%. Our capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at $900 million and our capital expenditures continue to reflect our investments in our manufacturing and related facilities, including improving their environmental footprint. Investments in digital technologies throughout our business, and increasing ESG investments. We expect share repurchases for 2021 to be in the upper range of $3 billion to $5 billion. This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Bob for Q&A. Salim, thank you. It's Peter. And on your question around the IRS matter, the dispute. Look, these notices are related to a transfer pricing dispute with the IRS regarding the allocation of the profits between the U.S. and the territory of Puerto Rico. So, you can see we have a difference of opinion on the value of the significant risks and the complexity we undertake with activities performed at our Puerto Rico facility.  We strongly believe the IRS' position is without merit, and we have appropriate tax reserves, and this dispute will take several years to resolve. I would like to note Salim that Puerto Rico is our flagship manufacturing facility, responsible for the majority of Amgen's global manufacturing. We're proud of our Puerto Rico operations, very proud of them, and our colleagues there. We've had a major manufacturing presence in Puerto Rico for about 30 years.  We have more than 2,200 highly skilled colleagues in Puerto Rico and who produce very sophisticated biologic medicines for patients all over the world with serious diseases. We've invested nearly $4 billion to expand and modernize those facilities in Puerto Rico, and we're proud to be consistently recognized as one of the island's best and most responsible employers. So, on the matter of interest rate, I'll have to refer you to the IRS for that, but that's the IRS matter in brief. Terence, thank you. And, as always, we don't give long-term margin guidance, but what I'd really like to say, our Northstar around this, we always pause and think about our objective is to grow our after-tax cash flows for the enterprise versus targeting specific operating margin or OpEx growth rates. So, we're going to continue to make prudent investments that lead to that objective. So, I would just note, we're continuing to invest in internal, external innovation.  You've seen the fruits of that in the second quarter, the launches of new products, broader digitalization efforts. Secondly, we highlighted our expectation that R&D expenses are going to grow year-over-year as we increase our spend on AMG 160 and AMG 757 and dose-expansion. We're going to rapidly advance those assets in the prostate in small cell lung cancer. We have three biosimilars in Phase III, three inflam in Phase II. Third, I'll just note Terence that we're absorbing the upfront costs related to the acquisition of Rodeo, as well as the cost of the Five Prime acquisition. our recent collaboration with Kyowa Kirin, and our recently announced the acquisition of Teneobio, which we do expect to close in the second half of 2021. We also plan to rapidly progress these Phase 3 ready molecules in the development of bema and KHK4083. We began being higher manufacturing costs in Q2.  Those were related to the Lilly COVID antibody effort. Net adds to the OpEx build for the rest of the year or two. But on a year-over-year basis, remember, we're comparing as depressed spend in Q2 and Q3 2020 due to COVID. So, at the end of the day, there's any number of financial metrics that we expect to be measured on by our investors and the analysts, and and we take pride in knowing that we want to end up really at the top of the group in terms of our operating efficiency. So that's very important to us. So, you can rest assured that we'll continue to stay focused on that. Yes. Brian, thank you for the question. Look, we filed a petition with the U.S. tax [Indiscernible]. In this case, it could take several years to resolve. The IRS is also proposing significant adjustments to 2013 and '15, relate to similar issues. As you know. We disagree, strongly disagree with the proposed adjustments.  We're pursuing a resolution with the IRS Administrative Appeals Office on that. The IRS, as you notice, they're currently auditing the years 2016 through '18., so yes, we're sure they'll take the same position for the other periods under audit. We believe that we have adequate reserves for that."

            "name": "Bob Bradway",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello everyone and thank you for joining our call. Through the first six months of the year, Amgen has continued to execute well, driving demand for our current products globally while also paving the way for growth from future products. Total revenues in the second quarter increased 5% over the prior year, and 11% over the prior quarter. We achieved this growth despite the lingering effects of COVID-19 and increased competition in many of our therapeutic categories.  We continue to see strong volume-driven growth from Repatha, Otezla, Prolia, and EVENITY, and a number of our oncology biosimilar -- oncology medicines as well, all of which address significant health challenges. We also saw strong growth in the quarter from our biosimilars, supporting our commitment to deliver value to healthcare systems around the world. We generated volume growth of 22% outside the United States, and we're particularly encouraged by our progress in the Asia-Pacific region, where two notable approvals in the second quarter should provide additional growth moving forward.  In China, our partner BeiGenesecured approval for Kyprolis, which joins BLINCYTO and XGEVA in our oncology collaboration there. And in Japan, the approval of Aimovig for migraine marks another important milestone for us in that market. In the U.S., we're excited by the strong launch of LUMAKRAS, which is providing hope to lung cancer patients in need of new treatment options. We've very pleased with the enthusiasm LUMAKRAS has generated in the oncology community.  We're also excited that the FDA granted priority review to Tezepelumab, further confirming our belief that it offers significant advantages over currently available treatment alternatives for people with severe asthma, a debilitating disease that affects millions worldwide. We've long sought to complement our internal innovation efforts with the best available external innovation. And in the first half of this year, we've executed on several compelling business development transactions which fits squarely in our stated areas of interest.  The acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics and our partnership with Kyowa Kirin, for example, have added to potential first-in-class phase 3 ready assets in cancer and inflammation, two therapeutic categories where there remains a high unmet need. The acquisition of Teneobio, which Dave will address in a moment, will significantly strengthen our protein engineering capabilities across therapeutic areas. Our strong balance sheet and cash flows will enable us to take advantage of additional business development opportunities like these as they arise.  All the work we do is focused on advancing our mission to serve patients and to do so in a way that helps to address the many challenges facing society. You may have seen our recently announced plans to invest approximately $1 billion to build two new manufacturing facilities, one in North Carolina and the other in Ohio, to meet the demand for our medicines. Both facilities will utilize cutting-edge technologies to be much more efficient and environmentally friendly than traditional plants, supporting our goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2027.  Both plants will also draw from very diverse talent pools as we, along with a number of other large companies that are part of the OneTen coalition, look to collectively hire 1 million black Americans into well-paying jobs over the next 10 years. You can learn more about our commitment to good corporate citizenship by reading our ESG report, which can be found in the responsibility section of Amgen.com. Finally, before I turn things over to Murdo, let me thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to serving patients around the world and delivering strong performance across all aspects of our business. Murdo, over to you. Okay. Erica, let's open the lines for questions. Maybe you could remind our callers of the procedure and our [Indiscernible] for them to ask 1 question so that we have the opportunity to get through everybody who has a desire to ask a question of us. And I feel sure our callers would like to know that it's Arvind's birthday today, so bear that in mind when you ask questions here this afternoon. Okay. Erica, open them up. You and me both. You and me both. All right, what can we do for you? Murdo, do you want to [Indiscernible]? So Alli, I'll just repeat what I've said many times before, which is that our business development efforts are focused on the areas where we have an ongoing strong research presence and/or commercial presence. So, you're right, we've been active in oncology and in the immunology area. We continue to look for opportunities in both those spaces as well as in general medicine.  And to the extent that we see things that we think we're going to add value to in nephrology or bone health, or the migraine area, we'll look there as well. So active efforts are underway and we look, again, across the marketplace actively. We'll focus on how we can earn a return for our shareholders from the assets that we might license or acquire. Are you just -- just sorry? Just quickly. I don't think I addressed your nephrology question. We don't have as much active research in nephrology and bone at the moment.  And because we haven't seen internally opportunities to advance novel therapies there, we think the medicines we have are addressing the needs in the marketplace very effectively, but to the extent that there are things outside of Amgen that fit well with our 30-years of leadership, for example, nephrology or with our global leadership in bone, and we pay close attention to that as well. Erica, as we're pushing up against the top of the hour, why don't we take our final 2 questions. Hey, let's go to the final question. Okay, Erica. Well, let me just thank our callers for joining the call today. We're excited about the second half of the year, a lot going on here. And so, we look forward to having the opportunity to gather with you in October and update you on the next quarter. Appreciate your interest in Amgen. Thank you."

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. Second-quarter product sales increased 3% year-over-year. Volumes increased 8%, driven by double-digit growth across a number of our products, including Prolia, Repatha, and our biosimilar products MVASI and KANJINTI. Our ex-U.S. business grew 18% with a volume growth of 22% year-over-year. We continued to see a gradual recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Q2 when compared to Q1 2021. Patient visits and lab test procedure trends continued to improve but remained below pre-COVID-19 levels.  We remain focused on customer execution. Overall, U.S. field activity improved quarter-over-quarter reaching 80% of pre-COVID levels. Face-to-face customer interactions are increasing and accounted for 60% of activity during the second quarter. Over the course of the pandemic, the cumulative decline in diagnoses has suppressed the volume of new patients starting treatment, which we expect will continue to impact our business during the second half of the year. Now let me review some product details beginning with our innovative portfolio. In bone health, Prolia increased 24% year-over-year, driven primarily by volume growth.  In the second quarter, osteoporosis diagnoses rates remained at approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels. We remain focused on driving patient growth and are optimistic about Prolia's strength in the second half of the year. EVENITY sales increased 30% year-over-year, driven by 32% volume growth. In the U.S., sales nearly doubled year-over-year as we saw an acceleration in demand trends driven by new and continuing patients. We believe EVENITY 's unique bone-building attributes will continue to drive revenue growth.  Moving to Repatha, which has reached more than 1 million patients since launch. Repatha sales increased 43% year-over-year driven by 49% volume growth, and we maintained U.S. and global share leadership in the PCSK9 class. In the U.S., total volumes grew 37% year-over-year, and outside the U.S., volumes grew 66% year-over-year. Volume growth in the quarter was partially offset by lower net selling price resulting from an increase in Medicare Part D patients receiving Repatha and entering the coverage gap. Looking forward, we expect some ongoing reduction in global net selling price on a sequential basis.  Overall, we're confident in our ability to grow Repatha to help more patients at risk of developing a heart attack or a stroke. Now on to Aimovig, which grew 24% quarter-over-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net sales declined 16%. Volumes grew 11% but were more than offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions In the U.S., Aimovig TRx volume grew 7% year-on-year, and the brand maintained total prescription share leadership among subcutaneous CGRPs. Looking ahead, we see continued rebate pressure as oral CGRPs compete for a share in the market.  To date, more than half a million patients worldwide have been prescribed Aimovig. We believe Aimovig has significant potential to help many more patients suffering from chronic migraine given the clinical data that will be published soon, showing Aimovig's superiority versus topiramate. Moving to our inflammation portfolio, Otezla sales were $534 million in the quarter, with 5% volume growth more than offset by unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling price. In the U.S., Otezla maintained first-line share leadership in psoriasis. New-to-brand prescription volumes grew 10% year-over-year, even as patient visits to dermatologists remained 15% below pre-pandemic levels.  The number of new patients who started treatment with Otezla in Q2 was near pre-pandemic levels, but those gains were largely offset by a lower percentage of 90-day prescription fills and lower prescription refill rates for Otezla. We expect the post pandemic recovery in the dermatology segment will progress over the coming quarters. Looking forward, we're preparing for the anticipated approval of mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication in the U.S. later this year, and for the launch of Otezla in China.  ENBREL sales decreased 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower net selling prices and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. On a year-over-year basis, volumes declined by 1% supported by ENBREL's long track record of efficacy and safety. Turning to biosimilars, Q2 sales were $567 million driven by strong volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We continue to hold leading biosimilar shares in Europe for AMGEVITA, and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI.  For the remainder of the year, we expect worldwide biosimilar volume growth to be offset by declines in net selling price due to increased competition. Longer term, growth for biosimilars will come from expansion of existing products in new markets and launches of additional biosimilar molecules such as Amgevita in the U.S. and biosimilars Soliris, STELARA, and EYLEA. In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long-acting GCSF with 52% volume share in the quarter. Sales declined 18% year-over-year driven by lower net selling price and lower volume.  This was partially offset by a $75 million year-over-year benefit from favorable changes in reimbursement mix. Neulasta's U.S. average selling price declined 35% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. We expect this trend will continue throughout 2021 driven by intensifying competition. KYPROLIS sales increased 11% year-over-year, primarily driven by volume growth and net selling price. Moving forward, we expect growth from KYPROLIS use in combination with CD38 antibodies, including DARZALEX and SARCLISA. I'd like to take this opportunity to comment on our recent launch of LUMAKRAS, which is off to a strong start with unaided brand awareness increasing 20 points since launch.  KRAS testing in patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer now stands at 70%, and 46 of the top 50 testing labs now identify KRAS G12C as actionable in their laboratories. We're very pleased with the positive reaction from the oncology community, and we will be working closely with them to ensure access for patients who can benefit from this breakthrough medicine. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q2 execution given the sustained impact of COVID-19 on our business, closely monitor the course of the pandemic and its impact on patients and physician behavior during the second half of the year, maintain our focus on execution to ensure our medicines continue to reach the patients they can benefit. And with that, I will turn it over to Dave. : Yes. Thanks, Geoff, I would say throughout the course of last year, we saw a slowdown in the number of bio-naive psoriasis patients moving into the market based on COVID disruption to patient visits. And given that Otezla is an early option in the treatment of psoriasis, we were impacted by that, I would say more than the biologics which tend to gain growth from Otezla and from each other. So that slowdown in the new patient diagnoses last year compounds our growth rate this year. The good news of the quarter is we saw new patient trends tick up. So, we did see 10% growth in new patients, prescribed new-to-brand prescriptions in the quarter.  However, this was somewhat offset by an increase in the number of patients that switched away from Otezla to another treatment. And we think that that was pent-up treatment decision-making that didn't happen because patients weren't going to see their dermatologists last year. There were some price reductions mostly related to our co-pay programs, but that's usually a good indication of new patients starting.  So, overall, I would say it's primarily COVID impact. With respect to other products coming in, I'm not sure how to answer that. What I can say is we continue to like our share position, that our share has held in the share of bio-naive psoriasis patients, and we continue to feel optimistic about the growth of Otezla given the pending indication in mild-to-moderate patients, which should come hopefully by the end of this year. Teams continue to execute well. Our field execution, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is improving. And we're very focused on making sure we continue to grow Otezla over the long haul. : Sure. Thanks for the question, Ronny. I'm hesitant to go out too far. What we are seeing, of course, and inflammation right now, there is a lot of new entrants, a lot of new mechanisms, and a lot of competition which is increasing. the gross-to-nets, that new [Indiscernible] have to pay to secure access. We're also seeing increased management by the large national PBMs of national formularies as to which mechanisms get placed in a preferred status versus being held in reserve after patients fail in earlier lines of therapy.  So, if we take rheumatoid arthritis as an example, I do see TNS continuing to entrench themselves in that first-line position, and novel mechanisms are likely to be in the second and perhaps even third line after patients have failed to have a resolution of their RA symptoms or improve the progression of their disease. In the biosimilar dynamics, I think we're seeing now the increase in interest from both payers, and PBMs, and providers, given some of the trends that we're seeing with the early biosimilars in the inflammation category. And I do think that interest in biosimilars will increase.  And I think that biosimilar penetration of parent molecule or originator molecule will accelerate with the new entrant. So, we're expecting that to be the condition on the [Indiscernible] by the time we launch AMGEVITA In the U.S. But overall, I would just come back to the strength that we have as a Company given our portfolio of innovator or originator molecules enhanced with the presence of our biosimilar portfolio. And I think that affords us an opportunity to serve many patients across a host of autoimmune diseases, as well as serve -- providers, payors, and PBMs with a lot of value to deliver to the healthcare system. : Thanks Geoffrey, for the question. I would say, it's again, hard to project into the future as to how the healthcare system's payors and providers will change in their adoption of biosimilars. But I think given that Denosumab is a Part B product, the oncology biosimilar curves would be a close approximation of what we defining for. : Yes. Thanks. Alethia. We're quite happy with the performance of Repatha and us now to really treat a large number of patients, we reached a million patients now with Repatha. So quite a milestone. The overall dynamic that is dragging price down is really a U.S. Part D patient dynamic, as patients enter into the coverage gap or as we sometimes refer to the donut hole. And as we expand our percentage or share of business in the Part D or Medicare Part D business and segment of the market.  We will see some net-negative price drag quarter-over-quarter. Now, it's not -- not going to be as precipitous as the price changes that we've made historically. So, our volume is outpacing that and we will see that drop to the net sales lines. So overall, good evolution. We're also seeing nice growth on Repatha ex-U.S. where the price is relatively stable year on year. So that part of the mix is helping bolster price evolution over time as well. But some slight drag will continue. But again, it's a good sign because it means we're expanding that Medicare pool of patients much more rapidly than we did historically. : And, Ken, and we haven't announced our timing on EYLEA, but we are moving quickly in the enrollment of that program and we anticipate being early in the sequence of launches for that product. : Yeah, Carter, we obviously pay close attention to the JAKs safety concerns as raised on the Xeljanz data and applied some reduction in JAK penetration assumptions to the AD market when we were evaluating the attractiveness of the OX40 asset. And I think that was one of the drivers here. We [Indiscernible] that the biologic still has a large role to play. We think initially the OX40 asset will establish perhaps a second-line opportunity in the market. And we can expand from there. But the portion of the market that we think will be addressed by JAKs is probably smaller than was once considered."

            "name": "David Reese",
            "content": "Thanks, Murdo. And good afternoon, everyone. We made several important advances in R&D last quarter. I will begin with our acquisition of Teneobio, which will strengthen Amgen's leadership in developing engineered protein-based medicines to treat patients with serious illnesses. There are three important components to the acquisition. First, Teneobio's core antibody technology will enable the development of multi-specific biologics directed against targets in a wide range of diseases across our key therapeutic areas. Tenebio's antibody platform offers capabilities complementary to our [Indiscernible].  It is genetically modified to express human IgG molecules comprising only a heavy chain, A small single-chain antigen-binding BH domains from these molecules are soluble, and stable, and can be easily strung together like beads on a string to generate multispecific molecules. In addition, Teneobio also brings a novel lower affinity CD3 engaging technology that complements our BiTE platform. The availability of a second CD3 engager will allow us to broaden our bi-specifics capabilities and enable customization of the T-Cell engaging domain, depending on the disease and target.  Finally, we're acquiring clinical and pre-clinical oncology programs directed against high-value targets of interest, which we specifically selected based on our own discovery efforts and target validation. These include a Phase 1 bispecific antibody for prostate cancer that complements Acapatamab AMG 160, also targeting PSMA and amg 509 are targeting steep one which was recently granted fast-track designation by the FDA. Turning to oncology, we continue to Advance LUMAKRAS registration around the globe, with regulatory reviews and progress in multiple jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan.  Feedback from the medical community on the LUMAKRAS launched in the U.S. has been overwhelmingly positive. and I've heard personally from oncologists who are excited to have LUMAKRAS available and are heavily screening their patients for KRAS G12C mutations. I'm pleased to report that more than 2,000 patients have received LUMAKRAS across more than 000 sites, and 900 investigators or treating physicians, including through our global early access programs. In the LUMAKRAS development program, we continue to advance our broad-based combination efforts.  Initial data from our Vectibix combination in colorectal cancer have been accepted for presentation at ESMO in September and the MEK and oral EGFR combination abstracts will be submitted to a medical meeting in the fourth quarter. To expand our LUMAKRAS experience for SHP2 [Indiscernible] along with our ongoing collaboration with Revolution Medicines, we have also entered into a collaboration with Novartis for our SHP2 combination trial. Updates from our monotherapy, non-small cell lung cancer study, including additional biomarker analyses, as well as data in patients with stable brain metastases, have been accepted for presentation at the World Congress on lung cancer.  Recall that we are also investigating LUMAKRAS in patients with active brain metastases. We also plan on initiating a Phase II first-line non-small cell lung cancer study in patients with PD-L1 negative and or STK11 mutant tumors in the third quarter. In the Bemarituzumab program, we are having good discussions with regulators on the Phase 3 gastric cancer development path and plan to initiate a registration program by year-end. This will include two phases three trials. One investigating the utility of Bemarituzumab in combination with chemotherapy.  And the other evaluating the addition of Bemarituzumab to chemotherapy and the checkpoint inhibitor. We are also planning to potentially pivotal Phase II study with [Indiscernible], AMG 757. Our half-life extended BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. And we look forward to discussing the next steps with regulators in the coming weeks. I am also pleased to report that we have completed enrollment in the castrate-resistant prostate cancer expansion cohort for [Indiscernible] or AMG 160.  In inflammation, continuing our leadership in dermatology, we are working closely with Kyowa Kirin to advance AMG 451, also known as KHK4083, a first-in-class OX40 antibody into Phase 3 for atopic dermatitis. We look forward to the presentation of the Phase 2 atopic dermatitis data at the annual meeting of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology at the end of September, as well as, initiating discussions with regulators on our Phase 3 development plans in the coming months.  In addition, the FDA accepted the Otezla supplemental filing for mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Finally, we and our partners, AstraZeneca, we're very pleased that the FDA granted Tezepelumab priority review for the treatment of asthma, reflecting significant unmet medical need. In closing. I would like to thank the entire organization for continuing to advance important medicines for our patients. Peter? Thanks, Dave. So, as we mentioned, as you pointed out, this study in first-line, non-small cell lung cancer will be conducted in patients who are either a PD-L1 negative or STK 11 mutant. These are populations of patients, of course, who -- patients who don't typically benefit from checkpoint inhibitors, where there's really, we think a lot of residual unmet medical need. In fact, STK 11 mutational status may help confer resistance to checkpoint inhibition. So, that is the population that we're targeting.  Whether this can be potentially registration enabling or not, I think it's too early to speculate. The FDA has generally been clear that in first-line lung cancer, they wish to see randomized trials. So, one would have to anticipate having a pretty spectacular efficacy readout to lead to registration based on a single-arm Phase 2 trial. Obvious -- if we saw compelling data, we would have the appropriate conversations going forward. Okay. The next question. Yes. In terms of the Phase 3 trial, I think the best way to think about that, Umer, is that we expect data in the first half of next year. And given the general rapidity of progression of patients historically in second and third line lung cancer to standard therapy, the utility of an interim analysis may not be particularly useful, meaning the primary analysis often falls very quickly after an interim analysis. So, of course, we'll take a look at that and get a better sense in the second half of the year of the event rates.  But, I would really point to the primary analysis in the first half of next year as the major event. And then in first-line, as I said, we think that there is significant unmet medical need in the PD-L1 negative STK 11 mutant -- and/or STK 11 mutant population, given the relative refractoriness of those tumors to currently available treatments. And so, we're very much looking forward to getting that study launched shortly on and seeing the data readout. We'll provide guidance on timelines as soon as enrollment is really underway. Thanks, Jay. Given the regimen that we're studying, you can expect that most of the patients that have been enrolled on that particular combination of LUMAKRAS and Vectibix will have colorectal cancer given the backbone of Vectibix here, although the trial is open across malignancies for treating physicians to enroll patients if they feel that regimen may be appropriate. In terms of driving uptake of Vectibix, I don't want to speculate on that. Our job here is really to generate these combination data and see if -- we think we can really drive things forward, particularly in colorectal cancer. Yeah, thanks, Matt. I'm glad you brought up AMG 592, our IL-2 mutein. Just to remind everyone, this is a molecule designed to enhance the number and function of T regulatory cells, some of the key modulatory cells in the immune system. In many autoimmune diseases, the T regulatory access is out of whack. As you mentioned, we anticipate sharing Phase 1b data in lupus at a medical meeting towards the end of the year. And we'll look forward there -- being able to share those data with you. In addition, a Phase II trial in lupus is actively enrolling now.  And then finally, as you mentioned, Matt, we are launching a study in ulcerative colitis, another autoimmune disorder, in which there's quite a bit of evidence of dysregulation of the [Indiscernible] So I think it's really the Phase 2 readouts here that will be critical as we accrue those data. As always, we'll look to make sure that we are adding something to what is standardly available. In lupus, there remains a very large residual unmet medical need.  There was an approval within the last day or two, of course, but only the second drug in 40 years and a very large patient population, they're still requiring active medicines are ulcerative colitis particularly for a long-term remission is also an area with substantial unmet medical needs. So, it's full speed ahead in the IL-2 mutein program. We'll look forward to sharing this data with you. Thanks, Mike. Let me start with the second part first. You're exactly right. That's simply diversifying our experience. We're moving forward as I noted with both Revolution Medicines on combination as well as this new collaboration with Novartis [Indiscernible] we look forward to both datasets. In terms of the MEK or EGFR combinations, as I've said before, in terms of response rate, it's going to vary by line of therapy and indication in terms of what sort of increments that you want to see.  But generally, 10%, 20%, 30% relative improvement in response rates and progression-free survival, certainly beyond first-line, is typically what we would want to see and those are the rough sort of benchmarks that we'll use. And on these first cohorts, of course, the critical thing upfront is safety and determining appropriate doses, and then moving into expansion cohorts for efficacy. Thanks again. Yeah. Maybe I'll start with the question on combinations. Of course, the ones we like the best are the ones that work and that's what we're testing right now. It would actually -- all of these combinations have been selected for one or another reason or both. One, most importantly, is a biological possibility. so, reason to believe in either additive or synergistic effects.  And then two, if combining molecules are part of a background regimen, and so we think we're really covering the waterfront in terms of indications of interest with relevant combinations here. And at this point, Ken and I, I think it's really an empirical matter of generating the data. And of course, I will share that as we've outlined. Yeah. Thanks, Carter. We're very enthusiastic about this molecule. Atopic dermatitis is a disease with widespread prevalence actually in global populations. despite existing therapies. We think there is a very large amount of residual net medical need. Patients often cycle through therapies. Given the novel mechanism of action, we're targeting the OX40 pathway. We think there is quite a big opportunity to have a real impact in this field.  As I mentioned, we'll be presenting the Phase 2b data at the end of September at one of the major European dermatology meetings and I think there you'll get a sense of our thoughts on dosing and what things may look like going forward, and of course, as we have discussions with regulators, we'll outline our plans on the phase 3 program, which will in all likelihood be a suite of studies. Let me ask Murdo to comment a little further here. Yeah. Thanks, Cory. As we've discussed before, we're looking at both direct combinations and sequential therapy here. So, I think you can see -- you can expect to see data from both of those sometime through the first half of next year or so as we accumulate enough data to define what the relevant path forward is with a checkpoint inhibitor. So more to come there, but we continue to actively work on these development programs. Yes, thanks, Dane, I think to take the last part of your question. what we've seen are ongoing response rates consistent with -- response rates consistent with the data that you saw from the later cohorts that we presented a month or 2 ago. And in addition, we've actually been impressed with the duration of response. Most of these patients are third line plus, which, as you know, is a very aggressive disease in small cell lung cancer. And durable responses here are vanishing rare. So that I think is in addition.  What really gives us encouragement here. As we discussed the potential registrational path with the FDA in the coming weeks, I think we will focus on the patient population, but I think the initial foray is likely to be those later lines of therapy. We are moving forward in our development program now and are actively investigating earlier lines of therapy as well. That is clearly the end game that we're pointing for with Tarlatamab. And given the sort of activity that we're seeing in the clinic right now. Thanks, Michael. I think you're exactly right. With the chemotherapy combinations, number one. And then going into biomarker selected populations. As we've discussed in terms of our planned upcoming first-line [Indiscernible] which we'll be launching on shortly. And so, should checkpoint inhibitor combinations not be feasible, I would expect that we would piece together other routes to first-line to find patients who are most likely to benefit. I mean, I think the short answer here is no, and we remain extremely bullish about tezepelumab, given its activity across a range of patients with asthma, regardless of eosinophil count. As we mentioned, we were granted priority review by the FDA. Clearly an acknowledgment of the potential fit of this medicine with a large residual unmet medical need. So that's [Indiscernible]. That doesn't really give us positive [Indiscernible]."

        "content": "Operator: My name is Erica and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen\u2019s First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\nArvind Sood: Erica, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to our Q1 call. I think the 2 key themes for this quarter are continued focus on volume-driven growth and pipeline advancement. Lots to cover, but we\u2019ll do our best to stick an efficient format of limited prepared comments and addressing your one best question. So slides have been posted. Just a quick reminder, that we\u2019ll use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation. And some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to different materially. So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob?\nRobert Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. We had a busy start to 2021 and a first quarter that\u2019s something of a mirror image to what we experienced a year ago. Last year, if you recall, we came out of the gate with a very strong January and February, and then started to really feel the impact of the pandemic in March. This year, especially in the U.S. it was almost the reverse. We felt the impact of the pandemic in January and February, and we began to see a recovery in March, a trend that seems to be holding in April as well. Setting aside the pandemic, we executed effectively in the first quarter and this is reflected in the strong competitive performance of our brands globally. Our strong biosimilar is showing the rapid progress of our lead pipeline molecules and the addition of an attractive Phase-3-ready molecule in oncology. Altogether, we remain confident in our full year outlook. We\u2019re fortunate to have a diverse portfolio of newer products that continue to show strong volume growth. Repatha, for example, delivered 36% volume growth in the first quarter. It remains the clear leader of the PCSK9 market globally, and will soon reach the milestone of 1 million patients served. We\u2019re also the global leader in bone health with Prolia and of Evenity generating double-digit volume in the quarter. Our industry-leading portfolio of biosimilars is annualizing above the $2 billion mark. And I would remind you that we have 3 additional biosimilars in Phase 3 development and look forward to a flow of new launch opportunities for these and AMGEVITA over the next few years. As we\u2019ve shared with you many times in the past, we\u2019re active in business development, looking to complement our internally developed innovation with compelling external opportunities. And our recent acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics is a good example of that. As you know, one of the molecules we acquired in that deal, bemarituzumab was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA as a first-line therapy for a subset of patients with gastric cancer. More than 1 million new gastric cancer cases are diagnosed annually. And the disease is particularly prevalent in the Asia Pacific region, which we\u2019ve said previously will account for approximately 25% of our growth over the next decade. Bemarituzumab is now our third late-stage clinical medicine to be granted Breakthrough Therapy status, joining sotorasib, for which the trade-name LUMAKRAS has now been provisionally approved for use in the U.S. and tezepelumab also has earned that Breakthrough Therapy distinction. With a strong balance sheet, healthy cash flows and our proven ability to integrate, we\u2019ll continue to look for external opportunities that strengthen us in our stated areas of focus. Before I turn things over to our CFO, Peter Griffith, I want to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to serving patients around the world and delivering results for our stakeholders. I look forward to our Q&A session a little later in our call. But for now, over to you, Peter.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Bob. I would like to take a few moments to reflect on the strong fundamentals of the business and further to reaffirm our full-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Let me first confirm our predictable consistent capital allocation hierarchy as seen in our Q1 activity. It always begins with investing in internal innovation. LUMAKRAS and tezepelumab, both internally discovered, and each granted Breakthrough Therapy designation, are excellent examples of this. We also patiently pursue external business development opportunities that clear our hurdle rate and then are consistent with our areas of therapeutic focus, in which we are confident of integrating into Amgen efficiently and effectively on a timely basis. We allocated $2 billion of our shareholders\u2019 capital to the Five Prime acquisition in the second quarter and have committed additional R&D funding to pursue other indications for the lead molecule bema. Our capital expenditures remain a high priority, including investments in our industry-leading protein manufacturing, our ESG initiatives including enabling carbon neutrality by 2027, and digitization imperatives. We continue to return capital to our shareholders. First, we paid dividends of $1.76 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from 2020. This year marks our 11th year of dividends with meaningful increases in each of those years. Second, we repurchased 3.7 million shares in the first quarter at cost of roughly $865 million. Finally, our capital allocation hierarchy always builds on our efficient capital structure, which results in an optimal weighted average cost of capital. Now, I will briefly walk through our first quarter financial results. Recall that in 2021, we are now comparing to our recast 2020 results that exclude the impact of fair value adjustments to equity investments that were historically included in non-GAAP OI&E. In Q1, revenues decreased 4%. Historically, first quarter sales have been the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year. As we entered 2021, we knew that COVID would likely introduce some variability. And as the quarter progressed and we saw a continuing cumulative effect of COVID cases on prescribing patterns, we anticipated that Q1 would be more negatively impacted, which led us to disclose in March that it would be moderately below 2020\u2019s percentage of the full year. First quarter sales benefited from 4% volume growth. Looking back to Q1 in 2020, we recorded approximately $150 million of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions, creating a negative impact on year-over-year growth comparisons in Q1 2021. As we get underway with the second quarter, we expect there to be some continuing cumulative COVID impacts. While we expect to see improvements in the rate of recovery, that recovery will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter increased 2% year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Effective Q2 2021, cost of sales will increase as a percent of product sales in connection with our first shipments of antibodies to Lilly. Recall that revenue from shipments of these antibodies will be recorded in other revenues. For the full year, we expect R&D spend will increase as our innovative pipeline continues to progress, which now includes bema from the Five Prime acquisition as well as the Rodeo acquisition. And for the full year, we expect SG&A spend to decline. We continue our focus on digitization imperatives. Non-GAAP OI&E was a net $375 million expense in Q1. This is unfavorable by $79 million on a year-over-year basis, due to the recording of our portion of Beijing\u2019s loss this quarter. Recall the recognition of Beijing\u2019s results did not start until Q2 2020. The effects year-over-year of the adjustments in sales deductions, combined with the recognition of the Beijing results, totaled about $0.29 in decreased EPS on a comparison basis for Q1 2021 and explain a large portion of the 12% decline in EPS year-over-year. Now, turning to the outlook for the business for 2021, based on underlying market dynamics and our investment plan, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance with a revenue range of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion, and a non-GAAP EPS range of $16 to $17. Important additional points to consider, as you model the remainder of 2021. We are providing more specific quarter-over-quarter guidance, given the unprecedented continuing cumulative COVID impact on the operating environment. But we do not expect to provide such guidance on an ongoing basis. We see the recovery from COVID-19 more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. And for the second quarter, we expect total revenues to grow between 7% and 10% sequentially from the first quarter. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to increase by about 7% over last year, with an operating margin of roughly 50%, which includes operating expenses for Five Prime and Rodeo. Historically, the Q2 quarter-over-quarter operating expense increase is about 10%. But in the second quarter of this year, we expect quarter-over-quarter operating expenses to increase in the mid-teens percentage range, reflecting the impact of our Lilly COVID-19 antibody manufacturing agreement. Investments for growth including the Five Prime acquisition, as well as increasing activity levels, including launch preparation. For the full year, we continue to anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be a net expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Our capital expenditures guidance remains unchanged at $900 million. And based on our confidence in the long range outlook of the business, we are raising the upper end of our share repurchase range to $5 billion for 2021 versus prior guidance of $4 billion. So our range for share repurchases in 2021 is now $3 billion to $5 billion. Additionally, we\u2019re updating our non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 13.5% to 14.5% versus prior guidance of 13% to 14%. My confidence is strong in the long-term outlook for Amgen, given the strength of the business, and the strength of our outstanding and dedicated team of 23,000-plus colleagues that deliver everyday to patients, and also deliver long-term growth to our shareholders. This concludes the financial update. I\u2019ll turn it over to Murdo. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Peter. First quarter product sales declined 5% year-over-year, volumes grew 4% driven by double-digit growth for a number of products, including Prolia, Repatha, MVASI, and KANJINTI. Net selling price declined 7% and the year-over-year comparison was negatively affected by 2% due to a benefit in Q1 2020 from approximately $150 million of changes to estimated sales deductions that did not reoccur to the same magnitude in Q1 of 2021. In the first quarter, the cumulative effect of the COVID pandemic on missed patient visits and diagnoses impacted our business, January and February were clearly affected by post-holiday COVID spikes, and March showed demand improvement across most brands, which has continued into April. Despite the impact of the pandemic, our teams have found solutions to address the continuity of care, stabilizing our continuing patient volume. We also saw improvement in customer facing execution throughout the quarter across all communication channels, including face-to-face and virtual activities. We expect some COVID-19 related disruptions still in the second quarter, the steady recovery thereafter. I\u2019ll now review some product details beginning with our innovative portfolio. In bone health, Prolia grew 16% year-over-year, recording over $500 million of U.S. sales in the U.S. for the first time. As a majority of osteoporosis patients in the U.S. have been vaccinated and diagnosis rates are at approximately 90% to pre-COVID-19 levels. We\u2019re confident in Prolia\u2019s continued growth in 2021. EVENITY sales increased 7% year-over-year driven by strong volume growth, given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of postmenopausal women, if entity provides an excellent therapy to build bone first, which should then be followed by treatment with Prolia. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year to a quarterly sales record of $286 million driven by 36% volume growth and we maintain global leadership in the PCSK9 class. Sales outside the U.S. grew by 40% driven by strong patient demand. In the U.S., we continue to see strength in new patient starts with new-to-brand prescriptions growing 54% quarter-over-quarter helped by favorable pharmacy benefit manager formulary changes. U.S. volume growth demonstrates that we\u2019ve made good progress against our strategy to provide Repatha at an affordable price to patients, particularly those with Medicare Part D coverage. This acceleration in Medicare Part D growth has increased our exposure to the so called doughnut hole, which creates some negative impact on overall net price. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high risk cardiovascular patients. Next to Aimovig, which remains the market leader in the highly competitive CGRP class; Aimovig volumes grew 20% year-over-year in the first quarter with a 45% average total prescription share and 38% average new-to-brand prescription share. Year-over-year net selling price declined primarily driven by increased rebates to maintain patient access. Unfortunately, millions of patients suffering from migraine are sub-optimally treated with older, less effective therapies. Given the head-to-head data, we\u2019ve generated showing Aimovig superiority against topiramate, we\u2019re confident we can help many more patients suffering from chronic migraine. Turning to our inflammation portfolio, where Otezla has demonstrated a robust safety and efficacy profile with over 6 years of real world experience in market with more than 500,000 patients treated globally. Enbrel similarly has served millions of patients globally since 1998. Otezla sales were $476 million in the quarter. Volume growth was 9% driven primarily by 11% total prescription growth in the U.S. Otezla remains the market leading brands and systemic medication for psoriasis with an approximately 30% share of first-line treatment. However, new-to-brand prescription volume remained flat as COVID-19 continued to suppress the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis patients. Year-over-year growth was also negatively impacted given pandemic-related inventory stocking in Q1 of 2020. Otezla has more than 90% commercial payer coverage in the U.S. without requiring a biological step, and is an affordable, safe and efficacious option for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients. We see attractive growth opportunities for Otezla as the pandemic recovery progresses. In addition, geographic expansion and the anticipated approval later this year of the mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication will contribute to future Otezla growth. In 2021, year-over-year comparisons for Enbrel are adversely impacted by $255 million of favorable estimated sales deductions that were recorded in 2020, $115 million of which were in Q1 of 2020. In the quarter, Enbrel sales decreased 20% year-over-year with declines in both unit volume and net selling price. Moving forward, we expect volume and net price trends to continue. Parsabiv sales decreased 55% year-over-year driven by 65% volume decline. With Parsabiv\u2019s inclusion in the end-stage renal disease bundled in the U.S., we have seen dialysis clinics quickly implement new treatment protocols, switching patients from Parsabiv to generic cinacalcet. Switching to biosimilars, Q1 sales were $570 million driven by strong volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We continue to hold leading biosimilar shares in Europe from AMGEVITA and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI, where we saw average shares of 50% and 43%, respectively in Q1. For the remainder of the year, we expect biosimilar volume growth to be offset by declines in net selling price due to increased competition. Longer term growth for biosimilars will come from expansion of existing products to new markets and launches of additional biosimilar molecules, such as AMGEVITA in the U.S., and biosimilars for SOLIRIS, STELARA and EYLEA. In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long acting G-CSF with 54% share of volume in the quarter. In Q1, we surpassed 1 million patients who with the help of Onpro were able to receive their G-CSF treatment, while reducing the need to return to their doctor\u2019s office or other site of care for administration. Consistent with recent trends, Neulasta\u2019s U.S. average selling price declined 30% on a year-over-year basis, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2021 driven by intensifying competition. XGEVA sales decreased 3% year-over-year for the first quarter, as volume growth in Asia was offset by lower net selling price in that region. U.S. unit volumes declined year-over-year driven by demand impacts in January and February, with recovery beginning in March and into April. KYPROLIS sales decreased 10% year-over-year for the first quarter as the pandemic is suppressed the number of new patients starting treatment for multiple myeloma. Moving forward, we expect promotion to drive growth in second line and beyond as a result of our launch of the combination indication of KYPROLIS and DARZALEX plus dexamethasone or DKd. The combination of KYPROLIS with Sarclisa and dexamethasone, or Isa-Kd was also approved in the quarter. As Bob mentioned, our team is ready to launch sotorasib or LUMAKRAS upon approval, and we\u2019re excited to establish it as a foundational therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. We\u2019ve already launched our biomarker assist program, which removes access barriers to testing and helps appropriate patients with out of pocket costs. And we\u2019re also preparing for the launch of Tezepelumab with our partner AstraZeneca and are enthusiastic about the prospect of having a therapy that can help treat the more than 2.5 million people in the world living with severe uncontrolled asthma. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our Q1 execution given the pandemic-related disruption of new patient diagnoses and treatment. And we\u2019ll continue our focused execution during Q2, and are projecting recovery over the second half of the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn it to Dave.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll begin with 2 new programs that are strong strategic fits within our portfolio. First, we are excited to welcome our new colleagues from Five Prime Therapeutics and begin work on bemarituzumab. The integration is going well and we have hit the ground running with Phase 3 planning activities. As Bob mentioned, we received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA and look forward to discussions with regulators on the development program, including Phase 3 in the near future. We\u2019ll also investigate bemarituzumab and other indications where FGFR2b may play a role, including squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And we\u2019ll have more to say on the entire development program as those plans are finalized. In inflammation, I would like to highlight our acquisition of Rodeo Therapeutics and their 15 prostaglandin dehydrogenase program, which was motivated by compelling preclinical data from Rodeo and valuable insights from deCODE. This is a nice illustration of our use of human genetic data to inform drug discovery and development. LUMAKRAS program continues to advance with several regulatory milestones in the first quarter, including global submissions for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and the priority review from FDA with a regulatory action date of August 16. We\u2019re having productive interactions with the FDA and multiple other regulatory agencies that will include Japan with today\u2019s anticipated submission, and we look forward to making LUMAKRAS available to patients as soon as possible. We\u2019re also pleased to receive Temporary Authorization for Use status in France. This designation is to promote fast access to innovative medicines before marketing authorization and conventional access, and we have received a large number of requests. In the clinical development program, we completed enrollment in the Phase 3 study versus docetaxel in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Based on the overall efficacy and safety profile of LUMAKRAS and discussions with regulators, we reduce the sample size in this study, while maintaining appropriate statistical power to assess the progression free survival primary endpoint. The timelines of the study have not changed as the primary endpoint remains event driven. Although, we have demonstrated that the 960 milligram dose is safe and efficacious in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, we continue to explore different doses and regimens as is common in oncology drug development. As part of this effort, we are initiating a new cohort to determine whether a once-daily oral dose of 240 milligrams maintains the safety and efficacy profile of the 960 milligram dose in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Should a lower dose be as safe and efficacious as 960 milligrams, it may further enhance the patient experience with one-daily LUMAKRAS. We expect the results from this study in late 2022 or early 2023, and do not expect any impact on the timelines of our ongoing priority review. We also continue to make good progress in evaluating combination regimens. Efficacy cohorts are underway for our MEK inhibitor, EGFR antibody, and oral EGFR inhibitor combinations. And we expect to present updates on these regimens at medical meetings in the second half of the year. We continue to evaluate doses and regimens to find the optimal options for patients in our other combinations, including PD-1 and SHP2. Finally, we are initiating triplet cohorts in colorectal cancer of LUMAKRAS, with standard of care chemotherapy and either an anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF antibody. In our BiTE programs, we have initiated several new studies, including new indications for AMG 160, targeting PSMA in non-small cell lung cancer, and AMG 757, targeting DLL3, now also being investigated in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Details on these and other development programs, including small molecules can be found in our press release. Turning to tezepelumab developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca. The Phase 3 NAVIGATOR data were well received by clinicians and additional analyses will be presented at the American Thoracic Society meeting in May. We remain on track to submit regulatory filings this quarter and believe the data support tezepelumab as a first line biologic therapy for a broad population of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We are also investigating other indications with Phase 2 studies in COPD and chronic spontaneous urticaria. And most recently, a Phase 3 study for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Finally, on Otezla, we submitted a supplemental new drug application to FDA based on the Phase 3 ADVANCE study in mild to moderate psoriasis. The positive results from ADVANCE were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology or AAD meeting a few days ago. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our staff for continuing to deliver for patients.\nRobert Bradway: Okay, Erica, thank you. Let\u2019s turn now to Q&A. And perhaps you could remind our callers of the procedure for asking questions. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I had a question on Otezla, the head to head against deucravacitinib at AAD showed some pretty meaningful differentiation. I just wanted to ask from a maybe a commercial perspective, how does that dataset along with the ADVANCE data change you\u2019re thinking about, the positioning of Otezla in the marketplace with respect to psoriasis? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah, thanks, Geoff, for the question. The first thing I would just reiterate is that we anticipated that the deucra data would indeed show what they did show. And we assumed that in the model that we put together for the transaction and we\u2019ve assumed that for the balance of this year. What I would say is that we continue to believe that Otezla is really ideally positioned in the first line pre-biologic psoriasis market. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve been on the market for 6 years now. We have in-market cumulative patient experience with over 500,000 individuals globally. We have excellent commercial and payer coverage at over 90% of covered lives. And we continue to make really good progress holding a 30% share in the market with really outstanding customer-facing capabilities. The other thing that we, of course, look at is positioning in the market and how that holds up against not just deucra, but other competitors. And we think that, we really are the first kind of option pre-biologic post-topical. And dermatologists have become very comfortable using Otezla that way. Payer coverage is consistent with that position in the market. And with the pending mild to moderate indication data, which were presented at the same AAD meeting, which were quite compelling. We expect to be able to expand our utilization of Otezla in psoriasis population, in the milder patient type. So overall, we like our position in the market. The way I see it is we still have to see how the full detailed safety data look for the TYK2 product, given that it is part of the JAK family. And it took 6 years and over 200,000 patients for us to understand the Xeljanz safety profile. So I think there is a lot still to be understood here, but not necessarily the safety and efficacy of Otezla.\nGeoff Meacham: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Yee with Jefferies.\nMichael Yee: I have a question maybe for David. You had a nice update and comments on KRAS. Maybe you could just put some context around the timing of data now for the second half, around MEK, maybe talk about what drives the timing of that and disclosure. And then the comment around 240 versus 960, I think there\u2019d be different ways to interpret that. Maybe you can make a comment about that, because I thought 960 was pretty well tolerated. It\u2019s got a good profile. So maybe make some comments on that. That will be great. Thanks, David.\nDavid Reese: Yeah, thanks, Mike, both great questions. I think our anticipation is that at meetings right into the start of the second half of the year, we\u2019ll start to see some of the cohort data that we outlined, MEK and then both EGFR antibody and small molecule inhibitor combinations. And you can probably see those come out sequentially over the second half of the year, as we accumulate data. I would say that the combination therapy programs are moving along quite rapidly. And as we mentioned, we\u2019ve opened some new triplet combination. So I feel very good about where we are in the status of combination regimens. In terms of the dose comparison study, we\u2019ve now got long-term data from both our Phase 1 trial, as well as the Phase 2 trial, updated target coverage information, pharmacokinetics, as well as of course, efficacy and safety data. And based on modeling, we wondered, could we achieve adequate target coverage at 250 and preserve potentially the same efficacy profile that we\u2019ve seen at 960 milligrams? And so, that\u2019s just the question that we\u2019re going to ask. It\u2019s quite common to continue dose exploration in oncology molecules. And I would view this as par for the course. We are very pleased with the tolerability profile. And as you pointed out, at 960 milligrams we\u2019ve had an outstanding experience. In fact, this is one of the best tolerated drugs that I\u2019ve been involved with in 30 years in oncology drug development. And that\u2019s not really what a driver is here, but can we potentially get by with efficacy at a lower 240 milligram dose and enhance patient experience?\nMichael Yee: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer.\nJay Olson: Oh, hey, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m curious about the Phase 2 data for Olpasiran that you expect in the first half of next year. Can you just talk about what sort of signals you\u2019ll be looking for in that data, in terms of your plans to design a Phase 3 study and any potential points of differentiation from Pelacarsen? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yeah, thanks, Jay. And for those who may not know off the top of their heads, what Olpasiran is, this was formerly AMG 890. It\u2019s small interfering RNA, designed to lower lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, where elevated LP little a may be a driver. As we noted, we completed enrollment in what\u2019s a robust Phase 2 trial that actually completed enrollment ahead of schedule. And what we\u2019ll be looking for, as we unveil those data, Jay, are first of all, longer-term follow-up, meaning sufficient long-term suppression of Lp(a) levels and our targets would be in the range of the Phase 1 data that we presented last November, at the American Heart Association meeting, and then of course, additional safety data. And of course, we are exploring different dose levels, as is pretty much standard in a program like this. And so, this would be in part for dose selection for Phase 3 going forward. We are very actively engaged already in Phase 3 planning and what the design of that sort of trial may look like. Based on the data that we\u2019ve seen to date, one of our goals may be relatively infrequent dosing, given the duration of effect that we observed in the Phase 1 trial. And that\u2019s one thing that we\u2019ll be taking a close look at, as well in Phase 2.\nJay Olson: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could just comment a little more detail on the Repatha trends. It looks like we\u2019re really starting to see the product break out a little bit here and not seeing some of those first quarter gross-to-net issues that you\u2019ve sort of experienced in the past couple years. Do you think you\u2019re at a point now where you\u2019re going to get to substantial Part D penetration and also see rest of world penetration? Maybe you could just comment on your outlook there. Thanks.\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah, thank you, Matthew. We are pleased, obviously, with the quarter for Repatha. And, it\u2019s been a bit of a journey getting here and trying to ensure that patients have affordable access to Repatha, particularly in Medicare Part D, as you point out. I would say that we are anticipating with one exception, we are anticipating relatively stable net price for the remainder of the year. And the exception that I\u2019m pointing out is that as we expand our penetration of Medicare Part D, we will have some drag on our net price as a function of patients entering and staying in the doughnut hole for a period of time. So that\u2019s the one downside of helping patients in Medicare Part D. There is still a coverage gap in that benefit. And, of course, given the durability of treatment and the chronic nature of Repatha, they can be in that coverage gap for quite a bit. So we do have more exposure to the doughnut hole over time. But as you could tell from the first quarter, we were more than able to offset that small drag on. net price. And we anticipate that we\u2019ll continue to penetrate that patient population, given the very strong payer coverage we have there with \u2013 between commercial and Medicare, we\u2019ve got over 80% covered lives for this important product. And there are still millions of patients out there who are sub-optimally treated for their hyperlipidemia given that they\u2019re at very high risk of cardiovascular events. So \u2013 and globally, we were seeing some really strong performance in Europe and the Americas. China is doing quite well, despite not having an RDL listing. And we continue to make inroads in Japan where we are the only PCSK9 on the market.\nOperator: Your next question is from Yaron Werber with Cowen & Company.\nYaron Werber: Great. David, if you don\u2019t mind, I just have a follow-up question as well about LUMAKRAS relating to PD-1 combo specifically. I think you\u2019ve said in the past that you haven\u2019t gotten to the MTD on both drugs, as you tested them in combination, it sounds that you\u2019re continuing to explore dose and schedule. You\u2019ve also recently talked about sequential therapy. So was just trying to say, are we actually going to get data in the second half and why are you testing sequential therapy? What are you trying to say? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yeah, thanks, Yaron. We\u2019re continuing to look at a variety of approaches in combination with PD-1s, whether that\u2019s in combination or sequentially. I think it\u2019s fair to say a number of small molecules, EGFR inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors had challenges combining with PD-1s. And I think there\u2019s a fair amount of work out here. We are \u2013 we\u2019ll provide updates. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll have data that\u2019s robust enough to share in the second half of the year. That\u2019s possible. But I don\u2019t want to promise that, but certainly we\u2019ll provide guidance as those different regimens move along in sequential therapy, maybe actually a preferred approach here.\nOperator: Your next question is from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one follow-up on that, Dave, I was just wondering, does the 940 mg dose exploration have to do with this question on how to best combine KRAS with a PD-1? And then, my other question, I just was wondering Bob or Peter, if you could comment on the tax proposals coming out of DC and any implications for your Puerto Rico \u2013 some of the tax benefits you get out of Puerto Rico on the manufacturing side? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yeah. Thanks, Terence. I\u2019ll take the first part of that question. Yeah, the 240 milligram dose comparison study, doesn\u2019t have really anything to do with the combinations. Dosing as you\u2019re aware, in combination regimens in oncology, one, typically explores a range of doses, potentially of all of the members of that combination regimen, depending on what the backbone may be. But this is really a monotherapy exploration, and again, determined to see whether we can preserve efficacy at a lower dose at this lower 240 milligram dose.\nRobert Bradway: On the tax front, Peter, why don\u2019t you share our thoughts?\nPeter Griffith: I will. Terence, very good question there. And, look, I think it\u2019s premature to speculate on this. We expect the administration\u2019s proposal for the subject, I think is everybody does to \u2013 significant debate within Congress and other stakeholders. Rest assured, we\u2019re active in Washington to ensure that our position [and our tax system] [ph] should continue to be competitive, and should continue to really encourage innovation in the United States [as well heard and understood] [ph]. And we are very supportive, as you can imagine of incentives to encourage manufacturing in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. And, Terence, I would just let you know that our tax leader Jackie Crouse has much expertise in the area of Puerto Rico, not just around tax, but just overall into how the economy down there functions and so forth. So she\u2019s called upon regularly by the legislators for advice and counsel. Thanks again for the question.\nOperator: Your next question is from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. David, I have a 2-part question on KRAS. First, perhaps if you could just walk us through your thought process on why 240 in particular? Why not 180 or 360? And I say that in the context of having seen responses as low as 180, perhaps, you could even give us a flavor for the PK curves look like around the 240 doses above and below? And secondly, I recall back when the Phase 3 was initiated for KRAS. The powering math was really directed at OS, not PFS, even though the primary endpoints PFS. I realize the conversations with FDA have moved towards PFS, and looks like the new powering is more than reasonable for PFS. But I do want understand the evolution and thought process away from OS, and what we can reasonably expect on p-values around OS with data that Amgen? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yeah. Thanks, Umer. Good question. Yeah, the 240 milligram dose was chosen based on modeling that we\u2019ve done that really takes account of all of the dose levels pharmacokinetic data, target coverage data, or accumulated preclinical data regarding efficacy at different target coverage levels. And, this was really chosen as a lower bound, where we thought we would potentially preserve or could preserve the efficacy that we\u2019re seeing at 960 milligrams. In regards to the Phase 3 trial, as you note, we change the powering to really have \u2013 we have good power on the progression free survival endpoint that was done in concert with regulators. We will be able to take a look at overall survival. The power will be somewhat reduced in terms of the overall survival endpoint, but \u2013 I think, we\u2019ll still have a pretty good sense of what the drug is producing in terms of overall survival. Part of the thinking here is well is to minimize exposure of patients to the docetaxel control arm.\nUmer Raffat: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mohit Bansal with Citi.\nMohit Bansal: Question \u2013 and maybe 1 question for Murdo. So Onpro has done really well during pandemic. Could you please remind us how often these contracts are negotiated? And should we expect any reversal in Onpro trends? Are we seeing anything there as the pandemic subsides? Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Mohit. The contracts aren\u2019t necessarily on the schedule. We have some large networks, where we negotiate annually, but we have a lot of smaller what we call value-based accounts, where we contract on a much more non-calendarized basis, so they\u2019re happening throughout the course of the year. And is your question with respect to reversal \u2013 are you asking me about price trends, volume trends? Can you clarify that question?\nMohit Bansal: I mean, the trends, because there was a trend towards using more Onpro versus the PFS, given it is to taken at-home products. So do you think there could be some kind of reversal there as the pandemic subside, because then patients can come in and then get their shots?\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah, thank you for the clarification. Obviously, we\u2019re watching that clearly, the pandemic was stimulus for many oncologists to think more carefully about the G-CSF treatment that they were going to use in order to help minimize the amount of provider interaction that patients would incur. What we have been doing in the meantime, though, is reinforcing that you actually can improve outcomes by using long acting G-CSF. And using Onpro in particular, so we have a promotional effort that I think is helping strengthen the volume demand curve. The only thing I will continue to point out, though, is with competition comes some price erosion. And we have a new competitor entrant in that category in the long acting G-CSF category. So we anticipate more net price negative evolution through the remainder of the year.\nMohit Bansal: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink.\nGeoffrey Porges: Right. Thank you very much for the question. Murdo, could you just discuss the issue of price pretty significant negative price effect? First of all, could you tell us whether that\u2019s all in the U.S. or whether it\u2019s U.S. and ex-U.S.? And then secondly, essentially, in the U.S. took significant price increases at the end of the year, but still have negative price Q-on-Q looks like 8% or 9%? Is this going to be a trend that persists throughout the year? And then, Bob, perhaps you could comment on what we should be modeling in terms of legislative or executive order changes to pricing going forward? You usually have your finger on the pulse in Washington. Thanks.\nMurdo Gordon: Sure. All right. Thanks, Geoff. Let me go first on the overall price evolution in the portfolio, we continue to believe that mid-single-digit net negative price for the portfolio for the years, the right number, that\u2019s what we continue to see what you know and what we experienced, probably more than some of our peer companies in the first quarter, given the nature of our portfolio is more net negative price evolution, because of patients renewing and their benefits, and going through benefit re-verification and hitting, they\u2019re kind of out of pocket recess. And so our co-pay assistance programs have more drag, we did activate more payer access at the end of last year into this. So we did have on some brands, some increased payer coverage at the cost of some net price negative evolution. But we do anticipate Q1 being the lowest compare, Q2 a little better, and then Q3 and Q4 being better thereafter.\nGeoffrey Porges: Great. Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: And, Jeff, on Washington, I\u2019m not sure whether executive orders the concern these days, or whether it\u2019s something that\u2019s attached to reconciliation, if I had to guess I\u2019d say that the greater risk of something being attached to reconciliation. But it\u2019s still not very clear how this administration and members of the Democratic Party in general, want to try to tackle the question of drug pricing this year. So we\u2019re continuing to stay very involved, as you\u2019d expect, and we have the benefit, I think of being able to demonstrate just how important innovation is with the progress you see being made against the pandemic. And so, we\u2019ll continue to stay active and focus on the things that could be done to improve patient access to medicines. And, I think the other thing, Jeff is to continue to shine a light on the role of the middlemen and how much of the pharmaceutical dollars now wind up in the hands of the middlemen, which I think now, across the country is just an excess of 50%. I think it actually is at 51% now. So we\u2019ll continue to draw attention to that as well.\nGeoffrey Porges: Right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nAlethia Young: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted you guys talk a little bit more about the moderate-to-severe psoriasis market and how you plan on kind of penetrating with the current commercial salesforce you have, especially, in light of potential competition that may emerge over time in Bristol? And then just also with the SHIP2 program, is that still underway as a combination for you guys? Thanks.\nRobert Bradway: Maybe I\u2019ll just start very quickly, Alethia. SHIP2, yeah, that\u2019s underway, and we\u2019re continuing to work on that combination more to come. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah, Alethia, as I mentioned earlier in response to the question on the TYK2 data that were recently presented. As I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we have begun primary care promotion for Otezla in the currently labeled mild-to-moderate patient population, and have seen good response there in terms of uptake with 11% TRx year-on-year performance for the quarter. We\u2019re pretty pleased with that evolution, what we are seeing is a slowdown in the psoriasis patient population in the newly diagnosed patient population, in particular. We think this is a direct impact of COVID causing patients with psoriasis, not to see their dermatologist starting really at the beginning of the pandemic, but what\u2019s happened is the cumulative effect of this is starting that to impact the patients that have passed through some of the topical options. And we depend on bio-naive patients for our growth. So we are definitely pre-biologic option for dermatologists. So we are watching that closely, and we think that that could continue to create some softness in the pre-biologic psoriasis patient market opportunity into Q2 with recovery thereafter, because we are seeing much more patient volume in dermatology offices in March and into April. So we think that things are recovering. But it will take a while for that cumulative effect of new patient softness to work its way through the market. In terms of overall positioning in the market, we continue to think that our safety and efficacy profile is a very attractive option for patients and dermatologists as that first systemic agent pre-biologic, and I think really these days in rheumatology and dermatology, physicians are much more aware of the different categories of options that they have, and the different profiles of the different classes of drugs. And I think that with recent data in the JAK category, there\u2019ll be some speculation and some hesitancy to use a product like the TYK2, as a first bio-naive option for to treat patients.\nRobert Bradway: Hey, Erica, thanks, let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Your next question is from Dane Leone with Raymond James.\nDane Leone: Hi, thank you for taking the questions, and congrats on the update in the start to the year. So the question for me, just as a follow-up to some of those sotorasib questions. Is really maybe since people have been asking about fairly specific things, I think, what everyone\u2019s trying to analyze and some of the updates, if we\u2019re really only getting longer-term follow-up on your pivotal dataset at ASCO is, what\u2019s the team\u2019s view right now of the ability to move sotorasib into the frontline setting and long, a lot of us had thought that you would need a successful combination with PD-1 to move in the frontline setting. Obviously, we haven\u2019t seen you guys start a pivotal dataset. And you just said, might take longer to figure out that algorithm. Alternatively, you go down the SHIP2 pathway, do you, 1 have a timeline for showing us SHIP2 combination data? And 2, is there an alternative path for getting sotorasib into the frontline long setting that we should be thinking about that we might be missing on this call right now? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Yeah, thanks, Dane. In terms of potential frontline combinations, I think a number of them that are being examined in the master protocol, if we can enhance efficacy by multiple hits on the pathway could be feasible, for example, the MEK combination. The EGFR inhibitor combinations, and then as well, as you mentioned PD-1 whether that is in combination or sequentially, for example, to rely on a priming effect is a question that we\u2019re trying to answer. SHIP2, I would also consider an additional hit on the pathway and would also fall into that grouping. So I think, we\u2019ll be guided by emerging data, but all of those would be potential avenues into earlier lines of therapy, in addition also potentially avenues into other indications such as colorectal cancer in some of the other solid tumors, where G12C mutations occur.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.\nRonny Gal: Good afternoon. And thank you for getting me in. 2 if I may. First, just the traditional sotorasib question. I guess, we saw some data in ACR about patient having multiple escape mutations from the first \u2013 from being when treated with KRASG12C inhibitor. And I was wondering, does that concern you that that patient escapes so quickly with multiple mechanisms that suggests that maybe 2 agents will not be enough? Or is that kind of thoughts for the course, and this is what was expected. And second, we have seen some of your peers\u2019 license China developed and tested product to bring to the developed market, especially in oncology. And I was wondering if you consider this strategy, especially as the by similar player, this seems to be a natural complimentary strategy, any so where do you come from that?\nRobert Bradway: Maybe I\u2019ll start with the first part, and then have Murdo address the second part. Yeah, in terms of the mutational patterns that were recently reported, I would say that biologically, nothing that we thought surprised us based on everything we\u2019ve learned about these pathways in the last 30 to 40 years and the potential mechanisms of resistance. This also points the way, I think, 2 specific combinations that may, in fact, help to ameliorate those resistance patterns. I will point out that we will be presenting in short order here also updated comprehensive biomarker data including mutational data, and I think you\u2019ll find that of interest in that is certainly helping to guide our own thinking about the development program as well. Murdo, do you want to take the second half of the question?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes, Ronny, we continue to look globally for product opportunities to license and promote in the world. And I think in oncology, in particular, there have been some interesting deals done lately. We obviously have a strong partnership already with a company based in China through Beijing. And we continue to enjoy that partnership and the co-development that we have. I would also say that given our global footprint, Amgen really is an excellent partner choice with our global capabilities in oncology and general medicine. So we\u2019re opening to business with Chinese companies, Japanese companies, global companies, absolutely.\nRobert Bradway: Okay. We\u2019re pushing up against the top of the hour. So we\u2019re trying to get over questions. But are we bringing on the next caller?\nOperator: Okay. Our next question is from Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Good afternoon, thanks for all the color today, maybe just switching gears a bit and moving to the DCMA sounds like you\u2019re about to go back into the clinic, can you maybe just give us some color on sort of the changes to the protocol or dose escalation and any read through to the broader platform, and just, I guess, focus more specifically on DCMA with those changes comment on sort of your competitiveness in a increasingly competitive space? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Yeah, Carter, thanks for the question. So we do expect to begin dosing again, hopefully, in the next few weeks or so. As you intuited, this would adjust some of the inter-patient dose escalation that is typical with the use of BiTE molecules, and so that we\u2019ll be pushing that forward. More broadly, obviously, we want to be able to deliver a program here that can offer something to patients, and physicians that they realize might not have, and we\u2019ll continually assess the program against that metric. More broadly, I\u2019m quite pleased with the progress we made on AMG 160 and AMG 757. And, as always \u2013 we\u2019ll always provide a cautionary note about extrapolating extensively across programs, because much of what we witness in the clinic is target dependent and so all of these programs will have their idiosyncrasies that need to be worked through as part of the development program.\nOperator: Your next question is from Colin Bristow with UBS Equities.\nColin Bristow: Good evening. Thanks for take me in. Just a quick update from you guys on the business development priorities. What are your current areas of interest? How are you thinking about deal size? And just some overall, I guess, commentary on how you\u2019re thinking about valuations in the space? Thanks.\nRobert Bradway: Well, Colin, as you know, we transacted 2 acquisitions in the first quarter, 1 of the preclinical stage, 1 of the Phase 3 ready, and I think that reflects the breadth of interest that we have. We\u2019re continuing to look at acquisitions and licensing opportunities in our stated areas of focus. So, in particular, immunology the inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancer are attracted to us. And then we have very strong franchises in the few other therapeutic areas, as you know, and in migraine and bone health and nephrology. So we look for commercial opportunities there as well.\nColin Bristow: That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just 1 quick question in terms of protein degradation, obviously, you have a platform that somewhat early, you have any interest in expanding you\u2019re positioning in that space?\nRobert Bradway: Yeah, as we said before, I think going forward we would expect the development of what we call the induced proximity platform to depend both on internal innovation and external partnerships and potentially acquisition. So we\u2019re open to both. We\u2019re making a lot of progress there. And we\u2019ll provide more detail a bit later.\nColin Bristow: Good. Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Erica, I gather we have a couple more questions lined up. So we\u2019ll take those remaining questions with apologies to the audience that we\u2019re going over the allotted hour. But let\u2019s get to next question.\nOperator: Your next question is from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Thanks, guys. So you addressed a little bit of the moderate to severe pressure on the competition for Otezla. Could you again address a little bit more, now that we have more granular data from Tapinarof and others on the topicals? Do you think the topicals being cheaper might push out some of the uptake in the biologics for Otezla? And then, if you want to answer that one, just throwing out here, you\u2019re one of the first to do RTOR application for oncology with all the FDA controversy development. Can you just tell us like, how that\u2019s going? Is it proceeding as normal? We\u2019re all wondering how that application process will go, because that could be the faster way to market for a lot of new drugs. Thanks.\nRobert Bradway: Let\u2019s try to get them both quickly.\nMurdo Gordon: All right, Robyn. Look, we think that there\u2019s obviously a role for topicals to play for patients with low body surface area involvement in their disease. When it starts to become a broader surface area or in awkward places on the patient\u2019s body, then they\u2019re looking for a systemic agent, and they\u2019re looking for a safe and effective one. And that\u2019s really where we think the mild to moderate opportunity is for Otezla. And we\u2019re not even considering the millions of patients out there with mild to moderate. We\u2019re looking at about 40% to 50% addressable patient population. So we\u2019re giving at least half the market as a topical market, assuming the other half would be addressable with an oral. Dave?\nDavid Reese: Yeah. And, in terms of RTOR or Real-Time Oncology Review, what that does is permit submission of tranches of data, as you move through the submission process, as opposed to waiting and submitting either a complete file all at once or very large chunks of a file. We\u2019ve had very productive interactions with the FDA. And in our view, the RTOR process has worked quite nicely here. In the longer term, quite frankly, I think this is the way of the future not only in oncology, but across therapeutic areas for more real-time submission of data, probably from the inception of development programs.\nRobert Bradway: Erica, let\u2019s take 2 last questions, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kennen MacKay with RBC Capital Markets.\nKennen MacKay: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. A question on tezepelumab. We recently heard from a KOL some thoughts that this actually could be as competitive as some of the other biologics in asthma in the high eosinophil group, not just competitive in the high unmet need [levy eosinophil] [ph] market. Just wondering when that data does come out, that full publication does come out, really what we should be looking for in these high eosinophil patients for signs of competitiveness there. Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. As we\u2019ve reported, as you saw, and we\u2019ll be providing some data updates, additional analyses on the NAVIGATOR Phase 3 trial at the American Thoracic Society meeting in a few weeks now. Across the board, we saw efficacy that we think is consistent with first line use. It\u2019s important to understand that there are many patients with severe uncontrolled asthma, who have disease that is seeking another treatment right now, meaning they are not controlled with currently available therapies. And so, regardless of eosinophil count, we think that the clinical profile of this molecule is quite attractive. And my view continues to be that this is just going to be a really important medicine in asthma for patients.\nArvind Sood: Erica, let\u2019s take one last question.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.\nCory Kasimov: Updated LUMAKRAS\u2019 ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, and do you see this as a potential future source of differentiation one way or the other in the KRAS field? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yeah, Cory, thanks. Quickly, so we are actually studying specifically LUMAKRAS in patients with brain metastases. I think the clinical data will be definitive here. And once we\u2019ve amassed a large enough dataset, we\u2019ll present that. But it\u2019s full speed ahead to answer that question.\nRobert Bradway: Okay. Well, thank you all for your patience and for dialing in to the call today. I remind you as always that Arvind and his team will be around for several hours still, if you had other questions that you didn\u2019t get answered. But we appreciate your support and look forward to being back with you in July. Thanks.\nArvind Sood: Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes Amgen\u2019s First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. I would like to take a few moments to reflect on the strong fundamentals of the business and further to reaffirm our full-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Let me first confirm our predictable consistent capital allocation hierarchy as seen in our Q1 activity. It always begins with investing in internal innovation. LUMAKRAS and tezepelumab, both internally discovered, and each granted Breakthrough Therapy designation, are excellent examples of this. We also patiently pursue external business development opportunities that clear our hurdle rate and then are consistent with our areas of therapeutic focus, in which we are confident of integrating into Amgen efficiently and effectively on a timely basis. We allocated $2 billion of our shareholders' capital to the Five Prime acquisition in the second quarter and have committed additional R&D funding to pursue other indications for the lead molecule bema. Our capital expenditures remain a high priority, including investments in our industry-leading protein manufacturing, our ESG initiatives including enabling carbon neutrality by 2027, and digitization imperatives. We continue to return capital to our shareholders. First, we paid dividends of $1.76 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from 2020. This year marks our 11th year of dividends with meaningful increases in each of those years. Second, we repurchased 3.7 million shares in the first quarter at cost of roughly $865 million. Finally, our capital allocation hierarchy always builds on our efficient capital structure, which results in an optimal weighted average cost of capital. Now, I will briefly walk through our first quarter financial results. Recall that in 2021, we are now comparing to our recast 2020 results that exclude the impact of fair value adjustments to equity investments that were historically included in non-GAAP OI&E. In Q1, revenues decreased 4%. Historically, first quarter sales have been the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year. As we entered 2021, we knew that COVID would likely introduce some variability. And as the quarter progressed and we saw a continuing cumulative effect of COVID cases on prescribing patterns, we anticipated that Q1 would be more negatively impacted, which led us to disclose in March that it would be moderately below 2020's percentage of the full year. First quarter sales benefited from 4% volume growth. Looking back to Q1 in 2020, we recorded approximately $150 million of favorable changes to estimated sales deductions, creating a negative impact on year-over-year growth comparisons in Q1 2021. As we get underway with the second quarter, we expect there to be some continuing cumulative COVID impacts. While we expect to see improvements in the rate of recovery, that recovery will be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter increased 2% year-over-year. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 16% to 17%. Effective Q2 2021, cost of sales will increase as a percent of product sales in connection with our first shipments of antibodies to Lilly. Recall that revenue from shipments of these antibodies will be recorded in other revenues. For the full year, we expect R&D spend will increase as our innovative pipeline continues to progress, which now includes bema from the Five Prime acquisition as well as the Rodeo acquisition. And for the full year, we expect SG&A spend to decline. We continue our focus on digitization imperatives. Non-GAAP OI&E was a net $375 million expense in Q1. This is unfavorable by $79 million on a year-over-year basis, due to the recording of our portion of Beijing's loss this quarter. Recall the recognition of Beijing's results did not start until Q2 2020. The effects year-over-year of the adjustments in sales deductions, combined with the recognition of the Beijing results, totaled about $0.29 in decreased EPS on a comparison basis for Q1 2021 and explain a large portion of the 12% decline in EPS year-over-year. Now, turning to the outlook for the business for 2021, based on underlying market dynamics and our investment plan, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance with a revenue range of $25.8 billion to $26.6 billion, and a non-GAAP EPS range of $16 to $17. Important additional points to consider, as you model the remainder of 2021. We are providing more specific quarter-over-quarter guidance, given the unprecedented continuing cumulative COVID impact on the operating environment. But we do not expect to provide such guidance on an ongoing basis. We see the recovery from COVID-19 more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. And for the second quarter, we expect total revenues to grow between 7% and 10% sequentially from the first quarter. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to increase by about 7% over last year, with an operating margin of roughly 50%, which includes operating expenses for Five Prime and Rodeo. Historically, the Q2 quarter-over-quarter operating expense increase is about 10%. But in the second quarter of this year, we expect quarter-over-quarter operating expenses to increase in the mid-teens percentage range, reflecting the impact of our Lilly COVID-19 antibody manufacturing agreement. Investments for growth including the Five Prime acquisition, as well as increasing activity levels, including launch preparation. For the full year, we continue to anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be a net expense in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Our capital expenditures guidance remains unchanged at $900 million. And based on our confidence in the long range outlook of the business, we are raising the upper end of our share repurchase range to $5 billion for 2021 versus prior guidance of $4 billion. So our range for share repurchases in 2021 is now $3 billion to $5 billion. Additionally, we're updating our non-GAAP tax rate guidance of 13.5% to 14.5% versus prior guidance of 13% to 14%. My confidence is strong in the long-term outlook for Amgen, given the strength of the business, and the strength of our outstanding and dedicated team of 23,000-plus colleagues that deliver everyday to patients, and also deliver long-term growth to our shareholders. This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Murdo. Murdo? I will. Terence, very good question there. And, look, I think it's premature to speculate on this. We expect the administration's proposal for the subject, I think is everybody does to \u2013 significant debate within Congress and other stakeholders. Rest assured, we're active in Washington to ensure that our position [and our tax system] [ph] should continue to be competitive, and should continue to really encourage innovation in the United States [as well heard and understood] [ph]. And we are very supportive, as you can imagine of incentives to encourage manufacturing in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. And, Terence, I would just let you know that our tax leader Jackie Crouse has much expertise in the area of Puerto Rico, not just around tax, but just overall into how the economy down there functions and so forth. So she's called upon regularly by the legislators for advice and counsel. Thanks again for the question."

            "name": "Robert Bradway",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. We had a busy start to 2021 and a first quarter that's something of a mirror image to what we experienced a year ago. Last year, if you recall, we came out of the gate with a very strong January and February, and then started to really feel the impact of the pandemic in March. This year, especially in the U.S. it was almost the reverse. We felt the impact of the pandemic in January and February, and we began to see a recovery in March, a trend that seems to be holding in April as well. Setting aside the pandemic, we executed effectively in the first quarter and this is reflected in the strong competitive performance of our brands globally. Our strong biosimilar is showing the rapid progress of our lead pipeline molecules and the addition of an attractive Phase-3-ready molecule in oncology. Altogether, we remain confident in our full year outlook. We're fortunate to have a diverse portfolio of newer products that continue to show strong volume growth. Repatha, for example, delivered 36% volume growth in the first quarter. It remains the clear leader of the PCSK9 market globally, and will soon reach the milestone of 1 million patients served. We're also the global leader in bone health with Prolia and of Evenity generating double-digit volume in the quarter. Our industry-leading portfolio of biosimilars is annualizing above the $2 billion mark. And I would remind you that we have 3 additional biosimilars in Phase 3 development and look forward to a flow of new launch opportunities for these and AMGEVITA over the next few years. As we've shared with you many times in the past, we're active in business development, looking to complement our internally developed innovation with compelling external opportunities. And our recent acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics is a good example of that. As you know, one of the molecules we acquired in that deal, bemarituzumab was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA as a first-line therapy for a subset of patients with gastric cancer. More than 1 million new gastric cancer cases are diagnosed annually. And the disease is particularly prevalent in the Asia Pacific region, which we've said previously will account for approximately 25% of our growth over the next decade. Bemarituzumab is now our third late-stage clinical medicine to be granted Breakthrough Therapy status, joining sotorasib, for which the trade-name LUMAKRAS has now been provisionally approved for use in the U.S. and tezepelumab also has earned that Breakthrough Therapy distinction. With a strong balance sheet, healthy cash flows and our proven ability to integrate, we'll continue to look for external opportunities that strengthen us in our stated areas of focus. Before I turn things over to our CFO, Peter Griffith, I want to thank my Amgen colleagues for their continued commitment to serving patients around the world and delivering results for our stakeholders. I look forward to our Q&A session a little later in our call. But for now, over to you, Peter. Okay, Erica, thank you. Let's turn now to Q&A. And perhaps you could remind our callers of the procedure for asking questions. Thanks. Murdo? On the tax front, Peter, why don't you share our thoughts? And, Jeff, on Washington, I'm not sure whether executive orders the concern these days, or whether it's something that's attached to reconciliation, if I had to guess I'd say that the greater risk of something being attached to reconciliation. But it's still not very clear how this administration and members of the Democratic Party in general, want to try to tackle the question of drug pricing this year. So we're continuing to stay very involved, as you'd expect, and we have the benefit, I think of being able to demonstrate just how important innovation is with the progress you see being made against the pandemic. And so, we'll continue to stay active and focus on the things that could be done to improve patient access to medicines. And, I think the other thing, Jeff is to continue to shine a light on the role of the middlemen and how much of the pharmaceutical dollars now wind up in the hands of the middlemen, which I think now, across the country is just an excess of 50%. I think it actually is at 51% now. So we'll continue to draw attention to that as well. Maybe I'll just start very quickly, Alethia. SHIP2, yeah, that's underway, and we're continuing to work on that combination more to come. Murdo? Hey, Erica, thanks, let's go to the next question. Yeah, thanks, Dane. In terms of potential frontline combinations, I think a number of them that are being examined in the master protocol, if we can enhance efficacy by multiple hits on the pathway could be feasible, for example, the MEK combination. The EGFR inhibitor combinations, and then as well, as you mentioned PD-1 whether that is in combination or sequentially, for example, to rely on a priming effect is a question that we're trying to answer. SHIP2, I would also consider an additional hit on the pathway and would also fall into that grouping. So I think, we'll be guided by emerging data, but all of those would be potential avenues into earlier lines of therapy, in addition also potentially avenues into other indications such as colorectal cancer in some of the other solid tumors, where G12C mutations occur.

So we're open to both. We're making a lot of progress there. And we'll provide more detail a bit later. Erica, I gather we have a couple more questions lined up. So we'll take those remaining questions with apologies to the audience that we're going over the allotted hour. But let's get to next question. Let's try to get them both quickly.

            "content": "Thanks, Peter. First quarter product sales declined 5% year-over-year, volumes grew 4% driven by double-digit growth for a number of products, including Prolia, Repatha, MVASI, and KANJINTI. Net selling price declined 7% and the year-over-year comparison was negatively affected by 2% due to a benefit in Q1 2020 from approximately $150 million of changes to estimated sales deductions that did not reoccur to the same magnitude in Q1 of 2021. In the first quarter, the cumulative effect of the COVID pandemic on missed patient visits and diagnoses impacted our business, January and February were clearly affected by post-holiday COVID spikes, and March showed demand improvement across most brands, which has continued into April. Despite the impact of the pandemic, our teams have found solutions to address the continuity of care, stabilizing our continuing patient volume. We also saw improvement in customer facing execution throughout the quarter across all communication channels, including face-to-face and virtual activities. We expect some COVID-19 related disruptions still in the second quarter, the steady recovery thereafter. I'll now review some product details beginning with our innovative portfolio. In bone health, Prolia grew 16% year-over-year, recording over $500 million of U.S. sales in the U.S. for the first time. As a majority of osteoporosis patients in the U.S. have been vaccinated and diagnosis rates are at approximately 90% to pre-COVID-19 levels. We're confident in Prolia's continued growth in 2021. EVENITY sales increased 7% year-over-year driven by strong volume growth, given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of postmenopausal women, if entity provides an excellent therapy to build bone first, which should then be followed by treatment with Prolia. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year to a quarterly sales record of $286 million driven by 36% volume growth and we maintain global leadership in the PCSK9 class. Sales outside the U.S. grew by 40% driven by strong patient demand. In the U.S., we continue to see strength in new patient starts with new-to-brand prescriptions growing 54% quarter-over-quarter helped by favorable pharmacy benefit manager formulary changes. U.S. volume growth demonstrates that we've made good progress against our strategy to provide Repatha at an affordable price to patients, particularly those with Medicare Part D coverage. This acceleration in Medicare Part D growth has increased our exposure to the so called doughnut hole, which creates some negative impact on overall net price. We remain confident in our ability to grow Repatha globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high risk cardiovascular patients. Next to Aimovig, which remains the market leader in the highly competitive CGRP class; Aimovig volumes grew 20% year-over-year in the first quarter with a 45% average total prescription share and 38% average new-to-brand prescription share. Year-over-year net selling price declined primarily driven by increased rebates to maintain patient access. Unfortunately, millions of patients suffering from migraine are sub-optimally treated with older, less effective therapies. Given the head-to-head data, we've generated showing Aimovig superiority against topiramate, we're confident we can help many more patients suffering from chronic migraine. Turning to our inflammation portfolio, where Otezla has demonstrated a robust safety and efficacy profile with over 6 years of real world experience in market with more than 500,000 patients treated globally. Enbrel similarly has served millions of patients globally since 1998. Otezla sales were $476 million in the quarter. Volume growth was 9% driven primarily by 11% total prescription growth in the U.S. Otezla remains the market leading brands and systemic medication for psoriasis with an approximately 30% share of first-line treatment. However, new-to-brand prescription volume remained flat as COVID-19 continued to suppress the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis patients. Year-over-year growth was also negatively impacted given pandemic-related inventory stocking in Q1 of 2020. Otezla has more than 90% commercial payer coverage in the U.S. without requiring a biological step, and is an affordable, safe and efficacious option for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients. We see attractive growth opportunities for Otezla as the pandemic recovery progresses. In addition, geographic expansion and the anticipated approval later this year of the mild-to-moderate psoriasis indication will contribute to future Otezla growth. In 2021, year-over-year comparisons for Enbrel are adversely impacted by $255 million of favorable estimated sales deductions that were recorded in 2020, $115 million of which were in Q1 of 2020. In the quarter, Enbrel sales decreased 20% year-over-year with declines in both unit volume and net selling price. Moving forward, we expect volume and net price trends to continue. Parsabiv sales decreased 55% year-over-year driven by 65% volume decline. With Parsabiv's inclusion in the end-stage renal disease bundled in the U.S., we have seen dialysis clinics quickly implement new treatment protocols, switching patients from Parsabiv to generic cinacalcet. Switching to biosimilars, Q1 sales were $570 million driven by strong volume growth, which was partially offset by declines in net selling price. We continue to hold leading biosimilar shares in Europe from AMGEVITA and in the U.S. for MVASI and KANJINTI, where we saw average shares of 50% and 43%, respectively in Q1. For the remainder of the year, we expect biosimilar volume growth to be offset by declines in net selling price due to increased competition. Longer term growth for biosimilars will come from expansion of existing products to new markets and launches of additional biosimilar molecules, such as AMGEVITA in the U.S., and biosimilars for SOLIRIS, STELARA and EYLEA. In oncology, Neulasta Onpro remains the preferred long acting G-CSF with 54% share of volume in the quarter. In Q1, we surpassed 1 million patients who with the help of Onpro were able to receive their G-CSF treatment, while reducing the need to return to their doctor's office or other site of care for administration. Consistent with recent trends, Neulasta's U.S. average selling price declined 30% on a year-over-year basis, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2021 driven by intensifying competition. XGEVA sales decreased 3% year-over-year for the first quarter, as volume growth in Asia was offset by lower net selling price in that region. U.S. unit volumes declined year-over-year driven by demand impacts in January and February, with recovery beginning in March and into April. KYPROLIS sales decreased 10% year-over-year for the first quarter as the pandemic is suppressed the number of new patients starting treatment for multiple myeloma. Moving forward, we expect promotion to drive growth in second line and beyond as a result of our launch of the combination indication of KYPROLIS and DARZALEX plus dexamethasone or DKd. The combination of KYPROLIS with Sarclisa and dexamethasone, or Isa-Kd was also approved in the quarter. As Bob mentioned, our team is ready to launch sotorasib or LUMAKRAS upon approval, and we're excited to establish it as a foundational therapy for patients with advanced lung cancer. We've already launched our biomarker assist program, which removes access barriers to testing and helps appropriate patients with out of pocket costs. And we're also preparing for the launch of Tezepelumab with our partner AstraZeneca and are enthusiastic about the prospect of having a therapy that can help treat the more than 2.5 million people in the world living with severe uncontrolled asthma. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q1 execution given the pandemic-related disruption of new patient diagnoses and treatment. And we'll continue our focused execution during Q2, and are projecting recovery over the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn it to Dave. Yeah, thanks, Geoff, for the question. The first thing I would just reiterate is that we anticipated that the deucra data would indeed show what they did show. And we assumed that in the model that we put together for the transaction and we've assumed that for the balance of this year. What I would say is that we continue to believe that Otezla is really ideally positioned in the first line pre-biologic psoriasis market. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've been on the market for 6 years now. We have in-market cumulative patient experience with over 500,000 individuals globally. We have excellent commercial and payer coverage at over 90% of covered lives. And we continue to make really good progress holding a 30% share in the market with really outstanding customer-facing capabilities. The other thing that we, of course, look at is positioning in the market and how that holds up against not just deucra, but other competitors. And we think that, we really are the first kind of option pre-biologic post-topical. And dermatologists have become very comfortable using Otezla that way. Payer coverage is consistent with that position in the market. And with the pending mild to moderate indication data, which were presented at the same AAD meeting, which were quite compelling. We expect to be able to expand our utilization of Otezla in psoriasis population, in the milder patient type. So overall, we like our position in the market. The way I see it is we still have to see how the full detailed safety data look for the TYK2 product, given that it is part of the JAK family. And it took 6 years and over 200,000 patients for us to understand the Xeljanz safety profile. So I think there is a lot still to be understood here, but not necessarily the safety and efficacy of Otezla. Yeah, thank you, Matthew. We are pleased, obviously, with the quarter for Repatha. And, it's been a bit of a journey getting here and trying to ensure that patients have affordable access to Repatha, particularly in Medicare Part D, as you point out. I would say that we are anticipating with one exception, we are anticipating relatively stable net price for the remainder of the year. And the exception that I'm pointing out is that as we expand our penetration of Medicare Part D, we will have some drag on our net price as a function of patients entering and staying in the doughnut hole for a period of time. So that's the one downside of helping patients in Medicare Part D. There is still a coverage gap in that benefit. And, of course, given the durability of treatment and the chronic nature of Repatha, they can be in that coverage gap for quite a bit. So we do have more exposure to the doughnut hole over time. But as you could tell from the first quarter, we were more than able to offset that small drag on. net price. And we anticipate that we'll continue to penetrate that patient population, given the very strong payer coverage we have there with \u2013 between commercial and Medicare, we've got over 80% covered lives for this important product. And there are still millions of patients out there who are sub-optimally treated for their hyperlipidemia given that they're at very high risk of cardiovascular events. So \u2013 and globally, we were seeing some really strong performance in Europe and the Americas. China is doing quite well, despite not having an RDL listing. And we continue to make inroads in Japan where we are the only PCSK9 on the market. Thanks, Mohit. The contracts aren't necessarily on the schedule. We have some large networks, where we negotiate annually, but we have a lot of smaller what we call value-based accounts, where we contract on a much more non-calendarized basis, so they're happening throughout the course of the year. And is your question with respect to reversal \u2013 are you asking me about price trends, volume trends? Can you clarify that question? Yeah, thank you for the clarification. Obviously, we're watching that clearly, the pandemic was stimulus for many oncologists to think more carefully about the G-CSF treatment that they were going to use in order to help minimize the amount of provider interaction that patients would incur. What we have been doing in the meantime, though, is reinforcing that you actually can improve outcomes by using long acting G-CSF. And using Onpro in particular, so we have a promotional effort that I think is helping strengthen the volume demand curve. The only thing I will continue to point out, though, is with competition comes some price erosion. And we have a new competitor entrant in that category in the long acting G-CSF category. So we anticipate more net price negative evolution through the remainder of the year. Sure. All right. Thanks, Geoff. Let me go first on the overall price evolution in the portfolio, we continue to believe that mid-single-digit net negative price for the portfolio for the years, the right number, that's what we continue to see what you know and what we experienced, probably more than some of our peer companies in the first quarter, given the nature of our portfolio is more net negative price evolution, because of patients renewing and their benefits, and going through benefit re-verification and hitting, they're kind of out of pocket recess. And so our co-pay assistance programs have more drag, we did activate more payer access at the end of last year into this. So we did have on some brands, some increased payer coverage at the cost of some net price negative evolution. But we do anticipate Q1 being the lowest compare, Q2 a little better, and then Q3 and Q4 being better thereafter. Yeah, Alethia, as I mentioned earlier in response to the question on the TYK2 data that were recently presented. As I've mentioned in the past, we have begun primary care promotion for Otezla in the currently labeled mild-to-moderate patient population, and have seen good response there in terms of uptake with 11% TRx year-on-year performance for the quarter. We're pretty pleased with that evolution, what we are seeing is a slowdown in the psoriasis patient population in the newly diagnosed patient population, in particular. We think this is a direct impact of COVID causing patients with psoriasis, not to see their dermatologist starting really at the beginning of the pandemic, but what's happened is the cumulative effect of this is starting that to impact the patients that have passed through some of the topical options. And we depend on bio-naive patients for our growth. So we are definitely pre-biologic option for dermatologists. So we are watching that closely, and we think that that could continue to create some softness in the pre-biologic psoriasis patient market opportunity into Q2 with recovery thereafter, because we are seeing much more patient volume in dermatology offices in March and into April. So we think that things are recovering. But it will take a while for that cumulative effect of new patient softness to work its way through the market. In terms of overall positioning in the market, we continue to think that our safety and efficacy profile is a very attractive option for patients and dermatologists as that first systemic agent pre-biologic, and I think really these days in rheumatology and dermatology, physicians are much more aware of the different categories of options that they have, and the different profiles of the different classes of drugs. And I think that with recent data in the JAK category, there'll be some speculation and some hesitancy to use a product like the TYK2, as a first bio-naive option for to treat patients. Yes, Ronny, we continue to look globally for product opportunities to license and promote in the world. And I think in oncology, in particular, there have been some interesting deals done lately. We obviously have a strong partnership already with a company based in China through Beijing. And we continue to enjoy that partnership and the co-development that we have. I would also say that given our global footprint, Amgen really is an excellent partner choice with our global capabilities in oncology and general medicine. So we're opening to business with Chinese companies, Japanese companies, global companies, absolutely. All right, Robyn. Look, we think that there's obviously a role for topicals to play for patients with low body surface area involvement in their disease. When it starts to become a broader surface area or in awkward places on the patient's body, then they're looking for a systemic agent, and they're looking for a safe and effective one. And that's really where we think the mild to moderate opportunity is for Otezla. And we're not even considering the millions of patients out there with mild to moderate. We're looking at about 40% to 50% addressable patient population. So we're giving at least half the market as a topical market, assuming the other half would be addressable with an oral. Dave?"

            "name": "David Reese",
            "content": "Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin with 2 new programs that are strong strategic fits within our portfolio. First, we are excited to welcome our new colleagues from Five Prime Therapeutics and begin work on bemarituzumab. The integration is going well and we have hit the ground running with Phase 3 planning activities. As Bob mentioned, we received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA and look forward to discussions with regulators on the development program, including Phase 3 in the near future. We'll also investigate bemarituzumab and other indications where FGFR2b may play a role, including squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And we'll have more to say on the entire development program as those plans are finalized. In inflammation, I would like to highlight our acquisition of Rodeo Therapeutics and their 15 prostaglandin dehydrogenase program, which was motivated by compelling preclinical data from Rodeo and valuable insights from deCODE. This is a nice illustration of our use of human genetic data to inform drug discovery and development. LUMAKRAS program continues to advance with several regulatory milestones in the first quarter, including global submissions for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and the priority review from FDA with a regulatory action date of August 16. We're having productive interactions with the FDA and multiple other regulatory agencies that will include Japan with today's anticipated submission, and we look forward to making LUMAKRAS available to patients as soon as possible. We're also pleased to receive Temporary Authorization for Use status in France. This designation is to promote fast access to innovative medicines before marketing authorization and conventional access, and we have received a large number of requests. In the clinical development program, we completed enrollment in the Phase 3 study versus docetaxel in advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Based on the overall efficacy and safety profile of LUMAKRAS and discussions with regulators, we reduce the sample size in this study, while maintaining appropriate statistical power to assess the progression free survival primary endpoint. The timelines of the study have not changed as the primary endpoint remains event driven. Although, we have demonstrated that the 960 milligram dose is safe and efficacious in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, we continue to explore different doses and regimens as is common in oncology drug development. As part of this effort, we are initiating a new cohort to determine whether a once-daily oral dose of 240 milligrams maintains the safety and efficacy profile of the 960 milligram dose in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Should a lower dose be as safe and efficacious as 960 milligrams, it may further enhance the patient experience with one-daily LUMAKRAS. We expect the results from this study in late 2022 or early 2023, and do not expect any impact on the timelines of our ongoing priority review. We also continue to make good progress in evaluating combination regimens. Efficacy cohorts are underway for our MEK inhibitor, EGFR antibody, and oral EGFR inhibitor combinations. And we expect to present updates on these regimens at medical meetings in the second half of the year. We continue to evaluate doses and regimens to find the optimal options for patients in our other combinations, including PD-1 and SHP2. Finally, we are initiating triplet cohorts in colorectal cancer of LUMAKRAS, with standard of care chemotherapy and either an anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF antibody. In our BiTE programs, we have initiated several new studies, including new indications for AMG 160, targeting PSMA in non-small cell lung cancer, and AMG 757, targeting DLL3, now also being investigated in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Details on these and other development programs, including small molecules can be found in our press release. Turning to tezepelumab developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca. The Phase 3 NAVIGATOR data were well received by clinicians and additional analyses will be presented at the American Thoracic Society meeting in May. We remain on track to submit regulatory filings this quarter and believe the data support tezepelumab as a first line biologic therapy for a broad population of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We are also investigating other indications with Phase 2 studies in COPD and chronic spontaneous urticaria. And most recently, a Phase 3 study for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Finally, on Otezla, we submitted a supplemental new drug application to FDA based on the Phase 3 ADVANCE study in mild to moderate psoriasis. The positive results from ADVANCE were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology or AAD meeting a few days ago. In closing, I'd like to thank our staff for continuing to deliver for patients. Yeah, thanks, Mike, both great questions. I think our anticipation is that at meetings right into the start of the second half of the year, we'll start to see some of the cohort data that we outlined, MEK and then both EGFR antibody and small molecule inhibitor combinations. And you can probably see those come out sequentially over the second half of the year, as we accumulate data. I would say that the combination therapy programs are moving along quite rapidly. And as we mentioned, we've opened some new triplet combination. So I feel very good about where we are in the status of combination regimens. In terms of the dose comparison study, we've now got long-term data from both our Phase 1 trial, as well as the Phase 2 trial, updated target coverage information, pharmacokinetics, as well as of course, efficacy and safety data. And based on modeling, we wondered, could we achieve adequate target coverage at 250 and preserve potentially the same efficacy profile that we've seen at 960 milligrams? And so, that's just the question that we're going to ask. It's quite common to continue dose exploration in oncology molecules. And I would view this as par for the course. We are very pleased with the tolerability profile. And as you pointed out, at 960 milligrams we've had an outstanding experience. In fact, this is one of the best tolerated drugs that I've been involved with in 30 years in oncology drug development. And that's not really what a driver is here, but can we potentially get by with efficacy at a lower 240 milligram dose and enhance patient experience? Yeah, thanks, Jay. And for those who may not know off the top of their heads, what Olpasiran is, this was formerly AMG 890. It's small interfering RNA, designed to lower lipoprotein(a) levels in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, where elevated LP little a may be a driver. As we noted, we completed enrollment in what's a robust Phase 2 trial that actually completed enrollment ahead of schedule. And what we'll be looking for, as we unveil those data, Jay, are first of all, longer-term follow-up, meaning sufficient long-term suppression of Lp(a) levels and our targets would be in the range of the Phase 1 data that we presented last November, at the American Heart Association meeting, and then of course, additional safety data. And of course, we are exploring different dose levels, as is pretty much standard in a program like this. And so, this would be in part for dose selection for Phase 3 going forward. We are very actively engaged already in Phase 3 planning and what the design of that sort of trial may look like. Based on the data that we've seen to date, one of our goals may be relatively infrequent dosing, given the duration of effect that we observed in the Phase 1 trial. And that's one thing that we'll be taking a close look at, as well in Phase 2. Yeah, thanks, Yaron. We're continuing to look at a variety of approaches in combination with PD-1s, whether that's in combination or sequentially. I think it's fair to say a number of small molecules, EGFR inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors had challenges combining with PD-1s. And I think there's a fair amount of work out here. We are \u2013 we'll provide updates. I don't know if we'll have data that's robust enough to share in the second half of the year. That's possible. But I don't want to promise that, but certainly we'll provide guidance as those different regimens move along in sequential therapy, maybe actually a preferred approach here. Yeah. Thanks, Terence. I'll take the first part of that question. Yeah, the 240 milligram dose comparison study, doesn't have really anything to do with the combinations. Dosing as you're aware, in combination regimens in oncology, one, typically explores a range of doses, potentially of all of the members of that combination regimen, depending on what the backbone may be. But this is really a monotherapy exploration, and again, determined to see whether we can preserve efficacy at a lower dose at this lower 240 milligram dose. Yeah. Thanks, Umer. Good question. Yeah, the 240 milligram dose was chosen based on modeling that we've done that really takes account of all of the dose levels pharmacokinetic data, target coverage data, or accumulated preclinical data regarding efficacy at different target coverage levels. And, this was really chosen as a lower bound, where we thought we would potentially preserve or could preserve the efficacy that we're seeing at 960 milligrams. In regards to the Phase 3 trial, as you note, we change the powering to really have \u2013 we have good power on the progression free survival endpoint that was done in concert with regulators. We will be able to take a look at overall survival. The power will be somewhat reduced in terms of the overall survival endpoint, but \u2013 I think, we'll still have a pretty good sense of what the drug is producing in terms of overall survival. Part of the thinking here is well is to minimize exposure of patients to the docetaxel control arm. Yeah. And, in terms of RTOR or Real-Time Oncology Review, what that does is permit submission of tranches of data, as you move through the submission process, as opposed to waiting and submitting either a complete file all at once or very large chunks of a file. We've had very productive interactions with the FDA. And in our view, the RTOR process has worked quite nicely here. In the longer term, quite frankly, I think this is the way of the future not only in oncology, but across therapeutic areas for more real-time submission of data, probably from the inception of development programs. Yeah, Cory, thanks. Quickly, so we are actually studying specifically LUMAKRAS in patients with brain metastases. I think the clinical data will be definitive here. And once we've amassed a large enough dataset, we'll present that. But it's full speed ahead to answer that question."

        "content": "Operator: My name is Jason and I will be the conference facilitator today for Amgen's Fourth Quarter Full Year 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\nArvind Sood: Okay. Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our call to discuss the results for Q4 and full year 2022. 2022 was once again a year exemplified by great execution despite some of the macro challenges. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will make some opening comments, followed by prepared comments from other members of our senior leadership team. You should have received a link to our slides that we have posted. Through the course of our discussion, we will make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and just a reminder that actual results can vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Arvind and hello, everyone and thank you for joining our call. So beginning the year feeling confident about the long-term growth outlook for our business and let me offer 5 reasons why. First, we have a number of innovative volume-driven products that still have plenty of room to run and we saw that in 2022. Repatha, Prolia and EVENITY each generated double-digit sales and volume growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We expect continued growth from these products in 2023 and beyond with Repatha, in particular, helped by important new data from the FOURIER open-label extension study and new prescribing guidelines. OTEZLA delivered 7% volume growth in both the fourth quarter and the full year, benefiting from a label expansion that gives us the opportunity to reach millions of new patients in the U.S. with mild to moderate psoriasis. LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE collectively contributed more than $450 million in full year sales and we're pursuing additional indications for both products. We're especially pleased to see TEZSPIRE being utilized by patients across all types of severe asthma. Murdo will share more about the performance of our in-line products in a moment. Second, we moved 6 first-in-class molecules into Phase III or potentially registration-enabling trials in 2022, including Olpasiran for LP(a), rocatinlimab for atopic dermatitis, TEZSPIRE in eosinophilic esophagitis and of course, bemarituzimab, tarlatimab in BLINCYTO in cancer. We've also begun enrolling patients in a Phase II trial for AMG 133. Based on early data, this molecule, with its unique mechanism of action, looks like it may have an attractive profile for the treatment of obesity. And more on our pipeline from Dave Reese in a moment. Third, we have an industry-leading biosimilars business that will contribute to our growth over time. In 2022, we delivered positive Phase III data for our biosimilar candidates to EYLEA, SOLIRIS and STELARA, positioning us to be in the first wave of these launches which we know is critical to success. We're also less than 24 hours into the launch of AMGEVITA in the U.S. and AMGEVITA is the leading biosimilar to HUMIRA internationally. And with a 5-month lead over the next entrant, we're well positioned for success in the U.S. All told, we have 6 more biosimilar launches planned in the U.S. and markets around the world between now and the end of the decade, making this another source of long-term growth for us. Fourth, we've often said that we would look to licensing and acquisitions in our stated areas of strategic interest. And that's what we've done, building on our decades of experience in inflammation with 2 significant transactions that will strengthen our presence in this space. Through the acquisition of ChemoCentryx, we added TAVNEOS, a first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis and we're off to a strong start there. Our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will add several additional first-in-class early in life cycle biologic medicines, including TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA that will add to our growth profile through 2030 and beyond. We're working our way through the regulatory review processes for that deal and are confident that the deal poses no anticompetitive matters. And we have received a second request from the U.S. FTC and we'll work with them to answer their questions while remaining optimistic that we can complete the deal in the first half of the year. Finally, we've stayed true to our capital allocation priorities, investing in our business to drive long-term growth while also returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and a growing dividend. You'll hear more from Peter on this shortly. And everything we achieved last year and everything we will achieve going forward is due to the hard work and commitment of our people. They're passionate about our mission to serve patients. They're clear on how their work contributes to our success and they're ready to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges that await us. I'm grateful to all of them. I look forward to your questions a little later on but now let me turn the call over to Murdo.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Bob. 2022 was another year of strong execution of our mission to bring [indiscernible] products to the millions of patients in the world who suffer from gravest illness. The evolution of our portfolio continue by record sales for 16 brands. We saw strong volume gains across our general medicine and hematology-oncology growth brands. Our inflammation therapeutic area expanded with the launch of TEZSPIRE and the acquisition of TAVNEOS, 2 first-in-class medicines that treat serious disease. In addition, our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will add several important medicines to our portfolio. In total, volume growth for 2022 was 9% with 7% growth in the U.S. and 14% growth ex U.S. as we continue to deliver on our international growth strategy. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, full year global product sales grew 4% as our volume increases were offset by a 5% decline in net selling price. Including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact, product sales increased 2% year-over-year. In the quarter, we also saw strong volume growth with a 10% increase year-on-year. Starting with our general medicine business which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig, overall revenue for these 4 products grew 21% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year, driven by 19% and 21% volume growth, respectively. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 14% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven primarily by 11% volume growth. EVENITY which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $225 million for the quarter, driven by strong volume growth across markets. Repatha sales increased 22% year-over-year for the fourth quarter with volume growth of 31%, partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., we generated volume growth of 32% for the fourth quarter, aided by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. We saw declining net selling prices in the U.S. as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect less year-over-year U.S. price erosion than we saw in 2022. Outside the U.S., fourth quarter sales of Repatha grew 36% year-over-year, driven by 31% volume growth. Globally, Repatha has treated over 1.5 million patients since launch. Repatha's strong prescribing history in cardiology and expanding use in the primary care setting position us well to bring Repatha to more patients globally. With the FOURIER long-term follow-up data, in addition to evolving and more aggressive treatment guidelines, there's a clear rationale that lowering LDL cholesterol as much and as early as possible with Repatha will reduce cardiovascular risk for patients around the world. Transitioning to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla sales decreased 2% year-over-year for the quarter and increased 2% for the full year. We saw 7% volume growth in both periods. This was offset by lower net selling price, stemming from enhancements to our co-pay and patient assistance programs to support new patients starting treatment as well as additional rebates to improve the quality of coverage. During the fourth quarter, our U.S. Otezla business was impacted by new patient demand from 3 drug programs by newly launched topical and systemic competition. We expect that impact to continue in Q1 of 2023. We also expect to see the typical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due primarily to the effect of insurance reverifications, co-pays and deductibles for patients. The combined effect could lead to first quarter Otezla sales being similar to or below those from Q1 of 2022. Longer term, we continue to see strong growth potential for Otezla, given its established safety profile, strong payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and ease of administration. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the 4 million U.S. patients with mild to moderate psoriasis, 1.5 million of whom have psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical and can benefit from a first-line systemic treatment like Otezla. ENBREL sales decreased 1% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by declines in volume and net selling price, partially offset by higher year-end inventory levels. ENBREL remains an important product for patients due to its long track record of efficacy and safety. TEZSPIRE continues its strong launch with $79 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $170 million for the full year. Allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed TEZSPIRE across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation of TEZSPIRE in both biologic-naive and previously treated patients. Physicians acknowledge TEZSPIRE unique differentiated profile and has broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations. We're now preparing for the anticipated U.S. approval of the prefilled pen in the first quarter which will offer patients the convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home. Sales of TAVNEOS were $21 million in the fourth quarter. Our integration of ChemoCentryx is proceeding smoothly, confirming our belief that Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence will allow us to bring TAVNEOS to more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. We're also excited about our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. Our combined portfolio which will include [indiscernible] will address serious inflammatory diseases and improve the lives of many patients. Amgen's commercial capabilities and global presence in approximately 100 markets [ph] will allow our combined team to deliver important therapies that will make a meaningful difference for more patients globally. Today, we announced the launch of AMGEVITA, the first U.S. biosimilar to HUMIRA, a medicine used by more than 1 million patients living with serious inflammatory diseases. With our track record of developing and manufacturing biologics and decades of experience in inflammation, Amgen is uniquely equipped to supply patients with this biosimilar medicine. AMGEVITA is the first significant U.S. biosimilar in the pharmacy benefit space and we expect gradual uptake in the coming months as this market evolves. Moving to our hematology and oncology business which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. These 6 innovative products grew 14% year-over-year with 17% volume growth for the quarter. Full year sales grew 13%, driven by volume gains. KYPROLIS sales grew 14% in the fourth quarter. Nplate sales in the fourth quarter included $207 million related to a onetime order from the U.S. government. Given the strong performance of our hem/onc portfolio in 2022 and the recent positive data on both BLINCYTO and Vectibix, I look forward to the future growth potential of this portfolio. LUMAKRAS reported $71 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $285 million for the full year. Quarter-over-quarter sales declined 5% with 12% volume growth, more than offset by a lower net selling price driven by a $12 million unfavorable price adjustment resulting from a reimbursement approval decision in France and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 45 countries. We've launched LUMAKRAS in 30 markets and are rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. As we've noted before, the market for LUMAKRAS focused on the 7,000 U.S. and 20,000 ex U.S. patients in the second-line setting. Longer term, we expect LUMAKRAS growth to come from moving into earlier lines of therapy and expanding into additional tumor types. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 40% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 30% for the full year, driven by lower price. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines, driven by increased competition. The most recently published average selling price in the U.S. declined 38% year-over-year for MVASI and 51% for KANJINTI. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. And as we start the new year, I'm inspired by the hard work of the thousands of Amgen employees around the world who wake up every day to serve our patients. Our expanding international presence and diverse portfolio of products, further strengthened by the integration of ChemoCentryx and the announced acquisition of Horizon, position us well to serve many more patients globally. And with that, I'll turn it to Dave.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. For research and development, last year was one of high-quality execution and on-time delivery of results as we continued to progress our innovative pipeline. In general medicine, we strengthened our cardiovascular franchise and emerging portfolio of obesity assets, 2 areas of significant unmet need, affecting millions of patients globally. Repatha, of course, is the cornerstone of these efforts. And last November at AHA, we presented FOURIER open-label extension data. These data were recognized by the American College of Cardiology expert consensus decision pathway which indicated there appears to be no LDL cholesterol level below which benefit ceases. Additionally, LDL cholesterol recommendations were updated to reflect a reduction in target LDL levels in highest-risk patients from 70 to 55 milligrams per deciliter. This is a level that is not attainable for a large number of patients without PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Another molecule that we are excited about is Olpasiran. At AHA, we presented Phase II data where Olpasiran dosed 75 milligrams or higher every 12 weeks reduced Lp(a) concentrations by 95% to 100% in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with baseline Lp(a) levels of approximately 260 nanomolars per liter. Olpasiran appeared both safe and well tolerated in this study. We are encouraged by these data, particularly our dosing frequency, safety and tolerability profile and degree of Lp(a) reduction. We have initiated a Phase III outcome study and 6,000 subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and significantly elevated Lp(a) levels of at least 200 nanomolars per liter. Now turning to obesity. In December, we presented data from a Phase I study where AMG 133 appeared safe, well-tolerated and demonstrated a 14.5% reduction in body weight at day 85 following 3 monthly subcutaneous injections. Body weight reductions were observed up to 150 days after the final AMG 133 administration. Given these favorable attributes, we are now enrolling a 570-subject Phase II study to explore AMG 133 in patients with obesity with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The study will also investigate different dosing levels and regimens\u2026 [Technical Difficulty]\nPeter Griffith: \u2026applying 4%. Recall our Q4 2021 results included approximately $200 million of favorable impact to other income and expense resulting from a gain on our Beijing investment. Full year non-GAAP EPS of $17.69 grew 27% versus our re-GAAP [ph] 2021 result. Non-GAAP Q4 operating expenses were unchanged year-over-year while full year non-GAAP operating expenses declined 12%. The full year includes the impacts in 2021 of the $1.5 billion 5-prime IP [ph] R&D charge and the $400 million licensing payment that KKC [ph] for rocatinlimab. We advanced our pipeline and invested in product launch activities in 2022 while delivering a 51% non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product of sale. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 cost of sales as a percent of product sales decreased 1.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis, down to 16.3%. For the full year, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales decreased by 0.5 percentage points, down to 15.9%. Both the quarter and full year improvements were primarily due to fewer COVID-19 antibody shipments and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by changes in our product mix. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the fourth quarter decreased 2% year-over-year, primarily due to higher business development activity in 2021, including our upfront payments in connection with our Genera Biomedicines and Iraqis Therapeutics collaborations, along with lower marketed product support. This was partially offset by higher support for key assets in early- and late-stage programs. However, adjusted for 2021 BD activity, Q4 2022 R&D investment increased 7% year-over-year. And for the full year, non-GAAP R&D spend declined 8% based on the same drivers of the fourth quarter. However, adjusted for BD activity, full year 2022 R&D investment increased by 5%. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 2% year-over-year, driven by higher marketed product support, including investments in our priority products, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY and Repatha. For the full year, SG&A expenses were unchanged year-over-year as increased investments for all priority brands were offset by productivity gains, continuous improvement and reallocation for mature brands. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were about $470 million in expense in the fourth quarter, a $250 million increase year-over-year, primarily driven by the previously mentioned gains in 2021 that we recognized from our investment in BeiGene. For the full year, non-GAAP other income and expenses were approximately $1.7 billion. So now turning to the outlook for the business for 2023. Our outlook is Amgen-only on a stand-alone basis without any adjustments for the announced Horizon acquisition. It's important to remember that currently -- that current publicly available consensus estimates are derived from a combination of estimates of Amgen as a stand-alone company, along with estimates from some analysts who have already added Horizon into their estimates. So our 2023 revenue guidance is $26.0 billion to $27.2 billion and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $17.40 to $18.60 per share. So now let me review several key points related to our guidance. For total revenue, we expect the year-over-year comparison will not include about $700 million related to several items from 2022 that we do not expect benefit from in 2023. We assume we will not generate COVID-19 antibody revenues in 2023. We also assume a lower amount of Nplate sales in 2023 compared to 2022. Recall, 2022 included a significant purchase of Nplate by the United States government in the second half of the year. Also several favorable changes to estimated sales deductions that occurred in 2022 and the sale of our generics business in Turkey which closed late in 2022. For product sales, we project volume growth at a portfolio level, driven by strong growth in our priority products, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Repatha, Prolia and TAVNEOS. Consistent with industry trends and our recent history, we expect mid-single-digit price declines in our portfolio in 2023. Turning to Neulasta and our oncology biosimilars. We expect the recent trends to continue through 2023. This will likely result in full year Neulasta sales less than $700 million. Further, we expect less than $750 million in combined product sales for our oncology biosimilars, KANJINTI and MVASI. And finally, we expect product sales of less than $300 million for EPOGEN as we transition through the expiry of our contract with DaVita. For the full year, we're guiding other revenues to a range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Note that we recognized about $300 million of revenue from our COVID antibody collaboration with Lilly in 2022 that we don't anticipate repeating in 2023. So we will continue to manage our operating expenses consistent with our historical cost discipline. So even with increasing 2023 sales volumes, declining net selling prices and inflationary pressures on costs, we still project full year non-GAAP operating expenses to be flat versus 2022 as we continue our focus on driving productivity and cost efficiencies across the enterprise. We project non-GAAP cost of sales to be in the range of 16% to 17% as a percentage of product sales. Recall that we mentioned during our Q3 earnings discussion that tax law changes enacted by Puerto Rico in June 2022 replaced the Puerto Rico Excise Tax, the PRET, in favor of an income tax. This change will increase our income tax expense beginning in 2023 while reducing our cost of sales by roughly an equivalent amount. Note, however, there will be a negative impact in 2023 of approximately $125 million related to the amount of the PRET that is currently capitalized in inventory that will be charged to cost of goods sold in the first half of 2023, with most of the charge recognized in the first quarter without a corresponding tax benefit. We expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2023 to increase 3% to 4% year-over-year compared to our 2022 expenses as we advanced a number of the programs Dr. Reese referenced earlier. This is consistent with our first capital allocation priority to invest in the best innovation and our operating expense discipline provides us the capital to do just that. And for non-GAAP SG&A spend, we expect 2023 amounts as a percentage of product sales to slightly decrease year-over-year, driven by productivity improvements. These all lead to a projected non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales of roughly 50% on a full year basis. We expect non-GAAP other income and expense of approximately $1.4 billion. The expected year-over-year improvement is driven by a change in our accounting for our BeiGene investment we are making in 2023. Beginning in January 2023, we'll no longer record our share of BeiGene results in other income and expense under the equity method of accounting on our non-GAAP income statement. We'll now mark to market our investment with the impact recorded only on our GAAP income statement. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18% to 19%. This rate reflects the new Puerto Rico income tax which as I explained earlier, replaced the PRET beginning in 2023. We expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2023 and we expect that we will continue to meaningfully increase our dividend. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $925 million in 2023, consistent with our capital allocation priority to invest in our business, including in our new environmentally-friendly facilities in Ohio, North Carolina. And after we complete those facilities, we expect our capital expenditures to return to their historical levels. I'd also like to make some specific comments around the first quarter of 2023. I'm encouraged that our business is performing as expected through the first month of the year. However, consistent with our historical revenue patterns, we expect revenue in the first quarter of the year to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year and slightly below revenue in Q1 2022. At a portfolio level, we expect product sales to be unchanged from Q1 2022 and other revenues to be lower on a year-over-year basis due to the reasons set out above, including about $225 million related to COVID antibody sales in the first quarter of 2022. We anticipate about $80 million of foreign exchange headwinds in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022. The total of all these items creates greater than $400 million of headwinds versus the first quarter 2022. So these revenue patterns, along with the timing of expenses, are expected to translate into our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin being below 50% as a percentage of product sales, although we continue to expect operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50% for all of 2023. Recall, this is all Amgen stand-alone. We will continue to focus on our legacy of execution excellence. In summary, despite macroeconomic headwinds, we delivered another strong year of financial results in 2022, keeping us on track with our long-term commitments to deliver through 2030 and beyond. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen is strong and we look forward to completing the announced acquisition of Horizon during the first half of 2023 which will only strengthen our growth prospects. We would expect to provide updated guidance as appropriate at some point after the transaction closes. This concludes the financial update. My thanks to our 25,000-plus colleagues at Amgen around the world for their commitment to serving patients and their tireless efforts in 2022. I'll now turn it back over to Bob for our Q&A.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Well, thank you, Peter and Dave, for soldiering on despite the technical difficulties. And again, apologies to all of you who've dialed in to join us on the call and who found some disruption in the proceedings here. A number of you have e-mailed your questions to Arvind. What I'd like to suggest is that any of you who have questions, directly e-mail them now to Arvind and Arvind will read them and we'll try to answer them here in the room. And let me just assure all of you that we will rearrange our schedule and be available to answer questions if we don't get to it on this conference call, be available to Arvind and his team to answer questions you may have after we wrap up. So with that, let me turn to Arvind and we'll tackle the questions that you've already submitted.\nArvind Sood: Yes. Thanks, Bob. And apologies to everybody for the technical difficulties that we have had. And as Bob said, just please e-mail your questions to me directly. So the first question that we have is from Yaron Werber of Cowen and he submitted 2 questions. His first question is that Amgen will move to fair value from equity method of accounting for BeiGene. As you also now own less than 19.9% equity in BeiGene, will Amgen stop consolidating BeiGene's losses and profits from now on? And then the second question is, can you discuss when you plan to file the high concentration of AMGEVITA once you get the Phase III interchangeable data in the first half of 2023?\nBob Bradway: Okay. We do that in 2 pieces. Pete, why don't you hit the accounting question?\nPeter Griffith: Yes, quick question -- quick answer. Thank you, Yaron, for the question. On BeiGene equity method of accounting, as I said in my remarks, we will record, in our GAAP income statement, the mark-to-market but that won't be recorded in our non-GAAP income statement. So the answer is we will not include any earnings from -- or losses as our share of BeiGene going forward in our non-GAAP income statement.\nBob Bradway: Okay. And then on AMGEVITA, why don't we do a 2-parter there? Dave Reese and then Murdo, you may want to add some thoughts.\nDavid Reese: Yes. In terms of the filing time lines, once we have the data in hand, we'll be then giving guidance as to when we expect filing and potential approval of that after the appropriate regulatory interactions. It's important, I think, as Bob were put this in context, let me ask Murdo to comment here.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Dave. We have had some inbound questions on this, as you can imagine, during the day, given that we are launching. So far, launch is progressing well. We have product making its way into the channel and we're already receiving inbound interest in AMGEVITA from payers, prescribers and patients. One thing that's important to remember is the current product that we have in the market is a lower concentration, original concentration AMGEVITA or adalimumab but it is citrate-free, meaning that the patient experience here is still 1 where we minimize the injection site pain by having a citrate-free formulation. And patient experience here has been positive in our clinical trials and we anticipate that not having a high concentration will not be a barrier in the market. These are very low volumes that are injected through an auto-injectable pen. And we've seen very, very good reliability of patients being able to administer. In addition, of course, we provide nurse support for patients. And then while it wasn't asked, I think it's also important to note that we are providing financial assistance, support and reimbursement support for both prescribers and patients as we launch the product. So really a full suite of services and support that you would expect for a branded launch being applied to the launch of the first biosimilar, adalimumab, to launch in the U.S., that is AMGEVITA.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Murdo and Dave. Let's go to the next question, Arvind.\nArvind Sood: So the next question is from Geoff Meacham [ph] from BofA Merrill Lynch. And his question is, he said, I know you have AMGEVITA but are you expecting an indirect impact in the second half of '23 or the first half of '24 from all the HUMIRA biosimilars and STELARA, on Otezla and ENBREL mainly? And he is interested in the volume and price impact.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Murdo, you want to share your thoughts on that?\nMurdo Gordon: It's hard for me, obviously, to comment on what competitors may do as other biosimilars of adalimumab enter the market beyond July. But what we have seen coming into 2023 is a good cycle of reimbursement negotiations and we've been able to secure a very broad coverage for both ENBREL and Otezla. We expect that insurance coverage to continue throughout the course of 2023. And as is usual, we had small concessions on net price to secure that broad reimbursement but nothing unusual compared to prior years.\nArvind Sood: The next question is from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. And he has 2 questions. The first 1 is on Otezla. And Chris says, I know there are a lot of puts and takes on this market and I know you guys have highlighted a tailwind of mild-to-moderate psoriasis patients coming into therapy. But Otezla is kind of unique in that there is a sizable discontinuation rate. Just with that, if you're probably not going away, talk about why we shouldn't be more concerned about [indiscernible] and maybe just as importantly, the next-generation molecules that are coming behind it. Especially noticing that a decline Q-over-Q both in the U.S. and rest of the world, even with a 9% inventory build, any color on how you grow through this coming competition would be very helpful. And then he has a question on AMGEVITA.\nMurdo Gordon: Okay. So first on Otezla, I would start with the fact that we are the only systemic product indicated for a broad range of psoriasis patients without regard to the severity and really makes us the ideal first-line first systemic post-topical choice of therapy. And that is the positioning of the brand. The size of that market is very large. There's 4 million patients with a mild to moderate form of psoriasis. About 1.5 million of those patients would be regarded as not doing as well as they could on topical treatment by potential switching to a systemic like Otezla. As I mentioned just a few moments ago, Otezla also enjoys very broad frontline access, that is it doesn't require that you step through another systemic therapy. And it also means that prescribers can make it the first choice. And these are busy dermatologists. They want something that's easy. They don't want a lot of prior paperwork. And they want to be able to provide an ability for patients to start quickly on their therapy. Only Otezla offers that in the psoriasis market. I think what we're seeing right now is an effect of a number of free goods programs that were launched at the end of last year and continue into this quarter. When physicians have free goods programs or sometimes referred to as bridging programs, usually used at the beginning of a product launch when there hasn't been an opportunity to secure access with pharmacy benefit managers, physicians will sometimes use those to try novel therapies coming into the market. However, as those novel therapies go through the negotiation process with PBMs and payers, oftentimes, it becomes more difficult to try those novel therapies because of the nature of the access that they result with. And I think that's really where the sustained advantage of Otezla in that first-line systemic post-topical prebiologic patient population really allows us a long-term growth opportunity. And we continue to feel confident in the long-term growth of this brand. And we have a very strong commercial presence in a number of markets around the world and we continue to feel good from what we're hearing from our prescribing base of dermatologists. I will say that the short-term impact of these free good programs, we're watching it very closely and we're making sure that we continue to be competitive in the marketplace.\nArvind Sood: Okay. Chris, the second question is the same as the question that we have from Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. And she says on AMGEVITA, could you offer more details on how the dual pricing option will work and drive uptick? And how should we think about net pricing? What are your expectations for the market in midyear once more biosimilars enter?\nMurdo Gordon: Well, maybe I can answer the second part first. We don't comment on product-specific pricing and so I really can't answer the net price. I think it's fair to say that as additional entrants come into the market, net prices usually go down. We've seen that in our other biosimilars business but we would expect that to happen here. With respect to the 2 list price approach that we've employed here at this launch, this is really to address the complexity of the U.S. market. Pharmacy benefit managers have a business model that requires that they negotiate rebates with manufacturers and so they would prefer a high list price and negotiate rebates to net the price down and then pass those rebates through to their upstream employer clients. There are other stakeholders and customers in the health care system that prefer a net price-based model and don't care about the difference between list and net or gross price and net price. And so for those, we have the lower net price product available. So just a reminder, we have a high list price at 5% below HUMIRA and then we have a low list price at 55% below HUMIRA. We also intend to ensure that AMGEVITA is an affordable medicine for patients by providing co-pay assistance as well as helping patients secure reimbursement through the insurer. We are also pleased to report that we enjoy broad access out of the gate on day 1 of launch with the 3 national pharmacy benefit managers, so broad parity coverage alongside HUMIRA.\nBob Bradway: Let me just -- I note that we're up to the half past the hour but we will continue to take questions for as long as necessary here to answer those questions and until there is a recording of this that will be available in the form of a transcript for those of you that have conflicts and can't stay beyond the set time. So Arvind, why don't you go to the next question?\nArvind Sood: Yes. The next question is from Colin Bristow for UBS. And here's a question on the obesity pipeline. What update should we expect to get this year? Will we see data from the remaining 3 cohorts from the Phase I study? And then on AMG 786, when should we expect updates, more disclosure on this asset and program?\nDavid Reese: Yes. In terms of the obesity pipeline, AMG 133, the 2 additional cohorts you're referring to, I don't know that we'll see data over the course of this year on that. If that changes, of course, I'll provide guidance. AMG 786 is a small molecule with a different mechanism of action, as indicated to GLP-1 or Gipper receptor agonist or antagonist. So that's going through dose escalation over the course of the year. I'll provide guidance in terms of when we may see data from that program. And of course, at the time of data availability, we'll talk about the target as well.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thanks, David. Arvind, let's go to the next question.\nArvind Sood: So the next question is from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. And Evan wanted to know, he said with slowing LUMAKRAS sales, can you expand on how you may have revised your commercial strategy to better align with the commercial potential of the assets?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. I'm not sure we have a slowing overall volume growth. I think what we saw and I mentioned this, it might not have come through clearly on the audio but in the quarter, we did see a price effect based on reaching reimbursement decision finalization in France. And so we had a $12 million charge in the quarter against LUMAKRAS. It grew 7% volume in the quarter. But I think we anticipated the opportunity for LUMAKRAS in second-line being limited to the incident population. And we are commercially and medically sized appropriately for that opportunity. I think as we expand into earlier lines of therapy or other tumor types, we will continue to invest behind the product.\nArvind Sood: Okay. The next question is from Michael Yee. And Michael wants to know, he said, on 2023 guidance, can you clarify what the input is for revenue growth versus EPS growth range? Specifically, is there a positive impact from BeiGene accounting? And does the tax rate of 18% to 19% negatively impact EPS? Or is COGS offset, as explained last year, is 2023 OpEx growing more than revenue?\nPeter Griffith: Arvind, let me start by working our way from the tax question. So on the tax side of it, the 18% to 19% is increases by the amount. Although, as I have highlighted both last year and this year, we have a small carryover effect of about $125 million that's currently capitalized in cost of goods sold that will be released that -- excuse me, currently capitalized in inventory that will be released in the cost of goods sold, primarily during the first quarter without a corresponding tax benefit. So the answer is, going forward, after that $125 million works its way through cost of goods sold, it will be roughly equivalent to move from the Puerto Rico Excise Tax or the PRET which was recorded in cost of goods sold down to the actual income tax rate. The question on guidance. And I think the question was, what's included from BeiGene and what's not. As I said earlier to Yaron's question, what won't be included now is our share of either losses or gains in BeiGene's income. So we will include, on a mark-to-market basis in our GAAP income statement, the results of BeiGene and then the movements in the security but not in our non-GAAP income statement. We will no longer record our share of losses or their income.\nBob Bradway: Let me just say, Michael and to the prior question from Evan, if you need more detail on that to make sure you fully understand what we're saying in our response, just let us know, we'll get back to you. I think particularly, Evan, for your question, if you're not familiar with that mechanism that's common to us in France, happy just to provide more color for you. Again, Michael, I know a lot going on here and apologies for the disruption and don't know if you were able to follow all the slides earlier. So if you need more color, let us know, we'll call you back after the conference call. Okay. Go ahead, Arvind, to the next question.\nArvind Sood: Okay. Then we have a second question from Salveen asking, could you put the upcoming TEPEZZA Phase IV data and chronic context for us? What do you need to see? How would positive data expand the opportunity for the drug?\nBob Bradway: We are subject to the restrictions that we have on our ability to say anything on what's in the documents. You want to address that?\nDavid Reese: Yes. I mean, I think we're restricted, of course, by Irish takeover rules here. What we can say is that it's worth reminding everyone that the current label is broad and encompasses patients with thyroid eye disease, the -- due to autoimmune thyroiditis. This is primarily a study that will generate data in a population that we believe will help with reimbursement and with payers. And let me ask Murdo to comment on that. I would point out that mechanistically, there is no difference between chronic thyroid eye disease and the acute form of the disease. In fact, it's a semantic definition as to when the disease progresses to the chronic form but the underlying pathogenic mechanism of being driven in large part by IGF1R [ph] is intact. And therefore, based on prior data and mechanistically, we're optimistic about that study. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Look, I think the Horizon team is doing a very good job commercializing this product and continue to help many patients within the broad current indication, as Dave mentioned. And I think additional data here could be additive to the already very promising growth of the product.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thanks, Salveen, for your question. Let's go to the next one, Arvind.\nArvind Sood: The next 1 is from Christopher Schott of JPMorgan. And Christopher is saying, can you elaborate on our Otezla in 2023? Bristol suggesting that they are seeing some strong initial uptake in their bridge program and would be interested how much of this market expansion for orals versus something you're seeing in Otezla. And you mentioned an impact from competitor free drug impact over the next few quarters. Do you anticipate that will lessen as the year continues or an impact for much of the year?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. It's a similar question to 1 asked earlier but perhaps I can elaborate a little bit for Chris. It's fairly clear that dermatologists want to use the easiest product and safest and well-understood product when moving to a first systemic treatment post topically. Many of these topical patients are hesitant to try a systemic agent. And so I think this is where Otezla's profile studied extensively with over 700,000 patients globally having experienced this product, the safety and efficacy of Otezla is extremely well understood. As I mentioned earlier, the frontline access coverage that we've secured in the U.S. without a lot of prior authorization requirement, the convenience of that for dermatology practices is very clear and it makes it a really good first-line treatment, systemic treatment, especially for a patient with milder or more moderate disease. For moderate or severe disease, it is likely that you're going to need to use something like a biologic or a second-line agent. And we think that given that [indiscernible] has yet to go through the market access process and secure payer reimbursement, we're not really seeing how it's actually going to be used longer term in the marketplace. And I think sometimes, these free good programs can distort what the actual uptake curve will be for a product.\nArvind Sood: Then Murdo, there is a second question from Chris. He's asking, how are you thinking about ENBREL pricing dynamics over time, given the expected significant price declines in the HUMIRA market? I know you've talked about price continuing to erode but not accelerate. Can you remind us why we shouldn't expect a bigger step-down in price in 2023 or 2024 as the HUMIRA market price resets down significantly?\nMurdo Gordon: Well, as I mentioned before, we're primarily through our 2023 cycle and we've secured very good access. We've had to concede a bit of price, as I mentioned but not anything that looks precipitous compared to prior years. So we're pleased with that. ENBREL is an important product for many indications. We see that the safety and efficacy profile of ENBREL is well understood. I think physicians also want choice. And I think that's where PBMs are also open to having more than 1 TNF product on their formulary. And I think that's really what we've been able to secure and what we continue to think we'll be able to achieve in the future.\nBob Bradway: Let's go to the next question.\nArvind Sood: The next question is from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. And his question is, could you talk a little bit more about your HUMIRA biosimilar negotiations thus far? Seems like AbbVie has parity access with majority of them and the pricing is different for the first half versus the second half and there's more competition. Are your contracts similar? And how should we think about the cadence of launch as the year progresses?\nMurdo Gordon: Well, I can't comment on a competitor's contracts with PBMs and payers. What I can say is we've secured broad access for AMGEVITA at the 3 national PBMs. We continue to work with other customers to provide access for providers and patients alike. And we'll continue to compete effectively as we have done everywhere else in the world with this product. And outside of the U.S., we were able to establish a leadership position with AMGEVITA. And we think, given the services that we've provided and the commercial footprint we have, we're in a very good competitive position vis-\u00e0-vis other biosimilars.\nBob Bradway: I know a number of you have submitted questions, so we're continuing to work through the list. Anybody who hasn't yet shot Arvind an e-mail, we're going to go through those and we've got couple of handfuls still to go. So let's, Arvind, go to the next question.\nArvind Sood: Yes. The next 1 is a question by Greg Renza of RBC Capital Markets and Dave, this is for you. We were interested in hearing some color on the antibody drug conjugate strategy in light of the recent deals. How is the team approaching the space?\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks, Greg. What I view this is as another modality in our toolkit. We've been watching the antibody drug conjugate technology quite closely for the past several years. It's advanced, so what we feel is that we'll use ADCs on appropriate targets. I view it as an addition and an extension of our modalities. These collaborations bring together our experience on target identification and validation as well as, of course, antibody generation with some of the newer conjugation technology. So as that progresses, more to come but you should view this as additive to our armamentarium.\nArvind Sood: Okay. The next question is by Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. And his question is on AMGEVITA in the U.S. And he's asking, any commentary and your comfort with sell-side consensus for U.S. sales which seems to be around $600 million in 2023? And anything you can say about contract specifics such as whether there's price protection, if any of them go beyond 2023?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes, we don't give product-specific guidance. And this is a new event in the U.S. biosimilar market, given this is the first big pharmacy benefit product to go up. So we will continue to update all of you as the launch progresses. We have said we think this will be gradually slope on this launch and I'm going have to keep you apprised as we go forward.\nArvind Sood: Okay. The next 1 is by Dave Risinger of SVB Securities and he has 2 questions. The first 1 is for you, Dave. Please discuss key novel drug candidate readouts to watch in 2023. And the second 1 for you, Murdo. How do you expect formulary positioning for AMGEVITA to potentially change in January of 2024 after AMGEVITA is assigned an interchangeability designation?\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks, David. This is a year where certainly my focus, my team's focus will be on execution, a huge amount to carry forward in the pipeline. So things that I would keep an eye on, how well are we enrolling the Phase III Olpasiran trial? How well are we enrolling the AMG 133 Phase II trial? In the general medicine portfolio, in inflammation, how are the suite of rocatinlumab trials enrolling? How are we delivering on TEZSPIRE additional indications? And then finally, in oncology, things to keep an eye on are the tarlatumab program, not only the Phase II potentially registrational trial readout in the second half of the year but also initiation of a Phase III trial in second-line disease. These are some of the top line things that I'll be paying attention to. And then there are, of course, a host of others earlier in the pipeline and in discovery research.\nMurdo Gordon: And just on the AMGEVITA question, I would say that we have a commitment to continuing to make sure that the product attributes of our biosimilars provide payers, providers and patients with all of the benefits that they're looking for. And we're also trying to ensure that there is no reason to switch away from AMGEVITA in the long range. So we hope that interchangeability, the high concentration and the fact that we already have a citrate-free product on the market, along with the services we provide, along with the fact that this is an Amgen team of people who understand the inflammation indications of this product very well and they have relationships with the customers that prescribe HUMIRA, we feel really good about the durability of AMGEVITA long term beyond 2024.\nArvind Sood: Okay. The next question is from Umer Raffat from Evercore and he has 2 questions. The first 1 is for you, Dave, on OX40 and the monthly dosing in Phase III. He said and I don't see an arm investigating extended intervals quarterly or biannually. I'm just trying to tie the Phase III dosing interval versus the durable efficacy seen through 6 months post last dose. And the second question is for you, Peter, that the tax rate stepped up from 14% to 18% to 19%. Just wanted to get some additional color.\nDavid Reese: Yes. Regarding the dosing of rocatinlumab. As we've indicated before, we will explore different dosing paradigms here. And as that suite of Phase III trials fully launches, I think it will become clear what we're looking for there based on both the mechanism of action of the molecule as well as patient convenience. Peter?\nPeter Griffith: Umer, good question on tax. Again, it's just a change in what I would say the real estate on the P&L which is the PRET moves from the cost of sales line down to income tax expense in connection with the change in Puerto Rico for us from a PRET to the actual income tax in Puerto Rico which began here in 2023. So that's the nature of that change and that's where the 18% to 19% comes in from where we've been here historically.\nArvind Sood: Okay. The next question is from Jay Olson of Oppenheimer. And Jay is asking, can you talk about your plans for geographic diversification? It seems like ex U.S. revenues have become a small percentage of Amgen's total revenues over the past few quarters. And we were wondering what underlying dynamics drove that shift in geographical mix and if there are any future launches or other dynamics that might push the geographical mix back in favor of ex U.S. growth.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes, we are actually very pleased with the expansion internationally of the Amgen footprint being in over 100 markets. We continue to launch products and secure reimbursement around the world. I talked about LUMAKRAS. And most recently in China, we've been able to secure national reimbursement drug listing for both Prolia and Repatha. Our Japanese affiliate is growing well. In the recent history, I think what you're seeing is a function of just timing of launches coming a bit earlier in the U.S. and also some of our partnering products. I think longer term, what we've got is a very interesting portfolio of products that will continue to make their way around the world. The announced Horizon acquisition has a very large opportunity internationally. And we see our JPAC region is actually our fastest-growing potential opportunity longer term. So I wouldn't look at short-term movement from quarter-to-quarter. The long-term prevailing trend is that we will grow quickly outside the United States.\nArvind Sood: Okay. The next question is for you, Murdo, from Michael Schmidt of Guggenheim Partners. And he's asking, how confident are you in achieving low double-digit Otezla growth in 2023 and beyond, given the current pattern of essentially flat sales since 2020 of $2.2 billion?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes, I think we remain quite confident in our long-term growth of Otezla. We are in a period where there's a lot of new product entrants in the market competing for new patient starts. I think the unique positioning of the product, as I mentioned, allows us to source a very large pool of patients. And our coverage around the world and particularly in the U.S. from an insurance reimbursement perspective allows us to penetrate that market. So we feel very good about the continued prospects to grow Otezla.\nArvind Sood: Okay. The next question is from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. So she's asking, big picture, your guidance implies potentially flat growth. Given biosimilar pressures and pricing pressures, do you think 2023 is a trough year? And regarding the guidance range, can you give pushes and pulls on the biosimilar range?\nBob Bradway: So Robyn, maybe I'll start on the last piece and then Pete, you can reiterate what we said about '23. But as I said in my remarks, Robyn, we have 6 further similar launches planned between now and the end of the decade in the United States and other countries around the world. And it is the launch of those molecules through time which will enable us to continue to grow that franchise. So I would reiterate what I said earlier in my prepared comments. I think you've heard Murdo address as well the attractive opportunities that we think we'll have here, in particular, with AMGEVITA though we're in the first day of launch. And with respect to '23, Pete, I don't know whether you want to say anything in addition to what you already have about the outlook for the year.\nPeter Griffith: Thanks. I think we covered it earlier. I'd just note a couple of items that happened in 2022 that we didn't expect benefit from in '23, just to reiterate those. We don't expect any and assume any COVID-19 antibody revenues in '23. We're assuming a lower amount of Nplate sales in '23, Robyn, compared to '22. Recall, '22 had the significant purchase by the U.S. government in the second half of the year. We had several favorable changes to estimated sales deductions that occurred in '22 and we sold the generics business in Turkey which closed late in '22. So a couple of puts and takes around those. And so we look forward to a year in 2023 with strong growth in our priority products, since of, Repatha, Prolia, TAVNEOS. And also -- and that's in light of -- consistent with the industry trends we talked about in our recent history with mid-single-digit price declines in our portfolio but good volume growth. I think maybe to go back to the question Jay asked, too, we expect strong volume growth outside the United States in 2023. So we're looking forward to taking on '23 with a lot of aggressiveness.\nArvind Sood: Okay. The next question is from Matt Phipps of William Blair. And Matt's saying the oncology biosimilar 2023 guidance suggests a year-over-year decline of 38% versus a 30% year-over-year decline from '21 to '22. Is the rate of erosion in the oncology biosimilars expected to continue to get larger beyond 2023 or will this eventually hit something of a floor?\nMurdo Gordon: I wouldn't say we expect it to get larger but we will continue to see a decline in that business which is a function of the average selling price decline that we've seen thus far.\nArvind Sood: Yaron calling. He said I'm confused by the tax rate going up to 18% to 19% while COGS are 16% to 17%. Hence, I don't see any offsets in the COGS line. What am I missing?\nPeter Griffith: I think the answer to that is that our volume growth, the volume growth is quite large and that's really the offset, Yaron. That's a good question. And so we see that happening. We also -- in terms of the move of the PRET down there, recall, too, in cost of sales this year, we've got $125 million coming in off of the release out of inventory into cost of sales without any corresponding tax provision. And so the percent of sales versus a percent of pretax too, you've got to be thinking about that in terms of the income tax provision itself. So that's the puts and the takes on that. But when you strip it all back, it's really that move of the PRET down into the income tax expense that increases that effective rate to 18% to 19%.\nArvind Sood: Okay. The next question is from [indiscernible] from Credit Suisse. Thanks for the comments on Otezla and ENBREL. So can you add a bit more color into the dynamics in immunology? Are there any changes in the channel and mix of patients? Has there been any formulary disruptions?\nMurdo Gordon: Overall, our immunology business looks very good. I think we're very pleased with the TEZSPIRE launch. We continue to see broad phenotypes of patients regardless of biomarker status being treated. We are seeing de novo patients who haven't seen a biologic before in their treatment of their uncontrolled asthma. And we're also seeing patients being switched from other products within the class. And so we expect that area of autoimmune disease growing in terms of the biologic penetration of severe uncontrolled asthma. And we're well positioned to compete for that expanded treatment pattern. ENBREL continues to serve many patients. And the trends there are fairly predictable and fairly consistent. Otezla, as we've mentioned, is seeing some pressure from new free drug programs, both for our topicals as well as new entrant oral And then we also have just picked up TAVNEOS which we're really excited about, a product that treats a severe autoimmune disease, ANCA-associated vasculitis, very young product, very early in its life cycle and I think a lot of growth there to be had. And then, of course, last but certainly not least, on the branded side, the announced acquisition of Horizon. So I think the inflammation area, along with our own innovative pipeline and the pipeline of Horizon is a very good growth opportunity for us long term. And last but not least, here we are on the first day of launch of a novel biosimilar to the largest product in the U.S. and that's HUMIRA. So I think we've got a lot of opportunities for growth ahead.\nBob Bradway: I think we're down to our last question, Arvind, if you want to...\nArvind Sood: Yes. Let me read the last question, Bob and after that, you might have some concluding comments. So the last question is from Brian Skorney of Baird and Brian wants to know, do you expect this to be more of a longer-term tax rate, assuming no major changes to corporate tax rates in the U.S.?\nPeter Griffith: Yes, Brian, I think, as you know, we don't give long-term guidance on tax rates. And so we won't go beyond this year, so 18% to 19%. And go back to your own just to make sure we understand the change in the PRET. The PRET is a percentage of its cost of sales as opposed to the income tax rate which is pretax income. So that's a little bit of the difference to that Yaron asked about. So 18% to 19% this year is where we're at and that's where we'll -- that's what we'll give you for now.\nBob Bradway: All right. Well, thank you very much, again, for your patience. Apologies that we had a little bit of difficulty with our vendor's connection earlier on the call. So if you have any further questions, shoot them into Arvind. We'll be around here this afternoon, Peter Murdo, Dave and myself, to answer any further questions you might have. And we appreciate your joining the call and look forward to talking to you during the course of 2023. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks for using Webex. Visit our website at www.webex.com.",

            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "...applying 4%. Recall our Q4 2021 results included approximately $200 million of favorable impact to other income and expense resulting from a gain on our Beijing investment. Full year non-GAAP EPS of $17.69 grew 27% versus our re-GAAP [ph] 2021 result. Non-GAAP Q4 operating expenses were unchanged year-over-year while full year non-GAAP operating expenses declined 12%. The full year includes the impacts in 2021 of the $1.5 billion 5-prime IP [ph] R&D charge and the $400 million licensing payment that KKC [ph] for rocatinlimab. We advanced our pipeline and invested in product launch activities in 2022 while delivering a 51% non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product of sale. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 cost of sales as a percent of product sales decreased 1.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis, down to 16.3%. For the full year, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales decreased by 0.5 percentage points, down to 15.9%. Both the quarter and full year improvements were primarily due to fewer COVID-19 antibody shipments and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by changes in our product mix. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the fourth quarter decreased 2% year-over-year, primarily due to higher business development activity in 2021, including our upfront payments in connection with our Genera Biomedicines and Iraqis Therapeutics collaborations, along with lower marketed product support. This was partially offset by higher support for key assets in early- and late-stage programs. However, adjusted for 2021 BD activity, Q4 2022 R&D investment increased 7% year-over-year. And for the full year, non-GAAP R&D spend declined 8% based on the same drivers of the fourth quarter. However, adjusted for BD activity, full year 2022 R&D investment increased by 5%. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 2% year-over-year, driven by higher marketed product support, including investments in our priority products, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY and Repatha. For the full year, SG&A expenses were unchanged year-over-year as increased investments for all priority brands were offset by productivity gains, continuous improvement and reallocation for mature brands. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were about $470 million in expense in the fourth quarter, a $250 million increase year-over-year, primarily driven by the previously mentioned gains in 2021 that we recognized from our investment in BeiGene. For the full year, non-GAAP other income and expenses were approximately $1.7 billion. So now turning to the outlook for the business for 2023. Our outlook is Amgen-only on a stand-alone basis without any adjustments for the announced Horizon acquisition. It's important to remember that currently -- that current publicly available consensus estimates are derived from a combination of estimates of Amgen as a stand-alone company, along with estimates from some analysts who have already added Horizon into their estimates. So our 2023 revenue guidance is $26.0 billion to $27.2 billion and our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is $17.40 to $18.60 per share. So now let me review several key points related to our guidance. For total revenue, we expect the year-over-year comparison will not include about $700 million related to several items from 2022 that we do not expect benefit from in 2023. We assume we will not generate COVID-19 antibody revenues in 2023. We also assume a lower amount of Nplate sales in 2023 compared to 2022. Recall, 2022 included a significant purchase of Nplate by the United States government in the second half of the year. Also several favorable changes to estimated sales deductions that occurred in 2022 and the sale of our generics business in Turkey which closed late in 2022. For product sales, we project volume growth at a portfolio level, driven by strong growth in our priority products, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Repatha, Prolia and TAVNEOS. Consistent with industry trends and our recent history, we expect mid-single-digit price declines in our portfolio in 2023. Turning to Neulasta and our oncology biosimilars. We expect the recent trends to continue through 2023. This will likely result in full year Neulasta sales less than $700 million. Further, we expect less than $750 million in combined product sales for our oncology biosimilars, KANJINTI and MVASI. And finally, we expect product sales of less than $300 million for EPOGEN as we transition through the expiry of our contract with DaVita. For the full year, we're guiding other revenues to a range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Note that we recognized about $300 million of revenue from our COVID antibody collaboration with Lilly in 2022 that we don't anticipate repeating in 2023. So we will continue to manage our operating expenses consistent with our historical cost discipline. So even with increasing 2023 sales volumes, declining net selling prices and inflationary pressures on costs, we still project full year non-GAAP operating expenses to be flat versus 2022 as we continue our focus on driving productivity and cost efficiencies across the enterprise. We project non-GAAP cost of sales to be in the range of 16% to 17% as a percentage of product sales. Recall that we mentioned during our Q3 earnings discussion that tax law changes enacted by Puerto Rico in June 2022 replaced the Puerto Rico Excise Tax, the PRET, in favor of an income tax. This change will increase our income tax expense beginning in 2023 while reducing our cost of sales by roughly an equivalent amount. Note, however, there will be a negative impact in 2023 of approximately $125 million related to the amount of the PRET that is currently capitalized in inventory that will be charged to cost of goods sold in the first half of 2023, with most of the charge recognized in the first quarter without a corresponding tax benefit. We expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2023 to increase 3% to 4% year-over-year compared to our 2022 expenses as we advanced a number of the programs Dr. Reese referenced earlier. This is consistent with our first capital allocation priority to invest in the best innovation and our operating expense discipline provides us the capital to do just that. And for non-GAAP SG&A spend, we expect 2023 amounts as a percentage of product sales to slightly decrease year-over-year, driven by productivity improvements. These all lead to a projected non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales of roughly 50% on a full year basis. We expect non-GAAP other income and expense of approximately $1.4 billion. The expected year-over-year improvement is driven by a change in our accounting for our BeiGene investment we are making in 2023. Beginning in January 2023, we'll no longer record our share of BeiGene results in other income and expense under the equity method of accounting on our non-GAAP income statement. We'll now mark to market our investment with the impact recorded only on our GAAP income statement. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18% to 19%. This rate reflects the new Puerto Rico income tax which as I explained earlier, replaced the PRET beginning in 2023. We expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2023 and we expect that we will continue to meaningfully increase our dividend. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $925 million in 2023, consistent with our capital allocation priority to invest in our business, including in our new environmentally-friendly facilities in Ohio, North Carolina. And after we complete those facilities, we expect our capital expenditures to return to their historical levels. I'd also like to make some specific comments around the first quarter of 2023. I'm encouraged that our business is performing as expected through the first month of the year. However, consistent with our historical revenue patterns, we expect revenue in the first quarter of the year to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year and slightly below revenue in Q1 2022. At a portfolio level, we expect product sales to be unchanged from Q1 2022 and other revenues to be lower on a year-over-year basis due to the reasons set out above, including about $225 million related to COVID antibody sales in the first quarter of 2022. We anticipate about $80 million of foreign exchange headwinds in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022. The total of all these items creates greater than $400 million of headwinds versus the first quarter 2022. So these revenue patterns, along with the timing of expenses, are expected to translate into our Q1 non-GAAP operating margin being below 50% as a percentage of product sales, although we continue to expect operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50% for all of 2023. Recall, this is all Amgen stand-alone. We will continue to focus on our legacy of execution excellence. In summary, despite macroeconomic headwinds, we delivered another strong year of financial results in 2022, keeping us on track with our long-term commitments to deliver through 2030 and beyond. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen is strong and we look forward to completing the announced acquisition of Horizon during the first half of 2023 which will only strengthen our growth prospects. We would expect to provide updated guidance as appropriate at some point after the transaction closes. This concludes the financial update. My thanks to our 25,000-plus colleagues at Amgen around the world for their commitment to serving patients and their tireless efforts in 2022. I'll now turn it back over to Bob for our Q&A. Yes, quick question -- quick answer. Thank you, Yaron, for the question. On BeiGene equity method of accounting, as I said in my remarks, we will record, in our GAAP income statement, the mark-to-market but that won't be recorded in our non-GAAP income statement. So the answer is we will not include any earnings from -- or losses as our share of BeiGene going forward in our non-GAAP income statement. Arvind, let me start by working our way from the tax question. So on the tax side of it, the 18% to 19% is increases by the amount. Although, as I have highlighted both last year and this year, we have a small carryover effect of about $125 million that's currently capitalized in cost of goods sold that will be released that -- excuse me, currently capitalized in inventory that will be released in the cost of goods sold, primarily during the first quarter without a corresponding tax benefit. So the answer is, going forward, after that $125 million works its way through cost of goods sold, it will be roughly equivalent to move from the Puerto Rico Excise Tax or the PRET which was recorded in cost of goods sold down to the actual income tax rate. The question on guidance. And I think the question was, what's included from BeiGene and what's not. As I said earlier to Yaron's question, what won't be included now is our share of either losses or gains in BeiGene's income. So we will include, on a mark-to-market basis in our GAAP income statement, the results of BeiGene and then the movements in the security but not in our non-GAAP income statement. We will no longer record our share of losses or their income. Umer, good question on tax. Again, it's just a change in what I would say the real estate on the P&L which is the PRET moves from the cost of sales line down to income tax expense in connection with the change in Puerto Rico for us from a PRET to the actual income tax in Puerto Rico which began here in 2023. So that's the nature of that change and that's where the 18% to 19% comes in from where we've been here historically. Thanks. I think we covered it earlier. I'd just note a couple of items that happened in 2022 that we didn't expect benefit from in '23, just to reiterate those. We don't expect any and assume any COVID-19 antibody revenues in '23. We're assuming a lower amount of Nplate sales in '23, Robyn, compared to '22. Recall, '22 had the significant purchase by the U.S. government in the second half of the year. We had several favorable changes to estimated sales deductions that occurred in '22 and we sold the generics business in Turkey which closed late in '22. So a couple of puts and takes around those. And so we look forward to a year in 2023 with strong growth in our priority products, since of, Repatha, Prolia, TAVNEOS. And also -- and that's in light of -- consistent with the industry trends we talked about in our recent history with mid-single-digit price declines in our portfolio but good volume growth. I think maybe to go back to the question Jay asked, too, we expect strong volume growth outside the United States in 2023. So we're looking forward to taking on '23 with a lot of aggressiveness. I think the answer to that is that our volume growth, the volume growth is quite large and that's really the offset, Yaron. That's a good question. And so we see that happening. We also -- in terms of the move of the PRET down there, recall, too, in cost of sales this year, we've got $125 million coming in off of the release out of inventory into cost of sales without any corresponding tax provision. And so the percent of sales versus a percent of pretax too, you've got to be thinking about that in terms of the income tax provision itself. So that's the puts and the takes on that. But when you strip it all back, it's really that move of the PRET down into the income tax expense that increases that effective rate to 18% to 19%. Yes, Brian, I think, as you know, we don't give long-term guidance on tax rates. And so we won't go beyond this year, so 18% to 19%. And go back to your own just to make sure we understand the change in the PRET. The PRET is a percentage of its cost of sales as opposed to the income tax rate which is pretax income. So that's a little bit of the difference to that Yaron asked about. So 18% to 19% this year is where we're at and that's where we'll -- that's what we'll give you for now."

            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Arvind and hello, everyone and thank you for joining our call. So beginning the year feeling confident about the long-term growth outlook for our business and let me offer 5 reasons why. First, we have a number of innovative volume-driven products that still have plenty of room to run and we saw that in 2022. Repatha, Prolia and EVENITY each generated double-digit sales and volume growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year. We expect continued growth from these products in 2023 and beyond with Repatha, in particular, helped by important new data from the FOURIER open-label extension study and new prescribing guidelines. OTEZLA delivered 7% volume growth in both the fourth quarter and the full year, benefiting from a label expansion that gives us the opportunity to reach millions of new patients in the U.S. with mild to moderate psoriasis. LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE collectively contributed more than $450 million in full year sales and we're pursuing additional indications for both products. We're especially pleased to see TEZSPIRE being utilized by patients across all types of severe asthma. Murdo will share more about the performance of our in-line products in a moment. Second, we moved 6 first-in-class molecules into Phase III or potentially registration-enabling trials in 2022, including Olpasiran for LP(a), rocatinlimab for atopic dermatitis, TEZSPIRE in eosinophilic esophagitis and of course, bemarituzimab, tarlatimab in BLINCYTO in cancer. We've also begun enrolling patients in a Phase II trial for AMG 133. Based on early data, this molecule, with its unique mechanism of action, looks like it may have an attractive profile for the treatment of obesity. And more on our pipeline from Dave Reese in a moment. Third, we have an industry-leading biosimilars business that will contribute to our growth over time. In 2022, we delivered positive Phase III data for our biosimilar candidates to EYLEA, SOLIRIS and STELARA, positioning us to be in the first wave of these launches which we know is critical to success. We're also less than 24 hours into the launch of AMGEVITA in the U.S. and AMGEVITA is the leading biosimilar to HUMIRA internationally. And with a 5-month lead over the next entrant, we're well positioned for success in the U.S. All told, we have 6 more biosimilar launches planned in the U.S. and markets around the world between now and the end of the decade, making this another source of long-term growth for us. Fourth, we've often said that we would look to licensing and acquisitions in our stated areas of strategic interest. And that's what we've done, building on our decades of experience in inflammation with 2 significant transactions that will strengthen our presence in this space. Through the acquisition of ChemoCentryx, we added TAVNEOS, a first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis and we're off to a strong start there. Our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will add several additional first-in-class early in life cycle biologic medicines, including TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA that will add to our growth profile through 2030 and beyond. We're working our way through the regulatory review processes for that deal and are confident that the deal poses no anticompetitive matters. And we have received a second request from the U.S. FTC and we'll work with them to answer their questions while remaining optimistic that we can complete the deal in the first half of the year. Finally, we've stayed true to our capital allocation priorities, investing in our business to drive long-term growth while also returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and a growing dividend. You'll hear more from Peter on this shortly. And everything we achieved last year and everything we will achieve going forward is due to the hard work and commitment of our people. They're passionate about our mission to serve patients. They're clear on how their work contributes to our success and they're ready to seize the opportunities and meet the challenges that await us. I'm grateful to all of them. I look forward to your questions a little later on but now let me turn the call over to Murdo. Okay. Well, thank you, Peter and Dave, for soldiering on despite the technical difficulties. And again, apologies to all of you who've dialed in to join us on the call and who found some disruption in the proceedings here. A number of you have e-mailed your questions to Arvind. What I'd like to suggest is that any of you who have questions, directly e-mail them now to Arvind and Arvind will read them and we'll try to answer them here in the room. And let me just assure all of you that we will rearrange our schedule and be available to answer questions if we don't get to it on this conference call, be available to Arvind and his team to answer questions you may have after we wrap up. So with that, let me turn to Arvind and we'll tackle the questions that you've already submitted. Okay. We do that in 2 pieces. Pete, why don't you hit the accounting question? Okay. And then on AMGEVITA, why don't we do a 2-parter there? Dave Reese and then Murdo, you may want to add some thoughts. Okay. Thank you, Murdo and Dave. Let's go to the next question, Arvind. Okay. Murdo, you want to share your thoughts on that? Let me just -- I note that we're up to the half past the hour but we will continue to take questions for as long as necessary here to answer those questions and until there is a recording of this that will be available in the form of a transcript for those of you that have conflicts and can't stay beyond the set time. So Arvind, why don't you go to the next question? Okay. Thanks, David. Arvind, let's go to the next question. Let me just say, Michael and to the prior question from Evan, if you need more detail on that to make sure you fully understand what we're saying in our response, just let us know, we'll get back to you. I think particularly, Evan, for your question, if you're not familiar with that mechanism that's common to us in France, happy just to provide more color for you. Again, Michael, I know a lot going on here and apologies for the disruption and don't know if you were able to follow all the slides earlier. So if you need more color, let us know, we'll call you back after the conference call. Okay. Go ahead, Arvind, to the next question. We are subject to the restrictions that we have on our ability to say anything on what's in the documents. You want to address that? Okay. Thanks, Salveen, for your question. Let's go to the next one, Arvind. Let's go to the next question. I know a number of you have submitted questions, so we're continuing to work through the list. Anybody who hasn't yet shot Arvind an e-mail, we're going to go through those and we've got couple of handfuls still to go. So let's, Arvind, go to the next question. So Robyn, maybe I'll start on the last piece and then Pete, you can reiterate what we said about '23. But as I said in my remarks, Robyn, we have 6 further similar launches planned between now and the end of the decade in the United States and other countries around the world. And it is the launch of those molecules through time which will enable us to continue to grow that franchise. So I would reiterate what I said earlier in my prepared comments. I think you've heard Murdo address as well the attractive opportunities that we think we'll have here, in particular, with AMGEVITA though we're in the first day of launch. And with respect to '23, Pete, I don't know whether you want to say anything in addition to what you already have about the outlook for the year. I think we're down to our last question, Arvind, if you want to... All right. Well, thank you very much, again, for your patience. Apologies that we had a little bit of difficulty with our vendor's connection earlier on the call. So if you have any further questions, shoot them into Arvind. We'll be around here this afternoon, Peter Murdo, Dave and myself, to answer any further questions you might have. And we appreciate your joining the call and look forward to talking to you during the course of 2023. Thank you."

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. 2022 was another year of strong execution of our mission to bring [indiscernible] products to the millions of patients in the world who suffer from gravest illness. The evolution of our portfolio continue by record sales for 16 brands. We saw strong volume gains across our general medicine and hematology-oncology growth brands. Our inflammation therapeutic area expanded with the launch of TEZSPIRE and the acquisition of TAVNEOS, 2 first-in-class medicines that treat serious disease. In addition, our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will add several important medicines to our portfolio. In total, volume growth for 2022 was 9% with 7% growth in the U.S. and 14% growth ex U.S. as we continue to deliver on our international growth strategy. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, full year global product sales grew 4% as our volume increases were offset by a 5% decline in net selling price. Including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact, product sales increased 2% year-over-year. In the quarter, we also saw strong volume growth with a 10% increase year-on-year. Starting with our general medicine business which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig, overall revenue for these 4 products grew 21% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 18% for the full year, driven by 19% and 21% volume growth, respectively. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 14% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven primarily by 11% volume growth. EVENITY which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $225 million for the quarter, driven by strong volume growth across markets. Repatha sales increased 22% year-over-year for the fourth quarter with volume growth of 31%, partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., we generated volume growth of 32% for the fourth quarter, aided by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. We saw declining net selling prices in the U.S. as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect less year-over-year U.S. price erosion than we saw in 2022. Outside the U.S., fourth quarter sales of Repatha grew 36% year-over-year, driven by 31% volume growth. Globally, Repatha has treated over 1.5 million patients since launch. Repatha's strong prescribing history in cardiology and expanding use in the primary care setting position us well to bring Repatha to more patients globally. With the FOURIER long-term follow-up data, in addition to evolving and more aggressive treatment guidelines, there's a clear rationale that lowering LDL cholesterol as much and as early as possible with Repatha will reduce cardiovascular risk for patients around the world. Transitioning to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla sales decreased 2% year-over-year for the quarter and increased 2% for the full year. We saw 7% volume growth in both periods. This was offset by lower net selling price, stemming from enhancements to our co-pay and patient assistance programs to support new patients starting treatment as well as additional rebates to improve the quality of coverage. During the fourth quarter, our U.S. Otezla business was impacted by new patient demand from 3 drug programs by newly launched topical and systemic competition. We expect that impact to continue in Q1 of 2023. We also expect to see the typical pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due primarily to the effect of insurance reverifications, co-pays and deductibles for patients. The combined effect could lead to first quarter Otezla sales being similar to or below those from Q1 of 2022. Longer term, we continue to see strong growth potential for Otezla, given its established safety profile, strong payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and ease of administration. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the 4 million U.S. patients with mild to moderate psoriasis, 1.5 million of whom have psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical and can benefit from a first-line systemic treatment like Otezla. ENBREL sales decreased 1% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by declines in volume and net selling price, partially offset by higher year-end inventory levels. ENBREL remains an important product for patients due to its long track record of efficacy and safety. TEZSPIRE continues its strong launch with $79 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $170 million for the full year. Allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed TEZSPIRE across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation of TEZSPIRE in both biologic-naive and previously treated patients. Physicians acknowledge TEZSPIRE unique differentiated profile and has broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations. We're now preparing for the anticipated U.S. approval of the prefilled pen in the first quarter which will offer patients the convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home. Sales of TAVNEOS were $21 million in the fourth quarter. Our integration of ChemoCentryx is proceeding smoothly, confirming our belief that Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence will allow us to bring TAVNEOS to more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. We're also excited about our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. Our combined portfolio which will include [indiscernible] will address serious inflammatory diseases and improve the lives of many patients. Amgen's commercial capabilities and global presence in approximately 100 markets [ph] will allow our combined team to deliver important therapies that will make a meaningful difference for more patients globally. Today, we announced the launch of AMGEVITA, the first U.S. biosimilar to HUMIRA, a medicine used by more than 1 million patients living with serious inflammatory diseases. With our track record of developing and manufacturing biologics and decades of experience in inflammation, Amgen is uniquely equipped to supply patients with this biosimilar medicine. AMGEVITA is the first significant U.S. biosimilar in the pharmacy benefit space and we expect gradual uptake in the coming months as this market evolves. Moving to our hematology and oncology business which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. These 6 innovative products grew 14% year-over-year with 17% volume growth for the quarter. Full year sales grew 13%, driven by volume gains. KYPROLIS sales grew 14% in the fourth quarter. Nplate sales in the fourth quarter included $207 million related to a onetime order from the U.S. government. Given the strong performance of our hem/onc portfolio in 2022 and the recent positive data on both BLINCYTO and Vectibix, I look forward to the future growth potential of this portfolio. LUMAKRAS reported $71 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $285 million for the full year. Quarter-over-quarter sales declined 5% with 12% volume growth, more than offset by a lower net selling price driven by a $12 million unfavorable price adjustment resulting from a reimbursement approval decision in France and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 45 countries. We've launched LUMAKRAS in 30 markets and are rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. As we've noted before, the market for LUMAKRAS focused on the 7,000 U.S. and 20,000 ex U.S. patients in the second-line setting. Longer term, we expect LUMAKRAS growth to come from moving into earlier lines of therapy and expanding into additional tumor types. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 40% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 30% for the full year, driven by lower price. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines, driven by increased competition. The most recently published average selling price in the U.S. declined 38% year-over-year for MVASI and 51% for KANJINTI. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. And as we start the new year, I'm inspired by the hard work of the thousands of Amgen employees around the world who wake up every day to serve our patients. Our expanding international presence and diverse portfolio of products, further strengthened by the integration of ChemoCentryx and the announced acquisition of Horizon, position us well to serve many more patients globally. And with that, I'll turn it to Dave. Yes. Thanks, Dave. We have had some inbound questions on this, as you can imagine, during the day, given that we are launching. So far, launch is progressing well. We have product making its way into the channel and we're already receiving inbound interest in AMGEVITA from payers, prescribers and patients. One thing that's important to remember is the current product that we have in the market is a lower concentration, original concentration AMGEVITA or adalimumab but it is citrate-free, meaning that the patient experience here is still 1 where we minimize the injection site pain by having a citrate-free formulation. And patient experience here has been positive in our clinical trials and we anticipate that not having a high concentration will not be a barrier in the market. These are very low volumes that are injected through an auto-injectable pen. And we've seen very, very good reliability of patients being able to administer. In addition, of course, we provide nurse support for patients. And then while it wasn't asked, I think it's also important to note that we are providing financial assistance, support and reimbursement support for both prescribers and patients as we launch the product. So really a full suite of services and support that you would expect for a branded launch being applied to the launch of the first biosimilar, adalimumab, to launch in the U.S., that is AMGEVITA. It's hard for me, obviously, to comment on what competitors may do as other biosimilars of adalimumab enter the market beyond July. But what we have seen coming into 2023 is a good cycle of reimbursement negotiations and we've been able to secure a very broad coverage for both ENBREL and Otezla. We expect that insurance coverage to continue throughout the course of 2023. And as is usual, we had small concessions on net price to secure that broad reimbursement but nothing unusual compared to prior years. Okay. So first on Otezla, I would start with the fact that we are the only systemic product indicated for a broad range of psoriasis patients without regard to the severity and really makes us the ideal first-line first systemic post-topical choice of therapy. And that is the positioning of the brand. The size of that market is very large. There's 4 million patients with a mild to moderate form of psoriasis. About 1.5 million of those patients would be regarded as not doing as well as they could on topical treatment by potential switching to a systemic like Otezla. As I mentioned just a few moments ago, Otezla also enjoys very broad frontline access, that is it doesn't require that you step through another systemic therapy. And it also means that prescribers can make it the first choice. And these are busy dermatologists. They want something that's easy. They don't want a lot of prior paperwork. And they want to be able to provide an ability for patients to start quickly on their therapy. Only Otezla offers that in the psoriasis market. I think what we're seeing right now is an effect of a number of free goods programs that were launched at the end of last year and continue into this quarter. When physicians have free goods programs or sometimes referred to as bridging programs, usually used at the beginning of a product launch when there hasn't been an opportunity to secure access with pharmacy benefit managers, physicians will sometimes use those to try novel therapies coming into the market. However, as those novel therapies go through the negotiation process with PBMs and payers, oftentimes, it becomes more difficult to try those novel therapies because of the nature of the access that they result with. And I think that's really where the sustained advantage of Otezla in that first-line systemic post-topical prebiologic patient population really allows us a long-term growth opportunity. And we continue to feel confident in the long-term growth of this brand. And we have a very strong commercial presence in a number of markets around the world and we continue to feel good from what we're hearing from our prescribing base of dermatologists. I will say that the short-term impact of these free good programs, we're watching it very closely and we're making sure that we continue to be competitive in the marketplace. Well, maybe I can answer the second part first. We don't comment on product-specific pricing and so I really can't answer the net price. I think it's fair to say that as additional entrants come into the market, net prices usually go down. We've seen that in our other biosimilars business but we would expect that to happen here. With respect to the 2 list price approach that we've employed here at this launch, this is really to address the complexity of the U.S. market. Pharmacy benefit managers have a business model that requires that they negotiate rebates with manufacturers and so they would prefer a high list price and negotiate rebates to net the price down and then pass those rebates through to their upstream employer clients. There are other stakeholders and customers in the health care system that prefer a net price-based model and don't care about the difference between list and net or gross price and net price. And so for those, we have the lower net price product available. So just a reminder, we have a high list price at 5% below HUMIRA and then we have a low list price at 55% below HUMIRA. We also intend to ensure that AMGEVITA is an affordable medicine for patients by providing co-pay assistance as well as helping patients secure reimbursement through the insurer. We are also pleased to report that we enjoy broad access out of the gate on day 1 of launch with the 3 national pharmacy benefit managers, so broad parity coverage alongside HUMIRA. Yes. I'm not sure we have a slowing overall volume growth. I think what we saw and I mentioned this, it might not have come through clearly on the audio but in the quarter, we did see a price effect based on reaching reimbursement decision finalization in France. And so we had a $12 million charge in the quarter against LUMAKRAS. It grew 7% volume in the quarter. But I think we anticipated the opportunity for LUMAKRAS in second-line being limited to the incident population. And we are commercially and medically sized appropriately for that opportunity. I think as we expand into earlier lines of therapy or other tumor types, we will continue to invest behind the product. Yes. Look, I think the Horizon team is doing a very good job commercializing this product and continue to help many patients within the broad current indication, as Dave mentioned. And I think additional data here could be additive to the already very promising growth of the product. Yes. It's a similar question to 1 asked earlier but perhaps I can elaborate a little bit for Chris. It's fairly clear that dermatologists want to use the easiest product and safest and well-understood product when moving to a first systemic treatment post topically. Many of these topical patients are hesitant to try a systemic agent. And so I think this is where Otezla's profile studied extensively with over 700,000 patients globally having experienced this product, the safety and efficacy of Otezla is extremely well understood. As I mentioned earlier, the frontline access coverage that we've secured in the U.S. without a lot of prior authorization requirement, the convenience of that for dermatology practices is very clear and it makes it a really good first-line treatment, systemic treatment, especially for a patient with milder or more moderate disease. For moderate or severe disease, it is likely that you're going to need to use something like a biologic or a second-line agent. And we think that given that [indiscernible] has yet to go through the market access process and secure payer reimbursement, we're not really seeing how it's actually going to be used longer term in the marketplace. And I think sometimes, these free good programs can distort what the actual uptake curve will be for a product. Well, as I mentioned before, we're primarily through our 2023 cycle and we've secured very good access. We've had to concede a bit of price, as I mentioned but not anything that looks precipitous compared to prior years. So we're pleased with that. ENBREL is an important product for many indications. We see that the safety and efficacy profile of ENBREL is well understood. I think physicians also want choice. And I think that's where PBMs are also open to having more than 1 TNF product on their formulary. And I think that's really what we've been able to secure and what we continue to think we'll be able to achieve in the future. Well, I can't comment on a competitor's contracts with PBMs and payers. What I can say is we've secured broad access for AMGEVITA at the 3 national PBMs. We continue to work with other customers to provide access for providers and patients alike. And we'll continue to compete effectively as we have done everywhere else in the world with this product. And outside of the U.S., we were able to establish a leadership position with AMGEVITA. And we think, given the services that we've provided and the commercial footprint we have, we're in a very good competitive position vis-a\u0300-vis other biosimilars. Yes, we don't give product-specific guidance. And this is a new event in the U.S. biosimilar market, given this is the first big pharmacy benefit product to go up. So we will continue to update all of you as the launch progresses. We have said we think this will be gradually slope on this launch and I'm going have to keep you apprised as we go forward. And just on the AMGEVITA question, I would say that we have a commitment to continuing to make sure that the product attributes of our biosimilars provide payers, providers and patients with all of the benefits that they're looking for. And we're also trying to ensure that there is no reason to switch away from AMGEVITA in the long range. So we hope that interchangeability, the high concentration and the fact that we already have a citrate-free product on the market, along with the services we provide, along with the fact that this is an Amgen team of people who understand the inflammation indications of this product very well and they have relationships with the customers that prescribe HUMIRA, we feel really good about the durability of AMGEVITA long term beyond 2024. Yes, we are actually very pleased with the expansion internationally of the Amgen footprint being in over 100 markets. We continue to launch products and secure reimbursement around the world. I talked about LUMAKRAS. And most recently in China, we've been able to secure national reimbursement drug listing for both Prolia and Repatha. Our Japanese affiliate is growing well. In the recent history, I think what you're seeing is a function of just timing of launches coming a bit earlier in the U.S. and also some of our partnering products. I think longer term, what we've got is a very interesting portfolio of products that will continue to make their way around the world. The announced Horizon acquisition has a very large opportunity internationally. And we see our JPAC region is actually our fastest-growing potential opportunity longer term. So I wouldn't look at short-term movement from quarter-to-quarter. The long-term prevailing trend is that we will grow quickly outside the United States. Yes, I think we remain quite confident in our long-term growth of Otezla. We are in a period where there's a lot of new product entrants in the market competing for new patient starts. I think the unique positioning of the product, as I mentioned, allows us to source a very large pool of patients. And our coverage around the world and particularly in the U.S. from an insurance reimbursement perspective allows us to penetrate that market. So we feel very good about the continued prospects to grow Otezla. I wouldn't say we expect it to get larger but we will continue to see a decline in that business which is a function of the average selling price decline that we've seen thus far. Overall, our immunology business looks very good. I think we're very pleased with the TEZSPIRE launch. We continue to see broad phenotypes of patients regardless of biomarker status being treated. We are seeing de novo patients who haven't seen a biologic before in their treatment of their uncontrolled asthma. And we're also seeing patients being switched from other products within the class. And so we expect that area of autoimmune disease growing in terms of the biologic penetration of severe uncontrolled asthma. And we're well positioned to compete for that expanded treatment pattern. ENBREL continues to serve many patients. And the trends there are fairly predictable and fairly consistent. Otezla, as we've mentioned, is seeing some pressure from new free drug programs, both for our topicals as well as new entrant oral And then we also have just picked up TAVNEOS which we're really excited about, a product that treats a severe autoimmune disease, ANCA-associated vasculitis, very young product, very early in its life cycle and I think a lot of growth there to be had. And then, of course, last but certainly not least, on the branded side, the announced acquisition of Horizon. So I think the inflammation area, along with our own innovative pipeline and the pipeline of Horizon is a very good growth opportunity for us long term. And last but not least, here we are on the first day of launch of a novel biosimilar to the largest product in the U.S. and that's HUMIRA. So I think we've got a lot of opportunities for growth ahead."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "David Reese",
            "content": "Thanks, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. For research and development, last year was one of high-quality execution and on-time delivery of results as we continued to progress our innovative pipeline. In general medicine, we strengthened our cardiovascular franchise and emerging portfolio of obesity assets, 2 areas of significant unmet need, affecting millions of patients globally. Repatha, of course, is the cornerstone of these efforts. And last November at AHA, we presented FOURIER open-label extension data. These data were recognized by the American College of Cardiology expert consensus decision pathway which indicated there appears to be no LDL cholesterol level below which benefit ceases. Additionally, LDL cholesterol recommendations were updated to reflect a reduction in target LDL levels in highest-risk patients from 70 to 55 milligrams per deciliter. This is a level that is not attainable for a large number of patients without PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Another molecule that we are excited about is Olpasiran. At AHA, we presented Phase II data where Olpasiran dosed 75 milligrams or higher every 12 weeks reduced Lp(a) concentrations by 95% to 100% in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with baseline Lp(a) levels of approximately 260 nanomolars per liter. Olpasiran appeared both safe and well tolerated in this study. We are encouraged by these data, particularly our dosing frequency, safety and tolerability profile and degree of Lp(a) reduction. We have initiated a Phase III outcome study and 6,000 subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and significantly elevated Lp(a) levels of at least 200 nanomolars per liter. Now turning to obesity. In December, we presented data from a Phase I study where AMG 133 appeared safe, well-tolerated and demonstrated a 14.5% reduction in body weight at day 85 following 3 monthly subcutaneous injections. Body weight reductions were observed up to 150 days after the final AMG 133 administration. Given these favorable attributes, we are now enrolling a 570-subject Phase II study to explore AMG 133 in patients with obesity with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The study will also investigate different dosing levels and regimens... [Technical Difficulty] Yes. In terms of the filing time lines, once we have the data in hand, we'll be then giving guidance as to when we expect filing and potential approval of that after the appropriate regulatory interactions. It's important, I think, as Bob were put this in context, let me ask Murdo to comment here. Yes. In terms of the obesity pipeline, AMG 133, the 2 additional cohorts you're referring to, I don't know that we'll see data over the course of this year on that. If that changes, of course, I'll provide guidance. AMG 786 is a small molecule with a different mechanism of action, as indicated to GLP-1 or Gipper receptor agonist or antagonist. So that's going through dose escalation over the course of the year. I'll provide guidance in terms of when we may see data from that program. And of course, at the time of data availability, we'll talk about the target as well. Yes. I mean, I think we're restricted, of course, by Irish takeover rules here. What we can say is that it's worth reminding everyone that the current label is broad and encompasses patients with thyroid eye disease, the -- due to autoimmune thyroiditis. This is primarily a study that will generate data in a population that we believe will help with reimbursement and with payers. And let me ask Murdo to comment on that. I would point out that mechanistically, there is no difference between chronic thyroid eye disease and the acute form of the disease. In fact, it's a semantic definition as to when the disease progresses to the chronic form but the underlying pathogenic mechanism of being driven in large part by IGF1R [ph] is intact. And therefore, based on prior data and mechanistically, we're optimistic about that study. Murdo? Yes. Thanks, Greg. What I view this is as another modality in our toolkit. We've been watching the antibody drug conjugate technology quite closely for the past several years. It's advanced, so what we feel is that we'll use ADCs on appropriate targets. I view it as an addition and an extension of our modalities. These collaborations bring together our experience on target identification and validation as well as, of course, antibody generation with some of the newer conjugation technology. So as that progresses, more to come but you should view this as additive to our armamentarium. Yes. Thanks, David. This is a year where certainly my focus, my team's focus will be on execution, a huge amount to carry forward in the pipeline. So things that I would keep an eye on, how well are we enrolling the Phase III Olpasiran trial? How well are we enrolling the AMG 133 Phase II trial? In the general medicine portfolio, in inflammation, how are the suite of rocatinlumab trials enrolling? How are we delivering on TEZSPIRE additional indications? And then finally, in oncology, things to keep an eye on are the tarlatumab program, not only the Phase II potentially registrational trial readout in the second half of the year but also initiation of a Phase III trial in second-line disease. These are some of the top line things that I'll be paying attention to. And then there are, of course, a host of others earlier in the pipeline and in discovery research. Yes. Regarding the dosing of rocatinlumab. As we've indicated before, we will explore different dosing paradigms here. And as that suite of Phase III trials fully launches, I think it will become clear what we're looking for there based on both the mechanism of action of the molecule as well as patient convenience.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\nArvind Sood: Okay. Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our Q3 call. So we continued with our execution during the quarter with a focus on driving volume growth for our key products and advancing our innovative pipeline. Leading the discussion today will be our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. We have posted some slides for your reference and my customary reminder that we'll be making some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, all of you, for joining our call. In the face of both macroeconomic and industry-specific challenges, Amgen remains laser-focused on delivering for patients and shareholders. Benefit of that focus was evident in the third quarter with volumes up a healthy 8% and 16% outside the United States. These results reflect the strong underlying demand for our medicines and the value they bring to patients even in challenging economic times like those prevailing at the moment. Revenues for the quarter were down 1%, reflecting a 5% net price decline consistent with what we communicated earlier in the year and a 2% impact from foreign exchange. All told, 11 of our products generated record sales in the quarter, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 15% with free cash flows reaching $2.8 billion for the quarter. Looking forward, we remain focused on several growth drivers. With the recent closing of the ChemoCentryx acquisition, we're excited to have TAVNEOS in our portfolio. TAVNEOS is the first new treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis in more than 10 years, and we're confident that we can leverage our decades of experience in inflammation and nephrology to bring this innovative medicine to many more patients moving forward. Two recently launched products, TEZSPIRE and LUMAKRAS, are off to solid starts. TEZSPIRE is performing well in asthma, and we have studies underway for several other indications for that product as well. LUMAKRAS is performing well globally with patients, payers and prescribers recognizing the importance of this innovation. With combination studies underway, we're exploring the many different ways this product may benefit patients through time. We have a number of key products led by Repatha, Otezla, Prolia and EVENITY that we know can benefit millions more patients globally than they do today. And let's not lose sight of the fact that these 4 products collectively generated $2 billion in third quarter sales with volume growth of 17%. We've built an industry-leading biosimilars business, having now launched five products in markets around the world, and we're months away from being the first company to launch a biosimilar to HUMIRA in the U.S. AMGEVITA is already the most prescribed HUMIRA biosimilar in Europe, giving us confidence as we prepare to enter the U.S. market. Looking forward, our next wave of biosimilars to STELARA, SOLIRIS and EYLEA are well positioned with our having now successfully completed Phase III trials for all three of these molecules. We have many potential new medicines advancing through our innovative pipeline, including Olpasiran, tarlatamab, rocatinlimab, bemarituzumab and AMG 133. These five molecules and several others that you'll hear about shortly from Dave Reese are vintage Amgen, which is first-in-class medicines that make a big difference for patients suffering from serious diseases for which there remains a real need for new and better treatments. Finally, we have a highly engaged and committed workforce, and I want to thank them, as always, for their great work. With that, let me turn over to our CFO, Peter Griffith.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Bob. We're pleased with our execution this quarter, and we are on track to deliver against our long-term objectives, most importantly serving patients. Our recently closed acquisition of ChemoCentryx adds a newly launched innovative product to our portfolio, TAVNEOS, a first-in-class and best-in-class approved treatment for patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Let's walk through our third quarter financial results before discussing our 2022 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 6 of the slide deck. In Q3, we recognized total revenue of $6.7 billion. This represents a modest decline of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, total revenue and product sales grew 2% and 1%, respectively. Earnings per share of $4.70 grew 15% versus our recast Q3 2021. Recall those results included $400 million recorded in R&D expense related to our upfront payment to license rights to AMG 451, rocatinlimab, from Kyowa Kirin Corporation, KKC. Non-GAAP EPS grew 1%, excluding the $400 million expense for the KKC license. Murdo will review product sales with you, but I would highlight that our established product portfolio generated almost $900 million in product sales and continues to deliver strong cash flows to fund both internal and external innovation. Other revenues of $415 million increased 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 8% year-over-year primarily driven by the $400 million payment to KKC in Q3 2021. Excluding the impact of the $400 million upfront payment, third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting investments to advance our research capabilities and pipeline while also supporting product launches. And we delivered a 52.5% operating margin as a percentage of product sales. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 0.3 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 16.1% primarily due to changes in product mix, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and lower costs associated with fewer COVID-19 antibody shipments. Excluding the $400 million upfront payment, non-GAAP R&D spend in the third quarter increased 10% year-over-year primarily due to higher late-stage program support and research and early pipeline spend, partially offset by lower marketed product support. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments and activities while driving productivity, automation and digitalization. Non-GAAP OI&E was about $370 million in expense in the third quarter. This was driven by increased net interest expense and our share of BeiGene results because of our use of the equity method of accounting. Our OI&E was lower than anticipated due to gains from liability management that we do not expect to the same extent in future quarters. We have a strong balance sheet, generates significant cash flow and retain significant financial flexibility to execute strategic business development opportunities and execute on our multiple capital allocation priorities. In the third quarter, we executed on the following: first, our recent acquisition at ChemoCentryx is a clear example of investing in the best innovation, in this case, external for patients; second, investing in our business through capital expenditures, including advancing construction on our new environmentally friendly facilities in Ohio and North Carolina; third, returning capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $1.94 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from Q3 2021; and fourth, opportunistic share repurchases. The final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase, ASR program, occurred in the third quarter, and we have repurchased about $6.3 billion of shares year-to-date. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2022. We're pleased with our execution through the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect to absorb about $560 million in FX headwinds against product sales based on recent FX rates, of which we absorbed nearly $400 million through the third quarter. And this is net of our hedging activities, reflecting our strong execution through the third quarter. And despite challenging foreign exchange dynamics, we're updating our 2022 revenue guidance range to $26.0 billion to $26.3 billion. We are updating our non-GAAP EPS range to $17.25 to $17.85. This range encompasses both FX headwinds of approximately 3% or $0.45 for the full year based on recent FX rates and costs associated with our acquisition of ChemoCentryx incurred between closing and year-end. I'll share a few additional points to consider for the remainder of 2022 with a particular focus on how these trends are likely to impact Q4. We expect FX headwinds to reduce product sales in Q4 by about $165 million. The U.S. government has agreed to purchase $290 million of Nplate. We will recognize about $200 million of those sales in Q4 with the remainder in 2023. We have completed the previously discussed divestiture of Gensenta, our generics business, in Turkey and will no longer recognize product sales and operating expenses from that business effective November 2, 2022. Sales of that business annualized at approximately $90 million. We now expect full year other revenue for 2022 between $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion versus our prior guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. When comparing against our recast 2021 results, we continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to reflect a low double-digit decrease year-over-year. We continue to expect 2022 non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% as a percentage of product sales. We now expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2022 to decrease 5% to 8% year-over-year compared to our recast 2021 non-GAAP R&D expenses, which include the $400 million upfront payment we discussed above. We expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to be roughly flat year-over-year as a percentage of product sales. We expect OI&E to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion with fourth quarter results closer to the first and second quarter results. For the full year, we now anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate range of 13.5% to 14.5%, down from our prior guidance of 14.0% to 15.0%. As you consider your modeling for 2023, recall that tax law changes enacted by Puerto Rico in June of 2022 that replaced the Puerto Rico excise tax, the PRET, in favor of an income tax will increase our 2023 income tax expense while reducing by roughly an equivalent amount of cost of goods sold. Note, however, there will be a onetime residual negative impact in 2023 related to the amount of the PRET currently capitalized in inventory that will be charged to cost of goods sold without a corresponding tax benefit. This charge is slightly larger than the benefit previously recognized with the implementation of the PRET in 2011, which was discussed in our 2011 Form 10-K. Summing up, since the business review in February, much has changed at the macro level with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, persistently high inflation, higher interest rates and the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act. Despite these headwinds, we have executed well in 2022. As we plan for 2023, we anticipate that these headwinds will continue. We're adapting our operating plans and expect to successfully execute against them. Like previous years, we expect to provide 2023 guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen remains strong. I thank our millions of patients for their courage and my 25,000 colleagues for their mission-driven work on behalf of those patients every day. This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Murdo.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Peter. We saw strong volume growth in the third quarter with an 8% increase year-on-year. We delivered record quarterly sales for 11 products, including EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, AMGEVITA, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO; and double-digit volume growth for several additional products, including Repatha and LUMAKRAS. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, third quarter global product sales grew 1% as our volume increases were offset by a 5% decline in net selling price, consistent with our prior estimates. Including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact, product sales declined 1% year-over-year. I'll start now with our general medicine business, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig. Overall revenue for this portfolio grew 14% year-over-year driven by 20% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 7% year-over-year driven by 8% volume growth. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $201 million for the quarter driven by 45% volume growth in the U.S. and 30% volume growth outside of the U.S. Repatha sales increased 14% year-over-year driven by 52% volume growth, which was partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., we generated 32% volume growth aided by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. We also saw declining net selling prices in the U.S. as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect less year-over-year U.S. price erosion than we saw in 2022. Outside the U.S., sales of Repatha grew 26% driven by 73% volume growth. Net price declines outside the U.S. were primarily a result of Repatha's inclusion on China's National Reimbursement Drug List as of January 1, 2022. Overall, we remain focused on addressing leading cause of morbidity and mortality by bringing Repatha to patients in need all around the world. Moving to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla sales increased 3% year-over-year for the quarter. Otezla saw 9% volume growth, partially offset by lower inventory and unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In the U.S., Otezla remains the leader in bio-naive psoriasis patient share, and we see broader adoption of Otezla among patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Looking forward, we expect continued strong volume growth given Otezla's established safety profile, strong payer coverage and unique position as the only systemic oral that can treat a broad spectrum of patients with psoriasis regardless of the severity of their disease. ENBREL sales decreased 14% year-over-year for the third quarter driven by lower net selling price, unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and a 3% decline in volume. ENBREL remains an important product for patients due to its long track record of efficacy and safety. I'm very pleased with our strong U.S. launch of TEZSPIRE, which generated $55 million of sales in the third quarter. Allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed TEZSPIRE across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation in both biologic-naive and previously treated patients. Physicians acknowledge TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled without requiring any phenotypic and biomarker testing. We recently completed our acquisition of ChemoCentryx, which adds TAVNEOS to our portfolio. TAVNEOS recently launched as a first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis, or AAV. This is a serious systemic autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation and eventual destruction of small blood vessels. This inflammatory disease can lead to permanent organ damage and, in some severe cases, can be life-threatening. TAVNEOS represents a significant advance in treatment for the 8,000 to 10,000 U.S. patients a year who develop severe active disease or experience major relapses of AAV. AAV is often managed by rheumatologists and nephrologists, where Amgen has a strong market presence and successful track record. We look forward to applying our deep expertise and inflammation experience to help many more patients manage AAV with TAVNEOS. Moving to our hematology and oncology business. Our 6 innovative products grew 8% year-over-year with 10% volume growth. For Vectibix and Nplate, strong volume growth in the quarter benefited from timing of shipments to our partners in Japan. Our launch of LUMAKRAS is progressing well with revenues of $75 million in the third quarter. Quarter-over-quarter sales declined 3% driven by lower net selling price due to a $12 million unfavorable price adjustment resulting from our reimbursement approval in Germany. This was partially offset by 15% volume growth. In the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to over 3,700 patients by over 2,200 clinicians in both academic and community settings. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 45 countries. We've launched in 30 markets and are rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining markets. As we've noted before, near term, the market for LUMAKRAS is focused on the 7,000 U.S. and 20,000 ex U.S. patients in the second-line setting. Longer term, we expect LUMAKRAS growth to come from earlier-line therapy and the potential of LUMAKRAS to treat other tumor types. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 25% year-over-year. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines driven by increased competition. The most recently published average selling price for MVASI in the U.S. declined 37% year-over-year and for KANJINTI declined 38% year-over-year. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. We're preparing ourselves for the upcoming launch of AMGEVITA, our HUMIRA biosimilar, in the U.S. in early 2023, followed by the next wave of biosimilar launches to STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS. Overall, I'm very pleased with our execution in the quarter. Our international presence and diverse portfolio of products position us well to deliver on the execution of our long-term growth strategy. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by welcoming our new colleagues from ChemoCentryx. We're excited that you're now part of Amgen. For research and development, the third quarter was one of continued execution where we presented new data on several programs and continued to progress our innovative clinical pipeline. Beginning with general medicine. This coming weekend at the American Heart Association meeting, we plan to present data from a Phase II study of Olpasiran, a lipoprotein little a targeting small interfering RNA molecule in subjects with elevated Lp little a. We also plan to present additional data from the Repatha FOURIER and Repatha open-label extension studies highlighting the association between the significant and sustained achievement of low and very low LDL cholesterol levels and lower rates of major cardiovascular events. Data from the single- and multiple-dose cohorts of the Phase I study of AMG 133, a multispecific that inhibits the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor, or GIPR, and activates the GLP-1 receptor, will be presented at the 20th World Congress on Insulin Resistance, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Hybrid Conference in December. As a reminder, the unique aspect of AMG 133 is the inhibition of GIPR, an innovative approach that we chose to take based on human genetic data that suggest decreased expression of GIPR leads to lower body mass index and lower weight. We look forward to discussing the Repatha and Olpasiran data along with an update on AMG 133 at our investor call scheduled for Monday, November 7. Turning to inflammation. In September, we presented data from the Phase III SPROUT trial, where Otezla treatment resulted in significant improvement in measures of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis at week 16 compared to placebo in children's ages 6 to 17. We also presented data from the Otezla Phase III DISCRETE trial, where 16-week data demonstrated statistically significant improvements in genital psoriasis, including skin, itch and quality of life in patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Based on these results, discussion of the FDA is ongoing for DISCRETE to add clinical data to the U.S. prescribing information, and discussions with regulatory authorities globally for SPROUT are forthcoming. In September, TEZSPIRE was approved in the European Union and in Japan, and regulatory reviews continue in other jurisdictions. In oncology, we presented data from tarlatamab, a DLL3-targeting BiTE molecule being studying in patients with small cell lung cancer. These data demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity with notable response durability and survival. In this setting, tarlatamab delivered a confirmed overall response rate of 23%, a median duration of response of 13 months and a median overall survival of 13.2 months. We continue to enroll patients in a potentially registrational Phase II study in this setting. We're also investigating tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line small cell lung cancer in combination with AMG 404, a PD-1 inhibitor, in patients with second-line or later small cell lung cancer and in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. In August, we presented data from our LUMAKRAS checkpoint inhibitor and SHIP2 combination studies. Based on these data, we continue to explore LUMAKRAS in both settings. In September, we presented data on LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix, where this combination demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety in patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Phase III trial continues to enroll using this combination. We also presented data from the global Phase III CodeBreaK 200 confirmatory trial, where LUMAKRAS treatment led to increased progression-free survival and a significantly higher objective response rate in patients with KRAS G12C mutated non-small cell lung cancer compared with docetaxel. Patient-reported outcomes were also improved with LUMAKRAS versus docetaxel. We've just received initial top line data from a post-marketing requirement study comparing the 960-milligram daily dose of LUMAKRAS with a lower dose of 240 milligrams daily in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Following discussions with regulators, we are planning to submit data from this study along with CodeBreaK 200 confirmatory Phase III data. As a reminder, we are investigating multiple potential to pass the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with LUMAKRAS, potentially segmented by PD-L1 expression levels, where the non-small cell lung cancer population breaks down into roughly 1/3 across PD-L1 high expressers, intermediate or low expressers, and PD-L1-negative expression. We've seen promising early data in the PD-L1-negative population and are planning to initiate a Phase III study of LUMAKRAS plus chemotherapy in first-line advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that the primary analysis of a Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 938, an investigational biosimilar to EYLEA compared with EYLEA, met its primary end point in subjects with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. With these data and previously announced Phase III data from our biosimilar candidates to SOLIRIS and STELARA, we have completed our goal of delivering positive Phase III data from 3 biosimilars in 2022. In conclusion, with an innovative portfolio or approximately 3/4 of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential and a growing portfolio of biosimilars, we are well positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients and growth for shareholders over the near and long term. I'll now turn it back to Bob.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, David. And Jason, why don't we now open the line up for questions. If you would remind our callers of the procedure, we can get started.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSalveen Richter: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On AMG 133 in obesity, could you just help us understand how you'll evaluate the data in the context of existing therapies to make a move forward decision and how you're thinking about differentiation here? Is it just a matter of taking a piece of the market given size? Or do you think there's other aspects here to the program?\nBob Bradway: Dave, why don't you take that question?\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks, Salveen. We know there's a lot of interest in this program. And as we mentioned, we'll be showing the data in full in the first week of December at the hybrid conference. Obesity is a large, very heterogeneous disease. It's a global public health problem. The things that I would look for in evaluating this molecule going forward will be the dosing; dosing interval; what are the kinetics of weight loss; how rapid is that weight loss; what is sustainability. And then finally, the overall tolerability. We do plan on using our extensive capabilities in human data to help shape our thinking and guide this development program as we move forward.\nSalveen Richter: Thank you.\nArvind Sood: Jason, we'll take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question now that you've been through - or hopefully been through most of the contracting season for next year. I think one of the key investor concerns is obviously with biosimilar HUMIRA coming next year, what impact that could have to ENBREL and ENBREL pricing dynamics for next year. So I'm wondering if you can just comment on how to think about the potential impact to ENBREL and its pricing next year? Thanks.\nMurdo Gordon: Thank you, Matthew. It's Murdo. We're obviously excited about the opportunity to launch the first biosimilar to HUMIRA. And so we are active in our discussions with payers and PBMs for that. We are not seeing a massive amount of change to ENBREL's access going forward, and we continue to believe we've got good regard on the payers and PBMs for the efficacy and the safety of ENBREL. And if there were to be a change in ENBREL pricing, it would be for volume gains. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're declining in volumes about 3% year-on-year. Our goal is to maintain that and maybe even improve upon it. But we're not quite finished in the contracting cycle.\nArvind Sood: Okay. Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a two part question on what everybody wants to talk about, which is obesity. So Lilly and Novo, the two lead players in the GLP space, they both have early-stage programs. I'm talking Phase I stage programs on triple agonist, et cetera. And one thing they always emphasize is that they have certain predefined thresholds for moving any of those programs forward. And those thresholds are off of incremental efficacy beyond the current most competitive products out there. And my question is, I imagine you're thinking about some of those thresholds too relative to Manjaro, perhaps Carsem, as you think about the progression of your program. And I'm curious if you could speak to that. And secondly, if you could just clarify for us, the low- and the high-dose data from single ascending dose you showed at your business review early in the year, was that an average of the first three and the highest three of the six cohorts in Phase I? Or was it the first two out of the six cohorts? I wasn't quite sure with the low and the high meant within the single ascending dose. And I remember, there were 6 different cohorts within single ascending. Thank you very much.\nDavid Reese: Yes. We'll get back to you on the latter half of that question. I'll remember off the top of my head, Umer, what that is. But we're going to have -- in a month, you'll have the full data set with all of the cohorts broken out. So I think, at that point, it will be very clear. In terms of thresholds, as I discussed a short while ago, there are many potential avenues to differentiation here. Of course, degree of weight loss is one of them; but also dosing interval; what the kinetics are; importantly, durability; importantly, tolerability, since a fair number of patients transition off of these agents for tolerability. So those are the sorts of things that we'll be taking a look at as we assess whether we've got a differentiated product and it's worth our scale investment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nMichael Yee: Thank you. I'm going to ask another follow-up on 133. David, last quarter, you said you actually started the Phase II. I actually didn't hear that here. Can you just talk about the actual status of where you are with 133 and also the fact that I believe it's been disclosed that you dialed back the GLP-1 potency, so we should not be expecting material, diabetes types effects, and this is not what we're looking for or people should be examining or scrutinizing? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yes. No, I don't believe we announced we had started Phase II, Mike, but rather that we're in planning. We do expect to initiating the Phase II trial in the relative near term. And once that gets launched, of course, we'll talk about design and give guidance in terms of expected data availability. I wouldn't over think the GLP-1 component, and I'm not sure that's on point. I think, again, when we share the data in a month, you'll get a look at that.\nMichael Yee: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nJay Olson: Hey, congrats on the quarter and closing the ChemoCentryx deal. You have a lot of volume growth outside the U.S. in the third quarter. And as an example, I think you said Repatha grew 73% ex U.S. with inclusion on China's National Drug Reimbursement List. Can you talk about the pace of product launches outside the U.S. and volume growth and how do you expect U.S. versus ex U.S. revenue mix to evolve over time? Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Do you want to - yes, jump in.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Jay. I think Repatha is a good example of how now with our broadened international presence, we're able to bring new products and new launches to the market fairly quickly. What we're seeing in China is rapid expansion of Repatha. Recall, we were on the market for just over a year prior to securing national reimbursement drug list. So we did establish good understanding education, awareness of Repatha. We were promoting it primarily for percutaneous coronary intervention patients or stent patients, where the unmet need was deemed to be highest amongst the private cash pay patient group. But I think what you're seeing is there's real demand in these markets to help millions of patients who are at very high risk of coronary vascular disease. And so we're continuing to build out our business in Japan and China. We had good volume growth in Europe. And obviously, we also had good volume growth in the U.S. So we're excited about the evolution of Repatha, and we continue to feel good about how that product will drive volume and revenue growth for us in the future. With respect to other launches, the other good example that we're seeing is just the LUMAKRAS launch given that we've got approval in roughly 40 markets, we've got reimbursement in roughly 30 markets, and we're pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. Our teams -- our oncology teams around the world doing a very nice job of identifying KRAS G12C second-line patients and making sure that they have LUMAKRAS as a treatment option. So I'm really pleased that the international presence we've been building for many years now is in full place, is functioning at a high level and delivering strong volume growth. Going forward, we have some partner products where we don't necessarily have the launches in every country where we have our partners to do that. But wherever Amgen has the global responsibility and rights for products, we're feeling very good about our potential and ability to launch them globally.\nBob Bradway: And Jay, let me just add, don't forget, we've - in the slides that we shared with you tefan [ph] we have the outside U.S. data available for you on all the different products. You'll see the current contribution from the international business there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Geoffrey Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Charlie on for Geoff. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. I just have questions regarding the, I guess, the EYLEA as well as STELARA kind of potential launch timing. I think given you mentioned that you already submitted the STELARA data to the FDA, I'm wondering you're expecting to see the product launch kind of second half of next year and whether you anticipate any pushback from J&J? And I guess similarly kind of for EYLEA, were like launch timing is in the 2024 time frame and if you anticipate kind of any pushback from Regeneron? Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks for the question, Charlie. We're obviously pleased with the successful data readouts on those products and some that have been filed. We expect to be in the first wave of those biosimilar launches, and we're not disclosing specific launch timing on those products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital. Your line is now open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. I'm not going to ask about 133 but rather on LUMAKRAS. So you had mentioned you had data from the dose-reduction trial. Can you characterize how we should think about the relative efficacy of the lower doses versus the approved dose? And on the pembro combination trial, I noticed in the slides, you talked about a dose expansion with a lower dose lead-in. Are you also treating in combination with that lower dose?\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks, Evan. Look, we understand there's a lot of interest in the dose comparison data. We're just getting the top line results to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. So it's premature to share these data prior to their review and the appropriate conversations. In regards to the combination trial, I believe you're referring to with checkpoint inhibitors, we're doing a lower dose lead-in, as I've mentioned before, and then layering on top of that dosing the checkpoint inhibitors. So they are then given concurrently going forward.\nEvan Seigerman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter result. So I have a question regarding the 30%-plus year over decline that we have seen with the -- a couple of biosimilars. Is it on expected lives 3 or 4 years after launch? And how should we think about the other biosimilars you have in your portfolio? How should we think about the long-term pricing dynamic there? Because it was an expectation that the pricing would probably stabilize after a certain point, but it doesn't seem like that in biosimilar.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks for the question, Mohit. I think what's important to remember when you're thinking at least about U.S. biosimilars is products in the buy and bill or medical benefit side will continue to see price declines over time because of the way in which the average selling price calculation works. Products on the pharmacy benefit side, so think Medicare Part D products or commercial-insured retail pharmacy products, they are likely to have slower declines in the slope of their net price over time. Now both of those conditions depend on how many competitors for each molecule. So everyone is a little bit different. But I would hesitate to put a time frame on the class of products. I think you need to look at each one of the molecules. One thing I will say is we've been very clear on where we're going to get growth in our biosimilars portfolio, and that's by launching successive new biosimilars on top of our continuing base of business. Outside the U.S., biosimilar pricing tends to come down fairly rapidly and then can hold in some of the larger, what we call retail markets. In markets where it's a heavy tender business, prices will continue to decline as long as there are competitors in the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen.\nYaron Werber: I got just a couple maybe. David, the first one on 133, can you comment it's an antibody? Can we assume it's monthly dosing? And then secondly, for 938 against EYLEA, now that there's going to be high-dose EYLEA, the 8 milligrams approved, it's obviously the same underlying drug, just a different formulation. How does that impact what you need to do to bring in a high-dose 938 to market and how that jives versus the fiscal year '25 potential launch?\nDavid Reese: Yes. Let me take the first part on 133. It's -- as I said, it's a multispecific or bifunctional molecule, meaning it's got an antibody component that inhibits the GIPR receptor. And then there's a component that agonizes GLP-1. So as you noted, you can expect antibody-like pharmacokinetics, and we'll be sharing all of that in a month. But that's what will drive the dosing interval. On 938, let me ask Murdo to comment briefly on that.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Yaron, we continue to want to be able to have a full complement of competitive biosimilar products that compete effectively with their innovative parent products. And we've, I think, done that very successfully, thanks to the talented team in our formulation and process development organization. So we feel confident that we'll be able to bring various concentrations across the portfolio as needed. So we're working on that one.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities. Your line is now open.\nDavid Risinger: Great, thanks very much. So my question is on biosimilars timing for 2023, please. Regarding AMGEVITA, in light of your interchangeability study, which has an estimated completion in January, assuming that succeeds, when in 2023 do you think FDA will add interchangeability to the label? And then is Amgen planning to launch biosimilar STELARA in September at risk if patent litigation remains outstanding?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks again for the question. Maybe take the second part first. We haven't made any statements about when we will launch our biosimilar to STELARA, but we're pleased that we've got strong data in hand, and we're pleased that we've got the strength of the Amgen manufacturing network and commercial organization ready to go. And we'll track that space closely. We expect to be in the first wave of launches on STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS, the next wave of new biosimilar launches. And we expect to be in the market in early Feb in the new year with AMGEVITA. The interchangeability stat is an interesting one. I think over time, that may grow in importance. But being first with AMGEVITA, we understand it to be of lower priority from payers and PBMs. But we do expect to have interchangeability in a relevant time frame for when the other biosimilar entrants to HUMIRA come into the market.\nOperator: Next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Just going to follow up with you on the ENBREL comment ahead of the biosimilar HUMIRA launch. We've heard that ENBREL is often used as a third- or second-line TNF. And so I was just curious whether -- you've noted that you don't expect further pricing declines, but that part of it is when ENBREL - HUMIRA launches that really you're already having a flow-through HUMIRA get to ENBREL in many cases, and that's why there may not be motivations have to compete on price. Just sort of clear -- that's a detailed question. Maybe help me understand the dynamics there.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Robyn, thanks for the opportunity to clarify. I didn't say that we don't expect continued price declines on ENBREL. I said we don't expect the current price declines to be dramatically different going into next year. So we do expect to continue to concede price on ENBREL as the category is quite competitive, but we don't see the slope of that changing dramatically. And ENBREL is used across a broad range of patient types in rheumatoid arthritis as well as in psoriatic arthritis. I think what we see is we see a lot of frontline usage still, and we do see some post-TNF frontline usage. So I think that will continue. Not every patient is going to respond to TNF inhibitor, and many clinicians prefer the well-demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of ENBREL, and we think that will continue despite biosimilar options in the market. So that hopefully clarifies your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Bristow with UBS. Your line is now open.\nColin Bristow: Hey, good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter. So I'll take another one on 133, if I may. As we think about time line, it took Lilly and Novo around 5 to 6 years to move their lips from sort of Phase I initiation to the market. Is there any reason at all for us to think that there's any sort of abbreviated path here that you could explore? And just with those sort of aforementioned time lines in mind and the fact that this efficacy bar that we see now could be raised by what are the competitor assets is ahead of you, does this raise the bar for progression to Phase II from your side?\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks for the question. The -- I think -- let me start with, again, the disease itself, obesity, which is a very heterogeneous disease. Obviously, it's one of the major public health problems globally right now. Our belief is that there are a number of diseases tucked within the label of obesity. Some patients have primarily cardiovascular manifestations; others, type 2 diabetes; others, mechanical problems. And so as I noted, we will be using our human data capabilities to further understand and potentially segment these populations to determine if there can be a particular benefit in subsegments of patients. And then I would just remind you of the things that we'll look for in this program as we go forward to see whether we have a differentiated molecule or not, dosing; again, the kinetics, in particular, pidity [ph] and sustainability of weight loss; and then overall tolerability. Those are the things that we'll be looking at as we take a look at Phase II data and determine as the field unfolds where we go from there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nCarter Gould: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry to beat a dead horse here, but to follow up on the prior question, how important is it that you also pursue diabetes alongside an obesity indication? Or do you feel like you could just go after obesity and that might be able to suffice and work out commercially?\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks, Carter. That's a question we'll address it as we go forward. But I don't feel that it's essential that this be a diabetes medication. As I said, this is -- obesity powers a large number of diseases, and we're going to guide our development to where we think we get the most effect size.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Ted on for Michael. We have [won] LUMAKRAS coming out of World conference with updated data on different combinations you presented, I mean, PD-1 and SHIP2. How do you think these different combo regimens can be positioned to develop each other? Do you have any updated view? And would you prioritize one over the other with data so far?\nDavid Reese: Yes. No, in terms of the combination, SHIP2 checkpoint inhibitor combinations, we're enrolling Phase II trial now with the SHIP2 combination that will guide our development. That's a combination that could potentially be applied regardless of PD-L1 expression levels. And then as I mentioned, we are exploring in the PD-L1-positive population a low-dose run-in of LUMAKRAS then followed by layering on of the checkpoint inhibitor. And as those trials enroll, I'll provide guidance in terms of when we have data readouts. And those data will determine how we think about the first-line population. Finally, let me remind everyone again that in the PD-L1-negative population, we're going to be looking at a chemotherapy plus LUMAKRAS combination.\nArvind Sood: Jason, I see one more participant in the queue. So let's take one last question, after which Bob will make some closing comments.\nOperator: Our final question is from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: I wanted to ask a two part biosimilar question related just to the U.S. market, and that's what you think uptake will be like in 2 disease areas that are a little different than most. So in the rare disease space, where you'll have a biosimilar SOLIRIS and then in the eye space with your biosimilar EYLEA, how do you think those will compare to disease areas where we already have precedents, such as in oncology? I know the ice pace is buy and bill. I think rare diseases is not buy and both, but if you could compare those, please.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Tim, for the question. As I mentioned before, you do have to look at each product slightly individually in the circumstances that would generate or drive uptick. If we go back to the oncology biosimilars, we had an assumption at the beginning of those products that patients may not get switched on the maintenance phase of their treatment, so mid-cycle or mid-course of treatment. And what we saw, at least in the buy-and-bill space, for both MVASI and KANJINTI that -- was that oncologists were comfortable with the quality of the Amgen biosimilars and by the fact that they had access to our medical teams and our salespeople who are out there calling on them to help them understand the data behind our biosimilars. And so we did see mid-course of treatment switching to our biosimilars. So I think the threshold for what we thought would be a hesitancy on the part of the subscriber was different. And I think that we're looking closely at both SOLIRIS prescribers and EYLEA prescribers. And we've done some in-market research with both customer types, and we feel good about our opportunity to create value for the health care system by offering biosimilar alternatives to those 2 branded products. And we feel good about our chances of having a decent uptake on both.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Well, again, let me thank all of you for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Amgen. And let me just end by saying that we remain focused on ending the year strong and positioning ourselves for a good '23 and beyond. We look forward to having a chance to engage with you again here in a few short weeks or Monday and then in a few short weeks thereafter, at various conferences. So thank you and we'll look forward to seeing you soon.\nArvind Sood: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes our 2022 Q3 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. We're pleased with our execution this quarter, and we are on track to deliver against our long-term objectives, most importantly serving patients. Our recently closed acquisition of ChemoCentryx adds a newly launched innovative product to our portfolio, TAVNEOS, a first-in-class and best-in-class approved treatment for patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Let's walk through our third quarter financial results before discussing our 2022 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 6 of the slide deck. In Q3, we recognized total revenue of $6.7 billion. This represents a modest decline of 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, total revenue and product sales grew 2% and 1%, respectively. Earnings per share of $4.70 grew 15% versus our recast Q3 2021. Recall those results included $400 million recorded in R&D expense related to our upfront payment to license rights to AMG 451, rocatinlimab, from Kyowa Kirin Corporation, KKC. Non-GAAP EPS grew 1%, excluding the $400 million expense for the KKC license. Murdo will review product sales with you, but I would highlight that our established product portfolio generated almost $900 million in product sales and continues to deliver strong cash flows to fund both internal and external innovation. Other revenues of $415 million increased 8% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 8% year-over-year primarily driven by the $400 million payment to KKC in Q3 2021. Excluding the impact of the $400 million upfront payment, third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting investments to advance our research capabilities and pipeline while also supporting product launches. And we delivered a 52.5% operating margin as a percentage of product sales. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 0.3 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 16.1% primarily due to changes in product mix, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and lower costs associated with fewer COVID-19 antibody shipments. Excluding the $400 million upfront payment, non-GAAP R&D spend in the third quarter increased 10% year-over-year primarily due to higher late-stage program support and research and early pipeline spend, partially offset by lower marketed product support. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments and activities while driving productivity, automation and digitalization. Non-GAAP OI&E was about $370 million in expense in the third quarter. This was driven by increased net interest expense and our share of BeiGene results because of our use of the equity method of accounting. Our OI&E was lower than anticipated due to gains from liability management that we do not expect to the same extent in future quarters. We have a strong balance sheet, generates significant cash flow and retain significant financial flexibility to execute strategic business development opportunities and execute on our multiple capital allocation priorities. In the third quarter, we executed on the following: first, our recent acquisition at ChemoCentryx is a clear example of investing in the best innovation, in this case, external for patients; second, investing in our business through capital expenditures, including advancing construction on our new environmentally friendly facilities in Ohio and North Carolina; third, returning capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $1.94 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from Q3 2021; and fourth, opportunistic share repurchases. The final settlement of the accelerated share repurchase, ASR program, occurred in the third quarter, and we have repurchased about $6.3 billion of shares year-to-date. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2022. We're pleased with our execution through the third quarter. For the full year, we now expect to absorb about $560 million in FX headwinds against product sales based on recent FX rates, of which we absorbed nearly $400 million through the third quarter. And this is net of our hedging activities, reflecting our strong execution through the third quarter. And despite challenging foreign exchange dynamics, we're updating our 2022 revenue guidance range to $26.0 billion to $26.3 billion. We are updating our non-GAAP EPS range to $17.25 to $17.85. This range encompasses both FX headwinds of approximately 3% or $0.45 for the full year based on recent FX rates and costs associated with our acquisition of ChemoCentryx incurred between closing and year-end. I'll share a few additional points to consider for the remainder of 2022 with a particular focus on how these trends are likely to impact Q4. We expect FX headwinds to reduce product sales in Q4 by about $165 million. The U.S. government has agreed to purchase $290 million of Nplate. We will recognize about $200 million of those sales in Q4 with the remainder in 2023. We have completed the previously discussed divestiture of Gensenta, our generics business, in Turkey and will no longer recognize product sales and operating expenses from that business effective November 2, 2022. Sales of that business annualized at approximately $90 million. We now expect full year other revenue for 2022 between $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion versus our prior guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. When comparing against our recast 2021 results, we continue to expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to reflect a low double-digit decrease year-over-year. We continue to expect 2022 non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% as a percentage of product sales. We now expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2022 to decrease 5% to 8% year-over-year compared to our recast 2021 non-GAAP R&D expenses, which include the $400 million upfront payment we discussed above. We expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to be roughly flat year-over-year as a percentage of product sales. We expect OI&E to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion with fourth quarter results closer to the first and second quarter results. For the full year, we now anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate range of 13.5% to 14.5%, down from our prior guidance of 14.0% to 15.0%. As you consider your modeling for 2023, recall that tax law changes enacted by Puerto Rico in June of 2022 that replaced the Puerto Rico excise tax, the PRET, in favor of an income tax will increase our 2023 income tax expense while reducing by roughly an equivalent amount of cost of goods sold. Note, however, there will be a onetime residual negative impact in 2023 related to the amount of the PRET currently capitalized in inventory that will be charged to cost of goods sold without a corresponding tax benefit. This charge is slightly larger than the benefit previously recognized with the implementation of the PRET in 2011, which was discussed in our 2011 Form 10-K. Summing up, since the business review in February, much has changed at the macro level with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, persistently high inflation, higher interest rates and the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act. Despite these headwinds, we have executed well in 2022. As we plan for 2023, we anticipate that these headwinds will continue. We're adapting our operating plans and expect to successfully execute against them. Like previous years, we expect to provide 2023 guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen remains strong. I thank our millions of patients for their courage and my 25,000 colleagues for their mission-driven work on behalf of those patients every day. This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Murdo."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Bob Bradway",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, all of you, for joining our call. In the face of both macroeconomic and industry-specific challenges, Amgen remains laser-focused on delivering for patients and shareholders. Benefit of that focus was evident in the third quarter with volumes up a healthy 8% and 16% outside the United States. These results reflect the strong underlying demand for our medicines and the value they bring to patients even in challenging economic times like those prevailing at the moment. Revenues for the quarter were down 1%, reflecting a 5% net price decline consistent with what we communicated earlier in the year and a 2% impact from foreign exchange. All told, 11 of our products generated record sales in the quarter, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased 15% with free cash flows reaching $2.8 billion for the quarter. Looking forward, we remain focused on several growth drivers. With the recent closing of the ChemoCentryx acquisition, we're excited to have TAVNEOS in our portfolio. TAVNEOS is the first new treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis in more than 10 years, and we're confident that we can leverage our decades of experience in inflammation and nephrology to bring this innovative medicine to many more patients moving forward. Two recently launched products, TEZSPIRE and LUMAKRAS, are off to solid starts. TEZSPIRE is performing well in asthma, and we have studies underway for several other indications for that product as well. LUMAKRAS is performing well globally with patients, payers and prescribers recognizing the importance of this innovation. With combination studies underway, we're exploring the many different ways this product may benefit patients through time. We have a number of key products led by Repatha, Otezla, Prolia and EVENITY that we know can benefit millions more patients globally than they do today. And let's not lose sight of the fact that these 4 products collectively generated $2 billion in third quarter sales with volume growth of 17%. We've built an industry-leading biosimilars business, having now launched five products in markets around the world, and we're months away from being the first company to launch a biosimilar to HUMIRA in the U.S. AMGEVITA is already the most prescribed HUMIRA biosimilar in Europe, giving us confidence as we prepare to enter the U.S. market. Looking forward, our next wave of biosimilars to STELARA, SOLIRIS and EYLEA are well positioned with our having now successfully completed Phase III trials for all three of these molecules. We have many potential new medicines advancing through our innovative pipeline, including Olpasiran, tarlatamab, rocatinlimab, bemarituzumab and AMG 133. These five molecules and several others that you'll hear about shortly from Dave Reese are vintage Amgen, which is first-in-class medicines that make a big difference for patients suffering from serious diseases for which there remains a real need for new and better treatments. Finally, we have a highly engaged and committed workforce, and I want to thank them, as always, for their great work. With that, let me turn over to our CFO, Peter Griffith. Okay. Thank you, David. And Jason, why don't we now open the line up for questions. If you would remind our callers of the procedure, we can get started. Dave, why don't you take that question? Do you want to - yes, jump in. And Jay, let me just add, don't forget, we've - in the slides that we shared with you tefan [ph] we have the outside U.S. data available for you on all the different products. You'll see the current contribution from the international business there. Okay. Well, again, let me thank all of you for joining our call. We appreciate your interest in Amgen. And let me just end by saying that we remain focused on ending the year strong and positioning ourselves for a good '23 and beyond.

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. We saw strong volume growth in the third quarter with an 8% increase year-on-year. We delivered record quarterly sales for 11 products, including EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, AMGEVITA, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO; and double-digit volume growth for several additional products, including Repatha and LUMAKRAS. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, third quarter global product sales grew 1% as our volume increases were offset by a 5% decline in net selling price, consistent with our prior estimates. Including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact, product sales declined 1% year-over-year. I'll start now with our general medicine business, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig. Overall revenue for this portfolio grew 14% year-over-year driven by 20% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 7% year-over-year driven by 8% volume growth. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $201 million for the quarter driven by 45% volume growth in the U.S. and 30% volume growth outside of the U.S. Repatha sales increased 14% year-over-year driven by 52% volume growth, which was partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., we generated 32% volume growth aided by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. We also saw declining net selling prices in the U.S. as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect less year-over-year U.S. price erosion than we saw in 2022. Outside the U.S., sales of Repatha grew 26% driven by 73% volume growth. Net price declines outside the U.S. were primarily a result of Repatha's inclusion on China's National Reimbursement Drug List as of January 1, 2022. Overall, we remain focused on addressing leading cause of morbidity and mortality by bringing Repatha to patients in need all around the world. Moving to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla sales increased 3% year-over-year for the quarter. Otezla saw 9% volume growth, partially offset by lower inventory and unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In the U.S., Otezla remains the leader in bio-naive psoriasis patient share, and we see broader adoption of Otezla among patients with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Looking forward, we expect continued strong volume growth given Otezla's established safety profile, strong payer coverage and unique position as the only systemic oral that can treat a broad spectrum of patients with psoriasis regardless of the severity of their disease. ENBREL sales decreased 14% year-over-year for the third quarter driven by lower net selling price, unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and a 3% decline in volume. ENBREL remains an important product for patients due to its long track record of efficacy and safety. I'm very pleased with our strong U.S. launch of TEZSPIRE, which generated $55 million of sales in the third quarter. Allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed TEZSPIRE across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation in both biologic-naive and previously treated patients. Physicians acknowledge TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled without requiring any phenotypic and biomarker testing. We recently completed our acquisition of ChemoCentryx, which adds TAVNEOS to our portfolio. TAVNEOS recently launched as a first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis, or AAV. This is a serious systemic autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation and eventual destruction of small blood vessels. This inflammatory disease can lead to permanent organ damage and, in some severe cases, can be life-threatening. TAVNEOS represents a significant advance in treatment for the 8,000 to 10,000 U.S. patients a year who develop severe active disease or experience major relapses of AAV. AAV is often managed by rheumatologists and nephrologists, where Amgen has a strong market presence and successful track record. We look forward to applying our deep expertise and inflammation experience to help many more patients manage AAV with TAVNEOS. Moving to our hematology and oncology business. Our 6 innovative products grew 8% year-over-year with 10% volume growth. For Vectibix and Nplate, strong volume growth in the quarter benefited from timing of shipments to our partners in Japan. Our launch of LUMAKRAS is progressing well with revenues of $75 million in the third quarter. Quarter-over-quarter sales declined 3% driven by lower net selling price due to a $12 million unfavorable price adjustment resulting from our reimbursement approval in Germany. This was partially offset by 15% volume growth. In the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to over 3,700 patients by over 2,200 clinicians in both academic and community settings. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 45 countries. We've launched in 30 markets and are rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining markets. As we've noted before, near term, the market for LUMAKRAS is focused on the 7,000 U.S. and 20,000 ex U.S. patients in the second-line setting. Longer term, we expect LUMAKRAS growth to come from earlier-line therapy and the potential of LUMAKRAS to treat other tumor types. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 25% year-over-year. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines driven by increased competition. The most recently published average selling price for MVASI in the U.S. declined 37% year-over-year and for KANJINTI declined 38% year-over-year. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. We're preparing ourselves for the upcoming launch of AMGEVITA, our HUMIRA biosimilar, in the U.S. in early 2023, followed by the next wave of biosimilar launches to STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS. Overall, I'm very pleased with our execution in the quarter. Our international presence and diverse portfolio of products position us well to deliver on the execution of our long-term growth strategy. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave. Thank you, Matthew. It's Murdo. We're obviously excited about the opportunity to launch the first biosimilar to HUMIRA. And so we are active in our discussions with payers and PBMs for that. We are not seeing a massive amount of change to ENBREL's access going forward, and we continue to believe we've got good regard on the payers and PBMs for the efficacy and the safety of ENBREL. And if there were to be a change in ENBREL pricing, it would be for volume gains. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're declining in volumes about 3% year-on-year. Our goal is to maintain that and maybe even improve upon it. But we're not quite finished in the contracting cycle. Thanks, Jay. I think Repatha is a good example of how now with our broadened international presence, we're able to bring new products and new launches to the market fairly quickly. What we're seeing in China is rapid expansion of Repatha. Recall, we were on the market for just over a year prior to securing national reimbursement drug list. So we did establish good understanding education, awareness of Repatha. We were promoting it primarily for percutaneous coronary intervention patients or stent patients, where the unmet need was deemed to be highest amongst the private cash pay patient group. But I think what you're seeing is there's real demand in these markets to help millions of patients who are at very high risk of coronary vascular disease. And so we're continuing to build out our business in Japan and China. We had good volume growth in Europe. And obviously, we also had good volume growth in the U.S. So we're excited about the evolution of Repatha, and we continue to feel good about how that product will drive volume and revenue growth for us in the future. With respect to other launches, the other good example that we're seeing is just the LUMAKRAS launch given that we've got approval in roughly 40 markets, we've got reimbursement in roughly 30 markets, and we're pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. Our teams -- our oncology teams around the world doing a very nice job of identifying KRAS G12C second-line patients and making sure that they have LUMAKRAS as a treatment option. So I'm really pleased that the international presence we've been building for many years now is in full place, is functioning at a high level and delivering strong volume growth. Going forward, we have some partner products where we don't necessarily have the launches in every country where we have our partners to do that. But wherever Amgen has the global responsibility and rights for products, we're feeling very good about our potential and ability to launch them globally. Thanks for the question, Charlie. We're obviously pleased with the successful data readouts on those products and some that have been filed. We expect to be in the first wave of those biosimilar launches, and we're not disclosing specific launch timing on those products. Thanks for the question, Mohit. I think what's important to remember when you're thinking at least about U.S. biosimilars is products in the buy and bill or medical benefit side will continue to see price declines over time because of the way in which the average selling price calculation works. Products on the pharmacy benefit side, so think Medicare Part D products or commercial-insured retail pharmacy products, they are likely to have slower declines in the slope of their net price over time. Now both of those conditions depend on how many competitors for each molecule. So everyone is a little bit different. But I would hesitate to put a time frame on the class of products. I think you need to look at each one of the molecules. One thing I will say is we've been very clear on where we're going to get growth in our biosimilars portfolio, and that's by launching successive new biosimilars on top of our continuing base of business. Outside the U.S., biosimilar pricing tends to come down fairly rapidly and then can hold in some of the larger, what we call retail markets. In markets where it's a heavy tender business, prices will continue to decline as long as there are competitors in the market. Yes. Yaron, we continue to want to be able to have a full complement of competitive biosimilar products that compete effectively with their innovative parent products. And we've, I think, done that very successfully, thanks to the talented team in our formulation and process development organization. So we feel confident that we'll be able to bring various concentrations across the portfolio as needed. So we're working on that one. Yes. Thanks again for the question. Maybe take the second part first. We haven't made any statements about when we will launch our biosimilar to STELARA, but we're pleased that we've got strong data in hand, and we're pleased that we've got the strength of the Amgen manufacturing network and commercial organization ready to go. And we'll track that space closely. We expect to be in the first wave of launches on STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS, the next wave of new biosimilar launches. And we expect to be in the market in early Feb in the new year with AMGEVITA. The interchangeability stat is an interesting one. I think over time, that may grow in importance. But being first with AMGEVITA, we understand it to be of lower priority from payers and PBMs. But we do expect to have interchangeability in a relevant time frame for when the other biosimilar entrants to HUMIRA come into the market. Yes. Robyn, thanks for the opportunity to clarify. I didn't say that we don't expect continued price declines on ENBREL. I said we don't expect the current price declines to be dramatically different going into next year. So we do expect to continue to concede price on ENBREL as the category is quite competitive, but we don't see the slope of that changing dramatically. And ENBREL is used across a broad range of patient types in rheumatoid arthritis as well as in psoriatic arthritis. I think what we see is we see a lot of frontline usage still, and we do see some post-TNF frontline usage. So I think that will continue. Not every patient is going to respond to TNF inhibitor, and many clinicians prefer the well-demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of ENBREL, and we think that will continue despite biosimilar options in the market. So that hopefully clarifies your question. Yes. Thanks, Tim, for the question. As I mentioned before, you do have to look at each product slightly individually in the circumstances that would generate or drive uptick. If we go back to the oncology biosimilars, we had an assumption at the beginning of those products that patients may not get switched on the maintenance phase of their treatment, so mid-cycle or mid-course of treatment. And what we saw, at least in the buy-and-bill space, for both MVASI and KANJINTI that -- was that oncologists were comfortable with the quality of the Amgen biosimilars and by the fact that they had access to our medical teams and our salespeople who are out there calling on them to help them understand the data behind our biosimilars. And so we did see mid-course of treatment switching to our biosimilars. So I think the threshold for what we thought would be a hesitancy on the part of the subscriber was different. And I think that we're looking closely at both SOLIRIS prescribers and EYLEA prescribers. And we've done some in-market research with both customer types, and we feel good about our opportunity to create value for the health care system by offering biosimilar alternatives to those 2 branded products. And we feel good about our chances of having a decent uptake on both."

            "content": "Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by welcoming our new colleagues from ChemoCentryx. We're excited that you're now part of Amgen. For research and development, the third quarter was one of continued execution where we presented new data on several programs and continued to progress our innovative clinical pipeline. Beginning with general medicine. This coming weekend at the American Heart Association meeting, we plan to present data from a Phase II study of Olpasiran, a lipoprotein little a targeting small interfering RNA molecule in subjects with elevated Lp little a. We also plan to present additional data from the Repatha FOURIER and Repatha open-label extension studies highlighting the association between the significant and sustained achievement of low and very low LDL cholesterol levels and lower rates of major cardiovascular events. Data from the single- and multiple-dose cohorts of the Phase I study of AMG 133, a multispecific that inhibits the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor, or GIPR, and activates the GLP-1 receptor, will be presented at the 20th World Congress on Insulin Resistance, Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Hybrid Conference in December. As a reminder, the unique aspect of AMG 133 is the inhibition of GIPR, an innovative approach that we chose to take based on human genetic data that suggest decreased expression of GIPR leads to lower body mass index and lower weight. We look forward to discussing the Repatha and Olpasiran data along with an update on AMG 133 at our investor call scheduled for Monday, November 7. Turning to inflammation. In September, we presented data from the Phase III SPROUT trial, where Otezla treatment resulted in significant improvement in measures of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis at week 16 compared to placebo in children's ages 6 to 17. We also presented data from the Otezla Phase III DISCRETE trial, where 16-week data demonstrated statistically significant improvements in genital psoriasis, including skin, itch and quality of life in patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Based on these results, discussion of the FDA is ongoing for DISCRETE to add clinical data to the U.S. prescribing information, and discussions with regulatory authorities globally for SPROUT are forthcoming. In September, TEZSPIRE was approved in the European Union and in Japan, and regulatory reviews continue in other jurisdictions. In oncology, we presented data from tarlatamab, a DLL3-targeting BiTE molecule being studying in patients with small cell lung cancer. These data demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity with notable response durability and survival. In this setting, tarlatamab delivered a confirmed overall response rate of 23%, a median duration of response of 13 months and a median overall survival of 13.2 months. We continue to enroll patients in a potentially registrational Phase II study in this setting. We're also investigating tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line small cell lung cancer in combination with AMG 404, a PD-1 inhibitor, in patients with second-line or later small cell lung cancer and in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. In August, we presented data from our LUMAKRAS checkpoint inhibitor and SHIP2 combination studies. Based on these data, we continue to explore LUMAKRAS in both settings. In September, we presented data on LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix, where this combination demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety in patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Phase III trial continues to enroll using this combination. We also presented data from the global Phase III CodeBreaK 200 confirmatory trial, where LUMAKRAS treatment led to increased progression-free survival and a significantly higher objective response rate in patients with KRAS G12C mutated non-small cell lung cancer compared with docetaxel. Patient-reported outcomes were also improved with LUMAKRAS versus docetaxel. We've just received initial top line data from a post-marketing requirement study comparing the 960-milligram daily dose of LUMAKRAS with a lower dose of 240 milligrams daily in patients with KRAS G12C-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Following discussions with regulators, we are planning to submit data from this study along with CodeBreaK 200 confirmatory Phase III data. As a reminder, we are investigating multiple potential to pass the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with LUMAKRAS, potentially segmented by PD-L1 expression levels, where the non-small cell lung cancer population breaks down into roughly 1/3 across PD-L1 high expressers, intermediate or low expressers, and PD-L1-negative expression. We've seen promising early data in the PD-L1-negative population and are planning to initiate a Phase III study of LUMAKRAS plus chemotherapy in first-line advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that the primary analysis of a Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 938, an investigational biosimilar to EYLEA compared with EYLEA, met its primary end point in subjects with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. With these data and previously announced Phase III data from our biosimilar candidates to SOLIRIS and STELARA, we have completed our goal of delivering positive Phase III data from 3 biosimilars in 2022. In conclusion, with an innovative portfolio or approximately 3/4 of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential and a growing portfolio of biosimilars, we are well positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients and growth for shareholders over the near and long term. I'll now turn it back to Bob. Yes. Thanks, Salveen. We know there's a lot of interest in this program. And as we mentioned, we'll be showing the data in full in the first week of December at the hybrid conference. Obesity is a large, very heterogeneous disease. It's a global public health problem. The things that I would look for in evaluating this molecule going forward will be the dosing; dosing interval; what are the kinetics of weight loss; how rapid is that weight loss; what is sustainability. And then finally, the overall tolerability. We do plan on using our extensive capabilities in human data to help shape our thinking and guide this development program as we move forward. Yes. We'll get back to you on the latter half of that question. I'll remember off the top of my head, Umer, what that is. But we're going to have -- in a month, you'll have the full data set with all of the cohorts broken out. So I think, at that point, it will be very clear. In terms of thresholds, as I discussed a short while ago, there are many potential avenues to differentiation here. Of course, degree of weight loss is one of them; but also dosing interval; what the kinetics are; importantly, durability; importantly, tolerability, since a fair number of patients transition off of these agents for tolerability. So those are the sorts of things that we'll be taking a look at as we assess whether we've got a differentiated product and it's worth our scale investment. Yes. No, I don't believe we announced we had started Phase II, Mike, but rather that we're in planning. We do expect to initiating the Phase II trial in the relative near term. And once that gets launched, of course, we'll talk about design and give guidance in terms of expected data availability. I wouldn't over think the GLP-1 component, and I'm not sure that's on point. I think, again, when we share the data in a month, you'll get a look at that. Yes. Thanks, Evan. Look, we understand there's a lot of interest in the dose comparison data. We're just getting the top line results to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. So it's premature to share these data prior to their review and the appropriate conversations. In regards to the combination trial, I believe you're referring to with checkpoint inhibitors, we're doing a lower dose lead-in, as I've mentioned before, and then layering on top of that dosing the checkpoint inhibitors. So they are then given concurrently going forward. Yes. Let me take the first part on 133. It's -- as I said, it's a multispecific or bifunctional molecule, meaning it's got an antibody component that inhibits the GIPR receptor. And then there's a component that agonizes GLP-1. So as you noted, you can expect antibody-like pharmacokinetics, and we'll be sharing all of that in a month. But that's what will drive the dosing interval. On 938, let me ask Murdo to comment briefly on that. Yes. Thanks for the question. The -- I think -- let me start with, again, the disease itself, obesity, which is a very heterogeneous disease. Obviously, it's one of the major public health problems globally right now. Our belief is that there are a number of diseases tucked within the label of obesity. Some patients have primarily cardiovascular manifestations; others, type 2 diabetes; others, mechanical problems. And so as I noted, we will be using our human data capabilities to further understand and potentially segment these populations to determine if there can be a particular benefit in subsegments of patients. And then I would just remind you of the things that we'll look for in this program as we go forward to see whether we have a differentiated molecule or not, dosing; again, the kinetics, in particular, pidity [ph] and sustainability of weight loss; and then overall tolerability. Those are the things that we'll be looking at as we take a look at Phase II data and determine as the field unfolds where we go from there. Yes. Thanks, Carter. That's a question we'll address it as we go forward. But I don't feel that it's essential that this be a diabetes medication. As I said, this is -- obesity powers a large number of diseases, and we're going to guide our development to where we think we get the most effect size. Yes. No, in terms of the combination, SHIP2 checkpoint inhibitor combinations, we're enrolling Phase II trial now with the SHIP2 combination that will guide our development. That's a combination that could potentially be applied regardless of PD-L1 expression levels. And then as I mentioned, we are exploring in the PD-L1-positive population a low-dose run-in of LUMAKRAS then followed by layering on of the checkpoint inhibitor. And as those trials enroll, I'll provide guidance in terms of when we have data readouts. And those data will determine how we think about the first-line population. Finally, let me remind everyone again that in the PD-L1-negative population, we're going to be looking at a chemotherapy plus LUMAKRAS combination."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\nArvind Sood: Okay, Jason, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody and welcome to our Q2 call. Lots to cover today so we'll go and jump right in. Some of the key themes you'll hear about today include continued volume driven growth, our strategy of seeking both internal and external innovation, the latter exemplified by our announcement this morning of acquiring ChemoCentryx and lastly navigating through a difficult macro environment. We have posted the slides for your background, we will use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation today, and some of the statements will be forward-looking. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob?\nBob Bradway: Okay. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, we'll be discussing our second quarter performance, as well as our planned acquisition of ChemoCentryx which all of us here are very excited about. Starting with our operating results, we delivered strong volume driven growth in the second quarter, with unit volumes increasing 10%. Our innovative products performed well globally. Repatha, Otezla, Prolia and EVENITY, all delivered double-digit sales growth in the quarter. Our KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO in our innovative hematology oncology portfolio, all generated record quarterly sales. Our two newest products LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE are both off to a strong start. LUMAKRAS is now being prescribed for patients with non-small cell lung cancer in 25 countries around the world. TEZSPIRE has made a big impact in a short period of time for a broad population of patients with severe asthma in the U.S. With our planned acquisition of ChemoCentryx, we will be adding another newly launched innovative product to our portfolio, TAVNEOS, which is for ANCA-associated vasculitis which is a serious and sometimes life threatening autoimmune disease. TAVNEOS is a terrific medicine, the first innovation in this space in more than 10 years and very much needed given the harsh side effects of the older treatments and the seriousness of the disease. This product also fits right in Amgen's strategic sweet spot. Our decades of leadership in immunology and nephrology will enable us to add value to the TAVNEOS launch, reaching many more patients and much more quickly than would otherwise have been possible. You'll hear from Murdo in a moment, but let me just say that opportunities like this don't come along that often. We're really looking forward to working with the highly skilled and committed team from ChemoCentryx to realize the full potential of this very innovative product. We think we can make a difference for patients and own an attractive return for our shareholders from this investment. Dave will talk about the pipeline shortly and our innovative and biosimilar molecules are proceeding well through the pipeline and the highlights of course include the really encouraging data for our cardiovascular molecule Olpasiran which we expect to move into Phase 3 testing. On the oncology side, data from our BiTEs or bi-specifics in several solid tumors are giving us growing confidence in the role these molecules can play in diseases where there are still really big unmet medical needs like small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer. Across the board our biosimilars are advancing to plan setting us up for the growth of that business from future launches. Let me now turn to the current drug pricing debate in Washington. By now it won't surprise you to hear that we're disappointed by the proposed legislation. For some time, we've been advocating for reforms that respect innovation and provide improved access to it. The proposed bill does neither. The bill will impose price controls and price controls will stymie innovation. At a time when our nation needs more innovation, the result of this bill will be less of it adding to the problem to bill those precious little to improve the affordability of medicines for patients. So, when it comes to innovation and affordability, this bill is a little lose for patients. Recent developments are no surprise however, we've been positioning our business for some time for a world of compressed lifecycles and prices and if adopted this legislation will accelerate those trends and we will adapt accordingly. We continue to believe that the world needs more innovation, not less and our focus will remain on advancing more of it. Across inflammation, oncology and general medicine, we have a broad portfolio of innovative and biosimilar products meeting the needs of patients globally and we remain encouraged by the prospects for our long-term growth. Through the first half of the year, our team performed well meeting the needs of the patients we serve. I'm grateful to them for their dedication to our mission. And let me turn now over to Peter.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Bob. The CFO organization welcomes ChemoCentryx to Amgen and we're excited to help enable the teams to serve patients. We are pleased with our performance this quarter and we're on track to deliver against our long-term objectives. We continue to see the company successfully navigate through foreign exchange headwinds, increasing interest rates, inflation, supply chain pressures and the war in Europe all while working through COVID variants surges. We're grateful for the hard work of our 24,000 mission-driven colleagues at Amgen and serving our millions of patients around the globe. I will present our second quarter financial results before discussing our 2022 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 6 of the slide deck. We effectively executed in the second quarter with year-over-year volume driven revenue growth of one percent and product sales growth of three percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenue growth and product sales growth for three percent and five percent respectively. Our EPS growth of a 163% versus our recast Q2, 2021. It's favorably impacted by the $1.5 billion Five Prime In-process R&D expense in 2021, excluding the $1.5 billion charge for Five Prime, Non-GAAP EPS grew six percent. Turning to product sales. Strong volume growth of 10% was driven by Repatha, Prolia, LUMAKRAS and EVENITY, as well as a number of other products in the portfolio. Year-over-year volume growth was partially offset by declines in net selling price of six percent and foreign exchange headwinds of two percent. Our established product portfolio generated almost one billion dollars of product sales and continues to deliver strong cash flows to fund internal and external innovation, just like the ChemoCentryx deal today. Transitioning to our biosimilars, AMGEVITA remains the most prescribed adalimumab biosimilar in Europe and we are preparing and excited for the U.S. launch of this product in January 2023. Other revenues of about $300 million decreased 24% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 antibody collaboration revenues versus Q2, 2021. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased year-over-year, driven primarily by the $1.5 billion Five Prime related expense in 2021 that I previously mentioned. Recall from our Q1 discussion that we've updated our non-GAAP policy to no longer exclude such expenses from our non-GAAP results in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC this year. For comparison purposes, our 2021 non-GAAP operating expenses will now include two items that were previously excluded. First, the $1.5 billion recorded in Acquired In-Process R&D associated with Five Prime in Q2, 2021, and next secondly, And next, secondly $400 million recorded in R&D related to an upfront payment to license rights to AMG 451 from Kyowa Kirin Corporation in Q3, 2021. Excluding the impact of the Five Prime in-process R&D, $1.5 billion charge in Q2, '21, second quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses declined five percent year-over-year, reflecting continuous improvement driven by digitalization, process simplification and automation, which more than offset investments to advance our pipeline and support product launches on a non-GAAP basis cost of sales as a percent of product sales decreased 2.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 14.7%, primarily due to lower COVID-19 antibody shipments and direct manufacturing costs, partially offset by evolving product mix. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the second quarter decreased two percent year-over-year, primarily due to lower marketed product support, partially offset by higher spend in research and early pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the second quarter declined two percent year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments and activities while driving productivity. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were a net $410 million expense in Q2. This was driven by net interest expense and our share of BeiGene results as a result of our use of the equity method of accounting. We have a strong balance sheet, generates significant cash flow and retain significant financial flexibility to execute strategic business development opportunities. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, today's announcement of the acquisition of ChemoCentryx is a great example of investing in the best innovation, whether internal or external. Second, investing in our business through capital expenditures including for our new environmentally friendly facilities under construction in Ohio and North Carolina. Third, returning capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including a $1.94 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from last year's quarter. And fourth, opportunistic share repurchases and while we had no share buybacks in the second quarter, Q1, 2022 at $6.3 billion. Let's turn to the outlook for the business for 2022. We are pleased with our progress through the first half of 2022 and we continue to be confident in the trajectories of our growth brands. For the full year, we now expect to absorb $500 million in foreign exchange headwinds against product sales based on recent foreign exchange rates, of which we absorb $200 million in the first half of the year, reflecting our effective execution today while considering the challenging foreign exchange dynamics, we are narrowing our 2022 revenue guidance range to $25.5 billion to $26.4 billion. Our non-GAAP EPS range of $17 to $18 remains unchanged. This range encompasses foreign exchange headwinds of approximately three percent or $0.45 for the full year based on recent foreign exchange rates. Of that $0.45 we experienced approximately $0.20 in the first half of the year. So we anticipate an additional $0.25 in foreign exchange headwinds against EPS in the second half of the year. Our non-GAAP EPS range also encompasses cost associated with our acquisition of ChemoCentryx, both foreign exchange and ChemoCentryx will influence our performance within the range. I'll share a few additional points to consider for the remainder of 2022 with a particular focus on how these trends are likely to impact Q3 and Q4. First, we expect foreign exchange headwinds against product sales in Q3 and Q4 of approximately a $50 million in each quarter for a total of $300 million for the second half of the year. These headwinds are most pronounced in brands with significant ex-U.S. scale such as Prolia, Aranesp, AMGEVITA, Vectibix and XGEVA. Second, anticipated negative pricing trends for MVASI and KANJINTI are expected to continue in the second half of the year and we expect quarter over quarter product sales declines in those products for the remainder of the year. We expect KANJINTI sales for the year of roughly $300 million and MVASI sales for the year of roughly $850 million. As we've noted, growth in Biosimilars will be driven by the addition of new products and geographies and we look forward to being the first Biosimilar, the HUMIRA to launch in the United States with Amgevita in January, 2023. Third, we expect Q3 Enbrel product sales to approximate Q2 Enbrel product sales. Fourth, for the full year, we now expect Neulasta product sales to be between $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. This is a change from our previous range of $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. We expect a negative pricing trends for Neulasta will continue in the second half of the year. Fifth, although we expect that net impact of these factors will result in Q3 revenues and EPS lower than Q2. I would reiterate that our full year EPS guidance remains unchanged at $17 to $18. We now expect other revenue for 2022 to be in the range of $1.4 to $1.6 billion versus our prior range of $1.4 to $1.7 billion. Our expectations for total non-GAAP operating expenses for 2022 are unchanged from the last time we spoke. We continue to expect that operating expenses will increase in the second half of the year versus the first half of this year, including important investments in our pipeline as well as both current and upcoming launches. Again including Amgevita in January, '23 and increasing R&D spend in the third and the fourth quarter. We continue to expect 2022 non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 15.5% to 16.5%. Our expectations for non-GAAP R&D in 2022 remain unchanged. Based on our recast 2021 results which now include $400 million of expense in Q3, related to the license with KKC for AMG 451. Our expected 2022 non-GAAP R&D expense now equates to a decrease of 46% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to be flat to slightly down year-over-year as a percent of product sales. We continue to expect other income and expenses to be in the range of $1.6 to $1.8 billion with an increase in Q3 over the run rate of the first two quarters due to both increasing interest rates, and our share of BeiGene's results. And finally, for the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate range of 14.0% to 15.0%, up from our prior guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. We will effectively execute throughout the remainder of 2022, despite the continuing headwinds we will continue investing in the best innovation. We look forward to the launch of Amgevita in January, '23 driving the launch of the Tezspire and Lumakras progressing our pipeline, successfully integrating ChemoCentryx and delivering on our 2030 objectives. This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Murdo. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Peter. Second quarter product sales increased three percent year-over-year driven by a 10% volume increase. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, global product sales grew five percent, we delivered record quarterly sales for Prolia, EVENITY, AMGEVITA, KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO and delivered double-digit volume growth for several additional products including Repatha and LUMAKRAS. Our ex-U.S. business grew five percent, with volume growth of 20% year-over-year. In addition to the strong second quarter, I'm also personally excited about our announcement to acquire ChemoCentryx and the opportunity to help patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis, a serious and potentially life-threatening autoimmune disease. I'll say more about TAVNEOS as I comment on the performance of our inflammation portfolio. I'll start with our General Medicine business, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig. Overall revenue for this portfolio grew 17% year-over-year driven by 24% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 13% year-over-year. Volumes grew 12%, driven by an increase in both new and repeat patients. EVENITY had record sales of a $191 million for the quarter, driven by 60% volume growth in the U.S. and 37% volume growth outside of the U.S. Enbrel sales decreased eight percent year-over-year for the second quarter, primarily driven by declines in net selling price and volume. Enbrel remains a frequently prescribed therapy due to its long track record of efficacy and safety. Our launch of Tezspire is off to a very strong start with $29 million in sales in the second quarter. I'm encouraged to see that both allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed Tezspire across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation in both biologic naive and previously treated patients. On the access front, Tezspire is a medical benefit product for which we received permanent reimbursement coding as of July 1. Physicians acknowledge Tezspire's unique differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled or biologic eligible without any final phenotypic and biomarker limitation. Now, our agreement to acquire ChemoCentryx brings a compelling opportunity into our leading inflammation and nephrology portfolio with TAVNEOS, a recently launched first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated by Vasculitis or AAV. Let me take a minute to talk about how important I think TAVNEOS will be for patients. AAV is a serious systemic autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation and eventual destruction of small blood vessels. This inflammatory process can lead to permanent organ damage and in some severe cases can be life threatening. TAVNEOS represents a significant advance in the treatment options for the eight to 10,000 U.S. patients a year who develop severe active disease or experience major relapses of AAV. We are looking forward to meeting and working with the talented team at ChemoCentryx and I'm confident that by applying Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence, we can help many more patients with AAV with TAVNEOS. Moving to our hematology and oncology business. Our six innovative products grew 14% year-over-year with 11% volume growth. This was driven by strong volume growth for KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO which we expect to continue throughout this year. XGEVA volume declined two percent in Q1 and was flat year-over-year in Q2. Our launch of LUMAKRAS is progressing well with revenues of $77 million in the second quarter, representing 24% quarter-over-quarter growth. In the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to over 3,000 patients by over 1900 physicians, and we've seen broad adoption in the community setting where the majority of non-small cell lung cancer patients are treated. Unfortunately, while 85% of patients in the U.S. are tested for their KRAS G12C status, only 50% of the time do oncologists have these test results available to support second-line treatment decisions and our teams are removing barriers to ensure that the oncologist is able to review KRAS G12C status when the patient progresses beyond first-line therapy and we've seen that when the KRAS G12C status is known in the second line setting, 85% of patients receive LUMAKRAS. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 40 countries and we're actively launching in 25 markets and rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. Sales of our oncology Biosimilars declined 24% year-over-year, while our biosimilars for inviting KANJINTI both hold leading shares. We expect continued net selling price deterioration and volume declines driven by increased competition. In total, our Biosimilars portfolio has become an industry-leading franchise, which has contributed $5.5 billion of product sales cumulatively. Looking forward, we're excited about the upcoming launch of AMGEVITA in the United States in January of 2023, followed by the next wave of Biosimilar launches to STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS. Overall, I'm very pleased with our execution and volume growth in the quarter. Our expanding international presence and diverse portfolio of products, including the exciting addition of TAVNEOS position us well to deliver on our long-term growth strategy. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.\nDavid Reese: Thanks Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by sharing my excitement for the transaction we announced today. As you've heard ANCA-associated vasculitis is a serious and sometimes life threatening disorder. Having treated these patients personally, I fully appreciate the challenges they face and the benefits of TAVNEOS in addressing the significant unmet need. I look forward to working with the team at ChemoCentryx. For research and development, the second quarter was one of continued execution where we announced new data on several programs and continued to progress, our robust innovative clinical pipeline. Beginning with inflammation, in July TEZSPIRE was recommended for approval in the European Union by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for severe asthma and also approved in Canada. We initiated the SUNRISE Phase 3 study, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of TEZSPIRE in reducing oral corticosteroid use in adults with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma. The ROCKET Phase 3 program evaluating rocatinlimab, an innovative anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis was initiated in June. Following additional discussions with regulators and our partner, we are amending the studies to further improve patient convenience and investigate a range of doses. No safety or efficacy issues have arisen. We continue to remain very excited about the broad potential of this program in atopic dermatitis. In oncology, we will present data from two of our thoracic programs at the upcoming World Conference on Lung Cancer. The first is tarlatamab, the DLL3 targeting HLE BiTE molecule being studied in heavily pretreated patients with small cell lung cancer, a population with few treatment options. In this setting tarlatamab demonstrated promising antitumor activity with notable response durability. We look forward to presenting an updated data set in the World Conference and continue to enroll patients in a potentially registrational Phase 2 trial in this setting. We're also investigating tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line small cell lung cancer in combination with AMG 404, a PD-1 inhibitor in patients with second line or later small cell lung cancer and in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. I'll also present data from our LUMAKRAS checkpoint inhibitor in SHIP2 combination studies. Data from the former are embargoed until August 7. So we can't discuss the results today, but we can say is the PD-1 have been challenging to combined with other targeted agents due to tolerability issues. We will present a comprehensive dataset from this study. As a reminder, we are investigating multiple potential pass to first line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with LUMAKRAS potentially segmented by PD-L1 expression levels where the non-small cell lung cancer population breaks down into roughly thirds across PD-L1 high expressers, low expressers and PD-L1 negative expression. We've seen promising early data in the PD-L1 negative population and based on discussions with regulators, we are planning to initiate a Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS plus chemotherapy in first-line advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. While a smaller dataset, we are very encouraged by both the efficacy and safety of the LUMAKRAS combination with Revolution Medicines SHIP2 inhibitor RMC 4630. In patients without prior KRAS G12C inhibitor treatment, three of four patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received the highest two doses of RMC 4630 in combination with LUMAKRAS at a confirmed partial response and all four had disease control. In gastrointestinal cancer, we are also pleased to announce that data from the full dose expansion Phase 1b study of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in refractory KRAS G12C mutated colorectal cancer were accepted for presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress taking place in September. The final analysis of the FIGHT study Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, controlled trial evaluating Bemarituzumab, a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b FGFR2b targeting monoclonal antibody and modified FOLFOX6 in patients with previously untreated advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer was completed. These results continue to demonstrate the Bemarituzumab plus modified FOLFOX6 improves the clinical outcome of patients with FGFR2b expressing tumors with no new safety concerns. A greater survival benefit was observed with increasing levels of FGFR2b expression. In general Medicine, we announced top line data from a Phase 2 study of Olpasiran, our small interfering RNA targeting Lp(a). These data demonstrated a significant reduction from baseline in Lp(a) of up to or greater than 90% at week 36, the primary endpoint and week 48 at the end of treatment period for the majority of doses, which range from once every 12 weeks to once every 24 weeks in dosing frequency. No new safety concerns were identified during this treatment period. Presentation of these results is expected at a medical congress in the second half of this year. We're very excited about this innovative molecule and are moving to rapidly initiate a Phase 3 outcome study. AMG 133, a multispecific that inhibits the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) and activates the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor, has completed enrollment. We are planning to submit data from the initial cohorts of this Phase 1 study to a medical congress occurring late this year and are actively the Phase 2 program for this molecule. In conclusion, with an innovative portfolio, we're approximately three quarters of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential and a growing portfolio of Biosimilars, we are well positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients and growth for shareholders over the near and long term. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bob for questions and answers.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Dave. Jason, could you remind our callers of the process for asking a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nJay Olson: Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the ChemoCentryx deal, it looks like a really exciting opportunity to treat patients with high unmet medical need in AAV. Can you just talk about the synergies, in particular our revenue synergy potential, and then the strategic fit for ChemoCentryx within your organization? Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Yes. Thanks, Jay. We, as you can tell we're excited about the fit. We expect our teams and implant inflammation and nephrology will be excited to have this product added inside Amgen and in terms of synergies, obviously, it's a very good fit, but we're focused on investing and growing this opportunity, we think we see some opportunities to help the team at ChemoCentryx reach even more patients and they have so far. So our focus will be on that and so I don't think we really have much more to say at this point other than reiterating that we're excited about because it addresses an important need in the marketplace, it makes a big difference for patients who otherwise don't have great alternatives available to them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nChris Raymond: Thanks very much, maybe just on also another question maybe digging in the TAVNEOS and also if I can touch on Bob, your comments on the drug pricing legislation as it relates to this deal. So I think you guys point out having a nephrology and inflam presence is kind of unique for you guys in the commercial side, maybe just give a bit more color how you intend to leverage these two forces in the specific role. So have and then maybe the second part of this drug pricing language there is a decent amount of angst specifically around provisions targeting small molecules and allowing CMS to negotiate and you're nine so ChemoCentryx is predominantly a small molecule company, just maybe square those two issues there, if you will. Thanks.\nBob Bradway: Murdo wanted to start on the first question.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks for the question Chris. We are obviously pleased with the very nice strategic fit of TAVNEOS in our portfolio. The ChemoCentryx's team have been mostly focused on rheumatology and there are sub-specialties of rheumatologists who treat a lot of these AAV patients. So, they've been quite focused in their commercial efforts so far, we can scale that much more broadly, we have a national footprint on rheumatology given our current in-line inflammation business and we can also add nephrology, about a third of these patients end up getting diagnosed by nephrologist given that one of the presentations AAV is renal impairment or a renal inflammation, I should say. So that's the immediate benefit, but we've also got resources like our patient support programing, our medical teams, our institutional key account managers and our ability to work with payers to ensure that medical policies in prior authorizations are seamless for providers and patients. So, there is a lot we can bring to the table beyond just a very focused, but very effective so far ChemoCentryx effort.\nBob Bradway: And with respect to Washington, Chris, obviously we evaluated this in the context of the legislation, the potential legislation that's making its way through the Senate at the moment and well, as you point out, this is a small molecule product, we don't expect that there's any particular risk for this product as compared to other small molecules that could become subject to the price controls implied or pluses in the legislation so again, we think this is an attractive product, the clinical profile looks really well suited to the needs of the marketplace and we're excited to be joining the team with them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSalveen Richter: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up here. I'd like to dig a little deeper into what you said in the prepared remarks about the passage of this legislation, accelerating trend to reposition the business and manage lifecycles. Do you think this increases the urgency for M&A, given your financial strength and if so, what types of targets probably would make sense given the debate about non-orphan products versus orphan products and just a second question here on AMGEVITA being first to market, maybe you can just give us a sense of how that positions you and an early payer discussions here. Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Yes, you will catch the second piece of that Murdo and I'll address the first which is with respect to Washington again Salveen. As you know, this is still potential legislation. So we'll watch carefully to see if it gets passed and it if goes exactly what gets passed. So, I don't think at this point, will say anything more specific than what I said in my opening remarks, which is that we've been advocating for reform that would promote innovation and improve patient access to it and we'll be concerned to the extent of the legislation passes doesn't do those two things.\nMurdo Gordon: And Salveen on AMGEVITA, obviously we're pleased that we're first out of the gate with the AMGEVITA launch in the U.S. at the end of January next year, we were pleased with our performance outside the U.S. with AMGEVITA where we've established market leadership at the higher share and we've been able to hold that despite competition. Obviously, the U.S. market is a different market given payer in reimbursement structure, but we feel confident that we'll be able to establish good access and coverage for AMGEVITA early in the launch lifecycle and we think that PBMs and payers are interested in ensuring their patients and members have biosimilar availability and option. So, all going well and according to plan. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys, I'll ask two today, if I may, one on your deal and one on the quarter. Maybe starting with the quarterly update, I saw your partner as well as your press release talked about the lack of safety issue on the OX40 program. However, the need to perhaps change the dosing regimen. I guess my question is, if there is no safety issues that, is it fair to assume there is a biomarker change maybe a severe TH drop in a subset of patients, which could be prompting this regulatory feedback. And if you could remind us what dose were you currently using every two weeks in Phase 3. And then on ChemoCentryx deal. I think it's an interesting case study on sort of where the clinical data stood versus how good the commercial receptivity has been, but is it fair to assume that you wouldn't have moved forward with the deal, unless they were already yet perhaps 700 plus patients by now and their peak patient guidance was 6,000. Thank you very much.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Dave, do you want to take the first.\nDavid Reese: Yes, thanks Umer. In regards to OX40, yes, no safety issue, no biomarker issue either, no change in any kind of patient subset. As I said in my prepared remarks beginning this is really driven by ongoing discussions with the FDA to explore broader range of doses and we took that opportunity to we think improve patient convenience. I wouldn't overthink it or read anything more into it than that and we don't think that this will affect overall program timelines.\nBob Bradway: I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for in your specific question, but Murdo feel free to jump in.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes, Umer, we've been following the TAVNEOS journey for a while and I think what everybody has to remember here is that the nature of this disease. I mean this is a severe acute autoimmune inflammation that involves the lungs, the kidneys, sometimes skin and other organs and can cause permanent end organ damage if not treated effectively and efficiently and quickly and the current standards of care are difficult treatments for patients to tolerate and if you can intervene and improve that patients potential to remain relapse-free over the first 52 weeks as a rheumatologist or a nephrologist, if you all you have to do is add TAVNEOS to their base regimen, you're going to do that. So I think the behavioral change here is one that many physicians are choosing to do and that as you alluded to, that's been encouraging to see in the early phase of this launch. But the reason we like TAVNEOS is it helps reduce the potential relapse for patients by adding TAVNEOS to the current standard of care and potentially reducing glucocorticoid use. So this is a disease area that if we were doing the development on our own it would fit squarely in our strategy and so it comes in, into a strong inflammation portfolio and it's one that we think our scale and commercial and medical capabilities will allow us to accelerate what has already been a good launch.\nBob Bradway: I'd say Umer that we are obviously attractive the fact and is still at an early stage of its launch. We think we can add value to that and the feedback from the marketplace has been encouraging. The prescriber and patient based marketplace, that is. Okay, let's move on. Next question?\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nMichael Yee: Thanks for the question, now maybe for David. I know the upcoming data you've talked about the challenge in combination with PD-1. So maybe you could just right size your expectations is the bar fairly high there to move forward due to talks. And is your focus on front line really into the combination with chemo. So maybe just make a comment there and if you could just sneak in a second, when you actually talk about AMG 133 on your slide deck, I know there's a lot of focus obviously in obesity. Can you just comment on what we're supposed to know there advancing that forward. Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yes, sure. So in terms of Lumakras PD-1 combination, obviously I can't say much because of the embargo we're presenting these data Sunday afternoon in Vienna. As we think about development in first-line I'd like to think of kind of three buckets of patients are those whose tumors are PD-L1 negative, those who are PD-L1 low to intermediate and those that are PD-L1 high expressers. As I mentioned and as you picked up on in the PD-L1 negative population, we're moving forward with a Lumakras plus chemotherapy Phase 3 trial and then we will disclose the results of the checkpoint inhibitor data in Vienna and outline our plans for further development in this space, I think that's probably all I can say right now, but I would really think about this as different groups of patients where the therapy will be tailored to their particular tumor based on PD-L1 expression. On AMG 133, very pleased with our progress there as I mentioned, we completed enrollment in the Phase 1. We hope to present that we are submitting, in the process of submitting that to a medical congress and we're very actively planning what the Phase 2 program will look like and we'll have more to say about that as our plans are finalized over in the coming months.\nMichael Yee: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Bob, If I could just ask your sort of outlook on BD and M&A. We see due to modestly sized deals for assets with a bit of a pipeline over the course of the last year. How do you think about continuing to do more deals of that size versus something larger and more transformational and just how do you think about where you are in terms of adding assets versus where you'd like to be?\nBob Bradway: Matt, I don't think anything has changed, we continue to look for ways to invest in the business and our focus is on trying to find the best innovation and to try to advance particularly in the areas where we've been clear about our stated interest. So implant oncology and then the general medicine area. So we continue to look, there are obviously many more opportunities in the small and medium size and there are in the large size. But as I've said consistently through my tenure Matt, we feel responsibility to look at all the options to add value for our shareholders and we'll continue to do that.\nArvind Sood: Jason, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities. Your line is now open.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. So my question is related to understanding interchangeable Biosimilars and there are two parts, please. So first, obviously AMGEVITA is in a great position in the first half of next year, but could you talk about that product's ability to compete with interchangeable Biosimilars that are launching in the second half of '23 since AMGEVITA won't have that designation. And then the other part is news just hit a couple of days ago that the FDA approved Biosimilar Lucentis as interchangeable even though there was never a switching study conducted. So, I'm wondering if that's a sign that your ABP 938 or Biosimilar EYLEA is likely to also be approved as an interchangeable. Thank you.\nArvind Sood: Thanks, David for the question. I would say right now in our conversations with payers and insurers and for that matter, physicians interchangeability has not been a barrier to have them consider AMGEVITA as an option and an alternative to the innovator. We are pursuing interchangeability with AMGEVITA and we'll expect those data to readout later on in the launch. So I think our incumbent position being first to launch will help whether additional competition as they enter if they have interchangeability and our expectation is at least a couple will but we'll follow quickly with our own interchangeability data. So, it will be a short period in time where that competitive advantage may exist or persist in the market. As for ABP 938, I won't speculate on what the FDA might say about that. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMohit Bansal: Great, thanks for taking my question and maybe a question on LUMAKRAS Phase 3 study. So, Dave, what do you think could be clinically meaningful benefit forward docetaxel in this particular study. And the other part of the question is basically if you think about a chemo post-IO chemo tends to do well. Do you think placebo response could be better than historical in this particular trial? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: In terms of the Phase 3 study on track to report out this quarter, it's an event driven trial, if we see behavior of LUMAKRAS consistent with what we've observed really across the program to date in advanced lung cancer, I think we will be well positioned there. The trial has 90% power to detect a significant difference in progression-free survival. So, it's very well powered, I'm sure it will be a well conducted study and so we look forward to having those data soon. In terms of the placebo response, that I think it's hard to speculate on that. The trial that we are conducting in the PD-L1 negatives as chemotherapy plus LUMAKRAS against what would be considered a standard therapy arm where the addition of checkpoint inhibitors has a relatively modest additive benefit. So, based on preliminary data that we've seen, looking at LUMAKRAS in combination with chemotherapy as what's given us the confidence to move into Phase 3 and we've had productive discussions with regulators about that trial design.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Thanks so much for the question. I had one on LUMAKRAS, I guess Murdo for you. Commercially, when you look at the U.S. trends over the past say three quarters or so, maybe just help us with kind of are you reaching peak sort of saturation for G12C testing? How do you think about that in terms of the timing of getting to that same level outside the U.S. and then maybe, lot of people have asked about kind of the, the Phase 3 combo studies, but maybe if there is a, at a high level kind of an incremental opportunity that you would envision as you look to the combination study data. Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes, thanks for the question, Geoff. I would say it's less about peak testing in the U.S. where we've already got about 85% of frontline patients being tested and receiving a KRAS G12C status. Right now what we know is only half of the tested patient population in second line has the test result available when they're progressing. So that's really what we're focused on, we are focused on where is that test result for that progressing patients so that that treating oncologist can give the patient the benefit of LUMAKRAS and when they have that test is again half the time, 85% of those patients get LUMAKRAS. So we're getting a very high percentage penetration of those second line patients when the prescribing physician knows their test results. So, we are not picking yet. We've got headroom for more improvement there, currently about half of those patients are not getting their KRAS G12C test result reviewed upon progression. So that's an important thing that it seems are focused on. That's what we think we can do to continue to drive some revenue growth in the U.S. and outside the U.S., what we're seeing is really again a tale of two types of markets in markets like Germany, Switzerland and France where biomarker testing is very well developed and their clinical information systems are also very well developed, so that test is available and retrievable upon progression in second line. We're seeing very rapid lift and uptake in places where that's not quite as well developed I think Spain, Italy, to some extent, the U.K., the uptake resembles more what we've seen in the U.S.,\nGeoff Meacham: And just clarify. This is in our expanded access programs?\nMurdo Gordon: In our expanded access programs where we've seen clinical utilization, but I'm also talking about other experience with other targeted therapies, you're going to see a slower uptake in some markets than you will in others because of that testing infrastructure. So, we're working on that with those markets, we're changing that behavior with clinicians. And I think we'll be able to successfully grow this product in second line and of course, if we get confirmatory data in Phase 3, what that does is it makes it easier to promote because we're no longer on an accelerated approval and hopefully the datacenter compelling and continue to reinforce the value of LUMAKRAS.\nBob Bradway: Jason, next question?\nOperator: The next question comes from Yaron Werber with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nYaron Werber: Great, thanks for taking my question. David, it's for you with respect to Tavneos, the drug was tested in C3 glomerulopathy and also severe HS hidradenitis suppurativa and that data was a bit mixed. I think they were looking for FDA feedback and C3G and they're are thinking about Lupus Nephritis as well potentially starting another study and you thoughts is that these indications that you were supportive of. Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Hi. thanks, Yaron. Yes. So there are other disorders as you're indicating in which Tavneos has been investigated where activation of this limb of the complement cascade may play a role in the inflammatory disease process such as C3 glomerulopathy and hidradenitis suppurativa, we'll look at all of those data. Look at the programs with our new colleagues from ChemoCentryx and determine what the best path forward is to potentially address again diseases where there's currently very little effective therapy. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nCarter Gould: Great. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. So, I wanted to come to your hemog franchise, you still have BLINCYTO and KYPROLIS but we saw the discontinuation of the latest kind of bite you had in myeloma, Amgen had a multi-year effort to try to extend its myeloma franchise. Is that still where does that rank in terms of priorities and I guess just speaking more broadly what does it say about the sort of the innovation jumps required to compete in hemog going forward. Thank you.\nBob Bradway: We're going to take this in two parts. I think with respect to KYPROLIS obviously we're encouraged by the ongoing performance of that. And more generally to hemog portfolios, you referred to talk about the ongoing successful BLINCYTO again we're very encouraged by what we see and what we think we can continue to do for patients in relapsed-refractory ALL. But I think you also raised an important point, which is that multiple myeloma is a very crowded space and our decision with respect to 701 had a lot to do with our ability to get the market ahead of the competition or not. So, we're prioritizing on those medicines where we think we can be best-in-class and first-in-class and we have other programs underway that may be useful in multiple myeloma and Dave, you want to -- \nDavid Reese: Yes. As an area look we're guided by the science and the biology that we uncover AMG 701 what that was strategic multiple agents targeting BCMA and we chose to focus our efforts on for example tarlatamab DLL3 program where we've got a substantial lead. We've got a molecule that's extremely active, same platform is AMG 701 and so I think you'll see this kind of prioritization going forward.\nArvind Sood: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO. Your line is now open.\nEvan Seigerman: Thank you so much for taking my question and congrats on the deal earlier today, I actually want to touch on your prostate cancer efforts. Can you just walk me through some of the details around do you prioritizing 160 for the lower affinity T cell BiTE and just given the recent data we've seen in this space that may be newer technologies bispecific targeting CD 28 PSMA, how do you think your efforts can remain competitive here? Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Thanks for the question. So it's, we've got now a pair of molecules targeting prostate cancer, actually three if you include neuroendocrine prostate cancer where we're conducting a Tarlatamab study where DLL3 expression is quite frequent in neuroendocrine tumors. But first AMG 509 targeting steep one I continue to be impressed with the data we are generating in that trial and we are moving ahead with all deliberate speed to advance that program. We hope to be able to share data either late this year or sometime into next year from that dose escalation in first in human study and then, as I had indicated, all along we would take a look at the accumulating data from AMG 160 Acapatamab and AMG 340 which came to us through the Teneobio acquisition and based on what we saw, we elected to prioritize AMG 340 targeting PSMA going forward. The data you're alluding to, from a few days ago is a handful of patients some we've seen in the similar things in early phases. I think what you need is more patients and in particular prolonged follow up, especially in this disease and in that regards on the quite encouraged with what I'm seeing from AMG 509 for example. So that portfolio of three medicines is advancing I feel actually on very optimistic about what we may be able to do in prostate cancer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\nMichael Schmidt: Thanks for taking my questions. I had one on Aimovig. Just wondering if you could run market dynamics here just given 11% volume decline, is that a function of competitive dynamics or doesn't have to do with pricing and how should we think about peak potential given those trends? Thank you.\nArvind Sood: Thanks for the question, Michael. I think our focus on Aimovig has been one where we're making sure that we address the patient population patient population in a way in which we provide good access, but at a reasonable in that price and I think strategically, we've been able to do that well, we did lose one major PBM to be at the end of last year into this year and that's affected volume evolution. But we've also been able to improve our net pricing year-on-year. So from a profitability standpoint Aimovig is doing better. I think longer term, it's early in the marketplace CGRP class should be growing faster than it is given that the antibodies are much, much better than what's available in the market and the older non CGRP class and of course we've got the advent of the orals, so it's early days. We're still watching it play out, we continue to focus on promoting for the preventive patients that have high frequency migraine and we continue to do well there. So longer term, I think there's just a lot to wait and see.\nArvind Sood: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Great. I think you. I Just had one question and a follow-up question on the platform. So for OTEZLA, just talk a little bit about, given the lower price topicals and some of the data, new drugs that are going to approved in September, your thoughts on pricing and how we should think about that over the next year or two because I know you need more volume on those new drugs, but they could put some pricing pressure. And then on the BiTE platform in general, just to follow-up to Evan's question, I mean, so at what point do you -- seeing the new BiTE spec data coming out across the board from other companies at the -- from Regeneron as well, like at what point you deprioritize BiTE versus, say, the new bispec that are out there and put the money toward other things? Thanks.\nArvind Sood: So thanks for the question, Robyn. I'll start with the Otezla question on how with the topical entry into the market is affecting our business. I think overall we've been really pleased with the expansion of our own label to include the mild patient population and what I am encouraged by is in our conversations with payers and PBMs, we were able to have that that label expansion include those patients in our current contracted coverage without adding any value to our deals with the payers, so we didn't have to increase our rebate rate to have the myeloma patient population included in fact, what we've seen is more and more PBMs and plans are removing prior authorization requests for Otezla. So, overall, I'd say our access is improving quite a bit without a deterioration in the race having to pay for it, where I think you'll see continued net price pressure is in our co-pay assistance that we provide to patients in affordability. That's really what we see as a dynamic on the net price of Otezla in the U.S. What we're not seeing though is pressure on the net price because of the topical entrants. The challenge with the topical entrants is they don't have broad payer coverage yet and so until that happens, I think Otezla will continue to do well on the, on the access coverage end rate that we pay for it. Longer term, I think, it remains to be seen whether these are in direct competition or complementary to the patient types that we treat if you talk to their dermatologists, patients fall into categories where they don't want to move into a systemic treatment and stay on topicals and those that are willing to try a topical because the body surface area involvement, the location of their psoriasis, many factors come into play, and that's really where we are competing is people who have already decided they want a systemic agent. So I think they're are non-overlapping populations for the most part, and we don't necessarily see with topicals is applying pricing pressure.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Robyn. In regards to the BiTE platform, we've been working for some time on new generation technologies that will incorporate things like logic gates with multiple targets where either an AND gate or an or gate is engineered into the pipe for activation, the real goal here is to do two things, one, try and enhance efficacy, and two increase the therapeutic window so that you have is a little normal tissue-targeting as possible from the agents. So first molecules are moving towards the clinic, and we'll have more to say about that as we get ready to launch.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Jason, I know, we're a little bit past the top of the hour, but we've got a couple more questions in the queue. So why don't we take a couple more and then if we don't get to you Arvind and his team will be around receiving for some time. Could I just go for the next call?\nOperator: Our next question is from Dane Leone with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nDane Leone: Thank you for taking the questions. I just wanted to get a, obviously a focus of everyone of estimating what the real opportunity for Lumakras is in the U.S. here. Could you maybe just define your understanding of patients that might be eligible for LUMAKRAS that are in the current study is the current clinical studies or other patients that might be in assistance co-pay or other schemes where they would be on drug, but just not on commercial paid for drug. I think that would be helpful is again, obviously the run rate as well below what the estimates would be and people are just trying to triangulate over time what the peak sales could really be here in the U.S. Thank you.\nArvind Sood: Yes, Dane. I think I understand your question, but you don't please ask for clarification, if I don't address it that the clinical trial steal rate. If you will, patients who are not in commercial drug treatment, but are enrolled in other clinical trials is relatively small as a percentage of the total second-line non-small cell lung cancer patient. I'd say, less than 10% would be an estimate, it does vary goes up and down depending on the clinical activity of other investigational drugs and trials that are happening as I was answering a question earlier. The major challenge in growing LUMAKRAS in second line is ensuring that the prescribing physician has the KRAS G12C test result available to them when the lung cancer patient is progressing from frontline to second line. That's the gap in the treatment patient journey and right now our estimate is that that happens about 50% of the time and we are working to increase that. When that does occur, when the prescribing physician has the KRAS G12C result 8.5 times at attend that patient gets LUMAKRAS. So, we know that the profile of the product is conducive to that second-line treatment choice. We just, we just have to make sure we close down the administrative challenges of having that test result and patient in second line meet at the same time, we're also driving awareness and usage of our liquid biopsy for retesting and reassessment of that patient as they progress to second line. I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nTim Anderson: Thank you very much. Can I go back to Amgevita and Biosimilars here in the U.S., our sense is that payers may view the imperative of simply being to offer the best priced product to their constituents and I'm wondering whether with enough additional rebate maybe branded HUMIRA ends up being that lowest priced product. So my question, two questions really. Do you agree that the most important driver of what product used prioritize going to be net price or are there other factors at play and then is it in the realm of possibilities that branded HUMIRA ends up being that lowest-priced products? Thank you.\nArvind Sood: Yes, thanks. It's an important driver obviously. Net price is definitely something that the pharmacy benefit managers are focused on as are the upstream insurers, but not the only one. And I think this is where we've been able to successfully differentiate our biosimilars in the past and we are confident we'll be able to do that in a go-forward basis and what I would describe it. I've described this before is that we can go to a pharmacy benefit manager and say we can make the transition from brand HUMIRA to AMGEVITA as seamless as possible. We have field force deployed that call on prescribing rheumatologists and GI physicians to treat these patients. We have patient programs that rival the innovative compound, because we are also in the marketplace with innovative compounds and we've designed these programs over many years. We have patient support to help that patient understand how to administer the product and use their device. We have world-class manufacturing of biologics and sustainability of supply and we have really good additional benefit coming with the interchangeability that I mentioned in progress. So that actually does improve confidence on the part of the PBM and the payer because they don't want to have their patients have a bad experience transitioning from brand to biosimilar. Now is it possible that the biosimilar, the brand retains a substantial share even with biosimilars in the market. Yes, of course that's possible, but we'll wait and see how that plays out. Bob, closing comments?\nBob Bradway: Thank you, Arvind. And again, thank you all for joining our call. We feel that we've been executing well through the first half of the year and we're looking forward to carrying that momentum into the second half of the year and obviously excited about the ChemoCentryx announcements and what that represents the future of our inflam and nephrology franchises as well. So, thanks for joining. We'll look forward to catching up with you after the third quarter.\nArvind Sood: Great, thanks, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes our 2022 Q2 earnings call.

            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. The CFO organization welcomes ChemoCentryx to Amgen and we're excited to help enable the teams to serve patients. We are pleased with our performance this quarter and we're on track to deliver against our long-term objectives. We continue to see the company successfully navigate through foreign exchange headwinds, increasing interest rates, inflation, supply chain pressures and the war in Europe all while working through COVID variants surges. We're grateful for the hard work of our 24,000 mission-driven colleagues at Amgen and serving our millions of patients around the globe. I will present our second quarter financial results before discussing our 2022 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 6 of the slide deck. We effectively executed in the second quarter with year-over-year volume driven revenue growth of one percent and product sales growth of three percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenue growth and product sales growth for three percent and five percent respectively. Our EPS growth of a 163% versus our recast Q2, 2021. It's favorably impacted by the $1.5 billion Five Prime In-process R&D expense in 2021, excluding the $1.5 billion charge for Five Prime, Non-GAAP EPS grew six percent. Turning to product sales. Strong volume growth of 10% was driven by Repatha, Prolia, LUMAKRAS and EVENITY, as well as a number of other products in the portfolio. Year-over-year volume growth was partially offset by declines in net selling price of six percent and foreign exchange headwinds of two percent. Our established product portfolio generated almost one billion dollars of product sales and continues to deliver strong cash flows to fund internal and external innovation, just like the ChemoCentryx deal today. Transitioning to our biosimilars, AMGEVITA remains the most prescribed adalimumab biosimilar in Europe and we are preparing and excited for the U.S. launch of this product in January 2023. Other revenues of about $300 million decreased 24% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower COVID-19 antibody collaboration revenues versus Q2, 2021. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased year-over-year, driven primarily by the $1.5 billion Five Prime related expense in 2021 that I previously mentioned. Recall from our Q1 discussion that we've updated our non-GAAP policy to no longer exclude such expenses from our non-GAAP results in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC this year. For comparison purposes, our 2021 non-GAAP operating expenses will now include two items that were previously excluded. First, the $1.5 billion recorded in Acquired In-Process R&D associated with Five Prime in Q2, 2021, and next secondly, And next, secondly $400 million recorded in R&D related to an upfront payment to license rights to AMG 451 from Kyowa Kirin Corporation in Q3, 2021. Excluding the impact of the Five Prime in-process R&D, $1.5 billion charge in Q2, '21, second quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses declined five percent year-over-year, reflecting continuous improvement driven by digitalization, process simplification and automation, which more than offset investments to advance our pipeline and support product launches on a non-GAAP basis cost of sales as a percent of product sales decreased 2.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 14.7%, primarily due to lower COVID-19 antibody shipments and direct manufacturing costs, partially offset by evolving product mix. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the second quarter decreased two percent year-over-year, primarily due to lower marketed product support, partially offset by higher spend in research and early pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the second quarter declined two percent year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments and activities while driving productivity. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were a net $410 million expense in Q2. This was driven by net interest expense and our share of BeiGene results as a result of our use of the equity method of accounting. We have a strong balance sheet, generates significant cash flow and retain significant financial flexibility to execute strategic business development opportunities. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, today's announcement of the acquisition of ChemoCentryx is a great example of investing in the best innovation, whether internal or external. Second, investing in our business through capital expenditures including for our new environmentally friendly facilities under construction in Ohio and North Carolina. Third, returning capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including a $1.94 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from last year's quarter. And fourth, opportunistic share repurchases and while we had no share buybacks in the second quarter, Q1, 2022 at $6.3 billion. Let's turn to the outlook for the business for 2022. We are pleased with our progress through the first half of 2022 and we continue to be confident in the trajectories of our growth brands. For the full year, we now expect to absorb $500 million in foreign exchange headwinds against product sales based on recent foreign exchange rates, of which we absorb $200 million in the first half of the year, reflecting our effective execution today while considering the challenging foreign exchange dynamics, we are narrowing our 2022 revenue guidance range to $25.5 billion to $26.4 billion. Our non-GAAP EPS range of $17 to $18 remains unchanged. This range encompasses foreign exchange headwinds of approximately three percent or $0.45 for the full year based on recent foreign exchange rates. Of that $0.45 we experienced approximately $0.20 in the first half of the year. So we anticipate an additional $0.25 in foreign exchange headwinds against EPS in the second half of the year. Our non-GAAP EPS range also encompasses cost associated with our acquisition of ChemoCentryx, both foreign exchange and ChemoCentryx will influence our performance within the range. I'll share a few additional points to consider for the remainder of 2022 with a particular focus on how these trends are likely to impact Q3 and Q4. First, we expect foreign exchange headwinds against product sales in Q3 and Q4 of approximately a $50 million in each quarter for a total of $300 million for the second half of the year. These headwinds are most pronounced in brands with significant ex-U.S. scale such as Prolia, Aranesp, AMGEVITA, Vectibix and XGEVA. Second, anticipated negative pricing trends for MVASI and KANJINTI are expected to continue in the second half of the year and we expect quarter over quarter product sales declines in those products for the remainder of the year. We expect KANJINTI sales for the year of roughly $300 million and MVASI sales for the year of roughly $850 million. As we've noted, growth in Biosimilars will be driven by the addition of new products and geographies and we look forward to being the first Biosimilar, the HUMIRA to launch in the United States with Amgevita in January, 2023. Third, we expect Q3 Enbrel product sales to approximate Q2 Enbrel product sales. Fourth, for the full year, we now expect Neulasta product sales to be between $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. This is a change from our previous range of $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion. We expect a negative pricing trends for Neulasta will continue in the second half of the year. Fifth, although we expect that net impact of these factors will result in Q3 revenues and EPS lower than Q2. I would reiterate that our full year EPS guidance remains unchanged at $17 to $18. We now expect other revenue for 2022 to be in the range of $1.4 to $1.6 billion versus our prior range of $1.4 to $1.7 billion. Our expectations for total non-GAAP operating expenses for 2022 are unchanged from the last time we spoke. We continue to expect that operating expenses will increase in the second half of the year versus the first half of this year, including important investments in our pipeline as well as both current and upcoming launches. Again including Amgevita in January, '23 and increasing R&D spend in the third and the fourth quarter. We continue to expect 2022 non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 15.5% to 16.5%. Our expectations for non-GAAP R&D in 2022 remain unchanged. Based on our recast 2021 results which now include $400 million of expense in Q3, related to the license with KKC for AMG 451. Our expected 2022 non-GAAP R&D expense now equates to a decrease of 46% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to be flat to slightly down year-over-year as a percent of product sales. We continue to expect other income and expenses to be in the range of $1.6 to $1.8 billion with an increase in Q3 over the run rate of the first two quarters due to both increasing interest rates, and our share of BeiGene's results. And finally, for the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate range of 14.0% to 15.0%, up from our prior guidance of 13.5% to 14.5%. We will effectively execute throughout the remainder of 2022, despite the continuing headwinds we will continue investing in the best innovation. We look forward to the launch of Amgevita in January, '23 driving the launch of the Tezspire and Lumakras progressing our pipeline, successfully integrating ChemoCentryx and delivering on our 2030 objectives. This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Murdo. Murdo?"

            "name": "Bob Bradway",
            "content": "Okay. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, we'll be discussing our second quarter performance, as well as our planned acquisition of ChemoCentryx which all of us here are very excited about. Starting with our operating results, we delivered strong volume driven growth in the second quarter, with unit volumes increasing 10%. Our innovative products performed well globally. Repatha, Otezla, Prolia and EVENITY, all delivered double-digit sales growth in the quarter. Our KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO in our innovative hematology oncology portfolio, all generated record quarterly sales. Our two newest products LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE are both off to a strong start. LUMAKRAS is now being prescribed for patients with non-small cell lung cancer in 25 countries around the world. TEZSPIRE has made a big impact in a short period of time for a broad population of patients with severe asthma in the U.S. With our planned acquisition of ChemoCentryx, we will be adding another newly launched innovative product to our portfolio, TAVNEOS, which is for ANCA-associated vasculitis which is a serious and sometimes life threatening autoimmune disease. TAVNEOS is a terrific medicine, the first innovation in this space in more than 10 years and very much needed given the harsh side effects of the older treatments and the seriousness of the disease. This product also fits right in Amgen's strategic sweet spot. Our decades of leadership in immunology and nephrology will enable us to add value to the TAVNEOS launch, reaching many more patients and much more quickly than would otherwise have been possible. You'll hear from Murdo in a moment, but let me just say that opportunities like this don't come along that often. We're really looking forward to working with the highly skilled and committed team from ChemoCentryx to realize the full potential of this very innovative product. We think we can make a difference for patients and own an attractive return for our shareholders from this investment. Dave will talk about the pipeline shortly and our innovative and biosimilar molecules are proceeding well through the pipeline and the highlights of course include the really encouraging data for our cardiovascular molecule Olpasiran which we expect to move into Phase 3 testing. On the oncology side, data from our BiTEs or bi-specifics in several solid tumors are giving us growing confidence in the role these molecules can play in diseases where there are still really big unmet medical needs like small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer. Across the board our biosimilars are advancing to plan setting us up for the growth of that business from future launches. Let me now turn to the current drug pricing debate in Washington. By now it won't surprise you to hear that we're disappointed by the proposed legislation. For some time, we've been advocating for reforms that respect innovation and provide improved access to it. The proposed bill does neither. The bill will impose price controls and price controls will stymie innovation. At a time when our nation needs more innovation, the result of this bill will be less of it adding to the problem to bill those precious little to improve the affordability of medicines for patients. So, when it comes to innovation and affordability, this bill is a little lose for patients. Recent developments are no surprise however, we've been positioning our business for some time for a world of compressed lifecycles and prices and if adopted this legislation will accelerate those trends and we will adapt accordingly. We continue to believe that the world needs more innovation, not less and our focus will remain on advancing more of it. Across inflammation, oncology and general medicine, we have a broad portfolio of innovative and biosimilar products meeting the needs of patients globally and we remain encouraged by the prospects for our long-term growth. Through the first half of the year, our team performed well meeting the needs of the patients we serve. I'm grateful to them for their dedication to our mission. And let me turn now over to Peter. Okay. Thank you, Dave. Jason, could you remind our callers of the process for asking a question? Yes. Thanks, Jay. We, as you can tell we're excited about the fit. We expect our teams and implant inflammation and nephrology will be excited to have this product added inside Amgen and in terms of synergies, obviously, it's a very good fit, but we're focused on investing and growing this opportunity, we think we see some opportunities to help the team at ChemoCentryx reach even more patients and they have so far. So our focus will be on that and so I don't think we really have much more to say at this point other than reiterating that we're excited about because it addresses an important need in the marketplace, it makes a big difference for patients who otherwise don't have great alternatives available to them. Murdo wanted to start on the first question. And with respect to Washington, Chris, obviously we evaluated this in the context of the legislation, the potential legislation that's making its way through the Senate at the moment and well, as you point out, this is a small molecule product, we don't expect that there's any particular risk for this product as compared to other small molecules that could become subject to the price controls implied or pluses in the legislation so again, we think this is an attractive product, the clinical profile looks really well suited to the needs of the marketplace and we're excited to be joining the team with them. Yes, you will catch the second piece of that Murdo and I'll address the first which is with respect to Washington again Salveen. As you know, this is still potential legislation. So we'll watch carefully to see if it gets passed and it if goes exactly what gets passed. So, I don't think at this point, will say anything more specific than what I said in my opening remarks, which is that we've been advocating for reform that would promote innovation and improve patient access to it and we'll be concerned to the extent of the legislation passes doesn't do those two things. Okay. Dave, do you want to take the first. I'm not exactly sure what you're looking for in your specific question, but Murdo feel free to jump in. I'd say Umer that we are obviously attractive the fact and is still at an early stage of its launch. We think we can add value to that and the feedback from the marketplace has been encouraging. The prescriber and patient based marketplace, that is. Okay, let's move on. Next question? Matt, I don't think anything has changed, we continue to look for ways to invest in the business and our focus is on trying to find the best innovation and to try to advance particularly in the areas where we've been clear about our stated interest. So implant oncology and then the general medicine area. So we continue to look, there are obviously many more opportunities in the small and medium size and there are in the large size. But as I've said consistently through my tenure Matt, we feel responsibility to look at all the options to add value for our shareholders and we'll continue to do that. Jason, next question? We're going to take this in two parts. I think with respect to KYPROLIS obviously we're encouraged by the ongoing performance of that. And more generally to hemog portfolios, you referred to talk about the ongoing successful BLINCYTO again we're very encouraged by what we see and what we think we can continue to do for patients in relapsed-refractory ALL. But I think you also raised an important point, which is that multiple myeloma is a very crowded space and our decision with respect to 701 had a lot to do with our ability to get the market ahead of the competition or not. So, we're prioritizing on those medicines where we think we can be best-in-class and first-in-class and we have other programs underway that may be useful in multiple myeloma and Dave, you want to -- Thanks for the question. So it's, we've got now a pair of molecules targeting prostate cancer, actually three if you include neuroendocrine prostate cancer where we're conducting a Tarlatamab study where DLL3 expression is quite frequent in neuroendocrine tumors. But first AMG 509 targeting steep one I continue to be impressed with the data we are generating in that trial and we are moving ahead with all deliberate speed to advance that program. We hope to be able to share data either late this year or sometime into next year from that dose escalation in first in human study and then, as I had indicated, all along we would take a look at the accumulating data from AMG 160 Acapatamab and AMG 340 which came to us through the Teneobio acquisition and based on what we saw, we elected to prioritize AMG 340 targeting PSMA going forward. The data you're alluding to, from a few days ago is a handful of patients some we've seen in the similar things in early phases. I think what you need is more patients and in particular prolonged follow up, especially in this disease and in that regards on the quite encouraged with what I'm seeing from AMG 509 for example. So that portfolio of three medicines is advancing I feel actually on very optimistic about what we may be able to do in prostate cancer. Okay. Jason, I know, we're a little bit past the top of the hour, but we've got a couple more questions in the queue. So why don't we take a couple more and then if we don't get to you Arvind and his team will be around receiving for some time. Could I just go for the next call? Thank you, Arvind. And again, thank you all for joining our call. We feel that we've been executing well through the first half of the year and we're looking forward to carrying that momentum into the second half of the year and obviously excited about the ChemoCentryx announcements and what that represents the future of our inflam and nephrology franchises as well. So, thanks for joining. We'll look forward to catching up with you after the third quarter."

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Second quarter product sales increased three percent year-over-year driven by a 10% volume increase. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, global product sales grew five percent, we delivered record quarterly sales for Prolia, EVENITY, AMGEVITA, KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO and delivered double-digit volume growth for several additional products including Repatha and LUMAKRAS. Our ex-U.S. business grew five percent, with volume growth of 20% year-over-year. In addition to the strong second quarter, I'm also personally excited about our announcement to acquire ChemoCentryx and the opportunity to help patients with severe active ANCA-associated vasculitis, a serious and potentially life-threatening autoimmune disease. I'll say more about TAVNEOS as I comment on the performance of our inflammation portfolio. I'll start with our General Medicine business, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig. Overall revenue for this portfolio grew 17% year-over-year driven by 24% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 13% year-over-year. Volumes grew 12%, driven by an increase in both new and repeat patients. EVENITY had record sales of a $191 million for the quarter, driven by 60% volume growth in the U.S. and 37% volume growth outside of the U.S. Enbrel sales decreased eight percent year-over-year for the second quarter, primarily driven by declines in net selling price and volume. Enbrel remains a frequently prescribed therapy due to its long track record of efficacy and safety. Our launch of Tezspire is off to a very strong start with $29 million in sales in the second quarter. I'm encouraged to see that both allergists and pulmonologists have prescribed Tezspire across a broad range of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. We're also seeing initiation in both biologic naive and previously treated patients. On the access front, Tezspire is a medical benefit product for which we received permanent reimbursement coding as of July 1. Physicians acknowledge Tezspire's unique differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled or biologic eligible without any final phenotypic and biomarker limitation. Now, our agreement to acquire ChemoCentryx brings a compelling opportunity into our leading inflammation and nephrology portfolio with TAVNEOS, a recently launched first-in-class treatment for ANCA-associated by Vasculitis or AAV. Let me take a minute to talk about how important I think TAVNEOS will be for patients. AAV is a serious systemic autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation and eventual destruction of small blood vessels. This inflammatory process can lead to permanent organ damage and in some severe cases can be life threatening. TAVNEOS represents a significant advance in the treatment options for the eight to 10,000 U.S. patients a year who develop severe active disease or experience major relapses of AAV. We are looking forward to meeting and working with the talented team at ChemoCentryx and I'm confident that by applying Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence, we can help many more patients with AAV with TAVNEOS. Moving to our hematology and oncology business. Our six innovative products grew 14% year-over-year with 11% volume growth. This was driven by strong volume growth for KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO which we expect to continue throughout this year. XGEVA volume declined two percent in Q1 and was flat year-over-year in Q2. Our launch of LUMAKRAS is progressing well with revenues of $77 million in the second quarter, representing 24% quarter-over-quarter growth. In the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to over 3,000 patients by over 1900 physicians, and we've seen broad adoption in the community setting where the majority of non-small cell lung cancer patients are treated. Unfortunately, while 85% of patients in the U.S. are tested for their KRAS G12C status, only 50% of the time do oncologists have these test results available to support second-line treatment decisions and our teams are removing barriers to ensure that the oncologist is able to review KRAS G12C status when the patient progresses beyond first-line therapy and we've seen that when the KRAS G12C status is known in the second line setting, 85% of patients receive LUMAKRAS. Outside the U.S., LUMAKRAS has now been approved in over 40 countries and we're actively launching in 25 markets and rapidly pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. Sales of our oncology Biosimilars declined 24% year-over-year, while our biosimilars for inviting KANJINTI both hold leading shares. We expect continued net selling price deterioration and volume declines driven by increased competition. In total, our Biosimilars portfolio has become an industry-leading franchise, which has contributed $5.5 billion of product sales cumulatively. Looking forward, we're excited about the upcoming launch of AMGEVITA in the United States in January of 2023, followed by the next wave of Biosimilar launches to STELARA, EYLEA and SOLIRIS. Overall, I'm very pleased with our execution and volume growth in the quarter. Our expanding international presence and diverse portfolio of products, including the exciting addition of TAVNEOS position us well to deliver on our long-term growth strategy. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave. Thanks for the question Chris. We are obviously pleased with the very nice strategic fit of TAVNEOS in our portfolio. The ChemoCentryx's team have been mostly focused on rheumatology and there are sub-specialties of rheumatologists who treat a lot of these AAV patients. So, they've been quite focused in their commercial efforts so far, we can scale that much more broadly, we have a national footprint on rheumatology given our current in-line inflammation business and we can also add nephrology, about a third of these patients end up getting diagnosed by nephrologist given that one of the presentations AAV is renal impairment or a renal inflammation, I should say. So that's the immediate benefit, but we've also got resources like our patient support programing, our medical teams, our institutional key account managers and our ability to work with payers to ensure that medical policies in prior authorizations are seamless for providers and patients. So, there is a lot we can bring to the table beyond just a very focused, but very effective so far ChemoCentryx effort. And Salveen on AMGEVITA, obviously we're pleased that we're first out of the gate with the AMGEVITA launch in the U.S. at the end of January next year, we were pleased with our performance outside the U.S. with AMGEVITA where we've established market leadership at the higher share and we've been able to hold that despite competition. Obviously, the U.S. market is a different market given payer in reimbursement structure, but we feel confident that we'll be able to establish good access and coverage for AMGEVITA early in the launch lifecycle and we think that PBMs and payers are interested in ensuring their patients and members have biosimilar availability and option. So, all going well and according to plan. Thanks. Yes, Umer, we've been following the TAVNEOS journey for a while and I think what everybody has to remember here is that the nature of this disease. I mean this is a severe acute autoimmune inflammation that involves the lungs, the kidneys, sometimes skin and other organs and can cause permanent end organ damage if not treated effectively and efficiently and quickly and the current standards of care are difficult treatments for patients to tolerate and if you can intervene and improve that patients potential to remain relapse-free over the first 52 weeks as a rheumatologist or a nephrologist, if you all you have to do is add TAVNEOS to their base regimen, you're going to do that. So I think the behavioral change here is one that many physicians are choosing to do and that as you alluded to, that's been encouraging to see in the early phase of this launch. But the reason we like TAVNEOS is it helps reduce the potential relapse for patients by adding TAVNEOS to the current standard of care and potentially reducing glucocorticoid use. So this is a disease area that if we were doing the development on our own it would fit squarely in our strategy and so it comes in, into a strong inflammation portfolio and it's one that we think our scale and commercial and medical capabilities will allow us to accelerate what has already been a good launch. Yes, thanks for the question, Geoff. I would say it's less about peak testing in the U.S. where we've already got about 85% of frontline patients being tested and receiving a KRAS G12C status. Right now what we know is only half of the tested patient population in second line has the test result available when they're progressing. So that's really what we're focused on, we are focused on where is that test result for that progressing patients so that that treating oncologist can give the patient the benefit of LUMAKRAS and when they have that test is again half the time, 85% of those patients get LUMAKRAS. So we're getting a very high percentage penetration of those second line patients when the prescribing physician knows their test results. So, we are not picking yet. We've got headroom for more improvement there, currently about half of those patients are not getting their KRAS G12C test result reviewed upon progression. So that's an important thing that it seems are focused on. That's what we think we can do to continue to drive some revenue growth in the U.S. and outside the U.S., what we're seeing is really again a tale of two types of markets in markets like Germany, Switzerland and France where biomarker testing is very well developed and their clinical information systems are also very well developed, so that test is available and retrievable upon progression in second line. We're seeing very rapid lift and uptake in places where that's not quite as well developed I think Spain, Italy, to some extent, the U.K., the uptake resembles more what we've seen in the U.S., In our expanded access programs where we've seen clinical utilization, but I'm also talking about other experience with other targeted therapies, you're going to see a slower uptake in some markets than you will in others because of that testing infrastructure. So, we're working on that with those markets, we're changing that behavior with clinicians. And I think we'll be able to successfully grow this product in second line and of course, if we get confirmatory data in Phase 3, what that does is it makes it easier to promote because we're no longer on an accelerated approval and hopefully the datacenter compelling and continue to reinforce the value of LUMAKRAS."

            "name": "David Reese",
            "content": "Thanks Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by sharing my excitement for the transaction we announced today. As you've heard ANCA-associated vasculitis is a serious and sometimes life threatening disorder. Having treated these patients personally, I fully appreciate the challenges they face and the benefits of TAVNEOS in addressing the significant unmet need. I look forward to working with the team at ChemoCentryx. For research and development, the second quarter was one of continued execution where we announced new data on several programs and continued to progress, our robust innovative clinical pipeline. Beginning with inflammation, in July TEZSPIRE was recommended for approval in the European Union by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for severe asthma and also approved in Canada. We initiated the SUNRISE Phase 3 study, designed to assess the efficacy and safety of TEZSPIRE in reducing oral corticosteroid use in adults with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma. The ROCKET Phase 3 program evaluating rocatinlimab, an innovative anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis was initiated in June. Following additional discussions with regulators and our partner, we are amending the studies to further improve patient convenience and investigate a range of doses. No safety or efficacy issues have arisen. We continue to remain very excited about the broad potential of this program in atopic dermatitis. In oncology, we will present data from two of our thoracic programs at the upcoming World Conference on Lung Cancer. The first is tarlatamab, the DLL3 targeting HLE BiTE molecule being studied in heavily pretreated patients with small cell lung cancer, a population with few treatment options. In this setting tarlatamab demonstrated promising antitumor activity with notable response durability. We look forward to presenting an updated data set in the World Conference and continue to enroll patients in a potentially registrational Phase 2 trial in this setting. We're also investigating tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line small cell lung cancer in combination with AMG 404, a PD-1 inhibitor in patients with second line or later small cell lung cancer and in neuroendocrine prostate cancer. I'll also present data from our LUMAKRAS checkpoint inhibitor in SHIP2 combination studies. Data from the former are embargoed until August 7. So we can't discuss the results today, but we can say is the PD-1 have been challenging to combined with other targeted agents due to tolerability issues. We will present a comprehensive dataset from this study. As a reminder, we are investigating multiple potential pass to first line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with LUMAKRAS potentially segmented by PD-L1 expression levels where the non-small cell lung cancer population breaks down into roughly thirds across PD-L1 high expressers, low expressers and PD-L1 negative expression. We've seen promising early data in the PD-L1 negative population and based on discussions with regulators, we are planning to initiate a Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS plus chemotherapy in first-line advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. While a smaller dataset, we are very encouraged by both the efficacy and safety of the LUMAKRAS combination with Revolution Medicines SHIP2 inhibitor RMC 4630. In patients without prior KRAS G12C inhibitor treatment, three of four patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received the highest two doses of RMC 4630 in combination with LUMAKRAS at a confirmed partial response and all four had disease control. In gastrointestinal cancer, we are also pleased to announce that data from the full dose expansion Phase 1b study of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in refractory KRAS G12C mutated colorectal cancer were accepted for presentation at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress taking place in September. The final analysis of the FIGHT study Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, controlled trial evaluating Bemarituzumab, a fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b FGFR2b targeting monoclonal antibody and modified FOLFOX6 in patients with previously untreated advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer was completed. These results continue to demonstrate the Bemarituzumab plus modified FOLFOX6 improves the clinical outcome of patients with FGFR2b expressing tumors with no new safety concerns. A greater survival benefit was observed with increasing levels of FGFR2b expression. In general Medicine, we announced top line data from a Phase 2 study of Olpasiran, our small interfering RNA targeting Lp(a). These data demonstrated a significant reduction from baseline in Lp(a) of up to or greater than 90% at week 36, the primary endpoint and week 48 at the end of treatment period for the majority of doses, which range from once every 12 weeks to once every 24 weeks in dosing frequency. No new safety concerns were identified during this treatment period. Presentation of these results is expected at a medical congress in the second half of this year. We're very excited about this innovative molecule and are moving to rapidly initiate a Phase 3 outcome study. AMG 133, a multispecific that inhibits the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) and activates the glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor, has completed enrollment. We are planning to submit data from the initial cohorts of this Phase 1 study to a medical congress occurring late this year and are actively the Phase 2 program for this molecule. In conclusion, with an innovative portfolio, we're approximately three quarters of our clinical stage programs have first-in-class potential and a growing portfolio of Biosimilars, we are well positioned to continue to deliver important new medicines for patients and growth for shareholders over the near and long term. And with that, I'll turn it back to Bob for questions and answers. Yes, thanks Umer. In regards to OX40, yes, no safety issue, no biomarker issue either, no change in any kind of patient subset. As I said in my prepared remarks beginning this is really driven by ongoing discussions with the FDA to explore broader range of doses and we took that opportunity to we think improve patient convenience. I wouldn't overthink it or read anything more into it than that and we don't think that this will affect overall program timelines. Yes, sure. So in terms of Lumakras PD-1 combination, obviously I can't say much because of the embargo we're presenting these data Sunday afternoon in Vienna. As we think about development in first-line I'd like to think of kind of three buckets of patients are those whose tumors are PD-L1 negative, those who are PD-L1 low to intermediate and those that are PD-L1 high expressers. As I mentioned and as you picked up on in the PD-L1 negative population, we're moving forward with a Lumakras plus chemotherapy Phase 3 trial and then we will disclose the results of the checkpoint inhibitor data in Vienna and outline our plans for further development in this space, I think that's probably all I can say right now, but I would really think about this as different groups of patients where the therapy will be tailored to their particular tumor based on PD-L1 expression. On AMG 133, very pleased with our progress there as I mentioned, we completed enrollment in the Phase 1. We hope to present that we are submitting, in the process of submitting that to a medical congress and we're very actively planning what the Phase 2 program will look like and we'll have more to say about that as our plans are finalized over in the coming months. In terms of the Phase 3 study on track to report out this quarter, it's an event driven trial, if we see behavior of LUMAKRAS consistent with what we've observed really across the program to date in advanced lung cancer, I think we will be well positioned there. The trial has 90% power to detect a significant difference in progression-free survival. So, it's very well powered, I'm sure it will be a well conducted study and so we look forward to having those data soon. In terms of the placebo response, that I think it's hard to speculate on that. The trial that we are conducting in the PD-L1 negatives as chemotherapy plus LUMAKRAS against what would be considered a standard therapy arm where the addition of checkpoint inhibitors has a relatively modest additive benefit. So, based on preliminary data that we've seen, looking at LUMAKRAS in combination with chemotherapy as what's given us the confidence to move into Phase 3 and we've had productive discussions with regulators about that trial design. Hi. thanks, Yaron. Yes. So there are other disorders as you're indicating in which Tavneos has been investigated where activation of this limb of the complement cascade may play a role in the inflammatory disease process such as C3 glomerulopathy and hidradenitis suppurativa, we'll look at all of those data. Look at the programs with our new colleagues from ChemoCentryx and determine what the best path forward is to potentially address again diseases where there's currently very little effective therapy. Next question? Yes. As an area look we're guided by the science and the biology that we uncover AMG 701 what that was strategic multiple agents targeting BCMA and we chose to focus our efforts on for example tarlatamab DLL3 program where we've got a substantial lead. We've got a molecule that's extremely active, same platform is AMG 701 and so I think you'll see this kind of prioritization going forward. Thanks, Robyn. In regards to the BiTE platform, we've been working for some time on new generation technologies that will incorporate things like logic gates with multiple targets where either an AND gate or an or gate is engineered into the pipe for activation, the real goal here is to do two things, one, try and enhance efficacy, and two increase the therapeutic window so that you have is a little normal tissue-targeting as possible from the agents. So first molecules are moving towards the clinic, and we'll have more to say about that as we get ready to launch."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background nose. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.\nArvind Sood: Okay, RJ. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our Q1 call. I think our performance in Q1 exemplifies our continued focus on execution while staying on track to deliver against our long-term objectives. So let's get started. Slides have been posted. Quick reminder that we'll use non-GAAP financial measures in our presentation and some of the statements will be forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings identify factors that could cause our actual results to vary or differ materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway. Bob?\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. When we last spoke in February, we told you that we'd be focused on execution and that we have a number of opportunities in place that should enable us to deliver long-term attractive growth. In the first quarter of the year, we executed well on these many opportunities, delivering 6% revenue growth and 15% earnings per share growth. We achieved this performance despite the effects of COVID during the first two months of the year, currency headwinds, and of course, net selling price declines. The innovative brands that we highlighted in February continued to generate strong volume growth in the first quarter, including Repatha, which was up 49%; Prolia, up 10%; EVENITY, up 59%; and Otezla, up 7% as well as several of our oncology products, which also generated attractive volume growth in the quarter. Our two newest innovative medicines, LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE, are off to a strong start offering compelling new treatment options for patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer and severe asthma, respectively. And we're also pursuing significant new indications for both of these products. Let me just say, with respect to the five high-quality biosimilars we have on the market, that they're performing well and in line with our expectations. As we've noted previously, growth for the portfolio of biosimilar products over time will come through the steady introduction of new products, including the U.S. launch of AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to HUMIRA in January of next year. AMGEVITA is the first of six new biosimilars that we expect to launch by the end of the decade. International growth is an important component of our long-term strategy, and we saw a strong volume growth outside the U.S. of 15% in the first quarter and nearly 30% volume growth in the Asia Pacific region. Turning to our pipeline. We're advancing, as you're aware, a number of mid- to late-stage potentially first-in-class opportunities in inflammation, oncology and general medicine while continuing to invest in our innovative marketed brands and biosimilars. Since our business review, we've had important data readouts for LUMAKRAS, Repatha and ABP 654, which is our Phase 3 biosimilar candidate to STELARA. We have several more data milestones that come through the remainder of the year. Looking to the longer term, we continue to thoughtfully invest in an integrated set of discovery research capabilities, including human data and generative biology, as we look to significantly expand the number of targets we can pursue, reduce cycle times, and increase the probability of our success. As to our commitment to innovation, we're committed to pursuing the best innovation available, whether it comes through our own efforts or is sourced externally, and our strong balance sheet and cash flows will enable us to continue to invest in innovation in both organically and through business development. Our work to serve patients comes at a time when society is confronting many challenges. We're doing our part to address these as we have throughout our history, with a focus in four areas: removing barriers that limit equitable access to health care, working toward a more adjusted society, minimizing our environmental impact, and ensuring that our actions and culture reflect Amgen values. If you're interested in learning more, our latest environmental, social and governance report was published earlier today and is available on our website. Before I turn to Peter, let me just thank my Amgen colleagues around the world for their commitment to serving patients and outstanding execution. Now Peter, over to you.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Bob. We're pleased with our execution and growth this quarter as we drive towards our long-term goal. I will walk through our first quarter financial results before discussing our 2022 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 5 of the slide deck. The first quarter marked another period of solid execution, with year-over-year revenue growth of 6% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 15%. For product sales, strong volume growth of 9% was driven by Repatha, Prolia and EVENITY. Volume growth was partially offset by declines in net selling price and foreign exchange headwinds. Our established portfolio comprised of EPOGEN, Aranesp, NEUPOGEN, Sensipar and Parsabiv, generated almost $1 billion of product sales and continues to deliver strong cash flows. Transitioning to our biosimilars, AMGEVITA remains the most prescribed adalimumab biosimilar in Europe. And looking forward, we will leverage this successful experience as we prepare to launch and grow this product in the United States in January of 2023. For MVASI and KANJINTI, as anticipated, we experienced year-over-year declines driven by net selling price reductions and we expect this trend to continue for these products. Murdo will discuss product sales in more detail in his remarks. Other revenues of $500 million increased 64% year-over-year, primarily driven by our COVID-19 antibody collaboration. First quarter, total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year as we invest in our pipeline, execute product launches and drive digitalization across the Company. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.1 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 16.6%, primarily due to higher direct manufacturing costs, COVID-19 antibody manufacturing costs and increased royalties and profit shares. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter decreased 1% year-over-year. Recall that Q1 2021 included $53 million related to our acquisition of Rodeo Therapeutics. Excluding the $53 million for Rodeo in 2021, non-GAAP R&D increased 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the first quarter declined 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments and activities and driving productivity. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were a net $413 million expense in Q1. This line item is driven by interest expense and our share of BeiGene results as a result of our use of the equity method of accounting. We have a strong balance sheet, generates significant cash flow and retain excellent financial flexibility to evaluate strategic business development opportunities. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, investing in the best innovation, internal and external; second, investing in our business through capital expenditures, including for our new environmentally friendly facilities under construction in Ohio and North Carolina; and third, returning capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $1.94 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from Q4 2021; and fourth, opportunistic share repurchases, including 24.6 million shares of common stock in the first quarter, which included 23.3 million initial shares received and retired under the accelerated stock buyback agreement. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2022. We're pleased with our growth to date in 2022, and we're tracking to our 2022 plan. Accordingly, we're reaffirming our 2022 guidance with a revenue range of $25.4 billion to $26.5 billion and a non-GAAP EPS range of $17 to $18. This non-GAAP EPS guidance does not include upfront expenses that may occur from certain types of transactions in the future. Similar to our peers, we have updated our non-GAAP policy to no longer exclude such expenses from our non-GAAP results in accordance with guidance recently issued by the SEC. For reference, the only impact as we recast 2021 to incorporate this change is that our non-GAAP operating expenses will now include two items that were previously excluded in 2021. First, $1.5 billion recorded and acquired in-process R&D associated with the Five Prime acquisition in Q2 2021. And second, $400 million recorded in research and development related to an upfront payment to license rights to AMG 451 from Kyowa-Kirin Corporation in Q3 2021. Important additional points to consider for the remainder of 2022: foreign exchange had an adverse impact on our Q1 2022 sales, and based on current rates, it is expected to create headwinds to our reported product sales of approximately $400 million year-over-year and has been included in our guidance. We note that while the results of our hedging program are reported in product sales, our hedging program is designed to partially mitigate the foreign exchange impact on our net income over the full year. In total, our 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% or approximately $0.35. We continue to expect other revenue for 2022 to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion. Q1 included a majority of our full year's projected revenue from our COVID collaboration and recall that these revenues in 2021 were recognized across Q2 to Q4. Our COVID collaboration revenue outlook depends on the state of the pandemic and continued government support. Our expectations for total non-GAAP operating expenses for 2022 are unchanged from the last time we spoke. However, when comparing against our recast 2021 results, total non-GAAP operating expenses will now reflect a low double-digit decrease year-over-year. We continue to expect 2022 operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 15.5% to 16.5%. Our expectations for non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2022 remain unchanged. Based on our recast 2021 results, in response to the SEC guidance mentioned above, which increased non-GAAP R&D expense in 2021 by $400 million, our expected 2022 non-GAAP R&D expense now equates to a decrease of 4% to 6% year-over-year. We continue to expect SG&A spend to be flat year-over-year as a percentage of product sales. And we now expect other income and expenses to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, reflecting increasing interest rates and our share of BeiGene's results. This is a change from our previous range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. And for the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate range of 13.5% to 14.5%, up from our prior guidance of 13% to 14%. You've had an opportunity to read the update to our litigation and dispute with the IRS over the proposed adjustments for the period from 2010 to 2015, included in the press release. We firmly believe that the adjustments proposed by the IRS for that time period and the penalties proposed by the IRS of the 2013 to 2015 period are without merit. Further, the amount of the adjustments proposed by the IRS for 2010 to 2015 period overstates by billions of dollars, the magnitude of the dispute. We filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court in July 2021 to contest the adjustments previously proposed for the 2010 to 2012 period. And we plan to file another petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest the adjustments proposed in the notice for the 2013 to 2015 period. The dispute is expected to take several years to resolve. Amgen believes the IRS assertion of approximately $2 billion in penalties for the 2013 to 2015 period is wholly unwarranted. We've applied a consistent transfer pricing methodology since 2002. We've documented that transfer pricing methodology is required under relevant tax regulations, and have extensively discussed that methodology with the IRS across multiple tax audits over multiple tax years. The IRS has never previously proposed transfer pricing penalties. Amgen also believes, based upon the positions advanced by the IRS, that the IRS adjustments for the 2010 to 2015 period are overstated by approximately $2 billion due to the IRS failure to account for certain income and expenses. Amgen has reported its income and expenses in a consistent manner for many years, and the IRS has appropriately accounted for the Company's income and expenses in all prior audits. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the 2010 to 2015 period would be reduced by up to approximately $3.1 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued with respect to the Company's Puerto Rico earnings. Amgen previously made advanced tax deposits to the IRS, totaling $1.1 billion for the 2010 and to 2015 period. These deposits would further reduce any additional cash tax that could be imposed. The IRS is currently auditing the 2016 to 2018 period, -- we expect the audit to continue for several years, and it is possible that the 2010 to 2015 dispute will be resolved before the conclusion of the 2016 the 2018 audit and administrative appeals process. Any transfer pricing adjustments the IRS may propose for this period will be lessened by the change in tax rates resulting from the 2017 tax reform law, which reduced the difference between the tax rates applicable in the U.S. and Puerto Rico by approximately 2/3 beginning in 2018. We are highly confident in our positions in the litigation and dispute. We are grateful to all of our highly skilled colleagues in Puerto Rico and their important and ongoing contributions to Amgen's mission of serving patients. And now back to the mission of serving every patient every time. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen remains strong given the strength of the business and our outstanding and dedicated team of 24,000 colleagues that deliver every day for patients. This concludes the financial update. I'll now turn it over to Murdo.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks Peter. First quarter product sales increased 2% year-over-year, we continue to progress our volume-driven growth strategy, which led to a 9% volume increase globally in Q1. We delivered record quarterly sales for Repatha, EVENITY and BLINCYTO; and double-digit volume growth for several additional products, including Prolia, KYPROLIS and AMGEVITA. In the first two months of year, COVID-19 affected our business in the U.S. and around the world as the Omicron variant led to diminished capacity in the health care sector and reduced working days for our own sales forces. In March and continuing into April, the impact of Omicron in the U.S. receded, which allowed us to engage in increased face-to-face customer interactions. Provider and patient activity have also increased leading to improvements in demand for our products. Now let me review some product details, beginning with our General Medicine portfolio, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig. Overall revenue for our general medicine portfolio grew 19% year-over-year with 23% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 12% year-over-year. Volumes grew 10%, fueled by an increase in both new and repeat patients. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bond portfolio, had record sales of $170 million for the quarter, driven by strong volume growth across our markets. Moving to Repatha, the global leader in the PCSK9 class, Repatha sales increased 15% year-over-year, driven by 49% volume growth. And in the U.S., we saw 41% volume growth. Net selling prices declined as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access. Outside the U.S., sales grew 12% with strong volume growth coming from the inclusion of Repatha on China's National Reimbursement Drug List beginning January 1. We remain focused on increasing Repatha market penetration globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high-risk cardiovascular patients. Moving to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla delivered 7% year-over-year volume growth in the first quarter. In the U.S., we saw a strengthening of the market with Otezla remaining the market leader, achieving a 30% share of patients who are new to systemic agents for psoriasis. Otezla's recently expanded label has been well received by payers, providers and patients. We're seeing early signs of physicians using more systemic treatments for mild psoriasis patients, and the majority of dermatologists anticipate increasing the use of Otezla for mild psoriasis. Globally, Otezla sales decreased 5% year-over-year due to net price declines and lower inventory levels in the U.S. across wholesale and specialty pharmaceutical channels. Otezla net price declines in the U.S. were driven primarily by enhancements to our co-pay and bridge programs to support new patients starting treatment. Looking forward, we expect lower year-on-year price erosion for the remaining quarters of 2022. We also expect continued volume growth driven by broader adoption of Otezla, given our unique broad indication regardless of the severity of psoriasis. Enbrel sales decreased 7% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by declines in net selling price and inventory levels. Year-over-year, volume remained flat in the first quarter, supported by Enbrel's long track record of efficacy and safety. Our launch of TEZSPIRE is off to a strong start with $7 million in sales in the first quarter. Initial feedback from payers, providers and patients is very positive. Physician's unaided awareness increased to greater than 65% since launch, supported by our disease state education programs. On the access front, TEZSPIRE is a medical benefit product for which we expect permanent reimbursement coding as of July 1 of this year. Both allergists and pulmonologists acknowledge TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated properties and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled or biologic eligible without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations. Moving to the hematology and oncology business, our six innovative products grew 17% year-over-year with 11% volume growth. We saw strong volume growth from KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO which we expect to continue throughout this year. XGEVA sales grew 7% year-over-year, while volumes declined 2%. Our launch of LUMAKRAS is progressing well with revenues of $62 million in the first quarter, representing 38% quarter-over-quarter growth. In the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to approximately 2,500 patients by over 1,500 physicians in both academic and community settings since launch. While approximately 80% of patients in the U.S. are tested for their KRAS G12C status, the test result is not always available and/or reviewed when the patient progresses beyond first-line therapy. The opportunity to improve care is to ensure the KRAS G12C status is available in the patient chart or electronic medical record and reviewed by the oncologist to ensure that LUMAKRAS is discussed as an option for the patient. LUMAKRAS has strong payer coverage in the U.S., with 93% of patients having formulary access. Outside the U.S., sotorasib has now been approved in nearly 40 countries around the world with recent reimbursement approvals in the United Kingdom and Japan. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 25% year-over-year, while our biosimilars, MVASI and KANJINTI, both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and volume declines, driven by increased and ASP erosion. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches beginning with AMGEVITA in the United States in January of 2023. Overall, we're executing well against our growth strategy with strong volume trends across our portfolio. With that, I'll turn it to Dave.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. First quarter was one of continued execution in R&D where we focused on progressing our robust innovative clinical pipeline comprised of many potential first-in-class opportunities. Beginning with inflammation, we initiated two additional studies with TEZSPIRE in severe asthma. The WAYFINDER Phase 3b study, designed to demonstrate a reduction in oral corticosteroid use in adult participants on long-term oral corticosteroid therapy in the PASSAGE Phase 4 real-world effectiveness study designed to evaluate TEZSPIRE in adult and adolescent participants, including underrepresented populations such as Black Americans, smokers and patients with asthma-COPD overlap. Phase 3 planning continues for rocatinlimab, formerly AMG 451, an anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with heterogeneous moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Rocatinlumab binds activated pathogenic T cells expressing OX40. Its unique mechanism of action, rocatinlimab inhibits and prevents the expansion of activated pathogenic T cells and reduces their number. Thus, rocatinlimab has the potential to lead to profound disease control. In addition, this provides a rationale for longer dosing intervals, with the prospect of achieving disease modification. ROCKET, the comprehensive rocatinlimab Phase 3 program, remains on track to initiate in mid-2022. In our biosimilar portfolio, last week, we announced preliminary results from a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 654 compared to STELARA, ustekinumab, in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The study met the primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 654 and STELARA. Now turning to oncology. Earlier this month, we presented data at AACR on outcomes from a two-year analysis of the LUMAKRAS CodeBreaK 100 trial, which demonstrated the long-term clinical benefit, including overall survival of patients with KRAS G12C mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with LUMAKRAS. These data showed that roughly 1/3 of patients were still alive at two years, and the prolonged tumor response was also observed with a 41% objective response rate by central review. While this was a single-arm trial without a control arm, the efficacy data compare favorably with anticipated outcomes in this patient population based on historical data. There were no new safety signals reported over the course of this two-year follow-up analysis. We have submitted data from the LUMAKRAS PD-1 combination and SHIP2 combination cohorts to a medical congress taking place in the late summer, while top line results from the LUMAKRAS confirmatory Phase 3 study versus docetaxel and the dose comparison study are on track for Q3 and Q4, respectively. Also in the lung cancer setting, we have submitted updated Phase 1 data of tarlatamab, our DLL3-targeting half-life extended BiTE molecule being used in patients with relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer to a medical congress taking place in the late summer. And we plan to initiate DeLLphi-303, a Phase 1b study testing tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line small cell lung cancer this quarter. Finally, in squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we are enrolling patients in a Phase 1b study of bemarituzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against FGFR2b. Turning to gastrointestinal cancers. We presented data at the ASCO plenary series in February, where LUMAKRAS demonstrated a centrally confirmed objective response rate of 21% and disease control rate of 84% across 38 heavily pretreated advanced pancreatic cancer patients. We continue to explore the benefit of LUMAKRAS as a monotherapy and when combined with other agents in this setting. In third-line colorectal cancer, Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix is enrolling patients. In gastric cancer, a Phase 1b study of bemarituzumab plus oral chemotherapy regimens in tumors with FGFR2b overexpression has been initiated. In General Medicine, we were pleased to announce the results from two Repatha open-label extension trials, the FOURIER OLE, studies designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of Repatha in more than 6,600 high-risk adults with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease on stable effective statin therapy. In the OLE studies, patients received Repatha for approximately five years, with some patients receiving Repatha for up to 8.5 years in aggregate across the FOURIER and OLE studies. The combined results from these studies reinforce the long-term safety and tolerability of Repatha in lowering LDL cholesterol. We are extremely encouraged by the sustained benefit of this medicine in patients with cardiovascular disease who still struggle to get their LDL-cholesterol level below the recommended targets. These extended results for patients on Repatha are consistent with what the health care community has learned over the past seven decades about the benefits of lowering cholesterol. That is robust and sustained LDL cholesterol reduction affects the spectrum of important cardiovascular outcomes. We look forward to sharing these data at a medical congress later this year. In conclusion, we continue to execute crisply across our innovative and biosimilar portfolios and look forward to sharing new data from a number of our programs throughout the rest of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to Bob for Q&A.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Dave. RJ, could you remind our callers of the process for submitting a question, we're happy to answer questions now.\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Yee from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMichael Yee: Can you hear me okay?\nBob Bradway: Yes, Mike, go ahead.\nMichael Yee: Very good. Question for Dave. Obviously, the KRAS field is quite competitive and you have a very important Phase 3 LUMAKRAS confirmatory study reading out. I just wanted to know your confidence around the expectations for a positive result there against docetaxel, how fast you could file that and whether that changes the paradigm for accelerated approvals for competitors around you. So maybe just comment on that study and the ramifications.\nDavid Reese: If we replicate what we've observed so far with LUMAKRAS, I think, Mike, we would be quite confident in the likelihood that the Phase 3 trial against docetaxel, which, of course, has been around for decades, will be positive. We would, of course, discuss with the FDA and other regulatory bodies, how to file these data and move forward with full approvals in terms of effects on the competitive landscape. I'll leave that to others to comment on. But we're very confident in LUMAKRAS at this point. We're approved in roughly 40 countries around the world. The program is moving forward very briskly, and that's our focus right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nJay Olson: As you continue to generate important new clinical data for Repatha, data coming for Olpasiran, AMG 133, I saw you recently published data for AMG 986 for heart failure. It seems like you're building an increasingly strong cardiovascular portfolio. Can you just talk about your strategy in cardiovascular disease? And what are the large opportunities there? And are there any gaps in your cardiovascular portfolio where you may want to pursue business development opportunities?\nBob Bradway: Why don't I take the last piece of that, and Dave, why don't you respond to the first? I'll start. I think Murdo wanted to comment as well. Good. Jump in. Thanks, Jay. I think you raised an incredibly important question. As you're all aware, cardiovascular disease is one of our three principal areas of therapeutic areas for research. It remains an area of focus for us going forward. It remains the number one public health burden in terms of morbidity and mortality across the globe. And that, in part, is what spurs our commitment here with Repatha. Murdo will comment in a minute, but we believe there is tremendous opportunity to serve patients on a hypothesis that's probably the best proved in medicine in terms of LDL cholesterol. You mentioned the LPa program, Olpasiran, or AMG 890. Just to remind everyone, LPa is probably the single most important driver outside of LDL cholesterol in terms of the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. As I noted, we're looking forward to over the next couple of months, Phase 2b data in those programs. And our goal would be to transition Phase 3 as quickly as possible if those data replicate what we saw in Phase 1. In addition, we have a very active preclinical research portfolio, I think, indicating our ongoing strategic commitment to this area. Murdo, maybe I'll turn it to you next and then Bob can talk about the business development.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Dave. Underpinning, obviously, the huge unmet medical need of cardiovascular disease is our ability to reach that global population of patients, and we've built the medical and commercial capabilities and global footprint to support that business. We reported 49% volume growth on Repatha, 15% sales growth year-on-year. So we clearly have momentum now, and we continue to feel that there's more for us to do for these patients. We're also very clear that we are focused on improving the affordability of our medicines for these patients. And I think that that's another area we've made great progress. So adding to that portfolio with our own internal pipeline is a welcome thing. And I think Dave's team is working very hard, not only on the pipeline assets, but also to improve the profile of Repatha with the VESALIUS trial, which is ongoing. And of course, the recently announced long-term follow-up trials that were continued, so the profile of Amgen in cardiovascular disease is strong. And I'll turn it over to Bob on the business development.\nBob Bradway: Yes. And there, it's very simple, Jay. We've challenged our business development and research teams to find attractive innovation externally that we can add to our portfolio. So we're looking for things that we can add value to every day in cardiovascular disease as well as in inflammatory diseases and in cancer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Goeff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: Peter, a lot more commentary on the tax dispute with the IRS on this earnings call compared to when you first talked about it last year. I think probably a higher number of the investors expected. So the question is, has there been a recent discussion with the agency or the service that prompted broader language today? And I know it's going to take years to fully resolve, but would you expect your tax reserves to change over the course of that discussion? Or is that just something that's going to be a stagnant number? And then when you fully resolve it, then you'll appropriately make that change.\nPeter Griffith: Yes. Goeff, thank you for the question. Look, we wouldn't -- we're in litigation, so we wouldn't comment on discussions with the IRS first. And then secondly, on reserves, as you can understand, we don't comment on where we're at in terms of the size of the reserves other than we would just simply say that we're very confident in our position and the level of reserves that we've established. And as we said, this is about Puerto Rico and the allocation of profits between the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where we perform a majority of our global manufacturing. Puerto Rico is home to our flagship manufacturing complex, 30-year presence, 2,400 -- 2,400 highly skilled employees, over $4 billion in capital investments. And as we said, we believe that the IRS positions are without merit. We're going to vigorously contest those adjustments proposed for 2010 through 2015.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter: On LUMAKRAS, what steps can you take to ensure that G12C status is recognized by physicians to drive prescriptions here? And could you also frame the outlook for the combo study with KEYTRUDA that's reading out in late summer?\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Salveen. Maybe I'll start and then turn it over to Dave on the data question. We're obviously working extremely closely with all of the oncology providers to improve their own internal systems, whereby they have that KRAS G12C status with literally fingertip ready for making treatment choices for their patients. What we are seeing is a little bit of a COVID hangover effect. Many of these large oncology networks in the U.S. are short staffed and constrained in the resources that they can deploy against things like EMR enhancements, against things like better workflows for diagnostics and biomarkers, particularly new biomarkers. So we are working literally account by account across the country. We've made huge improvements, and we've seen some very large community oncology networks, which is where 80% of the patient base is treated. They're treated in the community centers. I think in the academic institutions, the testing is very strong, robust. The care is clear, and the test results are available for patients who progress. So it's really in the U.S. community setting where we're working. As we look ex-U.S., we see a different pattern by country. So countries that have advanced biomarker technology and very clear systems like Germany and France, we expect good uptake there and we're already seeing early indicators of that. France, as you may recall, has an early access program called an ATU program where we can actually charge for the product and that's being used already fairly broadly. And in Germany, we're just launching and a few weeks old as we are in Japan. So I think it's a network by network project that we're working intensely with our medical colleagues, with our commercial teams to make sure that no patient slips through. Dave?\nDavid Reese: And Salveen, thanks for the question. In terms of data availability, as we noted, we've submitted the data for one of the summer oncology conferences. We are looking at both combination and sequential approaches with PD-1 inhibitors. I'd also point out that one of the things we're beginning to examine is the whole population of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. You can divide them roughly into 1/3 are PD-L1 negative tumors, third have load intermediate PD-L1 expression; and third, have high PD-L1 expression. In the PD-L1 negative population, for instance, the effect of checkpoint inhibitors is quite modest, and that's an area where we are looking at combinations of LUMAKRAS with straight chemotherapy. So, one thing to keep in mind, as this field evolves is that depending on PD-L1 expression, the approach clinically may vary as well. And we are crafting our development program accordingly.\nArvind Sood: RJ, let's take the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon I was hoping a question for Murdo. Murdo, can you just maybe comment know you commented a business review around your thoughts around contracting and specifically biosimilar contracting as we think about both the HUMIRA launch and some of the other products. Any updated thoughts in terms of how that's going or your expectations on specifically HUMIRA for 2023 versus 2024?\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Matthew, for the question. No, I don't really have a lot of new information to update you on. We continue to feel like we're extremely well positioned for the opportunity to be among the first, if not the first, and potentially only biosimilar for a period of time in the market in 2023 as of January 31. We like our profile competitively given that we -- as you'll recall, we use the existing inflammation commercial organization that currently commercialize Enbrel and Otezla that have relationships intact with rheumatologists and dermatologists. We actually have a GI footprint as well supporting us solo. So, we feel that we've got the customer relationships. We definitely have the payer relationships. We have obviously 40 years of biologics manufacturing and supplying every patient every time to provide the confidence for pharmacy benefit managers to make the decision to make our product available as early as possible. So we're excited about the opportunity. And then, of course, after the launch of AMGEVITA in the U.S., we have several other launches, STELARA EYLEA, Soliris and then additional launches thereafter. So, six new biosimilars coming into the market, so this is an area where we're very focused. We've invested in this area. It's important to us for our long-term growth, and we have the capabilities in the market to ensure success.\nArvind Sood: Let's go the next question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.\nYaron Werber: Great. I guess, Peter, maybe for you and for the rest of the team. I guess, Peter, for you, first, the tax rate is increasing incrementally this year. Is that relating to the ongoing litigation with the IRS? Or is that for different reasons? And then maybe, Murdo, for you, the U.S. LUMAKRAS is growing, but it's going poll lower than we expected. Are you expecting ex-US to be bigger or similar in size to the U.S.?\nPeter Griffith: Yes. Let me jump in first here. I don't think Murdo wants to take the tax part of that. So look, we're only moving it up by 50 basis points. Yaron. It's not related at all to the tax litigation. And just maybe that highlights the point that I should make in response to Goeff's good question a little bit earlier, which is why more commentary now. I think this is exactly why, because this is a complicated area for all of you, for the analysts. And we want to make sure you understand our position. We think that it's been a struggle to understand for folks, this just prior conference calls. So we just want to be more specific on it. But in the case of that question itself, it's not related at all. And again, Yaron, thanks for the question. We're confident in our position in the level of reserves where we're at. But we're wanting to provide some more background for you on it. So hopefully, that's helpful. And now I'll turn it over to Murdo to get back to business.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks Peter. You're on. I would say in the U.S., what we're seeing with LUMAKRAS is when that KRAS G12C status is known at the point of progression from first-line treatment to second line. We're getting over 80% of those patients to be treated by LUMAKRAS. So we're penetrating the population when the identification of the KRAS G12C status is there. So that's clearly the lever that we need to ensure improved. And as I answered Salveen's question earlier, this is really an account-by-account book of work. And we're doing it with urgency because we really can't have patients progressing from first line to second line and not have the choice of LUMAKRAS. So this is really important work that we're doing for patients. When we look at the epidemiology of disease in the U.S. versus ex-U.S., I would say that the overall incidence of non-small cell lung cancer is similar between the U.S. and Europe in terms of size. Now one thing just to think about as you go into Asia, as the incidence of KRAS G12C mutational status is a bit lower. If you take Japan as an example, it's about 4% of patients who have non-small cell lung cancer that also have a KRAS G12C mutation compared to 13% in the U.S. So, the mutational epidemiology does change a little when you go outside of U.S. and Europe. So, we would expect the business to be slightly bigger in the U.S. than it will be in Europe and rest of the world.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: I guess two, if I may. First, perhaps on KRAS. There's an interesting disclosure on the slides on how 2,500 patients have taken it in U.S. commercially. And third-party data sets would suggest perhaps 1,200 patients were on the drug in March. And I'm trying to square those two. About 1,200 patients were on therapy in March and 2,500 is total exposure. Crude math would suggest that duration of therapy has tracked five-ish months or so. Is that consistent with your observation? And then secondly, Peter, on the tax court side, can you guide us through what the time line could look like because I feel like this is one of those topics? Now there's a -- two sets of liabilities that people will put in their model somehow at certain probability and having a sense for what the time line could look like for resolution, or at the very least, on when the hearing is or when a key core dates coming up on the tax code, that would be very helpful.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes, perhaps on the first question regarding patient numbers and duration of therapy. I think it's a little bit premature to be able to draw conclusions from numbers on drug versus numbers treated to get to DOT or duration of therapy. What you need to understand, I guess, in the 2,500 patients is we've got a combination of patients who were very late-stage disease, third line and beyond potentially who were challenged with the product and didn't do very well. Whereas the steady state will be more second-line patients having experienced maybe one prior line of therapy who could do quite well as indicated by the long-term follow-up data that we just put out at AACR, where you see about 1/3 of patients being alive at the two-year follow-up mark. So I think it's too early to infer from existing in-market patient numbers to understand what the effective duration of therapy will be. And in fact, I often say this is you really actually need 24 months in market to understand what your look-back period is to understand what your duration of therapy is. So it's going to be quite some time before we know what our real-world duration of therapy will be.\nPeter Griffith: Peter here. So, on the tax side, thank you. In terms of next steps and time line, we will be filing a petition with the U.S. Tax Court within 90 days. And as I mentioned, we will vigorously contest 2013 through 2015 notice through the judicial process. We plan to see consolidation of the 2013-2015 period with the ongoing 2010 to 2012 tax court case. And as I said, it will take several years for this to resolve itself. So that's the current time frame as we see it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Maybe to focus for a second on TEZSPIRE. I was looking to get a little bit more color there, specifically how you think about the importance of the J-code there and the extent that could drive an inflection in sales and I guess to the extent that's been an impediment to date. And then obviously, you started WAYFINDER recently. In the past, you guys kind of talked down the importance of the source results. So as we think about WAYFINDER, is that sort of critical in addressing that gap or simply nice to have some color there would be helpful.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Carter, on the question regarding TEZSPIRE. We're really excited about the market response to TEZSPIRE by having such a novel, unique product where the profile really simplifies the treatment of severe uncontrolled asthma, particularly for pulmonologists who have so much else to do, that they're looking for a simple solution that can treat their patients without being limited by phenotypic or biomarker status. So overall, we think it's going really well. It's clearly a benefit to have a permanent J-code in the market, which, as I mentioned, will be coming July 1. That gives confidence to providers and to their billing staff that they can code the product appropriately and have a high degree of assurance on reimbursement. I think they know the reimbursement is happening now, but it's also tied to reimbursement for some of these practices. Some of them run pretty tight cash flows. And knowing that the permanent J-code should expedite the time to reimbursement will actually help. So yes, I'd say it's going to be helpful. But I would say the in-market response currently is really good. And we're clearly providing product to patients who are going through that reimbursement step in that process so that they can get on therapy and have access to the medicine. But yes, we'd be looking for additional sales force -- sales growth in the back half of the year.\nDavid Reese: Yes, Carter. And in terms of WAYFINDER, this trial, we believe, will address some of the methodologic limitations. We believe we saw in the SOURCE trial. The sample size is much larger. It's a single-arm trial, sample size over 300 patients. Patients can be on a higher dose of steroids. There can be a more rapid corticosteroid taper. And we're looking at the effects earlier at earlier time points. All of these, I think, give us confidence that we will see effectiveness of TEZSPIRE in the setting of lowering oral corticosteroid use. In addition, we presented recently at the Quad AI meeting updated data from NAVIGATOR and other trials showing a very profound reduction in exacerbations in patients on oral corticosteroids. Again, I think this is going to be a really important drug for the treatment of asthma across a range of phenotypes, and we're quite confident in the development program going forward.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas from Truist. Your line is open.\nRobyn Karnauskas: So just a couple on Repatha. So just your thoughts on inclisiran with the permanent J-code coming in July and your thoughts on the impact on Repatha in the second half of the year? And then just a second, you have impressive growth with Repatha. Maybe you could give a little bit more color on script trends by doctor. Are you seeing more scripts by cardiologists here some trends that give you confidence that, that growth can continue as far as who is prescribing the drug versus I think previously in the early days, it was lipidologist mailing.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Robin. We are pleased with the evolution of Repatha. The growth is actually fairly consistent across the broad cardiology community. So it's not just your podologist, a variety of cardiologists. We're seeing general community cardiologists. We also have a large effort focused on integrated delivery networks and hospital systems where we have been successful in establishing a more standardized way of treating the some 25 million high-risk ASCVD patients in the U.S. that end up in an acute care facility for their MI or other events that they've been admitted for. And unfortunately, many of them don't even get a lipid panel, and many of them get discharged without appropriate recommendations or initiation of treatment. So we've stepped that up quite a bit, and we're seeing improvements quality of care. And those patients are being discharged then to the community cardiologists and/or primary care physicians with clearer intent on more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy or cardiovascular risk reduction. So that's definitely helping. For future growth, we're obviously going to continue that effort, and we're going to continue to expand that IDN work that we're going to do in the U.S., but we're also going to invest incrementally in primary care, given that we're seeing some spontaneous prescribing with primary care. So we're very pleased with the growth of Repatha. Ex-U.S., the other thing I would mention is we got the Jan 1 listing for Repatha in the China National Reimbursement Drug List, which has been a good launch for us there. And our team in China is doing a nice job of ensuring that Repatha is an option for high-risk ASCVD patients in that country. So really, I think we've got a large amount of headroom for growth on this product. there's a large patient population, and we've got good momentum now in cardiology, and we need to continue to build that into primary care and around the world. With respect to inclisiran, obviously, they're a competitor in the market. But given that they don't yet have event reduction data, even with reimbursement coding, I think they're still limited in what they can promote. But again, there's tons of patients out there that need more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy and more aggressive cardiovascular risk reduction, and we see that the market can bear a lot of people talking about this severe disease, the number one killer in the world for everybody that's concerned about patients and what we can do about it. So overall, we're still very bullish.\nBob Bradway: RJ, I know we've got several colors still hoping to ask questions. And I just want to give the callers heads up that we'll probably go a few minutes over the top of the hour. So, why don't we take the next question, and we'll do our best to get to everybody? And if we're unable to do that, then we'll, obviously, Arvind and his team will be available later.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Maybe a question on TEZSPIRE. So given that right now, it needs to be administered by a provider, do you -- what kind of reservation do you expect from the doctors at this point in terms of prescribing the agent, given that Dupi is available for self administration. And the question is, is there a possibility in the future that you could come up with a self-administration injection, which could actually help it become a self-administered at-home product.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Mohit. Unfortunately, because severe asthma, especially uncontrolled severe asthma is such an acute condition, many of these patients are under frequent care of a pulmonologists that are an allergist. And so they're seeing their physician on a very regular basis. And I think given our very convenient once month dosing, it's seen as a fairly easy product to administer. And of course, it's early days in the launch, but the feedback has been that the physician administration is not a barrier to initiation of TEZSPIRE. And allergists, in particular, are used to physician-administered products. What I think the benefit side of this is really playing out is that they have much less work to do on the biomarker side or the phenotypic assessment side. And so we've simplified their workflow in that regard. I do think over the long haul, we'll continue to evaluate what we need to do to ensure that there's convenience and maintenance for patients. And obviously, we're looking at other indications and other life cycle opportunities for test buyer. So we'll continue to assess whether or not we want to provide a self-administered option. I mean, clearly, the product could be developed that way, and we continue to look at that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dane Leone from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nDane Leone: Congrats on the quarter. One question for me. Presuming the dose equivalency study of LUMAKRAS actually demonstrates that 240-milligram Q-day is equivalent to 960. How are you playing on managing that transition at the end of the year? And the reason we get this question a lot from investors is, obviously, that will coincide with the presumable launch of a competitor in the KRAS G12C space. Maybe to frame it, just from a script being given 30-day script being given at the end of the year, if this dose equivalency does show that lower dose is equivalently effective, that 30-day turns into a 120-day script? Just how is your team thinking of managing this? And is there any expected change to pricing that would be enacted if the lower dose is seen as equivalent?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes, it's a pretty detailed hypothetical. What I would say is, first off, we remain confident that the 960-milligram dose is the right dose. And clearly, the safety and efficacy benefit of that product looks very good. And given the long-term follow-up data, clearly, it's a high bar for us to be able to see if it can be approved upon at a lower dose. So that's the one question that remains to be answered. The way, I guess, I can't directly answer your question because there's so many different complicated variables to it. But what I would say is, we continue to look at the best way to provide the right treatment for continuing patients. So if you're a second-line non-small cell lung cancer patient, you've been prescribed LUMAKRAS at 960. You're taking it, you've responded and you're stable. I'm not sure any oncologist is going to want to lower your dose, if you're a continuing patient. Now we've seen that in other disease areas where there might have been a dose change either to go up or to go down, where patients who are on a stable dose usually stay on that. So that would be my one bit of additional commentary to your question. But we'll wait and we'll see the data and we'll handle it according to what the data say and what the FDA guys us to do.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: I wanted to ask one from Murdo on Otezla now that we have the full label or kind of the full spectrum approval as of last December. So have you seen any sort of barriers for the more mild patients do these patients need to go to any sort of step edits or are they able to get it pretty freely? Do you expect that to change over the course of the year? Just love to get some color on how you're pushing it or marketing in those patients.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks for the question, Evan. No, we're really pleased with the response from payers and PBMs to ensuring that the expanded label now regardless of severity of psoriasis the patients can have strong access and good affordability for the product. In fact, we've actually improved access this year versus last year. So, we've been able to produce some of the prior authorization criteria, things like percentage of body surface area. There are there are some medical policies of prior authorizations where that's described as a percentage. We've had many of those removed. So we've actually opened up access for those patients. And I think that year to prescribe Otezla for that milder patient. I was at the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in March and spoke to many dermatologists and asked them what their prescribing experience was like and what the reimbursement experience was. And I think many of them played back to us that Otezla was easier than it had been in the past to prescribe for that milder patient. The other thing we did was we enhanced our co-pay systems and our own bridging programs to ensure that, that launch would go well. So far, so good, off to a good start, but I don't anticipate access being an impediment.\nArvind Sood: RJ, in consideration to the folks on the East Coast, it's past the hour. So why don't we take two more questions, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nGavin Scott: It's Gavin on for Cory. I just had a follow-up from a question earlier in the queue on LUMAKRAS pembro combo data late in the summer. I guess just of the lung cancer patients, can you remind us if this is predominantly second line plus? Or will there be sufficient patients in the front line to assess the pathway or a path forward? And then should we also look for multiple doses and/or different dosing administration. I think you've discussed in the past sequential dosing versus other strategies.\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks, Cory. Most of those patients will be second line and beyond. Maybe there is a limited experience in first-line, and we are looking across a range of doses with both combination and sequential therapy. So you can expect to see all of that when the data are presented.\nBob Bradway: Let's take one last question, RJ and after the Rob, just going to make a couple of concluding comments.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Bristow from UBS. Your line is open.\nColin Bristow: I'll keep this quick. Just quickly on the tax issues. Could you just talk about whether we should view this as being essentially limited to 2015? Or is there scope for this really to permeate through to effectively 2021? And then just quickly on LUMAKRAS, there was a small investigator-led data set presented at ELCC a few weeks ago. We saw some relatively high rates of LFT elevations with LUMAKRAS dose in closed sequence with PD-1. I was just curious how this compares to your own experience with the combo versus sequential dosing. And anything else you can say about the path forward there?\nPeter Griffith: Colin, thank you. Look, on the case, we're very confident in the position we've had and our structure and how we've allocated profits between Puerto Rico and the United States. So we're very confident in those reserves. If you did think about going forward, I did suggest in the press release articulated that the IRS is currently auditing 2016 through '18. If they did propose any transfer pricing adjustment, which is in the audit, the magnitude of those adjustments will be lessened by the change in tax rate from the 2017 Tax Act, which reduced the differences between the tax rates applicable in the United States and Puerto Rico by approximately 2/3 beginning in 2018. But once again, we're very confident how we're structured and we're very confident in the level of our reserves. And so we don't anticipate any changes going forward.\nBob Bradway: And Dave, do you want to get to the second piece of that?\nDavid Reese: Yes, with regards to the ELCC data, these were uncontrolled data from an investigator in France, patients receiving monotherapy potentially after checkpoint inhibitors. I can tell you that the rates of hepatic toxicity were higher than we have observed in our clinical trials program and through our ongoing pharmacovigilance effort. So I'm not sure why that was the case, but it was a heterogeneous unselected group of patients. It's hard for us to comment any further on those data.\nBob Bradway: Let me just thank all of you for dialing in. We appreciate your support and your interest in the Company. As we've tried to convey through this call, we feel we're executing well here into the 2022 calendar year. And we look forward to being back together with you after the second quarter to report on our progress through the midyear. Thank you. Sorry, we went a few minutes over. Thanks.\nArvind Sood: Thank you everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call, and we thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. We're pleased with our execution and growth this quarter as we drive towards our long-term goal. I will walk through our first quarter financial results before discussing our 2022 guidance. The financial results are shown on Slide 5 of the slide deck. The first quarter marked another period of solid execution, with year-over-year revenue growth of 6% and non-GAAP EPS growth of 15%. For product sales, strong volume growth of 9% was driven by Repatha, Prolia and EVENITY. Volume growth was partially offset by declines in net selling price and foreign exchange headwinds. Our established portfolio comprised of EPOGEN, Aranesp, NEUPOGEN, Sensipar and Parsabiv, generated almost $1 billion of product sales and continues to deliver strong cash flows. Transitioning to our biosimilars, AMGEVITA remains the most prescribed adalimumab biosimilar in Europe. And looking forward, we will leverage this successful experience as we prepare to launch and grow this product in the United States in January of 2023. For MVASI and KANJINTI, as anticipated, we experienced year-over-year declines driven by net selling price reductions and we expect this trend to continue for these products. Murdo will discuss product sales in more detail in his remarks. Other revenues of $500 million increased 64% year-over-year, primarily driven by our COVID-19 antibody collaboration. First quarter, total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 2% year-over-year as we invest in our pipeline, execute product launches and drive digitalization across the Company. On a non-GAAP basis, cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.1 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 16.6%, primarily due to higher direct manufacturing costs, COVID-19 antibody manufacturing costs and increased royalties and profit shares. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter decreased 1% year-over-year. Recall that Q1 2021 included $53 million related to our acquisition of Rodeo Therapeutics. Excluding the $53 million for Rodeo in 2021, non-GAAP R&D increased 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the first quarter declined 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments and activities and driving productivity. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were a net $413 million expense in Q1. This line item is driven by interest expense and our share of BeiGene results as a result of our use of the equity method of accounting. We have a strong balance sheet, generates significant cash flow and retain excellent financial flexibility to evaluate strategic business development opportunities. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, investing in the best innovation, internal and external; second, investing in our business through capital expenditures, including for our new environmentally friendly facilities under construction in Ohio and North Carolina; and third, returning capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $1.94 per share in the quarter, representing a 10% increase from Q4 2021; and fourth, opportunistic share repurchases, including 24.6 million shares of common stock in the first quarter, which included 23.3 million initial shares received and retired under the accelerated stock buyback agreement. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2022. We're pleased with our growth to date in 2022, and we're tracking to our 2022 plan. Accordingly, we're reaffirming our 2022 guidance with a revenue range of $25.4 billion to $26.5 billion and a non-GAAP EPS range of $17 to $18. This non-GAAP EPS guidance does not include upfront expenses that may occur from certain types of transactions in the future. Similar to our peers, we have updated our non-GAAP policy to no longer exclude such expenses from our non-GAAP results in accordance with guidance recently issued by the SEC. For reference, the only impact as we recast 2021 to incorporate this change is that our non-GAAP operating expenses will now include two items that were previously excluded in 2021. First, $1.5 billion recorded and acquired in-process R&D associated with the Five Prime acquisition in Q2 2021. And second, $400 million recorded in research and development related to an upfront payment to license rights to AMG 451 from Kyowa-Kirin Corporation in Q3 2021. Important additional points to consider for the remainder of 2022: foreign exchange had an adverse impact on our Q1 2022 sales, and based on current rates, it is expected to create headwinds to our reported product sales of approximately $400 million year-over-year and has been included in our guidance. We note that while the results of our hedging program are reported in product sales, our hedging program is designed to partially mitigate the foreign exchange impact on our net income over the full year. In total, our 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% or approximately $0.35. We continue to expect other revenue for 2022 to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion. Q1 included a majority of our full year's projected revenue from our COVID collaboration and recall that these revenues in 2021 were recognized across Q2 to Q4. Our COVID collaboration revenue outlook depends on the state of the pandemic and continued government support. Our expectations for total non-GAAP operating expenses for 2022 are unchanged from the last time we spoke. However, when comparing against our recast 2021 results, total non-GAAP operating expenses will now reflect a low double-digit decrease year-over-year. We continue to expect 2022 operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect cost of sales as a percent of product sales to be 15.5% to 16.5%. Our expectations for non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2022 remain unchanged. Based on our recast 2021 results, in response to the SEC guidance mentioned above, which increased non-GAAP R&D expense in 2021 by $400 million, our expected 2022 non-GAAP R&D expense now equates to a decrease of 4% to 6% year-over-year. We continue to expect SG&A spend to be flat year-over-year as a percentage of product sales. And we now expect other income and expenses to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, reflecting increasing interest rates and our share of BeiGene's results. This is a change from our previous range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. And for the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate range of 13.5% to 14.5%, up from our prior guidance of 13% to 14%. You've had an opportunity to read the update to our litigation and dispute with the IRS over the proposed adjustments for the period from 2010 to 2015, included in the press release. We firmly believe that the adjustments proposed by the IRS for that time period and the penalties proposed by the IRS of the 2013 to 2015 period are without merit. Further, the amount of the adjustments proposed by the IRS for 2010 to 2015 period overstates by billions of dollars, the magnitude of the dispute. We filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court in July 2021 to contest the adjustments previously proposed for the 2010 to 2012 period. And we plan to file another petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest the adjustments proposed in the notice for the 2013 to 2015 period. The dispute is expected to take several years to resolve. Amgen believes the IRS assertion of approximately $2 billion in penalties for the 2013 to 2015 period is wholly unwarranted. We've applied a consistent transfer pricing methodology since 2002. We've documented that transfer pricing methodology is required under relevant tax regulations, and have extensively discussed that methodology with the IRS across multiple tax audits over multiple tax years. The IRS has never previously proposed transfer pricing penalties. Amgen also believes, based upon the positions advanced by the IRS, that the IRS adjustments for the 2010 to 2015 period are overstated by approximately $2 billion due to the IRS failure to account for certain income and expenses. Amgen has reported its income and expenses in a consistent manner for many years, and the IRS has appropriately accounted for the Company's income and expenses in all prior audits. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the 2010 to 2015 period would be reduced by up to approximately $3.1 billion of repatriation tax previously accrued with respect to the Company's Puerto Rico earnings. Amgen previously made advanced tax deposits to the IRS, totaling $1.1 billion for the 2010 and to 2015 period. These deposits would further reduce any additional cash tax that could be imposed. The IRS is currently auditing the 2016 to 2018 period, -- we expect the audit to continue for several years, and it is possible that the 2010 to 2015 dispute will be resolved before the conclusion of the 2016 the 2018 audit and administrative appeals process. Any transfer pricing adjustments the IRS may propose for this period will be lessened by the change in tax rates resulting from the 2017 tax reform law, which reduced the difference between the tax rates applicable in the U.S. and Puerto Rico by approximately 2/3 beginning in 2018. We are highly confident in our positions in the litigation and dispute. We are grateful to all of our highly skilled colleagues in Puerto Rico and their important and ongoing contributions to Amgen's mission of serving patients. And now back to the mission of serving every patient every time. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen remains strong given the strength of the business and our outstanding and dedicated team of 24,000 colleagues that deliver every day for patients. This concludes the financial update. I'll now turn it over to Murdo. Yes. Goeff, thank you for the question. Look, we wouldn't -- we're in litigation, so we wouldn't comment on discussions with the IRS first. And then secondly, on reserves, as you can understand, we don't comment on where we're at in terms of the size of the reserves other than we would just simply say that we're very confident in our position and the level of reserves that we've established. And as we said, this is about Puerto Rico and the allocation of profits between the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, where we perform a majority of our global manufacturing. Puerto Rico is home to our flagship manufacturing complex, 30-year presence, 2,400 -- 2,400 highly skilled employees, over $4 billion in capital investments. And as we said, we believe that the IRS positions are without merit. We're going to vigorously contest those adjustments proposed for 2010 through 2015. Yes. Let me jump in first here. I don't think Murdo wants to take the tax part of that. So look, we're only moving it up by 50 basis points. Yaron. It's not related at all to the tax litigation. And just maybe that highlights the point that I should make in response to Goeff's good question a little bit earlier, which is why more commentary now. I think this is exactly why, because this is a complicated area for all of you, for the analysts. And we want to make sure you understand our position. We think that it's been a struggle to understand for folks, this just prior conference calls. So we just want to be more specific on it. But in the case of that question itself, it's not related at all. And again, Yaron, thanks for the question. We're confident in our position in the level of reserves where we're at. But we're wanting to provide some more background for you on it. So hopefully, that's helpful. And now I'll turn it over to Murdo to get back to business. Peter here. So, on the tax side, thank you. In terms of next steps and time line, we will be filing a petition with the U.S. Tax Court within 90 days. And as I mentioned, we will vigorously contest 2013 through 2015 notice through the judicial process. We plan to see consolidation of the 2013-2015 period with the ongoing 2010 to 2012 tax court case. And as I said, it will take several years for this to resolve itself. So that's the current time frame as we see it. Colin, thank you. Look, on the case, we're very confident in the position we've had and our structure and how we've allocated profits between Puerto Rico and the United States. So we're very confident in those reserves. If you did think about going forward, I did suggest in the press release articulated that the IRS is currently auditing 2016 through '18. If they did propose any transfer pricing adjustment, which is in the audit, the magnitude of those adjustments will be lessened by the change in tax rate from the 2017 Tax Act, which reduced the differences between the tax rates applicable in the United States and Puerto Rico by approximately 2/3 beginning in 2018. But once again, we're very confident how we're structured and we're very confident in the level of our reserves. And so we don't anticipate any changes going forward."

            "name": "Bob Bradway",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. When we last spoke in February, we told you that we'd be focused on execution and that we have a number of opportunities in place that should enable us to deliver long-term attractive growth. In the first quarter of the year, we executed well on these many opportunities, delivering 6% revenue growth and 15% earnings per share growth. We achieved this performance despite the effects of COVID during the first two months of the year, currency headwinds, and of course, net selling price declines. The innovative brands that we highlighted in February continued to generate strong volume growth in the first quarter, including Repatha, which was up 49%; Prolia, up 10%; EVENITY, up 59%; and Otezla, up 7% as well as several of our oncology products, which also generated attractive volume growth in the quarter. Our two newest innovative medicines, LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE, are off to a strong start offering compelling new treatment options for patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer and severe asthma, respectively. And we're also pursuing significant new indications for both of these products. Let me just say, with respect to the five high-quality biosimilars we have on the market, that they're performing well and in line with our expectations. As we've noted previously, growth for the portfolio of biosimilar products over time will come through the steady introduction of new products, including the U.S. launch of AMGEVITA, our biosimilar to HUMIRA in January of next year. AMGEVITA is the first of six new biosimilars that we expect to launch by the end of the decade. International growth is an important component of our long-term strategy, and we saw a strong volume growth outside the U.S. of 15% in the first quarter and nearly 30% volume growth in the Asia Pacific region. Turning to our pipeline. We're advancing, as you're aware, a number of mid- to late-stage potentially first-in-class opportunities in inflammation, oncology and general medicine while continuing to invest in our innovative marketed brands and biosimilars. Since our business review, we've had important data readouts for LUMAKRAS, Repatha and ABP 654, which is our Phase 3 biosimilar candidate to STELARA. We have several more data milestones that come through the remainder of the year. Looking to the longer term, we continue to thoughtfully invest in an integrated set of discovery research capabilities, including human data and generative biology, as we look to significantly expand the number of targets we can pursue, reduce cycle times, and increase the probability of our success. As to our commitment to innovation, we're committed to pursuing the best innovation available, whether it comes through our own efforts or is sourced externally, and our strong balance sheet and cash flows will enable us to continue to invest in innovation in both organically and through business development. Our work to serve patients comes at a time when society is confronting many challenges. We're doing our part to address these as we have throughout our history, with a focus in four areas: removing barriers that limit equitable access to health care, working toward a more adjusted society, minimizing our environmental impact, and ensuring that our actions and culture reflect Amgen values. If you're interested in learning more, our latest environmental, social and governance report was published earlier today and is available on our website. Before I turn to Peter, let me just thank my Amgen colleagues around the world for their commitment to serving patients and outstanding execution. Now Peter, over to you. Okay. Thank you, Dave. RJ, could you remind our callers of the process for submitting a question, we're happy to answer questions now. Yes, Mike, go ahead. Why don't I take the last piece of that, and Dave, why don't you respond to the first? I'll start. I think Murdo wanted to comment as well. Good. Jump in. Thanks, Jay. I think you raised an incredibly important question. As you're all aware, cardiovascular disease is one of our three principal areas of therapeutic areas for research. It remains an area of focus for us going forward. It remains the number one public health burden in terms of morbidity and mortality across the globe. And that, in part, is what spurs our commitment here with Repatha. Murdo will comment in a minute, but we believe there is tremendous opportunity to serve patients on a hypothesis that's probably the best proved in medicine in terms of LDL cholesterol. You mentioned the LPa program, Olpasiran, or AMG 890. Just to remind everyone, LPa is probably the single most important driver outside of LDL cholesterol in terms of the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. As I noted, we're looking forward to over the next couple of months, Phase 2b data in those programs. And our goal would be to transition Phase 3 as quickly as possible if those data replicate what we saw in Phase 1. In addition, we have a very active preclinical research portfolio, I think, indicating our ongoing strategic commitment to this area. Murdo, maybe I'll turn it to you next and then Bob can talk about the business development. Yes. And there, it's very simple, Jay. We've challenged our business development and research teams to find attractive innovation externally that we can add to our portfolio. So we're looking for things that we can add value to every day in cardiovascular disease as well as in inflammatory diseases and in cancer. RJ, I know we've got several colors still hoping to ask questions. And I just want to give the callers heads up that we'll probably go a few minutes over the top of the hour. So, why don't we take the next question, and we'll do our best to get to everybody? And if we're unable to do that, then we'll, obviously, Arvind and his team will be available later. Let's take one last question, RJ and after the Rob, just going to make a couple of concluding comments. And Dave, do you want to get to the second piece of that? Let me just thank all of you for dialing in. We appreciate your support and your interest in the Company. As we've tried to convey through this call, we feel we're executing well here into the 2022 calendar year. And we look forward to being back together with you after the second quarter to report on our progress through the midyear. Thank you. Sorry, we went a few minutes over. Thanks."

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks Peter. First quarter product sales increased 2% year-over-year, we continue to progress our volume-driven growth strategy, which led to a 9% volume increase globally in Q1. We delivered record quarterly sales for Repatha, EVENITY and BLINCYTO; and double-digit volume growth for several additional products, including Prolia, KYPROLIS and AMGEVITA. In the first two months of year, COVID-19 affected our business in the U.S. and around the world as the Omicron variant led to diminished capacity in the health care sector and reduced working days for our own sales forces. In March and continuing into April, the impact of Omicron in the U.S. receded, which allowed us to engage in increased face-to-face customer interactions. Provider and patient activity have also increased leading to improvements in demand for our products. Now let me review some product details, beginning with our General Medicine portfolio, which includes Prolia, EVENITY, Repatha and Aimovig. Overall revenue for our general medicine portfolio grew 19% year-over-year with 23% volume growth. In bone health, Prolia sales grew 12% year-over-year. Volumes grew 10%, fueled by an increase in both new and repeat patients. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bond portfolio, had record sales of $170 million for the quarter, driven by strong volume growth across our markets. Moving to Repatha, the global leader in the PCSK9 class, Repatha sales increased 15% year-over-year, driven by 49% volume growth. And in the U.S., we saw 41% volume growth. Net selling prices declined as we offered higher rebates to support broad Medicare Part D and commercial patient access. Outside the U.S., sales grew 12% with strong volume growth coming from the inclusion of Repatha on China's National Reimbursement Drug List beginning January 1. We remain focused on increasing Repatha market penetration globally to address the significant unmet medical need in treating high-risk cardiovascular patients. Moving to our inflammation portfolio. Otezla delivered 7% year-over-year volume growth in the first quarter. In the U.S., we saw a strengthening of the market with Otezla remaining the market leader, achieving a 30% share of patients who are new to systemic agents for psoriasis. Otezla's recently expanded label has been well received by payers, providers and patients. We're seeing early signs of physicians using more systemic treatments for mild psoriasis patients, and the majority of dermatologists anticipate increasing the use of Otezla for mild psoriasis. Globally, Otezla sales decreased 5% year-over-year due to net price declines and lower inventory levels in the U.S. across wholesale and specialty pharmaceutical channels. Otezla net price declines in the U.S. were driven primarily by enhancements to our co-pay and bridge programs to support new patients starting treatment. Looking forward, we expect lower year-on-year price erosion for the remaining quarters of 2022. We also expect continued volume growth driven by broader adoption of Otezla, given our unique broad indication regardless of the severity of psoriasis. Enbrel sales decreased 7% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by declines in net selling price and inventory levels. Year-over-year, volume remained flat in the first quarter, supported by Enbrel's long track record of efficacy and safety. Our launch of TEZSPIRE is off to a strong start with $7 million in sales in the first quarter. Initial feedback from payers, providers and patients is very positive. Physician's unaided awareness increased to greater than 65% since launch, supported by our disease state education programs. On the access front, TEZSPIRE is a medical benefit product for which we expect permanent reimbursement coding as of July 1 of this year. Both allergists and pulmonologists acknowledge TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated properties and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe asthma who are uncontrolled or biologic eligible without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations. Moving to the hematology and oncology business, our six innovative products grew 17% year-over-year with 11% volume growth. We saw strong volume growth from KYPROLIS, Nplate and BLINCYTO which we expect to continue throughout this year. XGEVA sales grew 7% year-over-year, while volumes declined 2%. Our launch of LUMAKRAS is progressing well with revenues of $62 million in the first quarter, representing 38% quarter-over-quarter growth. In the U.S., LUMAKRAS has been prescribed to approximately 2,500 patients by over 1,500 physicians in both academic and community settings since launch. While approximately 80% of patients in the U.S. are tested for their KRAS G12C status, the test result is not always available and/or reviewed when the patient progresses beyond first-line therapy. The opportunity to improve care is to ensure the KRAS G12C status is available in the patient chart or electronic medical record and reviewed by the oncologist to ensure that LUMAKRAS is discussed as an option for the patient. LUMAKRAS has strong payer coverage in the U.S., with 93% of patients having formulary access. Outside the U.S., sotorasib has now been approved in nearly 40 countries around the world with recent reimbursement approvals in the United Kingdom and Japan. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 25% year-over-year, while our biosimilars, MVASI and KANJINTI, both hold leading shares, we expect continued net selling price deterioration and volume declines, driven by increased and ASP erosion. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches beginning with AMGEVITA in the United States in January of 2023. Overall, we're executing well against our growth strategy with strong volume trends across our portfolio. With that, I'll turn it to Dave. Thanks, Dave. Underpinning, obviously, the huge unmet medical need of cardiovascular disease is our ability to reach that global population of patients, and we've built the medical and commercial capabilities and global footprint to support that business. We reported 49% volume growth on Repatha, 15% sales growth year-on-year. So we clearly have momentum now, and we continue to feel that there's more for us to do for these patients. We're also very clear that we are focused on improving the affordability of our medicines for these patients. And I think that that's another area we've made great progress. So adding to that portfolio with our own internal pipeline is a welcome thing. And I think Dave's team is working very hard, not only on the pipeline assets, but also to improve the profile of Repatha with the VESALIUS trial, which is ongoing. And of course, the recently announced long-term follow-up trials that were continued, so the profile of Amgen in cardiovascular disease is strong. And I'll turn it over to Bob on the business development. Thanks, Salveen. Maybe I'll start and then turn it over to Dave on the data question. We're obviously working extremely closely with all of the oncology providers to improve their own internal systems, whereby they have that KRAS G12C status with literally fingertip ready for making treatment choices for their patients. What we are seeing is a little bit of a COVID hangover effect. Many of these large oncology networks in the U.S. are short staffed and constrained in the resources that they can deploy against things like EMR enhancements, against things like better workflows for diagnostics and biomarkers, particularly new biomarkers. So we are working literally account by account across the country. We've made huge improvements, and we've seen some very large community oncology networks, which is where 80% of the patient base is treated. They're treated in the community centers. I think in the academic institutions, the testing is very strong, robust. The care is clear, and the test results are available for patients who progress. So it's really in the U.S. community setting where we're working. As we look ex-U.S., we see a different pattern by country. So countries that have advanced biomarker technology and very clear systems like Germany and France, we expect good uptake there and we're already seeing early indicators of that. France, as you may recall, has an early access program called an ATU program where we can actually charge for the product and that's being used already fairly broadly. And in Germany, we're just launching and a few weeks old as we are in Japan. So I think it's a network by network project that we're working intensely with our medical colleagues, with our commercial teams to make sure that no patient slips through. Dave? Thanks, Matthew, for the question. No, I don't really have a lot of new information to update you on. We continue to feel like we're extremely well positioned for the opportunity to be among the first, if not the first, and potentially only biosimilar for a period of time in the market in 2023 as of January 31. We like our profile competitively given that we -- as you'll recall, we use the existing inflammation commercial organization that currently commercialize Enbrel and Otezla that have relationships intact with rheumatologists and dermatologists. We actually have a GI footprint as well supporting us solo. So, we feel that we've got the customer relationships. We definitely have the payer relationships. We have obviously 40 years of biologics manufacturing and supplying every patient every time to provide the confidence for pharmacy benefit managers to make the decision to make our product available as early as possible. So we're excited about the opportunity. And then, of course, after the launch of AMGEVITA in the U.S., we have several other launches, STELARA EYLEA, Soliris and then additional launches thereafter. So, six new biosimilars coming into the market, so this is an area where we're very focused. We've invested in this area. It's important to us for our long-term growth, and we have the capabilities in the market to ensure success. Thanks Peter. You're on. I would say in the U.S., what we're seeing with LUMAKRAS is when that KRAS G12C status is known at the point of progression from first-line treatment to second line. We're getting over 80% of those patients to be treated by LUMAKRAS. So we're penetrating the population when the identification of the KRAS G12C status is there. So that's clearly the lever that we need to ensure improved. And as I answered Salveen's question earlier, this is really an account-by-account book of work. And we're doing it with urgency because we really can't have patients progressing from first line to second line and not have the choice of LUMAKRAS. So this is really important work that we're doing for patients. When we look at the epidemiology of disease in the U.S. versus ex-U.S., I would say that the overall incidence of non-small cell lung cancer is similar between the U.S. and Europe in terms of size. Now one thing just to think about as you go into Asia, as the incidence of KRAS G12C mutational status is a bit lower. If you take Japan as an example, it's about 4% of patients who have non-small cell lung cancer that also have a KRAS G12C mutation compared to 13% in the U.S. So, the mutational epidemiology does change a little when you go outside of U.S. and Europe. So, we would expect the business to be slightly bigger in the U.S. than it will be in Europe and rest of the world. Yes, perhaps on the first question regarding patient numbers and duration of therapy. I think it's a little bit premature to be able to draw conclusions from numbers on drug versus numbers treated to get to DOT or duration of therapy. What you need to understand, I guess, in the 2,500 patients is we've got a combination of patients who were very late-stage disease, third line and beyond potentially who were challenged with the product and didn't do very well. Whereas the steady state will be more second-line patients having experienced maybe one prior line of therapy who could do quite well as indicated by the long-term follow-up data that we just put out at AACR, where you see about 1/3 of patients being alive at the two-year follow-up mark. So I think it's too early to infer from existing in-market patient numbers to understand what the effective duration of therapy will be. And in fact, I often say this is you really actually need 24 months in market to understand what your look-back period is to understand what your duration of therapy is. So it's going to be quite some time before we know what our real-world duration of therapy will be. Thanks, Carter, on the question regarding TEZSPIRE. We're really excited about the market response to TEZSPIRE by having such a novel, unique product where the profile really simplifies the treatment of severe uncontrolled asthma, particularly for pulmonologists who have so much else to do, that they're looking for a simple solution that can treat their patients without being limited by phenotypic or biomarker status. So overall, we think it's going really well. It's clearly a benefit to have a permanent J-code in the market, which, as I mentioned, will be coming July 1. That gives confidence to providers and to their billing staff that they can code the product appropriately and have a high degree of assurance on reimbursement. I think they know the reimbursement is happening now, but it's also tied to reimbursement for some of these practices. Some of them run pretty tight cash flows. And knowing that the permanent J-code should expedite the time to reimbursement will actually help. So yes, I'd say it's going to be helpful. But I would say the in-market response currently is really good. And we're clearly providing product to patients who are going through that reimbursement step in that process so that they can get on therapy and have access to the medicine. But yes, we'd be looking for additional sales force -- sales growth in the back half of the year. Thanks, Robin. We are pleased with the evolution of Repatha. The growth is actually fairly consistent across the broad cardiology community. So it's not just your podologist, a variety of cardiologists. We're seeing general community cardiologists. We also have a large effort focused on integrated delivery networks and hospital systems where we have been successful in establishing a more standardized way of treating the some 25 million high-risk ASCVD patients in the U.S. that end up in an acute care facility for their MI or other events that they've been admitted for. And unfortunately, many of them don't even get a lipid panel, and many of them get discharged without appropriate recommendations or initiation of treatment. So we've stepped that up quite a bit, and we're seeing improvements quality of care. And those patients are being discharged then to the community cardiologists and/or primary care physicians with clearer intent on more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy or cardiovascular risk reduction. So that's definitely helping. For future growth, we're obviously going to continue that effort, and we're going to continue to expand that IDN work that we're going to do in the U.S., but we're also going to invest incrementally in primary care, given that we're seeing some spontaneous prescribing with primary care. So we're very pleased with the growth of Repatha. Ex-U.S., the other thing I would mention is we got the Jan 1 listing for Repatha in the China National Reimbursement Drug List, which has been a good launch for us there. And our team in China is doing a nice job of ensuring that Repatha is an option for high-risk ASCVD patients in that country. So really, I think we've got a large amount of headroom for growth on this product. there's a large patient population, and we've got good momentum now in cardiology, and we need to continue to build that into primary care and around the world. With respect to inclisiran, obviously, they're a competitor in the market. But given that they don't yet have event reduction data, even with reimbursement coding, I think they're still limited in what they can promote. But again, there's tons of patients out there that need more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy and more aggressive cardiovascular risk reduction, and we see that the market can bear a lot of people talking about this severe disease, the number one killer in the world for everybody that's concerned about patients and what we can do about it. So overall, we're still very bullish. Thanks, Mohit. Unfortunately, because severe asthma, especially uncontrolled severe asthma is such an acute condition, many of these patients are under frequent care of a pulmonologists that are an allergist. And so they're seeing their physician on a very regular basis. And I think given our very convenient once month dosing, it's seen as a fairly easy product to administer. And of course, it's early days in the launch, but the feedback has been that the physician administration is not a barrier to initiation of TEZSPIRE. And allergists, in particular, are used to physician-administered products. What I think the benefit side of this is really playing out is that they have much less work to do on the biomarker side or the phenotypic assessment side. And so we've simplified their workflow in that regard. I do think over the long haul, we'll continue to evaluate what we need to do to ensure that there's convenience and maintenance for patients. And obviously, we're looking at other indications and other life cycle opportunities for test buyer. So we'll continue to assess whether or not we want to provide a self-administered option. I mean, clearly, the product could be developed that way, and we continue to look at that. Yes, it's a pretty detailed hypothetical. What I would say is, first off, we remain confident that the 960-milligram dose is the right dose. And clearly, the safety and efficacy benefit of that product looks very good. And given the long-term follow-up data, clearly, it's a high bar for us to be able to see if it can be approved upon at a lower dose. So that's the one question that remains to be answered. The way, I guess, I can't directly answer your question because there's so many different complicated variables to it. But what I would say is, we continue to look at the best way to provide the right treatment for continuing patients. So if you're a second-line non-small cell lung cancer patient, you've been prescribed LUMAKRAS at 960. You're taking it, you've responded and you're stable. I'm not sure any oncologist is going to want to lower your dose, if you're a continuing patient. Now we've seen that in other disease areas where there might have been a dose change either to go up or to go down, where patients who are on a stable dose usually stay on that. So that would be my one bit of additional commentary to your question. But we'll wait and we'll see the data and we'll handle it according to what the data say and what the FDA guys us to do. Thanks for the question, Evan. No, we're really pleased with the response from payers and PBMs to ensuring that the expanded label now regardless of severity of psoriasis the patients can have strong access and good affordability for the product. In fact, we've actually improved access this year versus last year. So, we've been able to produce some of the prior authorization criteria, things like percentage of body surface area. There are there are some medical policies of prior authorizations where that's described as a percentage. We've had many of those removed. So we've actually opened up access for those patients. And I think that year to prescribe Otezla for that milder patient. I was at the American Academy of Dermatology meeting in March and spoke to many dermatologists and asked them what their prescribing experience was like and what the reimbursement experience was. And I think many of them played back to us that Otezla was easier than it had been in the past to prescribe for that milder patient. The other thing we did was we enhanced our co-pay systems and our own bridging programs to ensure that, that launch would go well. So far, so good, off to a good start, but I don't anticipate access being an impediment."

            "name": "David Reese",
            "content": "Thanks, Murdo. Good afternoon, everyone. First quarter was one of continued execution in R&D where we focused on progressing our robust innovative clinical pipeline comprised of many potential first-in-class opportunities. Beginning with inflammation, we initiated two additional studies with TEZSPIRE in severe asthma. The WAYFINDER Phase 3b study, designed to demonstrate a reduction in oral corticosteroid use in adult participants on long-term oral corticosteroid therapy in the PASSAGE Phase 4 real-world effectiveness study designed to evaluate TEZSPIRE in adult and adolescent participants, including underrepresented populations such as Black Americans, smokers and patients with asthma-COPD overlap. Phase 3 planning continues for rocatinlimab, formerly AMG 451, an anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with heterogeneous moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Rocatinlumab binds activated pathogenic T cells expressing OX40. Its unique mechanism of action, rocatinlimab inhibits and prevents the expansion of activated pathogenic T cells and reduces their number. Thus, rocatinlimab has the potential to lead to profound disease control. In addition, this provides a rationale for longer dosing intervals, with the prospect of achieving disease modification. ROCKET, the comprehensive rocatinlimab Phase 3 program, remains on track to initiate in mid-2022. In our biosimilar portfolio, last week, we announced preliminary results from a Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ABP 654 compared to STELARA, ustekinumab, in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The study met the primary efficacy endpoint, demonstrating no clinically meaningful differences between ABP 654 and STELARA. Now turning to oncology. Earlier this month, we presented data at AACR on outcomes from a two-year analysis of the LUMAKRAS CodeBreaK 100 trial, which demonstrated the long-term clinical benefit, including overall survival of patients with KRAS G12C mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with LUMAKRAS. These data showed that roughly 1/3 of patients were still alive at two years, and the prolonged tumor response was also observed with a 41% objective response rate by central review. While this was a single-arm trial without a control arm, the efficacy data compare favorably with anticipated outcomes in this patient population based on historical data. There were no new safety signals reported over the course of this two-year follow-up analysis. We have submitted data from the LUMAKRAS PD-1 combination and SHIP2 combination cohorts to a medical congress taking place in the late summer, while top line results from the LUMAKRAS confirmatory Phase 3 study versus docetaxel and the dose comparison study are on track for Q3 and Q4, respectively. Also in the lung cancer setting, we have submitted updated Phase 1 data of tarlatamab, our DLL3-targeting half-life extended BiTE molecule being used in patients with relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer to a medical congress taking place in the late summer. And we plan to initiate DeLLphi-303, a Phase 1b study testing tarlatamab in combination with standard of care in first-line small cell lung cancer this quarter. Finally, in squamous non-small cell lung cancer, we are enrolling patients in a Phase 1b study of bemarituzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against FGFR2b. Turning to gastrointestinal cancers. We presented data at the ASCO plenary series in February, where LUMAKRAS demonstrated a centrally confirmed objective response rate of 21% and disease control rate of 84% across 38 heavily pretreated advanced pancreatic cancer patients. We continue to explore the benefit of LUMAKRAS as a monotherapy and when combined with other agents in this setting. In third-line colorectal cancer, Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix is enrolling patients. In gastric cancer, a Phase 1b study of bemarituzumab plus oral chemotherapy regimens in tumors with FGFR2b overexpression has been initiated. In General Medicine, we were pleased to announce the results from two Repatha open-label extension trials, the FOURIER OLE, studies designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of Repatha in more than 6,600 high-risk adults with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease on stable effective statin therapy. In the OLE studies, patients received Repatha for approximately five years, with some patients receiving Repatha for up to 8.5 years in aggregate across the FOURIER and OLE studies. The combined results from these studies reinforce the long-term safety and tolerability of Repatha in lowering LDL cholesterol. We are extremely encouraged by the sustained benefit of this medicine in patients with cardiovascular disease who still struggle to get their LDL-cholesterol level below the recommended targets. These extended results for patients on Repatha are consistent with what the health care community has learned over the past seven decades about the benefits of lowering cholesterol. That is robust and sustained LDL cholesterol reduction affects the spectrum of important cardiovascular outcomes. We look forward to sharing these data at a medical congress later this year. In conclusion, we continue to execute crisply across our innovative and biosimilar portfolios and look forward to sharing new data from a number of our programs throughout the rest of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to Bob for Q&A. If we replicate what we've observed so far with LUMAKRAS, I think, Mike, we would be quite confident in the likelihood that the Phase 3 trial against docetaxel, which, of course, has been around for decades, will be positive. We would, of course, discuss with the FDA and other regulatory bodies, how to file these data and move forward with full approvals in terms of effects on the competitive landscape. I'll leave that to others to comment on. But we're very confident in LUMAKRAS at this point. We're approved in roughly 40 countries around the world. The program is moving forward very briskly, and that's our focus right now. And Salveen, thanks for the question. In terms of data availability, as we noted, we've submitted the data for one of the summer oncology conferences. We are looking at both combination and sequential approaches with PD-1 inhibitors. I'd also point out that one of the things we're beginning to examine is the whole population of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. You can divide them roughly into 1/3 are PD-L1 negative tumors, third have load intermediate PD-L1 expression; and third, have high PD-L1 expression. In the PD-L1 negative population, for instance, the effect of checkpoint inhibitors is quite modest, and that's an area where we are looking at combinations of LUMAKRAS with straight chemotherapy. So, one thing to keep in mind, as this field evolves is that depending on PD-L1 expression, the approach clinically may vary as well. And we are crafting our development program accordingly. Yes, Carter. And in terms of WAYFINDER, this trial, we believe, will address some of the methodologic limitations. We believe we saw in the SOURCE trial. The sample size is much larger. It's a single-arm trial, sample size over 300 patients. Patients can be on a higher dose of steroids. There can be a more rapid corticosteroid taper. And we're looking at the effects earlier at earlier time points. All of these, I think, give us confidence that we will see effectiveness of TEZSPIRE in the setting of lowering oral corticosteroid use. In addition, we presented recently at the Quad AI meeting updated data from NAVIGATOR and other trials showing a very profound reduction in exacerbations in patients on oral corticosteroids. Again, I think this is going to be a really important drug for the treatment of asthma across a range of phenotypes, and we're quite confident in the development program going forward. Yes. Thanks, Cory. Most of those patients will be second line and beyond. Maybe there is a limited experience in first-line, and we are looking across a range of doses with both combination and sequential therapy. So you can expect to see all of that when the data are presented. Yes, with regards to the ELCC data, these were uncontrolled data from an investigator in France, patients receiving monotherapy potentially after checkpoint inhibitors. I can tell you that the rates of hepatic toxicity were higher than we have observed in our clinical trials program and through our ongoing pharmacovigilance effort. So I'm not sure why that was the case, but it was a heterogeneous unselected group of patients. It's hard for us to comment any further on those data."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin.\nJustin Claeys: Thank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Vikram Karnani, Jay Bradner, I am pleased to welcome and he is joining us for the first time on our quarterly earnings call, and Peter Griffith, Dave Reese, will also be available during the Q&A session. Given the timing of these Horizon Therapeutics acquisition close, the results as shown in our press release and slides include contribution from the Horizon business from October 6 onwards. For the avoidance of doubt, this will also be the basis for our filed financial results. To supplement this information, Vikram will also provide sales information for these products for the full fourth quarter, including the first week of October as further context in his remarks. Through the course of our discussion today, we'll use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements, which are qualified by our safe harbor statement, and please note that actual results can vary materially. With that, over to you, Bob.\nRobert Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Justin, and let me thank all of you for joining our call. 2023 was another year of performance and progress for Amgen, further positioning us to deliver attractive growth through the end of the decade and beyond. Last year, we delivered double-digit volume growth in all four quarters with balanced growth across products and geographies. 18 [ph] of our medicines generated record annual sales, including Repatha, Prolia EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA. The acquisition of Horizon, which is completed on October 6, gives us a significant new rare disease business that now stands as a fourth pillar of growth alongside our leading general medicine, oncology and inflammation businesses. The medicines we acquired are all very early in their life cycles and by leveraging Amgen's world-class biologics manufacturing, decades of experience in inflammation and our extensive global presence, we believe these products have the potential to reach many more patients around the world. Last year, we also advanced the deepest and most diverse pipeline in our history with promising molecules at all stages of development across our four pillars of growth. We anticipate well over a dozen significant pipeline milestones this year. I'll touch on a few. In General Medicine, we'll generate Phase II data this year for our lead obesity molecule, MariTide, and we're excited, of course, to learn more about this asset. We're also advancing a number of early-stage assets in this space. In Oncology, we have a June 12 PDUFA date for the FDA to complete its priority review of Tarlatamab as a third-line treatment for small cell lung cancer. Tarlatamab is the first bispecific T cell engager shown to be effective in addressing a major solid tumor. In this case, one for which there has been no new treatment in decades and which today has a 5-year survival rate of just 3%. We're studying Tarlatamab in earlier lines of treatment and hope over the fullness of time to be able to serve the tens of thousands of patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer each year in the U.S. and major markets around the world. We've done this very successfully now with our first BiTE BLINCYTO, which has steadily moved into earlier lines of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and we'll take the same approach with yet another promising BiTE at being Xaluritamig in prostate cancer. In inflammation, we'll have Phase III data from Rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis from the first of 1 are now 8 trials in the ROCKE program. And in rare disease, we'll have Phase III data for UPLIZNA and myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease. At a time when a rapidly aging global population needs more innovation, Amgen is delivering, both with the medicines we have in the market today and with the promising new medicines that are advancing in our pipeline. We're also excited by the rapid convergence of biotech and tech, which is enabling us to innovate more quickly and confidently. We've been preparing for this hinge moment for more than a decade and recently named Dave Reese as our first ever Chief Technology Officer to ensure that we're capitalizing on technologies like generative artificial intelligence, not just in R&D, but across the entire company. Succeeding Dave is Amgen's Head of R&D is Jay Bradner. Jay is a physician scientist and a seasoned R&D leader, having served for many years as President of the Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research. Jay previously also served as a faculty member at Harvard Medical School and prior to joining Amgen was a practicing oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We're delighted to have Jay on board and excited by the work that he Dave and the rest of our team will do together to accelerate innovation at Amgen for the good of patients and for the long-term growth of our business. And with that, I want to thank our 27,000 employees around the world for their many contributions to our success. And let me now ask Murdo to talk about our commercial performance in 2023.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Bob, and I'm very pleased with our performance in 2023. Execution was strong across the business, resulting in record sales in the year for 18 brands and robust volume growth across the four pillars of our business. Full year product sales increased 9% year-over-year. Volume growth was 15% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 14% and volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Canada region was 10%. Asia Pacific continues to be our fastest-growing region with 41% volume growth. These results include $954 million of sales from the legacy Horizon portfolio from the period of October 6 through December 31. I'll start with our General Medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia EVENITY and Aimovig. Overall revenue for these four products grew 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year, driven by 18% and 20% volume growth, respectively. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter with volume growth of 35%, partially offset by lower net selling price. Outside of the U.S., we saw 25% volume growth with strength across our regions. In the U.S., volume growth of 48% was driven by a 66% increase in the number of new patients starting treatment. We saw a decline in net selling price in the U.S., primarily driven by new formulary coverage. We expect this additional coverage to lead to strong volume growth, which will more than offset declining net selling price. In addition, some payers have recently removed prior authorization for some patients, which will further ease their access to Repatha. We remain committed to the urgent need to educate physicians and patients on the importance of LDL-C lowering to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In the U.S., we activated more than 20,000 new prescribing physicians in 2023 in both the primary care and cardiology settings. And while we're pleased with this progress, we'll continue to work tirelessly for the many, many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha. Transitioning to bone health, EVENITY had record sales of $318 million for the quarter, driven by 39% volume growth. Osteoporosis disproportionately impacts postmenopausal women and the diagnosis and treatment rates for these patients are low. In the U.S., only 6% of very high-risk patients with osteoporosis are treated with a bone builder, creating an urgent need for treatment with an effective therapy. EVENITY is an important therapy to address this unmet need as it is the only bone builder that works with the body's natural ability to increase bone formation and also decrease bone resorption. We see strong growth potential for EVENITY and we'll continue to apply our proven experience in bone health to ensure it reaches all the patients who need it. Prolia sales grew 12% year-over-year to a record $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter. Volume growth of 10% was supported by real-world evidence reaffirming Prolia superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at a high risk of fracture. Moving to our oncology business, which includes BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and XGEVA. Sales of these six innovative products grew 5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, with 3% volume growth. Full year sales grew 12% year-over-year, driven by 12% volume growth. BLINCYTO sales grew 47% year-over-year to a record $241 million for the fourth quarter. Volume growth of 55% was supported by broad prescribing to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in frontline consolidation treatment. Long term, we see significant growth potential for BLINCYTO from utilization earlier in the front line as part of induction treatment. LUMAKRAS sales increased 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS coming from launches in new markets and additional indications. Vectibix sales increased 5% and KYPROLIS sales grew 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, both driven by volume growth. Nplate sales decreased 18% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by volume decline related to timing of orders placed by the U.S. government, partially offset by volume growth across our regions. Full year sales increased 13%, primarily driven by volume growth, including U.S. government orders. Excluding U.S. government orders, Nplate sales grew 23% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Transitioning to our inflammation business. Otezla sales increased 2% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and 3% volume growth, partially offset by lower inventory levels and lower net selling price. Full year sales decreased 4% driven by lower net selling price and lower inventory levels, partially offset by 2% volume growth. New patient starts for Otezla grew 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by strong execution and increased investment. Competitor free drug programs had a reduced impact in the quarter. Otezla is uniquely positioned to grow in 2024 and beyond, given its indication for all severities of psoriasis, combined with an established clinical profile, broad payer coverage, a lack of testing required for initiation and convenient oral administration. Enbrel sales decreased 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by a 4% impact from unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling price. U.S. volume grew 1% in the fourth quarter, supported by an increase in new patients starting treatment as a result of improved payer coverage. Going forward, we expect net selling price to continue to decline year-over-year driven by higher rebates to maintain broad first-line payer coverage and changes in patient mix. TEZSPIRE continues a strong launch trajectory with $177 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $567 million for the full year. Sales increased 10% sequentially, driven by volume growth. Our successful launch of a self-administered prefilled single-use pen allowed us to expand coverage with major pharmacy benefit managers to over 80%, contributing to higher new patient growth as the year progressed. Moving forward, we expect this expanded coverage will allow TEZSPIRE to help even more patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. Sales of TAVNEOS were $44 million in the quarter and $134 million for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 17% quarter-over-quarter volume growth in the U.S. Approximately 2,700 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 1,700 health care professionals. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our expertise in nephrology and inflammation to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Sales for our biosimilars portfolio grew 10% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year, driven by 27% and 29% volume growth. This volume growth was partially offset by net selling price decline. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. Overall, our execution is strong across the business, underscored by our foundational commitment to serve patients. The four pillars of our portfolio position us well to serve many more patients around the world who can benefit from our innovative therapies. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram, who will cover our rare disease portfolio.\nVikram Karnani: Thanks, Murdo. I am glad to share an update on our rare disease business now that we are 4 months past due close. We are now fully operating as part of Amgen with integration activities ongoing. As Bob has mentioned before, we are excited to be Amgen's fourth pillar of long-term growth. I wanted to make sure you're aware that we are not reporting the full quarter in press release and slides, which reflects sales from October 6 onwards and totaled $954 million. This excludes $41 million of sales that occurred in the first week of October prior to deal close. For the full quarter, our rare disease brands from Horizon delivered product sales of $995 million, representing 6% year-over-year sales growth. Throughout the remainder of my remarks, I will reference full quarter product sales. TEPEZZA, and IGF-1R monoclonal antibody for patients with thyroid eye disease generated $467 million of sales during the entire fourth quarter, representing 3% quarter-over-quarter growth. This is the third quarter in a row of quarter-over-quarter growth for TEPEZZA with the growth largely driven by the U.S. We saw a number of positive leading indicators, including a record number of unique TEPEZZA prescribers, total patient enrollment forms and patient starts in 2023. Additionally, thanks to our efforts, we've been able to generate favorable medical policy changes for greater than 50% of U.S. covered lives, and we expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024. We continue to see approximately 100,000 patients with moderate to severe disease in the U.S. who could benefit from TEPEZZA with the majority of these patients in low clinical activity score settings. Given positive leading indicators and high unmet need, we see a long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA in the U.S., while also recognizing there is some time lag between our execution efforts and the realization of increased patient numbers. International expansion also remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA. TEPEZZA is approved in Brazil, and we are progressing towards approval in additional countries. Our expansion into both Japan and Europe is a high priority with regulatory review underway in Japan and filings in the EU throughout the year. KRYSTEXXA, a PEGylated uricase enzyme for patients with chronic refractory gout delivered a record $280 million in sales for the entire fourth quarter, representing 30% year-over-year growth, driven by continued strong commercial execution. Sales are now annualizing at $80 billion [ph] run rate. Performance was driven by execution across all phases of the patient journey, demand generation, stakeholder engagement and adherence to treatment. UPLIZNA, an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody, which is now the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD, delivered a record $70 million in sales for the entire fourth quarter, representing 68% year-over-year growth. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex U.S. markets. Our remaining ultra-rare portfolio generated $178 million of sales for the entire fourth quarter, primarily driven by our ultra-rare medicines, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI and ACTIMMUNE. Looking ahead at 2024 by leveraging Amgen's world-class biologics capabilities, decades of experience in inflammation and extensive global presence, we are ready to reach more patients than ever before. I will now turn it over to Jay.\nJay Bradner: Thank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to take a minute to convey how thrilled I am to join the Amgen R&D organization and its leadership team. The creativity of our discovery research, expert and expedited clinical development, most authoritative biomanufacturing organization in the industry, all were well known to me before joining. But now on staff at Amgen, I appreciate the strong sense of service, the patients facing serious illness, the like-minded commitment, growing the impact of our medicines and our business and the shared conviction in this remarkable portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines. In 2023, we executed with speed across our clinical pipeline, achieving excellent enrollment in key programs and setting up 2024 as the year with significant data readouts across the portfolio for medicines with the potential to transform patient care. Key highlights in 2023 included the delivery of promising data from four key oncology assets and the attainment of three breakthrough therapy designations in oncology. We initiated pivotal Phase III studies for Tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer, LUMAKRAS in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, along with dazodalibep in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. In General Medicine, as previously disclosed, top line 52-week data from the 592 patient MariTide Phase II study is expected by late 2024. Leveraging the durability of weight loss observed in Phase I and rapid enrollment enjoyed in Phase II, we recently added a part 2 to this study, which explores durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks. Our planning for a comprehensive Phase III program across multiple indications remains on track. Lastly, you may have seen that yesterday, Nature Metabolism published manuscript from Amgen R&D that provides the integration of MariTide preclinical and Phase I data. Beyond MariTide, our obesity strategy encompasses several assets with AMG 786 in Phase I and additional preclinical assets advancing. Our approach is tailored to meet the dynamic needs of obesity treatment, demonstrating a longitudinal commitment to innovation and patient care in this field. The Phase III outcome study of Olpasiran are potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has enrolled more than 7,000 patients globally. This rapid enrollment accomplished in just 1 year across 34 countries and over 700 sites underscores the medical community's strong interest in and the potential impact of Olpasiran. We've deliberately expanded our initial enrollment target from 6,000 to over 7,000 patients to ensure comprehensive demographic representation and to satisfy regional regulatory requirements. We are on track to complete enrollment in the first half of 2024. In oncology, we're focused on approaching high conviction targets with differentiated therapies for large effect size. We're pleased to announce that the FDA granted priority review for BLINCYTO in early-stage CD19-positive B-ALL with a PDUFA date of June 21, 2024. The ongoing Phase III Golden Gate study is enrolling patients to evaluate the effectiveness of alternating BLINCYTO with low intensity chemotherapy here in older adults diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL. We're also planning to amend this study to evaluate subcutaneous administration of blinatumomab with initiation anticipated in the second half of 2024 potentially allowing us to serve more patients in treating physicians. Lastly, we're pleased to announce that just today, the American Journal of Hematology published a manuscript highlighting data from the dose expansion phase of our ongoing Phase Ib study of subcutaneous blinatumomab as a single agent in adult patients with heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL. Of 27 evaluable patients treated, we observed an 85% complete response rate, of which 75% were MRD negative. Subcutaneous blinatumumab is well tolerated with no observed grade 4 cytokine release syndrome. Turning to Tarlatamab, a first-in-class DLL3-targeting BiTE molecule, the FDA granted priority review following promising results from the Phase II DeLLphi-301 clinical trial and a PDUFA date of June 12, 2024. We are rapidly advancing Tarlatamab into earlier lines of treatment, where we have initiated two Phase III studies and plan to initiate a third in the first half of 2024. Xaluritamig, a first-in-class STEAP1 bispecific molecule being studied in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer continues to progress following the presentation of encouraging Phase I data last fall. We are ahead of schedule with the monotherapy dose expansion and expect to complete enrollment in the coming weeks. We've opened a reduced monitoring cohort and are making significant progress in dose range finding studies in combination with novel hormonal therapy combinations. For AMG 193 in oral MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor were encouraged by 9 responses we've seen across 7 MTAP-null solid tumors. MG 193 is a terrific example of a medicine targeting a genetically defined synthetic lethality and a first clinical translation of our induced proximity platform. We're now swiftly moving forward with dose expansion studies and plan to enter master protocols and thoracic and gastrointestinal malignancies, exploring combinations with standard of care in the first half of 2024. In our inflammation portfolio, we continue to explore TEZSPIRE and indications beyond severe asthma, including separate Phase III studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected in the second half of 2024 as well as in eosinophilic esophagitis. We also remain on track to present Phase II COPD data in the first half of 2024. Our ROCKET Phase III program for rocatinlimab, the first-in-class anti- OX40 -mon colonal antibody has successfully enrolled over 2,400 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. We're introducing an 8th study to the ROKET program to explore an auto-injector, and we are planning to initiate both the Phase III study in prurigo nodularis and a Phase II study in asthma this year as we seek to broadly explore the potential of rocatinlimab. Lastly, we are encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline with several mid to late-stage opportunities. In December, TEPEZZA received orphan drug designation in Japan where we've also recently submitted a new drug application for TEPEZZA in thyroid eye disease. To serve additional patients in Japan, we have a Phase III study underway in the study of chronic disease with a low clinical activity score. Beyond Japan, we are progressing TEPEZZA subcutaneous administration to drive increased adoption and improve patient experience and plan to initiate a Phase III study in thyroid eye disease this year. With UPLIZNA, we anticipate important Phase III data readouts this year in myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease. Both diseases with significant unmet need and where we have the potential to make a real difference for patients. Dazodalibep, an innovative CD40-ligand inhibitor fusion protein has entered Phase III for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. This follows encouraging Phase II data with efficacy across patients with moderate to severe systemic disease and patients with high symptom burden. Dazodalibep is the first therapy to demonstrate efficacy in this latter patient population. Closing on our rare disease efforts, we're excited about Fipaxalparant, an LPAR1 antagonist being studied in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, on track for a Phase II proof-of-concept data readout in the second half of 2024. In closing, I'm delighted to report on the important progress we make advancing our innovative pipeline, and I'm looking forward to sharing more pipeline milestones through 2024. I'll now turn it over to you, Peter.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023. In the fourth quarter, total revenue of $8.2 billion grew 20% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $4.71 grew 15% year-over-year. For the full year, we delivered total revenue of $28.2 billion, 7% growth year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $18.65, 5% growth year-over-year. As a reminder, both Q4 and the full year results include Horizon's results beginning October 6 when the acquisition closed. So our financial results will exclude approximately 1 week of Horizon's results from our fourth quarter results. I'll review the details of our fourth quarter and full year financial results before discussing our outlook for 2024. The financial results are shown on Slides 54 to 56 of the slide deck. Turning to our fourth quarter's total revenue of $8.2 billion. We saw product sales increased 20% year-over-year, driven by volume growth of 23%, offset by net selling price decline of 3%. Excluding the impact of Horizon, product sales increased 5% year-over-year driven by volume growth of 9%. Full year total revenues of $28.2 billion grew 7% year-over-year. Product sales increased 9% year-over-year, driven by 15% volume growth. Other revenues decreased 16% year-over-year, primarily due to lower profit and cost sharing from our COVID-19 collaboration with Lilly in 2022. Strong expense discipline resulted in a 50% non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales for the full year 2023. While we continue to focus on both internal and external innovation, investing $4.7 billion in our pipeline and $27.8 billion in our acquisition of Horizon. With product sales volume growth at 23% in Q4 and 15% for the full year, we still efficiently manage the operating expenses of the business. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 18% year-over-year, while full year non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9%. Excluding the impact of Horizon, Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% and full year non-GAAP operating expenses increased 5%. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was flat on a year-over-year basis at 16.3%. For the full year, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales increased by 1.1 percentage points to 17.0%. The full year increase was primarily driven by higher profit share and changes in our product mix, partially offset by the replacement of the Puerto Rico excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the fourth quarter increased 16% year-over-year and 8% year-over-year for the full year primarily due to higher spend on later-stage clinical program and marketed product support, including spend on programs acquired from the Horizon acquisition and continuing investment in our pipeline, including MariTide. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 20% year-over-year, primarily driven by commercial and G&A expenses related to the Horizon acquisition. Full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by commercial and G&A expenses related to the Horizon acquisition, partially offset by a decline in other marketed product spend. Non-GAAP OI&E were about $635 million in expense in the fourth quarter, a $168 million increase year-over-year, primarily driven by increased interest expense related to the debt issued for the Horizon acquisition. Full year non-GAAP OI&E was favorable $279 million year-over-year, primarily driven by the change in accounting for the BeiGene investment to the fair value mark-to-market method and by gains related to early debt retirement, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Our non-GAAP tax rate increased 2.5 percentage points year-over-year to 15.9% in the fourth quarter and 2.7 percentage points year-over-year to 16.5% for the full year primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change mentioned previously. The company generated $7.4 billion of free cash flow in 2023 compared with $8.8 billion in 2022. The decrease is driven by the Horizon transaction and integration costs, higher repatriation tax payments and higher capital expenditures. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flows with the addition of Horizon and are on track with our deleveraging plans to return to our efficient capital structure by the end of 2025. In summary, we continue to execute on our multiple capital allocation priorities. First, we continue to prioritize investments in both internal and external innovation. Our increased spending in non-GAAP R&D of 8% in '23 over '22, coupled with the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, continues to broaden and strengthen our balanced portfolio across therapeutic areas. With our strong late-stage innovative pipeline moving forward through development, we expect our non-GAAP R&D to continue to increase in 2024. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth, including our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. Amgen, Ohio, our new advanced assembly and final product packaging plant has just received license from the FDA for commercial production in January, roughly 2 years after we broke ground and our innovative drug substance plan under construction in North Carolina is expected to be operational by 2026. In addition, we've positioned the organization to accelerate investments in innovation, including leveraging the power of generative artificial intelligence. And third, we returned capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $2.13 per share in the quarter. This represented a 10% increase over that paid in each of 2022 four [ph] quarters. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2024. First, because this is the first full year incorporating the impact of Horizon, we're providing some additional granularity in our guidance, which we don't expect to repeat to the same extent in the future. For 2024, we're expecting revenue of $32.4 billion to $33.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $18.90 to $20.30. As we continue to integrate Horizon, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in 2024, and we're on track to meet the synergies target previously communicated of at least $500 million in pretax cost by year 3 after closing or in 2026. Our revenue range reflects our strong growth outlook driven by numerous opportunities across our four therapeutic area pillars. We will record a full year of legacy Horizon product sales, and we expect continued volume-driven growth in our priority products Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Prolia and BLINCYTO consistent with industry trends in our recent history, we expect mid single-digit price decline for our portfolio in 2024. As a reminder, as you model the first quarter of 2024 and consistent with our historical trends, we expect first quarter product sales to be the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year due to benefit plan changes, insurance reverifications and increased co-pay charges. So we expect the first quarter of 2024 total revenue to grow roughly 20% year-over-year. For the full year, we expect other revenue to be in the range of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. And we continue to efficiently run the business through our disciplined approach to managing operating expenses. In 2024, we're making incremental R&D investments to support our promising late-stage pipeline, including our rapidly advancing oncology programs as discussed following ESMO in October and other programs, including MariTide. Furthermore, the addition of Horizon has an impact on the 2024 operating margin given the timing of when synergies are realized. As a result, we project the full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 48%. Note that we expect non-GAAP operating margin growth to accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter. There are primarily three reasons for this. First, typical lower product sales in Q1, as I mentioned above, and in each of the following quarters. Second, increased spend on our commercial brands will continue building on the investments we made in the second half of 2023, including Repatha, Otezla, and our bone portfolio of EVENITY and Prolia And third, Q1 2024 reflects the addition of Horizon, for which we are just at the beginning stages of realizing synergies given the acquisition close date of October 6. So we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be roughly 43% in the first quarter. I would reiterate that we expect operating margin growth to accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter. We project non-GAAP cost of sales to be in the range of 17% to 18% as a percentage of product sales for the 2024 year. Taking into account the full year of Horizon related expenses, we expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2024 to increase approximately 20% year-over-year with investments also increasing to advance key pipeline assets, including AMG 193, MariTide, rocatinlimab and tarlatamab. We see significant potential in our innovative pipeline, and it is important that we strategically invest now to fully unlock the opportunities ahead to create long-term value for patients, staff and shareholders. And for non-GAAP SG&A spend, we expect 2024 full year amounts as a percentage of product sales to be between 21% and 22%. We anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. As mentioned on our Q3 '23 call, the '24 guidance includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt rates for the Horizon acquisition. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% to 17%. Our guidance is primarily being driven by two factors. The first is the jurisdictional mix of income, including the full year benefits associated with the Horizon transaction and the legal entity rationalization undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2023 in part to integrate the Horizon entities into our existing U.S. headquartered legal entity structure. The second is the benefit from a planned payment to the IRS as an advanced deposit as we've done in the past to stop the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions. There is no change in our belief in the merits of our legal arguments with the IRS as we prepare for trial. Given the interest rate environment, although the deposit negatively affects our cash flow in '24, if any of the deposit is returned to us upon the resolution of our litigation, those funds would accrue interest income. Therefore, the makes this payment makes this payment a prudent use of our capital. Once again, out of an abundance of clarity, this represents no change in our belief in the merits of the tax court case. The guidance also includes the impact of the adoption of the OECD 15% minimum tax by certain jurisdictions. Based on our individual footprint, we don't anticipate any significant effects of the new rules in 2024, but we're closely watching the global tax landscape for future impacts as the framework continues to be considered by additional jurisdictions and new rules take effect. We expect governments around the world, including the United States to continue to look for more sources of tax revenue from large multinational corporations that could result in higher taxes in the coming years. Similar to 2023, we expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2024 we expect that we will continue to increase our dividend. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion in 2024, consistent with our capital allocation priority to invest in our business, including the Ohio and North Carolina facilities I mentioned ahead and into the rare disease pillar. In summary, we delivered another strong year of financial results in 2023. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen is strong, and we believe that our new rare disease pillar, one of our four pillars will be an important additive source of growth for the company. This concludes the financial update. My thanks to my approximately 27,000 plus colleagues at Amgen around the world for their commitment to our mission of serving patients and their tireless efforts in 2023. I'll turn it back to Bob for Q&A.\nRobert Bradway: Okay. Thank you. Let's open the line, and we'll take questions from our callers. And Julian, why don't you remind them of the procedures so we can get through these questions here efficiently for everyone.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Yee: Hey, guys. Good afternoon, and thanks for good results and good guidance. We had a question on obesity. On 133, of course, you had the publication yesterday I feel like it was the most scrutinized Phase 1 publication. But maybe you could just talk to - maybe Jay could talk to your interpretation of some of the markers, for example, lipids, A1C, blood pressure and all that kind of thing. And maybe talk about your confidence about the profile versus competitors? Thank you so much.\nJay Bradner: Yes. Thanks a lot, Michael. We really appreciate the consideration the Phase 1 paper is receiving from the community. It's exciting to report these data. For those who haven't seen it, this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 49 patients, looking at safety, PK, PD, single ascending dose, 7 cohorts, multiple ascending dose 3 cohorts, 3 monthly doses, patients with obesity being migrated than 30. And we were quite pleased with the outcome. Looking at the 420-milligram dose as an example, which was the highest dose study, 14.5% weight loss at only day 85. And moreover, quite durable coming off of that medicine out to 150 days, all with relatively mild gastrointestinal side effects. And so to answer your last question first, we find the Phase I data, which we're pleased to share with the community to be quite supportive of our ongoing work to develop this medicine to the greatest possible benefit of patients suffering from obesity. Now you've asked questions around some of the measurements on this study, lipid, blood pressure and A1C. And I would just caution that this is a Phase I trial, the numbers are very small, that the duration of treatment is rather short. But even with all of those caveats, while hard to draw conclusions from such small numbers, especially labile measurements like blood pressure and lipids, all are directionally favorable. And so we have - we take no concern whatsoever from those measurements on the study.\nMichael Yee: Okay. Thank you. Those are the questions. Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line open.\nSalveen Richter: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Another one here on the obesity program. So post the published Phase I data, how are you thinking about differentiation on GI tolerability? Is the dose range being evaluated in the Phase II study similar to that in the Phase I? Thank you.\nJay Bradner: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take this one as well. As you may or may not know, the Phase II study, which is ongoing at present and going very well, explores 11 dosing cohorts with relevant placebo controls. And through that study, we'll have a chance to gain an experience with a longer exposure to MariTide dosed in different ways. We've recently added a part 2 to this study that will allow us to explore even more durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks enabled by just very rapid enrollment. And these four dosing cohorts will go on to test dose level and even less frequent dosing schedules than monthly. And so these Phase II data, even by end of year will be strongly instructive as to finding a safe and tolerated and efficacious dose to carry into Phase III clinical investigation.\nRobert Bradway: Yes. The only thing I would add is we're starting from a basis of a monthly dosing cadence and schedule. And so the additional dosing cohorts would look at potential dosing schedule beyond monthly. And the data are pretty clear in the market right now that the GI toxicity or GI side effects are generally related to the day of dosing of the GLP-1s, which are dosed weekly. We see some of that same GI side effect profile in kind of the first dose part of the dose titration. But there's an opportunity here to potentially spread the dosing intervals out further and further improve tolerability in our program. And as Jay clearly described, we've got all of the different aspects of that being studied in the Phase II program.\nJustin Claeys: Thanks, Julianne. We'll go to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJay Olson: Hey, thank you so much for taking a question, and congrats on the progress. Another question on 133. Talk about whether or not that we see later this year will include patients from two of the study? And do you think it's possible that 133 could be dosed twice every 2 or 3 months? And also, if you could just comment on the rollover rate of patients from Part 1 to Part 2? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Jay, could you catch all that some of what Jay asked was broken up at the beginning...\nJay Bradner: The third part was a little bit broken up of your question. I heard a better explanation of part two frequency of dosing. And then I did not hear your third part.\nJay Olson: If you just comment on the rate of patients rolling over from Part 1 to Part 2? Thanks.\nJay Bradner: Okay. Yes. Thank you for the question, Jay. Let me give a little bit of context on this Part 2 study that I think will help answer them. In part 2, the intent is to really look at durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks. And so by durable weight loss, patients eligible for Part 2, which begins at the end of 52 weeks, will be responding to this medicine. And then they'll be rerandomized to four cohorts that will test dose level. And again, this even less frequent dosing schedule. We have not disclosed the granularity on the dosing schedule. This is a competitive environment. But we're afforded this chance because the ADC, the antibody core of MariTide, like so many immunoglobulin therapeutics allows for the opportunity to use it much less frequently. The rate of patients rolling over to Part 2 will be established as the Phase II study continues to progress this year.\nJustin Claeys: Thank you, Julianne. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks very much. Just maybe to pivot over to TEPEZZA [ph] for a question. Can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics for 2024? It seems like the products come back to growth. But I'm just trying to get a sense of now that Amgen owns the asset and has more kind of time with it. What are your top priorities? And how do you think about continuing to kind of grow the new patient base here? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Sure, Chris. Maybe we'll take it in a couple of parts. But Vikram, share your thoughts first.\nVikram Karnani: Yes. Thank you for the question. I think if you focus a little bit on what are the underlying factors that are driving TEPEZZA growth, we saw a record number of unique TEPEZZA prescribers. We saw an increase in patient enrollment forms and patient starts. In addition, we've made pretty significant progress on payer coverage, as we've seen our covered lives have now increased to greater than 50% of U.S. covered lives. And that's important, educating some of those stakeholders on the new clinical data updated indication, it continues to drive uptake across the full spectrum of TED patients. And finally, what holds all of this together is a really robust patient service model that supports patient access. I think we continue to make progress and execute towards each one of these important leading indicators. And we shouldn't forget that we - there is still low penetration of the approximately 100,000 patients that can be eligible for this medicine in the U.S. alone. Now, just one last point here is that as we've noted before, there continues to be a time lag between the execution of all of these efforts and the realization of increased patient numbers. As we said before, it can take up to 90 days once a patient is identified for therapy for that patient to actually get on therapy. But we're pretty happy with all of our leading indicators and the execution that we have seen coming out of last year.\nRobert Bradway: And Chris, the only thing I would add is building on what Vikram said in his prepared remarks, we're excited about the international opportunity as well, and I think he characterized that well previously. And we're also excited about what we see as ongoing opportunities to invest in innovation for the benefit of TED patients. So all in all, I feel excited about the rare disease pillar that we've established and the role that TEPEZZA will play in that.\nJustin Claeys: All right. Next question, Julianne?\nOperator: Thank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to touch on TEZSPIRE specifically in COPD. How are you planning to differentiate given the pretty competitive data we saw from Dupixent [ph] And how should investors be looking at this data from an efficacy bar? Are there nuances in this trial that need to be clarified that might make it harder to do an apples-to-apples comparison?\nRobert Bradway: Yes, and thanks for the question. Murdo, why don't I start and then you add on. So it's a great and timely question. The Phase II COPD study of TEZSPIRE, we expect data in the first half of this year. This was a big study, 337 patients, moderate to severe COPD. They're having exacerbations despite being on triple therapy. And so reflective of the current unmet need inadequacy of therapy for patients with COPD. This is a slightly broader population than Dupi that we're studying here. We're totally on track for the readout. We quite like the mechanism here. You must know that TSLP [j works as a signaling factor upstream and by blocking it with our unique biotherapeutic, we block TSLP IL-25, IL-33 signaling. TSLP so many cell types modulating this airway Type 2 response. By hitting TSLP upstream, we think we can really have an impact on the disease biology. We see TSLP-elevated in the serum patients in bronchial mucosa [PH] and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. It's released by airway epithelium. There's just a lot of signals from the basic biology of this disease pointing to a medicine of this nature. And by looking at the broader population than they did with Dupi, we have a chance to really figure out who the responder is. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: I think you've covered all the bases. I would just add this, Evan, that with the unique and differentiated mechanism, as Jay described, we hope we can treat a broader population of patients than perhaps the currently available therapies. And we also recognize that there are patients who are refractory to those currently available therapies, and we would obviously want to understand if they would be responders to TEZSPIRE. I think we've got strong commercial capabilities, including with our partners at AstraZeneca and are well positioned to take a product like this into the market if we're successful in Phase III.\nJustin Claeys: Okay. All right. Thank you, Julian. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you, Evan. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch up on AMG 133 as well, two parts question. First, on the discontinuations at the high dose, we know five out of eight did not finish the full duration of the study, but there was a second arm also of this high dose 420-milligram with 10 patients, which was not reported. This was the one with digital tools. Could you speak to the discontinuation rate in that arm? So this a 420 done separately, which is not part of paper? And secondly, I know there's a case of liver enzyme elevation of the 280-meg dose, but this patient also had COVID. Could you perhaps speak to the timing of liver enzyme elevation relative to the COVID episode? Thank you very much.\nRobert Bradway: Yes. Thanks, Umer. I won't be able to provide patient level insights to the Phase I study at this time, but I do appreciate your question and your interest in the report. I'll speak to the dropouts of the Phase 1 at the 420-milligram dose, which was four out of the eight patients. First, it's notable to say that the high-dose cohort in the multiple ascending dose receiving the three doses of 420 experienced real weight loss, real benefit of 14.5% after these three monthly doses. This was the group that proved actually quite durable out to day 150. Four subjects decline to participate in this clinical study setting largely from logistical reasons. The AEs and other characteristics were comparable to all the other patients in the study. Now the second question around the digital group, I don't have insight into that. Dave, do you...\nDavid Reese: No. I mean we can get back to you on that. I don't know that we reported that - those data and the discontinuation rate.\nJustin Claeys: Julianne, next question.\nOperator: Thank you, Umer. Our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nColin Bristow: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe a couple more on MariTide. First, could you provide some insight into the dosing? I mean, obviously, these are pretty large doses. And if we look at like Repatha for 20 milligrams takes over 5 minutes by infusion or 3 infective injections. So I was wondering if you could give any insight there. And then in terms of the relative affinity for gip versus GLIP [ph] MariTide seams to have preferentially favor GLIP much more than competitor molecules. And so do you think the ultimate clinical profile is more closely going to resemble that of a long-acting glip-1 versus competitive git GLIPS [ph]? Thanks.\nRobert Bradway: Yes. Thanks, Colin. I appreciate the deep consideration of the molecule, especially. I'd start by saying, I don't regard these doses as high. I'm new here, but 420 milligrams for biotherapeutic that's an antibody drug conjugate with a peptide antibody ratio 2:1 seems well in scope for a modern biotherapeutic product. I don't need to tell this community paying so close - such close attention to Amgen that this is a very sophisticated biotherapeutics organization. And on the manufacturing side, just every patient, every time. And we have all the capabilities necessary to deliver this medicine at whichever of these three or other dose and schedule we arrived at. So no concerns there for me whatsoever. Regarding the balance of the pharmacology, you do invoke a difference between our medicine and medicines developed by pure pharmaceutical companies. Namely mechanistically the core antibody of MariTide inhibits the GIP receptor, whereas these other peptide medicines agonize it. We feel very secure in our choice to inhibit that receptor supported by just the finest level of experimental data available experiments of nature that genome-wide association studies in very large populations have pointed to a need, an opportunity to inhibit the gift receptor to deliver lower BMI as observed with variance in that receptor and downstream signaling pathways that correlate with reduced body mass index in large populations. As to the balance, which you asked, between inhibition of GIP receptor and agonism of GLP-1, these are very difficult measurements to make in humans, but our modeling suggests that with the therapeutic doses and exposures that we observe that we're achieving both.\nMurdo Gordon: And Colin, this is Murdo. I would just add that from a patient experience perspective, we've learned a lot from other biologics. And Amgen has a world-class process development, manufacturing and device team, and we've done a lot of work on this one, and we anticipate a very positive and simple patient experience on at least a monthly dosing schedule. And we've learned a lot from Repatha specifically, and there's more to follow on Repatha from that, but we continue to work to improve patient experience with our biologic injectables.\nJay Bradner: Just as we go to the next question, let me observe that we're almost up to the hour that we actually all to set aside, but I know we still have quite a few questions in the queue. So we'll try to get one question for a caller here and get through. We'll stay through the queue of calls or questions rather that's still waiting for us, but I know some of you may have to drop. So let's move forward, Justin.\nJustin Claeys: Julianne. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you, Collin. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: All right. Great, thanks. This is Brendan on for Yaron. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one from us. Actually, based on the data you've seen so far and maybe some feedback from physicians that you've heard, this is on UPLIZNA. Where do you kind of see UPLIZNA fitting into maybe the MG treatment paradigm given all the competition there, but maybe more to the point, how you're thinking about expansion opportunities given all the different autoimmune indications you could potentially pursue? Just trying to kind of understand how you see longer-term growth there?\nRobert Bradway: First, why don't we ask Vikram, just to address the performance of the product right now in NMOSD. And then a combination of Jay and Dave can talk about the other activities or other potential applications.\nVikram Karnani: Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, UPLIZNA is actually growing quite nicely and quite well in NMOSD. As you know, it is now the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD. We continue to execute across a variety of fronts. I mean, we're - we see this product nicely positioned versus as it's appropriate for NMOSD patients and within the competitive environment that we operate in. We've continued to make significant progress over the last 18 months or so, maybe even longer of continuing to drive more growth with newer prescribers and even depth with existing prescribers. So the product continues to do well. And I think we hope to continue to deliver good execution on this medicine in NMOSD. Maybe, Jay, you want to talk about the second question?\nJay Bradner: Yes. No, I'm happy to. As you may know, on a hematologist, I think CD19 is a terrific target. It's expressed really on all B cells and spares plasma cells. And therefore, considering indication expansion, as you've asked, there's a large number of diseases that could potentially be approached with UPLIZNA to the real benefit of patients with unmet need, far beyond the application of the prevailing CD20s that target just a subset of B cells. This is not lost on our team, and we're working through indication expansion priorities presently.\nJustin Claeys: Julian, let\u2019s got the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I have a question regarding the subcutaneous delivery of TEPEZZA. You do have a plan to initiate a Phase III study. Can you talk a little bit about which technology you are using? Is this with the pre-existing Halozyme technology? Or are you using something else for this development? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Sorry, I had trouble understanding your question.\nMurdo Gordon: The question is what technology we're using for the subcutaneous injectable form of TEPEZZA?\nRobert Bradway: Maybe I'll jump in. Mohit, we're not commenting at this point on the provider. We just said that we're going forward with the subcu.\nJustin Claeys: Okay, Julian, we\u2019ll go to next question.\nOperator: Thank you, Mohit. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open\nGeoff Meacham: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Another one on 133. When you think about the Phase III program, I just wanted to know what sort of informs the next indications you're going to go after? Is it unmet need? Is it the potential for differentiation on 133 and the timing of that, do you think that you'd want to have the Phase II data in hand? Or is this something that you could roll out sort of that risk? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Yes. Thanks for the question, Geoff, really appreciate it. As you know, obesity is a major public health crisis, maybe 40% of Americans with a BMI over 30 massively costly. So a huge burden to the global third-party payers and societies. The obesity-related disease list is quite long and expanding from cardiovascular disease and heart failure, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, NASH and AFLD kidney disease. These are chronic conditions that really demand medicines that can deliver durable and chronic weight loss. And so we think we have a really strong offering for these obesity-related diseases rising in our Phase II program, as you know. And obesity has a strong genetic component and we locked on to gipper [ph] inhibition based on genetic insights. So the opportunity space is quite large. You asked the question what indications and perhaps even in what sequence. And when we have all the requisite data, we'll remark in due course. But we intend all indications where this dual mechanism can improve public health. And we are actively planning and on track for an expansive Phase III program.\nJay Bradner: And in terms of - Dave, you want to add the regulatory piece?\nDavid Reese: Yes, I think -- Geoff, this is Dave Reese. I would just add that we're planning a very expansive Phase III program. So you can expect to see multiple indications move forward in parallel. And as Jay indicated, as we start to see data, we will begin launching those trials, and we'll discuss them. And then in addition, as you're aware, regulatory authorities around the world require a certain body of safety data before Phase III launches. And so of course, we will be compliant with that. But our goal is to launch Phase III as quickly as possible once we have the requisite data set and regulatory approval.\nJustin Claeys: Great. All right. Julian, we'll go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, Geoff. Our next question comes from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So I have another question on AMG 133, please. Could you add some more color on your expectations for the impact on blood pressure and lipids in Phase II, specifically whether you anticipate tirzepatide-like efficacy on those metrics? Thanks very much.\nRobert Bradway: Yes. Thanks, David. I mean we're making all these measurements, and I'm not going to try to forecast the outcome of that pharmacology at this time. As you've seen in our Phase I program, the medicines very well tolerated, delivering durable weight loss and benefit without significant excursion of some of those measurements. I just think it's too early to try to answer your question, and we'll have all that data at the end of the first part of Phase II towards the end of this calendar year.\nJay Bradner: And the best extrapolation that you can have is from the preclinical data that were just published, I urge you to take a look at that.\nJustin Claeys: Okay. Julian, we\u2019ll go to next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, David. Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: It's Ege [ph] on for Michael. Thanks for taking our question. A quick one on [indiscernible] Can you talk about your plan of data disclosure this year and your current thinking on the potential registration path? How do you think about the positioning of this agent relative to some of the other emerging agents based on different mechanisms such as ADC or AR degradors in prostate cancer? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Yes. Thanks for this outstanding question, Michael. And Zalaritamag [ph] is a very interesting and exciting molecule for those on the call. This is a steep on CD3 bispecific. We have been studying this in advance castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We have expanded a cohort in the Phase I monotherapy. We're opening to reduce monitoring as well as - as you invoke the existing and novel androgen receptor modulators integrators, we're exploring combinations with novel agents in that domain as well. The priorities for the program right now are to establish reduced monitoring. This will be important to reach just all the patients who can benefit. We're looking at the feasibility of reduced monitoring. We have a great experience with these T-cell engaging bispecifics as well as the plausibility of outpatient therapy. The approach to the regulatory path will present in due course. There'll be no surprises there. The path to bring medicines to patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer alone and ultimately, in combination is well worn, thankfully, and we know how to deliver there. You asked about differentiation in other medicines. These are often apples to oranges comparisons. We have looked at that, of course, and we really like the offering of Zalaritamag. The patients treated on our study had quite advanced disease, even more advanced disease than the demographics of the patients as reported on other mechanism medicines such as radio ligand therapies.. And the response rates we're seeing are really clinically meaningful to patients. And that gives us great encouragement to develop the medicine more ambitiously in the next few years.\nMurdo Gordon: Jay, in terms of the data sharing, do you want to share...\nDavid Reese: For data availability - as Jay mentioned, we're nearly complete in terms of dose expansion enrollment. So as those data roll forward over the course of the year, we'll provide guidance as to when we might have the next look at that data. But that's probably the next meaningful set of data we'll get a look at either later this year or early into next year.\nJustin Claeys: Julianne, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTim Anderson: Thank you very much. So Eli Lilly today made a couple of sets of comments about this topic of GIP agonism versus antagonism and they also weighed in on the data you published yesterday. And I'm wondering, in as much as you heard that or read those comments, is there any context to add or anything that's factually incorrect or anything to refute because they covered quite a few points, and they continue to express their view, which is agonism is the best way not antagonism?\nJay Bradner: Tim, this is Jay. I open it up to anyone else who wants to contribute to this. I don't believe that - yes, that engaging in the dialogue around this is as much to the narrative. Rather, I'd say that the argument for GIP receptor antagonism comes from just the highest level of scientific data, the human experience across populations with 1 million patients studied, among those who have variations in the genes associated with this pathway where that variation is directionally inhibitory, the BMI is lower. And so we're hoping to replicate that pharmacology with this medicine. We feel great about the offering in this domain.\nJustin Claeys: Okay. Julianne, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, Tim. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. This is Nicole on for Robin. So on Daxdilimab, targeting ILT7 business, can you talk about your level of confidence in this target in light of the competitive landscape? And would you expect to see near term from safety and efficacy?\nRobert Bradway: Sure. Jay and Dave?\nJay Bradner: Yes. Well, it's very early days with this medicine. There is strong preclinical support from the published literature and our own preclinical work. It's nicely for patients, a very competitive landscape, but this is the earliest phases of clinical investigation. And so we're going to approach this with total aquapoise and bring the medicine to the patients that stand to benefit the best based on the biology underlying.\nDavid Reese: Yes. I would say the target, as you mentioned, is one that helps control some of the central signaling that drives some of the autoimmune diseases that are being investigated here. And at this point, I think it's all efforts towards generating the clinical data.\nJustin Claeys: Okay. Jullian, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you, Nicole. Our next question comes from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open\nJames Shin: Thanks for taking our question. I have one for Jay. I just kind of want to piggyback on what Tim was alluding to. The GIP antagonism versus agonism, I'm looking at the Nature paper, it looks like 133 420-milligram dose has a slight blip in triglycerides that eventually fades, but it does seem like antagonism is behaving a little differently from the literature for agonism. Is it too early to chalk it up to antagonism versus agonism in your view? Just wanted to get your thoughts there.\nJay Bradner: The short answer is it's too early to talk it up to antagonism versus agonism. As I said before, and I meant it, that these lipids are labile and indirect biomarker of this pharmacology. This is an early stage study that had 1 or 3 monthly doses of the medicine. And so we are not reading anything into the lipids conclusively from this trial. We are making all these measurements in the active Phase I.\nJustin Claeys: Great. Then I think we have time for one more, Julianne.\nOperator: Thank you, James. Our last question will come from Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one on 786. Can you walk through exactly what's sort of driving - maybe let me take it back. Maybe first kind of if you could outline sort of how you're setting expectations there? And any color on what's driving the delay there? It seems like it's taking a long time to enroll 72 patients? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Sure. No, thank you for your question. For the broader group, AMG 786 is an oral medicine being developed for obesity. It is not an increasing that we've not as yet disclosed this target or pathway. This study is progressing fine. The readout of the Phase I is on track for the first half of 2024. We've completed initial dose escalation cohorts, and we're just collecting and analyzing data, expecting the readout in the first half of this year.\nJustin Claeys: And Julianne, we're going to turn it back to Bob for some closing remarks.\nRobert Bradway: Okay. Thank you all for joining the call. As you heard, we're excited about the opportunities that we see for growing our business across all four of our pillars, general medicine oncology, inflammation in rare disease. Last October, we shared an in-depth look at oncology in connection with the ESMO medical meeting. And we plan to do an introductory review of rare diseases and our rare disease pillar in late February to give you more information about the medicines that we already have on the market as well as some of those that are advancing through our pipeline. So we're encouraged by the questions that we heard on this call about those molecules, and we're excited about them and their prospects. So we'll host a call, which IR will share with you here over the next few days and look forward to having that opportunity. In the meantime, again, thank you for your support, and we look forward to talking to you at the Rare Disease Day at our first quarter results call. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our 2023 Q4 earnings call. You may now disconnect.+",

            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Justin, and let me thank all of you for joining our call. 2023 was another year of performance and progress for Amgen, further positioning us to deliver attractive growth through the end of the decade and beyond. Last year, we delivered double-digit volume growth in all four quarters with balanced growth across products and geographies. 18 [ph] of our medicines generated record annual sales, including Repatha, Prolia EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA. The acquisition of Horizon, which is completed on October 6, gives us a significant new rare disease business that now stands as a fourth pillar of growth alongside our leading general medicine, oncology and inflammation businesses. The medicines we acquired are all very early in their life cycles and by leveraging Amgen's world-class biologics manufacturing, decades of experience in inflammation and our extensive global presence, we believe these products have the potential to reach many more patients around the world. Last year, we also advanced the deepest and most diverse pipeline in our history with promising molecules at all stages of development across our four pillars of growth. We anticipate well over a dozen significant pipeline milestones this year. I'll touch on a few. In General Medicine, we'll generate Phase II data this year for our lead obesity molecule, MariTide, and we're excited, of course, to learn more about this asset. We're also advancing a number of early-stage assets in this space. In Oncology, we have a June 12 PDUFA date for the FDA to complete its priority review of Tarlatamab as a third-line treatment for small cell lung cancer. Tarlatamab is the first bispecific T cell engager shown to be effective in addressing a major solid tumor. In this case, one for which there has been no new treatment in decades and which today has a 5-year survival rate of just 3%. We're studying Tarlatamab in earlier lines of treatment and hope over the fullness of time to be able to serve the tens of thousands of patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer each year in the U.S. and major markets around the world. We've done this very successfully now with our first BiTE BLINCYTO, which has steadily moved into earlier lines of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and we'll take the same approach with yet another promising BiTE at being Xaluritamig in prostate cancer. In inflammation, we'll have Phase III data from Rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis from the first of 1 are now 8 trials in the ROCKE program. And in rare disease, we'll have Phase III data for UPLIZNA and myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease. At a time when a rapidly aging global population needs more innovation, Amgen is delivering, both with the medicines we have in the market today and with the promising new medicines that are advancing in our pipeline. We're also excited by the rapid convergence of biotech and tech, which is enabling us to innovate more quickly and confidently. We've been preparing for this hinge moment for more than a decade and recently named Dave Reese as our first ever Chief Technology Officer to ensure that we're capitalizing on technologies like generative artificial intelligence, not just in R&D, but across the entire company. Succeeding Dave is Amgen's Head of R&D is Jay Bradner. Jay is a physician scientist and a seasoned R&D leader, having served for many years as President of the Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research. Jay previously also served as a faculty member at Harvard Medical School and prior to joining Amgen was a practicing oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We're delighted to have Jay on board and excited by the work that he Dave and the rest of our team will do together to accelerate innovation at Amgen for the good of patients and for the long-term growth of our business. And with that, I want to thank our 27,000 employees around the world for their many contributions to our success. And let me now ask Murdo to talk about our commercial performance in 2023. Okay. Thank you. Let's open the line, and we'll take questions from our callers. And Julian, why don't you remind them of the procedures so we can get through these questions here efficiently for everyone. Yes. The only thing I would add is we're starting from a basis of a monthly dosing cadence and schedule. And so the additional dosing cohorts would look at potential dosing schedule beyond monthly. And the data are pretty clear in the market right now that the GI toxicity or GI side effects are generally related to the day of dosing of the GLP-1s, which are dosed weekly. We see some of that same GI side effect profile in kind of the first dose part of the dose titration. But there's an opportunity here to potentially spread the dosing intervals out further and further improve tolerability in our program. And as Jay clearly described, we've got all of the different aspects of that being studied in the Phase II program. Jay, could you catch all that some of what Jay asked was broken up at the beginning... Sure, Chris. Maybe we'll take it in a couple of parts. But Vikram, share your thoughts first. And Chris, the only thing I would add is building on what Vikram said in his prepared remarks, we're excited about the international opportunity as well, and I think he characterized that well previously. And we're also excited about what we see as ongoing opportunities to invest in innovation for the benefit of TED patients. So all in all, I feel excited about the rare disease pillar that we've established and the role that TEPEZZA will play in that. Yes, and thanks for the question. Murdo, why don't I start and then you add on. So it's a great and timely question. The Phase II COPD study of TEZSPIRE, we expect data in the first half of this year. This was a big study, 337 patients, moderate to severe COPD. They're having exacerbations despite being on triple therapy. And so reflective of the current unmet need inadequacy of therapy for patients with COPD. This is a slightly broader population than Dupi that we're studying here. We're totally on track for the readout. We quite like the mechanism here. You must know that TSLP [j works as a signaling factor upstream and by blocking it with our unique biotherapeutic, we block TSLP IL-25, IL-33 signaling. TSLP so many cell types modulating this airway Type 2 response. By hitting TSLP upstream, we think we can really have an impact on the disease biology. We see TSLP-elevated in the serum patients in bronchial mucosa [PH] and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. It's released by airway epithelium. There's just a lot of signals from the basic biology of this disease pointing to a medicine of this nature. And by looking at the broader population than they did with Dupi, we have a chance to really figure out who the responder is. Murdo? Yes. Thanks, Umer. I won't be able to provide patient level insights to the Phase I study at this time, but I do appreciate your question and your interest in the report. I'll speak to the dropouts of the Phase 1 at the 420-milligram dose, which was four out of the eight patients. First, it's notable to say that the high-dose cohort in the multiple ascending dose receiving the three doses of 420 experienced real weight loss, real benefit of 14.5% after these three monthly doses. This was the group that proved actually quite durable out to day 150. Four subjects decline to participate in this clinical study setting largely from logistical reasons. The AEs and other characteristics were comparable to all the other patients in the study. Now the second question around the digital group, I don't have insight into that. Dave, do you... Yes. Thanks, Colin. I appreciate the deep consideration of the molecule, especially. I'd start by saying, I don't regard these doses as high. I'm new here, but 420 milligrams for biotherapeutic that's an antibody drug conjugate with a peptide antibody ratio 2:1 seems well in scope for a modern biotherapeutic product. I don't need to tell this community paying so close - such close attention to Amgen that this is a very sophisticated biotherapeutics organization. And on the manufacturing side, just every patient, every time. And we have all the capabilities necessary to deliver this medicine at whichever of these three or other dose and schedule we arrived at. So no concerns there for me whatsoever. Regarding the balance of the pharmacology, you do invoke a difference between our medicine and medicines developed by pure pharmaceutical companies.

Mohit, we're not commenting at this point on the provider. We just said that we're going forward with the subcu. Yes. Thanks for the question, Geoff, really appreciate it. As you know, obesity is a major public health crisis, maybe 40% of Americans with a BMI over 30 massively costly. So a huge burden to the global third-party payers and societies. The obesity-related disease list is quite long and expanding from cardiovascular disease and heart failure, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, NASH and AFLD kidney disease. These are chronic conditions that really demand medicines that can deliver durable and chronic weight loss. And so we think we have a really strong offering for these obesity-related diseases rising in our Phase II program, as you know.

You asked the question what indications and perhaps even in what sequence. And when we have all the requisite data, we'll remark in due course. But we intend all indications where this dual mechanism can improve public health. And we are actively planning and on track for an expansive Phase III program. Yes. Thanks, David.

The path to bring medicines to patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer alone and ultimately, in combination is well worn, thankfully, and we know how to deliver there. You asked about differentiation in other medicines. These are often apples to oranges comparisons. We have looked at that, of course, and we really like the offering of Zalaritamag. The patients treated on our study had quite advanced disease, even more advanced disease than the demographics of the patients as reported on other mechanism medicines such as radio ligand therapies.. And the response rates we're seeing are really clinically meaningful to patients. And that gives us great encouragement to develop the medicine more ambitiously in the next few years. Sure.

As you heard, we're excited about the opportunities that we see for growing our business across all four of our pillars, general medicine oncology, inflammation in rare disease. Last October, we shared an in-depth look at oncology in connection with the ESMO medical meeting. And we plan to do an introductory review of rare diseases and our rare disease pillar in late February to give you more information about the medicines that we already have on the market as well as some of those that are advancing through our pipeline. So we're encouraged by the questions that we heard on this call about those molecules, and we're excited about them and their prospects. So we'll host a call, which IR will share with you here over the next few days and look forward to having that opportunity. In the meantime, again, thank you for your support, and we look forward to talking to you at the Rare Disease Day at our first quarter results call. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong execution and performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023. In the fourth quarter, total revenue of $8.2 billion grew 20% year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $4.71 grew 15% year-over-year. For the full year, we delivered total revenue of $28.2 billion, 7% growth year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS of $18.65, 5% growth year-over-year. As a reminder, both Q4 and the full year results include Horizon's results beginning October 6 when the acquisition closed. So our financial results will exclude approximately 1 week of Horizon's results from our fourth quarter results. I'll review the details of our fourth quarter and full year financial results before discussing our outlook for 2024. The financial results are shown on Slides 54 to 56 of the slide deck. Turning to our fourth quarter's total revenue of $8.2 billion. We saw product sales increased 20% year-over-year, driven by volume growth of 23%, offset by net selling price decline of 3%. Excluding the impact of Horizon, product sales increased 5% year-over-year driven by volume growth of 9%. Full year total revenues of $28.2 billion grew 7% year-over-year. Product sales increased 9% year-over-year, driven by 15% volume growth. Other revenues decreased 16% year-over-year, primarily due to lower profit and cost sharing from our COVID-19 collaboration with Lilly in 2022. Strong expense discipline resulted in a 50% non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales for the full year 2023. While we continue to focus on both internal and external innovation, investing $4.7 billion in our pipeline and $27.8 billion in our acquisition of Horizon. With product sales volume growth at 23% in Q4 and 15% for the full year, we still efficiently manage the operating expenses of the business. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 18% year-over-year, while full year non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9%. Excluding the impact of Horizon, Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% and full year non-GAAP operating expenses increased 5%. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 cost of sales as a percentage of product sales was flat on a year-over-year basis at 16.3%. For the full year, cost of sales as a percentage of product sales increased by 1.1 percentage points to 17.0%. The full year increase was primarily driven by higher profit share and changes in our product mix, partially offset by the replacement of the Puerto Rico excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the fourth quarter increased 16% year-over-year and 8% year-over-year for the full year primarily due to higher spend on later-stage clinical program and marketed product support, including spend on programs acquired from the Horizon acquisition and continuing investment in our pipeline, including MariTide. Q4 non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 20% year-over-year, primarily driven by commercial and G&A expenses related to the Horizon acquisition. Full year non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by commercial and G&A expenses related to the Horizon acquisition, partially offset by a decline in other marketed product spend. Non-GAAP OI&E were about $635 million in expense in the fourth quarter, a $168 million increase year-over-year, primarily driven by increased interest expense related to the debt issued for the Horizon acquisition. Full year non-GAAP OI&E was favorable $279 million year-over-year, primarily driven by the change in accounting for the BeiGene investment to the fair value mark-to-market method and by gains related to early debt retirement, partially offset by higher net interest expense. Our non-GAAP tax rate increased 2.5 percentage points year-over-year to 15.9% in the fourth quarter and 2.7 percentage points year-over-year to 16.5% for the full year primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change mentioned previously. The company generated $7.4 billion of free cash flow in 2023 compared with $8.8 billion in 2022. The decrease is driven by the Horizon transaction and integration costs, higher repatriation tax payments and higher capital expenditures. We expect to continue to generate strong cash flows with the addition of Horizon and are on track with our deleveraging plans to return to our efficient capital structure by the end of 2025. In summary, we continue to execute on our multiple capital allocation priorities. First, we continue to prioritize investments in both internal and external innovation. Our increased spending in non-GAAP R&D of 8% in '23 over '22, coupled with the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, continues to broaden and strengthen our balanced portfolio across therapeutic areas. With our strong late-stage innovative pipeline moving forward through development, we expect our non-GAAP R&D to continue to increase in 2024. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth, including our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. Amgen, Ohio, our new advanced assembly and final product packaging plant has just received license from the FDA for commercial production in January, roughly 2 years after we broke ground and our innovative drug substance plan under construction in North Carolina is expected to be operational by 2026. In addition, we've positioned the organization to accelerate investments in innovation, including leveraging the power of generative artificial intelligence. And third, we returned capital to shareholders through growing dividends, including $2.13 per share in the quarter. This represented a 10% increase over that paid in each of 2022 four [ph] quarters. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2024. First, because this is the first full year incorporating the impact of Horizon, we're providing some additional granularity in our guidance, which we don't expect to repeat to the same extent in the future. For 2024, we're expecting revenue of $32.4 billion to $33.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $18.90 to $20.30. As we continue to integrate Horizon, we expect the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in 2024, and we're on track to meet the synergies target previously communicated of at least $500 million in pretax cost by year 3 after closing or in 2026. Our revenue range reflects our strong growth outlook driven by numerous opportunities across our four therapeutic area pillars. We will record a full year of legacy Horizon product sales, and we expect continued volume-driven growth in our priority products Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Prolia and BLINCYTO consistent with industry trends in our recent history, we expect mid single-digit price decline for our portfolio in 2024. As a reminder, as you model the first quarter of 2024 and consistent with our historical trends, we expect first quarter product sales to be the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year due to benefit plan changes, insurance reverifications and increased co-pay charges. So we expect the first quarter of 2024 total revenue to grow roughly 20% year-over-year. For the full year, we expect other revenue to be in the range of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. And we continue to efficiently run the business through our disciplined approach to managing operating expenses. In 2024, we're making incremental R&D investments to support our promising late-stage pipeline, including our rapidly advancing oncology programs as discussed following ESMO in October and other programs, including MariTide. Furthermore, the addition of Horizon has an impact on the 2024 operating margin given the timing of when synergies are realized. As a result, we project the full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 48%. Note that we expect non-GAAP operating margin growth to accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter. There are primarily three reasons for this. First, typical lower product sales in Q1, as I mentioned above, and in each of the following quarters. Second, increased spend on our commercial brands will continue building on the investments we made in the second half of 2023, including Repatha, Otezla, and our bone portfolio of EVENITY and Prolia And third, Q1 2024 reflects the addition of Horizon, for which we are just at the beginning stages of realizing synergies given the acquisition close date of October 6. So we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be roughly 43% in the first quarter. I would reiterate that we expect operating margin growth to accelerate in each of the quarters following the first quarter. We project non-GAAP cost of sales to be in the range of 17% to 18% as a percentage of product sales for the 2024 year. Taking into account the full year of Horizon related expenses, we expect non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2024 to increase approximately 20% year-over-year with investments also increasing to advance key pipeline assets, including AMG 193, MariTide, rocatinlimab and tarlatamab. We see significant potential in our innovative pipeline, and it is important that we strategically invest now to fully unlock the opportunities ahead to create long-term value for patients, staff and shareholders. And for non-GAAP SG&A spend, we expect 2024 full year amounts as a percentage of product sales to be between 21% and 22%. We anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. As mentioned on our Q3 '23 call, the '24 guidance includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt rates for the Horizon acquisition. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% to 17%. Our guidance is primarily being driven by two factors. The first is the jurisdictional mix of income, including the full year benefits associated with the Horizon transaction and the legal entity rationalization undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2023 in part to integrate the Horizon entities into our existing U.S. headquartered legal entity structure. The second is the benefit from a planned payment to the IRS as an advanced deposit as we've done in the past to stop the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions. There is no change in our belief in the merits of our legal arguments with the IRS as we prepare for trial. Given the interest rate environment, although the deposit negatively affects our cash flow in '24, if any of the deposit is returned to us upon the resolution of our litigation, those funds would accrue interest income. Therefore, the makes this payment makes this payment a prudent use of our capital. Once again, out of an abundance of clarity, this represents no change in our belief in the merits of the tax court case. The guidance also includes the impact of the adoption of the OECD 15% minimum tax by certain jurisdictions. Based on our individual footprint, we don't anticipate any significant effects of the new rules in 2024, but we're closely watching the global tax landscape for future impacts as the framework continues to be considered by additional jurisdictions and new rules take effect. We expect governments around the world, including the United States to continue to look for more sources of tax revenue from large multinational corporations that could result in higher taxes in the coming years. Similar to 2023, we expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2024 we expect that we will continue to increase our dividend. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion in 2024, consistent with our capital allocation priority to invest in our business, including the Ohio and North Carolina facilities I mentioned ahead and into the rare disease pillar. In summary, we delivered another strong year of financial results in 2023. Our confidence in the long-term growth of Amgen is strong, and we believe that our new rare disease pillar, one of our four pillars will be an important additive source of growth for the company. This concludes the financial update. My thanks to my approximately 27,000 plus colleagues at Amgen around the world for their commitment to our mission of serving patients and their tireless efforts in 2023. I'll turn it back to Bob for Q&A."

            "name": "Vikram Karnani",
            "content": "Thanks, Murdo. I am glad to share an update on our rare disease business now that we are 4 months past due close. We are now fully operating as part of Amgen with integration activities ongoing. As Bob has mentioned before, we are excited to be Amgen's fourth pillar of long-term growth. I wanted to make sure you're aware that we are not reporting the full quarter in press release and slides, which reflects sales from October 6 onwards and totaled $954 million. This excludes $41 million of sales that occurred in the first week of October prior to deal close. For the full quarter, our rare disease brands from Horizon delivered product sales of $995 million, representing 6% year-over-year sales growth. Throughout the remainder of my remarks, I will reference full quarter product sales. TEPEZZA, and IGF-1R monoclonal antibody for patients with thyroid eye disease generated $467 million of sales during the entire fourth quarter, representing 3% quarter-over-quarter growth. This is the third quarter in a row of quarter-over-quarter growth for TEPEZZA with the growth largely driven by the U.S. We saw a number of positive leading indicators, including a record number of unique TEPEZZA prescribers, total patient enrollment forms and patient starts in 2023. Additionally, thanks to our efforts, we've been able to generate favorable medical policy changes for greater than 50% of U.S. covered lives, and we expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024. We continue to see approximately 100,000 patients with moderate to severe disease in the U.S. who could benefit from TEPEZZA with the majority of these patients in low clinical activity score settings. Given positive leading indicators and high unmet need, we see a long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA in the U.S., while also recognizing there is some time lag between our execution efforts and the realization of increased patient numbers. International expansion also remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA. TEPEZZA is approved in Brazil, and we are progressing towards approval in additional countries. Our expansion into both Japan and Europe is a high priority with regulatory review underway in Japan and filings in the EU throughout the year. KRYSTEXXA, a PEGylated uricase enzyme for patients with chronic refractory gout delivered a record $280 million in sales for the entire fourth quarter, representing 30% year-over-year growth, driven by continued strong commercial execution. Sales are now annualizing at $80 billion [ph] run rate. Performance was driven by execution across all phases of the patient journey, demand generation, stakeholder engagement and adherence to treatment. UPLIZNA, an anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody, which is now the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD, delivered a record $70 million in sales for the entire fourth quarter, representing 68% year-over-year growth. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex U.S. markets. Our remaining ultra-rare portfolio generated $178 million of sales for the entire fourth quarter, primarily driven by our ultra-rare medicines, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI and ACTIMMUNE. Looking ahead at 2024 by leveraging Amgen's world-class biologics capabilities, decades of experience in inflammation and extensive global presence, we are ready to reach more patients than ever before. I will now turn it over to Jay. Yes. Thank you for the question. I think if you focus a little bit on what are the underlying factors that are driving TEPEZZA growth, we saw a record number of unique TEPEZZA prescribers. We saw an increase in patient enrollment forms and patient starts. In addition, we've made pretty significant progress on payer coverage, as we've seen our covered lives have now increased to greater than 50% of U.S. covered lives. And that's important, educating some of those stakeholders on the new clinical data updated indication, it continues to drive uptake across the full spectrum of TED patients. And finally, what holds all of this together is a really robust patient service model that supports patient access. I think we continue to make progress and execute towards each one of these important leading indicators. And we shouldn't forget that we - there is still low penetration of the approximately 100,000 patients that can be eligible for this medicine in the U.S. alone. Now, just one last point here is that as we've noted before, there continues to be a time lag between the execution of all of these efforts and the realization of increased patient numbers. As we said before, it can take up to 90 days once a patient is identified for therapy for that patient to actually get on therapy. But we're pretty happy with all of our leading indicators and the execution that we have seen coming out of last year. Yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, UPLIZNA is actually growing quite nicely and quite well in NMOSD. As you know, it is now the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD. We continue to execute across a variety of fronts. I mean, we're - we see this product nicely positioned versus as it's appropriate for NMOSD patients and within the competitive environment that we operate in. We've continued to make significant progress over the last 18 months or so, maybe even longer of continuing to drive more growth with newer prescribers and even depth with existing prescribers. So the product continues to do well. And I think we hope to continue to deliver good execution on this medicine in NMOSD. Maybe, Jay, you want to talk about the second question?"

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and I'm very pleased with our performance in 2023. Execution was strong across the business, resulting in record sales in the year for 18 brands and robust volume growth across the four pillars of our business. Full year product sales increased 9% year-over-year. Volume growth was 15% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 14% and volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Canada region was 10%. Asia Pacific continues to be our fastest-growing region with 41% volume growth. These results include $954 million of sales from the legacy Horizon portfolio from the period of October 6 through December 31. I'll start with our General Medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia EVENITY and Aimovig. Overall revenue for these four products grew 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year, driven by 18% and 20% volume growth, respectively. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter with volume growth of 35%, partially offset by lower net selling price. Outside of the U.S., we saw 25% volume growth with strength across our regions. In the U.S., volume growth of 48% was driven by a 66% increase in the number of new patients starting treatment. We saw a decline in net selling price in the U.S., primarily driven by new formulary coverage. We expect this additional coverage to lead to strong volume growth, which will more than offset declining net selling price. In addition, some payers have recently removed prior authorization for some patients, which will further ease their access to Repatha. We remain committed to the urgent need to educate physicians and patients on the importance of LDL-C lowering to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. In the U.S., we activated more than 20,000 new prescribing physicians in 2023 in both the primary care and cardiology settings. And while we're pleased with this progress, we'll continue to work tirelessly for the many, many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha. Transitioning to bone health, EVENITY had record sales of $318 million for the quarter, driven by 39% volume growth. Osteoporosis disproportionately impacts postmenopausal women and the diagnosis and treatment rates for these patients are low. In the U.S., only 6% of very high-risk patients with osteoporosis are treated with a bone builder, creating an urgent need for treatment with an effective therapy. EVENITY is an important therapy to address this unmet need as it is the only bone builder that works with the body's natural ability to increase bone formation and also decrease bone resorption. We see strong growth potential for EVENITY and we'll continue to apply our proven experience in bone health to ensure it reaches all the patients who need it. Prolia sales grew 12% year-over-year to a record $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter. Volume growth of 10% was supported by real-world evidence reaffirming Prolia superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at a high risk of fracture. Moving to our oncology business, which includes BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and XGEVA. Sales of these six innovative products grew 5% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, with 3% volume growth. Full year sales grew 12% year-over-year, driven by 12% volume growth. BLINCYTO sales grew 47% year-over-year to a record $241 million for the fourth quarter. Volume growth of 55% was supported by broad prescribing to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in frontline consolidation treatment. Long term, we see significant growth potential for BLINCYTO from utilization earlier in the front line as part of induction treatment. LUMAKRAS sales increased 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS coming from launches in new markets and additional indications. Vectibix sales increased 5% and KYPROLIS sales grew 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, both driven by volume growth. Nplate sales decreased 18% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by volume decline related to timing of orders placed by the U.S. government, partially offset by volume growth across our regions. Full year sales increased 13%, primarily driven by volume growth, including U.S. government orders. Excluding U.S. government orders, Nplate sales grew 23% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Transitioning to our inflammation business. Otezla sales increased 2% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and 3% volume growth, partially offset by lower inventory levels and lower net selling price. Full year sales decreased 4% driven by lower net selling price and lower inventory levels, partially offset by 2% volume growth. New patient starts for Otezla grew 6% in the fourth quarter, driven by strong execution and increased investment. Competitor free drug programs had a reduced impact in the quarter. Otezla is uniquely positioned to grow in 2024 and beyond, given its indication for all severities of psoriasis, combined with an established clinical profile, broad payer coverage, a lack of testing required for initiation and convenient oral administration. Enbrel sales decreased 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter, driven by a 4% impact from unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower net selling price. U.S. volume grew 1% in the fourth quarter, supported by an increase in new patients starting treatment as a result of improved payer coverage. Going forward, we expect net selling price to continue to decline year-over-year driven by higher rebates to maintain broad first-line payer coverage and changes in patient mix. TEZSPIRE continues a strong launch trajectory with $177 million in sales in the fourth quarter and $567 million for the full year. Sales increased 10% sequentially, driven by volume growth. Our successful launch of a self-administered prefilled single-use pen allowed us to expand coverage with major pharmacy benefit managers to over 80%, contributing to higher new patient growth as the year progressed. Moving forward, we expect this expanded coverage will allow TEZSPIRE to help even more patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. Sales of TAVNEOS were $44 million in the quarter and $134 million for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we saw a 17% quarter-over-quarter volume growth in the U.S. Approximately 2,700 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 1,700 health care professionals. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our expertise in nephrology and inflammation to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Sales for our biosimilars portfolio grew 10% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year, driven by 27% and 29% volume growth. This volume growth was partially offset by net selling price decline. Over time, we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. Overall, our execution is strong across the business, underscored by our foundational commitment to serve patients. The four pillars of our portfolio position us well to serve many more patients around the world who can benefit from our innovative therapies. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram, who will cover our rare disease portfolio. I think you've covered all the bases. I would just add this, Evan, that with the unique and differentiated mechanism, as Jay described, we hope we can treat a broader population of patients than perhaps the currently available therapies. And we also recognize that there are patients who are refractory to those currently available therapies, and we would obviously want to understand if they would be responders to TEZSPIRE. I think we've got strong commercial capabilities, including with our partners at AstraZeneca and are well positioned to take a product like this into the market if we're successful in Phase III. And Colin, this is Murdo. I would just add that from a patient experience perspective, we've learned a lot from other biologics. And Amgen has a world-class process development, manufacturing and device team, and we've done a lot of work on this one, and we anticipate a very positive and simple patient experience on at least a monthly dosing schedule. And we've learned a lot from Repatha specifically, and there's more to follow on Repatha from that, but we continue to work to improve patient experience with our biologic injectables. The question is what technology we're using for the subcutaneous injectable form of TEPEZZA? Jay, in terms of the data sharing, do you want to share..."

I would just add that we're planning a very expansive Phase III program. So you can expect to see multiple indications move forward in parallel. And as Jay indicated, as we start to see data, we will begin launching those trials, and we'll discuss them. And then in addition, as you're aware, regulatory authorities around the world require a certain body of safety data before Phase III launches. And so of course, we will be compliant with that. But our goal is to launch Phase III as quickly as possible once we have the requisite data set and regulatory approval. For data availability - as Jay mentioned, we're nearly complete in terms of dose expansion enrollment. So as those data roll forward over the course of the year, we'll provide guidance as to when we might have the next look at that data. But that's probably the next meaningful set of data we'll get a look at either later this year or early into next year. Yes. I would say the target, as you mentioned, is one that helps control some of the central signaling that drives some of the autoimmune diseases that are being investigated here. And at this point, I think it's all efforts towards generating the clinical data."

            "name": "Jay Bradner",
            "content": "Thank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to take a minute to convey how thrilled I am to join the Amgen R&D organization and its leadership team. The creativity of our discovery research, expert and expedited clinical development, most authoritative biomanufacturing organization in the industry, all were well known to me before joining. But now on staff at Amgen, I appreciate the strong sense of service, the patients facing serious illness, the like-minded commitment, growing the impact of our medicines and our business and the shared conviction in this remarkable portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines. In 2023, we executed with speed across our clinical pipeline, achieving excellent enrollment in key programs and setting up 2024 as the year with significant data readouts across the portfolio for medicines with the potential to transform patient care. Key highlights in 2023 included the delivery of promising data from four key oncology assets and the attainment of three breakthrough therapy designations in oncology. We initiated pivotal Phase III studies for Tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer, LUMAKRAS in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer, along with dazodalibep in Sjo\u0308gren's syndrome. In General Medicine, as previously disclosed, top line 52-week data from the 592 patient MariTide Phase II study is expected by late 2024. Leveraging the durability of weight loss observed in Phase I and rapid enrollment enjoyed in Phase II, we recently added a part 2 to this study, which explores durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks. Our planning for a comprehensive Phase III program across multiple indications remains on track. Lastly, you may have seen that yesterday, Nature Metabolism published manuscript from Amgen R&D that provides the integration of MariTide preclinical and Phase I data. Beyond MariTide, our obesity strategy encompasses several assets with AMG 786 in Phase I and additional preclinical assets advancing. Our approach is tailored to meet the dynamic needs of obesity treatment, demonstrating a longitudinal commitment to innovation and patient care in this field. The Phase III outcome study of Olpasiran are potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has enrolled more than 7,000 patients globally. This rapid enrollment accomplished in just 1 year across 34 countries and over 700 sites underscores the medical community's strong interest in and the potential impact of Olpasiran. We've deliberately expanded our initial enrollment target from 6,000 to over 7,000 patients to ensure comprehensive demographic representation and to satisfy regional regulatory requirements. We are on track to complete enrollment in the first half of 2024. In oncology, we're focused on approaching high conviction targets with differentiated therapies for large effect size. We're pleased to announce that the FDA granted priority review for BLINCYTO in early-stage CD19-positive B-ALL with a PDUFA date of June 21, 2024. The ongoing Phase III Golden Gate study is enrolling patients to evaluate the effectiveness of alternating BLINCYTO with low intensity chemotherapy here in older adults diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL. We're also planning to amend this study to evaluate subcutaneous administration of blinatumomab with initiation anticipated in the second half of 2024 potentially allowing us to serve more patients in treating physicians. Lastly, we're pleased to announce that just today, the American Journal of Hematology published a manuscript highlighting data from the dose expansion phase of our ongoing Phase Ib study of subcutaneous blinatumomab as a single agent in adult patients with heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory B-cell ALL. Of 27 evaluable patients treated, we observed an 85% complete response rate, of which 75% were MRD negative. Subcutaneous blinatumumab is well tolerated with no observed grade 4 cytokine release syndrome. Turning to Tarlatamab, a first-in-class DLL3-targeting BiTE molecule, the FDA granted priority review following promising results from the Phase II DeLLphi-301 clinical trial and a PDUFA date of June 12, 2024. We are rapidly advancing Tarlatamab into earlier lines of treatment, where we have initiated two Phase III studies and plan to initiate a third in the first half of 2024. Xaluritamig, a first-in-class STEAP1 bispecific molecule being studied in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer continues to progress following the presentation of encouraging Phase I data last fall. We are ahead of schedule with the monotherapy dose expansion and expect to complete enrollment in the coming weeks. We've opened a reduced monitoring cohort and are making significant progress in dose range finding studies in combination with novel hormonal therapy combinations. For AMG 193 in oral MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor were encouraged by 9 responses we've seen across 7 MTAP-null solid tumors. MG 193 is a terrific example of a medicine targeting a genetically defined synthetic lethality and a first clinical translation of our induced proximity platform. We're now swiftly moving forward with dose expansion studies and plan to enter master protocols and thoracic and gastrointestinal malignancies, exploring combinations with standard of care in the first half of 2024. In our inflammation portfolio, we continue to explore TEZSPIRE and indications beyond severe asthma, including separate Phase III studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected in the second half of 2024 as well as in eosinophilic esophagitis. We also remain on track to present Phase II COPD data in the first half of 2024. Our ROCKET Phase III program for rocatinlimab, the first-in-class anti- OX40 -mon colonal antibody has successfully enrolled over 2,400 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. We're introducing an 8th study to the ROKET program to explore an auto-injector, and we are planning to initiate both the Phase III study in prurigo nodularis and a Phase II study in asthma this year as we seek to broadly explore the potential of rocatinlimab. Lastly, we are encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline with several mid to late-stage opportunities. In December, TEPEZZA received orphan drug designation in Japan where we've also recently submitted a new drug application for TEPEZZA in thyroid eye disease. To serve additional patients in Japan, we have a Phase III study underway in the study of chronic disease with a low clinical activity score. Beyond Japan, we are progressing TEPEZZA subcutaneous administration to drive increased adoption and improve patient experience and plan to initiate a Phase III study in thyroid eye disease this year. With UPLIZNA, we anticipate important Phase III data readouts this year in myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease. Both diseases with significant unmet need and where we have the potential to make a real difference for patients. Dazodalibep, an innovative CD40-ligand inhibitor fusion protein has entered Phase III for Sjo\u0308gren's syndrome. This follows encouraging Phase II data with efficacy across patients with moderate to severe systemic disease and patients with high symptom burden. Dazodalibep is the first therapy to demonstrate efficacy in this latter patient population. Closing on our rare disease efforts, we're excited about Fipaxalparant, an LPAR1 antagonist being studied in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, on track for a Phase II proof-of-concept data readout in the second half of 2024. In closing, I'm delighted to report on the important progress we make advancing our innovative pipeline, and I'm looking forward to sharing more pipeline milestones through 2024. I'll now turn it over to you, Peter. Yes. Thanks a lot, Michael. We really appreciate the consideration the Phase 1 paper is receiving from the community. It's exciting to report these data. For those who haven't seen it, this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 49 patients, looking at safety, PK, PD, single ascending dose, 7 cohorts, multiple ascending dose 3 cohorts, 3 monthly doses, patients with obesity being migrated than 30. And we were quite pleased with the outcome. Looking at the 420-milligram dose as an example, which was the highest dose study, 14.5% weight loss at only day 85. And moreover, quite durable coming off of that medicine out to 150 days, all with relatively mild gastrointestinal side effects. And so to answer your last question first, we find the Phase I data, which we're pleased to share with the community to be quite supportive of our ongoing work to develop this medicine to the greatest possible benefit of patients suffering from obesity. Now you've asked questions around some of the measurements on this study, lipid, blood pressure and A1C. And I would just caution that this is a Phase I trial, the numbers are very small, that the duration of treatment is rather short. But even with all of those caveats, while hard to draw conclusions from such small numbers, especially labile measurements like blood pressure and lipids, all are directionally favorable. And so we have - we take no concern whatsoever from those measurements on the study. Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take this one as well. As you may or may not know, the Phase II study, which is ongoing at present and going very well, explores 11 dosing cohorts with relevant placebo controls. And through that study, we'll have a chance to gain an experience with a longer exposure to MariTide dosed in different ways. We've recently added a part 2 to this study that will allow us to explore even more durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks enabled by just very rapid enrollment. And these four dosing cohorts will go on to test dose level and even less frequent dosing schedules than monthly. And so these Phase II data, even by end of year will be strongly instructive as to finding a safe and tolerated and efficacious dose to carry into Phase III clinical investigation. The third part was a little bit broken up of your question. I heard a better explanation of part two frequency of dosing. And then I did not hear your third part. Okay. Yes. Thank you for the question, Jay. Let me give a little bit of context on this Part 2 study that I think will help answer them. In part 2, the intent is to really look at durable weight loss beyond 52 weeks. And so by durable weight loss, patients eligible for Part 2, which begins at the end of 52 weeks, will be responding to this medicine. And then they'll be rerandomized to four cohorts that will test dose level. And again, this even less frequent dosing schedule. We have not disclosed the granularity on the dosing schedule. This is a competitive environment. But we're afforded this chance because the ADC, the antibody core of MariTide, like so many immunoglobulin therapeutics allows for the opportunity to use it much less frequently. The rate of patients rolling over to Part 2 will be established as the Phase II study continues to progress this year. Just as we go to the next question, let me observe that we're almost up to the hour that we actually all to set aside, but I know we still have quite a few questions in the queue. So we'll try to get one question for a caller here and get through. We'll stay through the queue of calls or questions rather that's still waiting for us, but I know some of you may have to drop. So let's move forward, Justin. Yes. No, I'm happy to. As you may know, on a hematologist, I think CD19 is a terrific target. It's expressed really on all B cells and spares plasma cells. And therefore, considering indication expansion, as you've asked, there's a large number of diseases that could potentially be approached with UPLIZNA to the real benefit of patients with unmet need, far beyond the application of the prevailing CD20s that target just a subset of B cells. This is not lost on our team, and we're working through indication expansion priorities presently. And in terms of - Dave, you want to add the regulatory piece? And the best extrapolation that you can have is from the preclinical data that were just published, I urge you to take a look at that. Tim, this is Jay. I open it up to anyone else who wants to contribute to this. I don't believe that - yes, that engaging in the dialogue around this is as much to the narrative. Rather, I'd say that the argument for GIP receptor antagonism comes from just the highest level of scientific data, the human experience across populations with 1 million patients studied, among those who have variations in the genes associated with this pathway where that variation is directionally inhibitory, the BMI is lower. And so we're hoping to replicate that pharmacology with this medicine. We feel great about the offering in this domain. Yes. Well, it's very early days with this medicine. There is strong preclinical support from the published literature and our own preclinical work. It's nicely for patients, a very competitive landscape, but this is the earliest phases of clinical investigation. And so we're going to approach this with total aquapoise and bring the medicine to the patients that stand to benefit the best based on the biology underlying. The short answer is it's too early to talk it up to antagonism versus agonism. As I said before, and I meant it, that these lipids are labile and indirect biomarker of this pharmacology. This is an early stage study that had 1 or 3 monthly doses of the medicine. And so we are not reading anything into the lipids conclusively from this trial. We are making all these measurements in the active Phase I."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin.\nJustin Claeys: Thank you, Julianne. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Vikram Karnani, who joined Amgen from Horizon Therapeutics following the October 6, 2023 acquisition close, Dave Reese and Peter Griffith. Given the timing of these Horizon Therapeutics acquisition close, our third quarter results do not include any contribution from Horizon. Vikram will provide select information from Horizon's third quarter product sales for future context. You should have received a link to our slides that we have posted. Through the course of our discussion today, we will make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance. And just a reminder that actual results can vary materially. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.\nRobert Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Justin and thank all of you for joining our call. It's an exciting time here at Amgen. And we're continuing to execute well this year, serving many more patients around the world with medicines such as Repatha, EVENITY and Tezspire, advancing a number of promising first-in-class medicines rapidly through our pipeline and preparing for our next wave of biosimilar launches. However, as this is our first earnings call following the close of our acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, I thought we might turn our attention there first. The Horizon acquisition, coupled with our purchase of ChemoCentryx, which we acquired a little more than a year ago, gives Amgen a significant rare disease business that fits squarely within our overall strategy and will be additive to the growth we expect from our base business. At the heart of our strategy of course is innovation. First, our best-in-class medicines that make a big difference for patients suffering from serious diseases. The medicines in our rare disease portfolio like Tavneos, Tepezza, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA fit this description perfectly and they'll benefit from Amgen's decades of experience in inflammatory diseases. These medicines are also early enough in their lifecycles that we can positively impact their growth by leveraging Amgen's capabilities in process development, lifecycle management and manufacturing. Finally, we spent the past decade or so building out our international footprint with Amgen medicines now available in about 100 countries. And today our rare disease sales come almost exclusively from the U.S. So, we'll be able to leverage our global presence to quickly bring these medicines to patients around the world. You'll hear more in a minute from Vikram Karnani, who joined us through the Horizon acquisition and is leading a newly created rare disease business that is now the fourth leg of Amgen's commercial stool, alongside our inflammation, oncology and general medicine businesses. Turning to our financial performance in the quarter. Total revenues were up 4% and earnings per share were up 6% compared with a year ago. Volume increased 11% globally, which represents our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth. And we achieved good balance across all of our geographic regions and therapeutic areas. Seven of our medicines generated record sales in the quarter. And I'll highlight one of these, BLINCYTO, which delivered 55% sales growth in the third quarter. We see continued upside potential for BLINCYTO as it is increasingly used in earlier lines of therapy and as practice guidelines are updated to reflect the role this medicine can play in treating a broad range of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Turning to our pipeline. We had the opportunity to discuss six potential first-in-class oncology assets with you recently following ESMO. Three of these have earned Breakthrough Therapy designations from the FDA; tarlatamab, BLINCYTO and LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in colorectal cancer. We also continue to progress trials for bemarituzumab in gastric cancer, for Xaluritamig in prostate cancer and for AMG 193, our PRMT5 inhibitor, which has generated responses across six solid tumors. I'll just quickly note that AMG 193 was identified through our proprietary DNA encoded library technology which we added through the 2019 acquisition of Nuevolution, and it demonstrates our leadership in the emerging field of multi-specific drugs that can address pathways that have long been recognized but considered inaccessible to traditional drug discovery efforts. In other pipeline news, we've completed enrollment in our Phase 2 obesity study for maridebart cafraglutide, which was formerly known as AMG 133. And finally, the FDA has accepted our BLA for our biosimilar to EYLEA. Looking at our business, we feel we have good momentum across the board. We have everything we need with the portfolio, the pipeline and the people to deliver attractive sales and earnings growth through the end of the decade and beyond. As always, I want to thank Amgen employees around the world, including some 2,000 new colleagues focused on rare diseases for their commitment to strong execution on behalf of the patients we serve. With that, I'll now turn it over to Murdo Gordon. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Bob. I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Execution is strong across the business with record quarterly sales for seven brands and robust volume growth across our general medicine, inflammation and hematology/oncology portfolios. Product sales increased 5% year-over-year. Volume growth was 11% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 11% and volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle-East and Canada region was 8%. Consistent with our international expansion strategy, Asia-Pacific continues to be our fastest growing region with 27% volume growth in the quarter. Starting with our general medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, Evenity and Aimovig. Overall revenue for these four products grew 21% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by 20% volume growth. Repatha sales increased 31% year-over-year in the third quarter, with volume growth of 44%, partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., volume growth of 45% was driven by a record number of new patients starting treatment, more than doubling year-over-year. We saw declining net selling prices in the US, primarily driven by new formulary coverage by CVS in July for commercial patients. Outside the U.S., we saw a 43% volume growth with strength across our regions. There are still many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha and we're rising to meet that challenge by investing and executing to drive awareness amongst physicians and patients. In the U.S., we have significantly expanded our primary care sales force and activated more than 15,000 new prescribers this year. We're also increasing promotion to patients through direct-to-consumer media efforts. Transitioning to bone health, Prolia sales grew 14% year-over-year in the third quarter, primarily driven by 7% volume growth and higher net selling price. We expect volumes for Prolia to grow supported by real-world evidence data presented earlier this year that demonstrate Prolia's superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with post-menopausal osteoporosis. EVENITY had record sales of $307 million for the quarter, driven by 48% volume growth. Osteoporosis disproportionately impacts postmenopausal women, and the diagnosis and treatment rates for these patients are low. In 2023, we expect approximately 3 million patients in the U.S. will be treated for post-menopausal osteoporosis, an estimated 40% of treated patients will be at very high risk of fracture. But only 6% of those high risk patients will be treated with a bone-building product. EVENITY plays an important role in the bone builder market with a 58% share in the U.S. and a 44% share in Japan. There's much more work to be done and we'll continue to invest to ensure EVENITY reaches the patients who need it. Otezla sales declined 10% year-over-year, driven by lower net selling price, unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, and lower inventory levels, partially offset by 1% volume growth in the U.S. Otezla net price declines were driven by higher rebates to support and expand access for commercial and Medicare Part-D patients. Our U.S. Otezla business has been impacted by free drug programs associated with new treatment options that have entered the psoriasis marketplace. We're beginning to see a reduced impact of these free drug programs as physicians and patients are experiencing barriers to access, given prior authorization requirements for these newer therapies. We have strong conviction in the growth potential of Otezla, with its unique indication for all severities of psoriasis, combined with an established clinical profile, broad payer coverage, a lack of testing required for initiation and convenient oral administration. To realize that potential, we have increased our investment to ensure physician and patients understand both the importance of treating psoriasis systemically and the safety and efficacy profile that Otezla offers. We are already seeing positive results from that increased investment, including significant growth in the number of patients requesting educational information and taking action on the Otezla website that generally indicate preparation for a discussion with the healthcare professional. And also recently increased our dermatology sales force by 20% to educate physicians about the benefits of Otezla for appropriate patients. With these increased investments, we expect to drive a return to growth for Otezla. Enbrel sales decreased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by an 8% decline from unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. Year-over-year volume increased 1% in the third quarter and the number of new patients in the U.S. starting treatment increased by 22% driven by improved payer coverage and Enbrel's 20-plus year track record of safety and efficacy. For the remainder of 2023, we expect our improved coverage will lead to continued growth in new patients and declining net selling price. Tezspire continues to show strong growth with $161 million in sales in the third quarter. Sales increased 21% sequentially, driven by 18% volume growth that benefited from the launch of our self-administered pre-filled single-use pen, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first quarter. We've now obtained coverage of the patent with the majority of pharmacy benefit managers, enabling easy access and convenient self-administration for patients in the U.S. with severe uncontrolled asthma. As we expected, Tezspire has both penetrated and helped grow the U.S. asthma biologics market. In 2023, the number of new patients on asthma biologics has increased by over 20% year-over-year and Tezspire's share of this expanded market is approximately 20%. Sales of Tavneos were $37 million in the quarter with 26% quarter-over-quarter volume growth. In the U.S., approximately 2,300 patients have now been treated with Tavneos by over 1,500 healthcare professionals. We continue to see an increase in awareness of Tavneos by rheumatologists and nephrologists. And exiting the quarter, we saw an increase in new patient start forms. Looking forward, we expect to bring Tavneos to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Amjevita sales increased 30% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by 53% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. Ex-U.S. sales increased 10%, driven by 22% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. Moving to our hematology-oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO . Strong commercial execution and compelling new clinical data drove 15% volume growth year-over-year for these six innovative products. BLINCYTO sales grew 55% year-over-year to a record $220 million for the third quarter. Volume growth of 56% was supported by broad prescribing to acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients following positive data from the registration-enabling E1910 study presented late 2022, and updated NCCN guidelines that were issued in May. Long-term, we see significant additional growth potential for BLINCYTO from earlier lines of therapy. LUMAKRAS reported $52 million in sales for the third quarter, a decline of 31% year-over-year. $22 million of this decline was driven by ongoing reimbursement negotiations in France. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS, driven by launches in new markets and our comprehensive global clinical development program. Vectibix sales increased 2% year-over-year for the third quarter to a record $252 million, driven by higher net selling price and 4% volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact. KYPROLIS grew 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by 8% volume growth. And Nplate sales increased 45% year-over-year for the third quarter, resulting from a $142 million order from the U.S. government. In the fourth quarter, we expect to fulfill an additional $62 million order for Nplate by the U.S. government. Given the strong performance of our hematology-oncology products and the exciting new positive data presented at ESMO on our oncology pipeline, we look forward to helping more patients with their cancer therapy. Overall, our execution is strong across the business, driving growth and demonstrating our dedication to serving patients. And with the expansion of our rare disease portfolio, we're excited to serve many more patients around the world who can benefit from our therapies. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram.\nVikram Karnani: Thanks, Murdo. We're excited to bring together Horizon's medicines, pipeline and rare disease expertise with Amgen's history of leadership in inflammatory diseases, global infrastructure and world-class biologic capabilities. For those that are not as familiar with Horizon's portfolio, I will spend the next few minutes providing some background on our rare disease medicines. Horizon's business delivered $945 million of sales in the third quarter, representing 2% year-over-year sales growth with multiple positive leading indicators. Let me describe in more detail. Tepezza, the first and only medicine approved for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, regardless of disease activity or duration, generated $453 million of sales in the third quarter, representing 2% quarter-over-quarter growth. We are confident that now as we have officially joined forces and have on-boarded the full commercial team, we will make significant progress in advancing this important product over time to patients. We are driving several initiatives to continue to build the U.S. thyroid eye disease market. In the third quarter, we saw a greater than 50% year-over-year increase in the number of Tepezza prescribers, supported by the April 2023 FDA label update to treat patients with thyroid eye disease, regardless of disease activity or duration. We are pleased with this progress and are continuing to educate the physician community on new clinical data and updated indication across the full spectrum of TED patients. Second, large national and regional payers are continuing to make favorable policy changes to help eligible patients access Tepezza. To date, we have obtained favorable policy changes for greater than 30% of U.S.-covered lives, which are expected to take effect later this year and early next year. As a reminder, for Tepezza, there is a time lag between a patient being identified for Tepezza treatment and treatment being initiated. It can take up to 90 days for a patient enrollment form to move through the prior authorization process. Once that step is complete, then the patient's infusion needs to be scheduled at an appropriate site of care. This process takes time and we have taken several important steps to minimize the time between patient identification and treatment initiation. Finally, we continue to see approximately 100,000 patients with moderate-to-severe disease in the U.S. that are appropriate for Tepezza, with the majority of these patients in low Clinical Activity Score settings. Therefore, the patients -- the FDA's label update, combined with favorable medical policy changes by payers and supported by the expanding base of prescribing physicians, gives us a significant opportunity to reach more patients. These positive execution trends underpin our confidence in Tepezza's growth potential in the U.S. Moving on to markets outside the U.S. We continue to see international expansion as a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for Tepezza which received its first ex-U.S. approval in Brazil in the second quarter of this year. We are particularly excited about the opportunity to leverage Amgen's long-standing presence in multiple major ex-U.S. markets, including Europe and in Japan, where we have reported positive data from the Phase 3 OPTIC-J trial. We also continue to enroll a Tepezza Phase 3 trial in Japanese patients with chronic or low clinical activity thyroid eye disease. KRYSTEXXA, the first and only medicine approved for uncontrolled gout, delivered a record $253 million of sales in the third quarter, representing 32% year-over-year growth. Sales are now annualizing at a $1 billion run rate. Performance in the third quarter reflected continued strong uptake in both the rheumatology and nephrology segments. Strong results were driven by execution across all phases of the patient journey, demand-generation, stakeholder education and adherence to treatment. The FDA approved KRYSTEXXA's label change for combination with methotrexate in July 2022. We have seen a steady increase in uptake since then. Immunomodulation usage remained above 70% of new patient starts in the third quarter. We see an opportunity to redefine KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate as a standard of care and reach even more of the over 100,000 uncontrolled gout patients in the U.S. UPLIZNA sales increased 54% year-over-year in the third quarter to $67 million. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex-U.S. markets, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Brazil. Additional indications in development also support UPLIZNA's long-term growth potential with Phase 3 trials underway in both IgG4-related disease, and myasthenia gravis. The rest of Horizon's portfolio generated $173 million of sales in the third quarter, primarily driven by our portfolio of ultra-rare medicines; RAVICTI, PROCYSBI and ACTIMMUNE. We see an opportunity for this basket of products to continue to generate robust sales. Before I turn it over to Dave Reese, I want to take the opportunity to thank all my colleagues in the rare disease business for maintaining their focus on patients throughout a period of distraction over the last several months. Looking ahead, we are excited to work together by leveraging Amgen and Horizon's combined capabilities to ensure our medicines reach more patients even faster who are suffering from serious and rare diseases globally. I'll now turn it over to Dave.\nDavid Reese: Thank you, Vikram. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by welcoming our new colleagues from Horizon. We are excited to be integrating Horizon's R&D capabilities with Amgen's to advance the promising Horizon pipeline. For R&D, the third quarter was one of high quality execution as we progressed our innovative pipeline with important oncology data readouts, the addition of two breakthrough therapy designations and completion of enrollment on key studies. We also advanced our innovative pipeline through rapid enrollment on multiple registration enabling studies. Starting with general medicine, we have completed enrollment in the Phase 2 study of maridebart cafraglutide in patients with obesity with or without diabetes. The goal of this study is to generate data that will provide optionality to design a broad Phase 3 program, leveraging the unique properties of maridebart cafraglutide that could potentially allow us to take a differentiated approach. We anticipate top-line data from this 52-week study towards the end of 2024. The Phase 3 outcomes study of Olpasiran are potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is enrolling very well. In inflammation, beyond severe asthma, we are investigating additional indications with Tezspire, including separate Phase 3 studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, which is fully enrolled and eosinophilic esophagitis. We also have a Phase 2 study in COPD that has been fully enrolled with top-line data anticipated in the first half of 2024. This study has recruited a broad population of COPD patients, including patients with both high and low eosinophil counts. Rocatinlimab, a first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, recruitment is off to a strong start on the ROCKET Phase 3 clinical development program. We have now randomized over 1,500 patients across the program. We are excited to present additional data from our expanded rheumatology portfolio following the acquisition of Horizon, including data from a Phase 2 study of dazodalibep in Sjogren's Syndrome, along with data from KRYSTEXXA, Tavneos, Otezla and other molecules from our broad portfolio at the American College of Rheumatology Convergence 2023 Meeting in November. I'll be brief with my remarks on our oncology portfolio, given the detailed oncology review last week. Based on the E1910 Phase 3 study, the FDA has granted BLINCYTO Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with CD19-positive Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the consolidation phase of multiphase therapy. We see future growth in BLINCYTO from advancements into earlier lines of therapy and subcutaneous administration. BLINCYTO also serves as a blueprint for how we plan to rapidly progress tarlatamab and Xaluritamig into earlier lines of therapy [indiscernible] setting a lower tumor burden. Along with experts in the field, we are very encouraged by tarlatamab, our BiTE molecule, targeting DLL3. At ESMO, we presented data from DeLLphi-301, a Phase 2 study in late-stage small-cell lung cancer, where we saw impressive response rates, durability of response, and overall survival in a setting where patients typically have limited options and a very poor prognosis. We are submitting these data to the FDA and are pleased that the FDA has granted tarlatamab Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Given our confidence in these data, we are rapidly advancing tarlatamab into earlier lines of treatment with multiple Phase 3 studies underway or planned. Based on emerging clinical data, we are discontinuing PSMA-targeting bispecific AMG 340, and we will focus our efforts on rapidly advancing Xaluritamig in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We expect Xaluritamig dose expansion cohorts to be fully enrolled by the end of the year, and are planning to initiate additional studies in patients with earlier-stage prostate cancer. With AMG 193, a small molecule MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor, we are encouraged by the responses we've seen across six MTAP-null solid tumors, the manageable safety profile and preclinical evidence of CNS penetrants. We are now rapidly enrolling dose expansion cohorts. And with that, I'll turn things over to Peter for the financial update.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Dave. I'll review our third quarter results before discussing our updated 2023 guidance. Turning to our third quarter financial results, which are shown on Slide 44, total revenues of $6.9 billion grew 4% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.96 grew 6% year-over-year. The growth in revenues was due to product sales increasing 5% year-over-year, driven by a 11% volume growth. Third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year. We advanced our pipeline and invested in growth opportunities in the quarter, while delivering a non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales of 52%. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.3 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 17.4%, primarily driven by higher profit shares and changes in product mix. Non-GAAP R&D expenses in the quarter decreased 2% year-over-year due to lower spend in research and early pipeline activities, partially offset by higher spend in later-stage clinical programs and marketed products. Year-to-date, non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 5% due to higher spend in later-stage clinical programs and marketed products, partially offset by lower spend in research and early pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the third quarter increased 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments, digitalization, driving productivity and accelerating use cases for artificial intelligence. Non-GAAP OI&E were a net $225 million expense in the third quarter. The year-over-year favorability was driven primarily by higher interest income and the change in Beijing accounting from equity method to a mark-to-market investments, with the impact included only in our GAAP results. Our third quarter non-GAAP tax rate increased 3.2 percentage points to 16.1%, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change that replaced the excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue to prioritize investments in both internal and external innovation. In the third quarter, we increased investments in programs, including maridebart cafraglutide, I'll call it mari from now on, Rocatinlimab, Tavneos and ABP 206, our biosimilar to OPDIVO. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth, including through simultaneous construction of our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. We're excited for the anticipated licensure of our Ohio facility in the first half of 2024. Additionally, we're making investments in all parts of our business to leverage the power of Generative AI opportunities. Third, we have a strong track record of returning capital to our shareholders and pay dividends of $2.13 per share in the third quarter, representing a 10% increase over the third quarter in 2022. The company generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2022. We will continue to generate strong cash flows. However, Q4 cash flow will be lower than historical patterns due to the timing of tax payments and Horizon transaction-related expenses. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2023 on Slide 46. We're pleased to have closed the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. We're updating our full-year 2023 guidance to include Horizon financial results starting October 6, 2023. So our Q4 results will exclude approximately one week of Horizon's results. We are raising our 2023 revenue guidance to$28.0 billion to $28.4 billion versus previous guidance of $26.6 billion to $27.4 billion. For 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share, we are narrowing the range to $18.20 to $18.80 versus previous guidance of $17.80 to $18.80. We will add Horizon's business into Q4 without material non-GAAP EPS dilution. However, we do expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be lower than Q3 non-GAAP EPS because of planned investment increases in our business, including key assets in our innovative pipeline, beginning with mari, Olpasiran and AMG 193, and other strategic business investments, including Generative AI use cases in all parts of our business. This sequential pattern is consistent with historical trends. And in addition, Q4 non-GAAP EPS will begin to include the recognition of interest expense related to the Horizon financing as a non-GAAP expense, important additional points to consider as you model the remainder of 2023. We now expect other revenue for 2023 to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion versus our prior range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. With the Horizon acquisition, we now anticipate full year non-GAAP operating expense for 2023 to increase from our previous estimate of 3% (ph) to approximately 10% versus last year. Horizon represents approximately 5 percentage points of this 10% year-over-year increase. We continue to expect the full year 2023 operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales as a percentage of product sales to be between 16% and 17%. We now expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to increase from our prior guidance of 5% to about 10% year-over-year. Horizon represents approximately 3 percentage points of this 10% year-over-year increase. The additional 2 percentage points are driven by planned increase in our investments in our innovative pipeline, including mari, Olpasiran, and AMG 193. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A to be down year-over-year as a percentage of product sales slightly. We now expect non-GAAP OI&E expenses to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, up from our prior guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect Q4 OI&E to be about $700 million, reflecting interest expense related to the Horizon financing, which will be included in our non-GAAP results effective October 6. And as you begin to model 2024, note that we expect 2024 OI&E to be consistent with this Q4 run rate. This higher interest expense is driven by the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition at a weighted average interest rate of 5.6%. We expect to end 2023 with approximately $65 billion of long-term debt, including the current portion of it, and $11 billion of cash and cash equivalents. For the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% to 17%, down from prior guidance of 17.5% to 18.5%. We expect approximately 540 million shares to be outstanding in Q4. This increase from Q3 is driven by the conversion of unvested Horizon equity awards and the Amgen equity awards. Our 2023 capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately $950 million, up from our prior guidance of $925 million. The addition of Horizon's rare disease team further strengthens our confidence in delivering against our long-term growth objectives. We continue to allocate capital to advance innovation at speed and at scale. And I'm incredibly grateful to our now 26,000-plus colleagues for successfully executing our mission of serving patients. This concludes the financial update. And now, I will ask our operator, Julianne, please open the lines for Q&A and remind our participants of the procedure to ask their questions. Julianne?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Yee: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for all the details around the Horizon transaction. I just wanted to ask a question to David Reese. I mean, David unless we're hiding under a rock, I guess obesity is like the biggest thing ever now and wanted to understand your commentary and confidence around 133 and the profile around what you think that could be relative to leaders and how 786 would fit into that given such a high bar for other orals? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yeah. Sure. As we've discussed before, Mike, with 133, we believe we have a potentially differentiated product based on the mechanism of action, it's a bi-functional to remind everyone, that antagonizes GIPR based on a genetic evidence, largely compiled by us, with two GLP-1 peptides stapled to the molecule for that mechanism of action. As I noted in the remarks, we've rapidly enrolled the Phase 2 trial. There are multiple arms to this trial that explore three different doses as well as different dosing intervals that I think will give us broad optionality going forward. We were quite pleased with the Phase 1 data in terms of depth of response, the kinetics of response, as well as persistence, and these are the things that we will be looking at in Phase 2 as we go forward. So it's full steam ahead on this program. And we're looking forward to data from the Phase 2 trial next year which will really inform the breadth of the Phase 3 trial that we're contemplating, which could be quite large. In terms of AMG 186 -- or 786, this is an orthogonal mechanism of action. We're bringing in data. And as we've indicated, after, you know, the first half of next year or so, we anticipate presenting those data in determining the path forward. As you note, it's a high bar in this field and we'd have to see the sort of profile that would, give us the confidence to invest broadly in a molecule like that. I would also note, we've got a suite of preclinical molecules, many of them non-incretin based in terms of mechanisms of action that we will be bringing forward over the next few years. So this is an area where we expect it to be a long-term player. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nYaron Werber: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, just for you, the $700 million run rate, that was interest expense only, right? That's not including where you're recording sort of the Beijing contribution in the line right above it in terms of other income. And then just secondly, again on your guidance, you also mentioned 3% to 10% increase year-over-year And you mentioned 5% to 10% going to R&D. The 3% to 10% increased -- just remind us what that was, because SG&A is expected to be down, right, slightly year-over-year, so I just missed what that was.\nPeter Griffith: Right. Thank you, Yaron. The 700 is everything, so that's the full run rate. And on the question on R&D, as I said in my remarks, we've focused our spending on the later clinical and in-market portfolio that was slightly offset by some decreases in early research. But we continue to spend and invest in the business and we'll continue to do that. As you can see, we're fortunate to have a significant number of opportunities in Phase 3 in the later stages. So that's what we'll stay focused on, will continue to differentially invest in the opportunities in innovation and we're very excited about that.\nOperator: Thank you, Yaron. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two-parter from me for Peter as well. Peter, again, I know you went through a lot of numbers there at the end. But in terms of the revenue guidance raise for the year, can you just characterize if that was all coming from the Horizon portfolio or if there was any other contribution from the underlying base business? And then the second part of the question is just any directional help with how to think about 2024 tax rate, as I know there's a number of moving pieces from some legislation, but then you obviously have the Horizon deal close. So just directionally, can you help us out in 2024 tax rate? Thank you.\nPeter Griffith: Yeah. So -- excuse me. On the tax rate, let me start with that '24 tax rate. We'll guide on that as we always do at the beginning of the year. I would just say, I think you're thinking about the global minimum tax and Pillar 2, and I would just note, there is no consensus or predictability about how that whole OECD framework is going to be implemented. I know different countries are doing different situations. Rest assured, we look at everything, optimize our position as appropriate on something like that. So we'll give you guidance on that next year at the beginning of the year. First part of the question?\nRobert Bradway: Revenues.\nPeter Griffith: Yeah. On revenue, look, we don't really break that down. I would just suggest that we continue to see strength in the business and we continue to see our in-line portfolio perform very, very well. I would just note, we had seven products with record sales in the quarter, we had Repatha up 31%, up in the quarter year-over-year. And we've continue to see the hematology-oncology portfolio was up 16%. So everything's, strong in our base business. We're excited about that base business, that continues to perform really well and we're very excited to have the rare disease business now. And looking forward to having that as, as we said, it's kind of the four stool of our commercial thrust forward. So we're seeing good strength around the business in different areas and we'll just continue to get more and more medicines to patients. I'd note, the 11% volume growth is really important. Underneath that 12% volume growth outside the United States. And underneath that 27% volume growth in JPAC, our fastest-growing region. So that's how we're looking at that. We're pleased with the momentum and we're pleased to be able to raise the 28.0 to 28.4.\nOperator: Thank you, Terence. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With regard to the Horizon transaction, now that it's closed, could you just walk through the outlook for Tepezza and the other assets as we look to 2024 here? You talked about initiatives that you have to expand the patient population in ex-U.S. being a growth lever. Just maybe walk us through that and when we might get updated long-term guidance, including Horizon. Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Yeah. Maybe we'll take this in two parts, Salveen, it's Bob. Obviously, we're not going to provide '24 guidance here this morning. But we'll see whether we can give you a clear sense of the things that are exciting us when we look at those products for -- heading into next year. And just generally on the question of long-term guidance, as you've heard us say on a number of occasions, we remain confident that we're on track to meet or beat the objectives that we established for 2030, in some ways now frankly, we're more focused on what we can deliver through 2031 and soon to be 2032 as well. So we reviewed -- in-depth review of the oncology portfolio a couple of weeks ago and gave you a good sense for the moving pieces through the end of the decade. And we may seek to present a picture of the business in that way now heading into next year, so that you can get a more comprehensive deep-dive into the different segments of the business that are driving growth. But let's turn to first question, which is the outlook for Horizon and the initiatives that are underway, in particular, with respect to Tepezza, and KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA. So Vikram, why don't you fire away?\nVikram Karnani: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we have a lot of positive leading indicators as we look at the business. I'll start with Tepezza. We're continuing to build that U.S. TED market following the FDA's April 2023 label updates. And that really helps us get the medicine to TED patients regardless of disease activity or duration. And what we've seen following that label update is that the payers are continuing to update their medical policies and make them more favorable so that more of these patients, more in the low CAS setting or the low Clinical Activity Score setting can now access Tepezza. And I think, finally, from an execution standpoint, we see newer prescribers from both ophthalmologists, as well as endocrinologists increasing 50% year-over-year in this third quarter. So all of these indicators for Tepezza are positive and we feel good about the execution of the team. And as I said, we have now combined forces with Amgen and together we should be able to drive business in a positive way moving forward. Think -- talking about -- the story around Tepezza also is one of international growth. While we see a lot of positive trends in the U.S., we're pretty excited about what we can do as a combined company for patients outside the U.S. as well. We've talked about Brazil getting approval recently. We've got [indiscernible] OPTIC-J as our trial in Japan. We've talked about the chronic trial that's enrolling. And finally, we're getting ready for other markets and we hope to bring the medicines to many more markets now as part of the combined company than we were talking about previously. So Tepezza, both signs very positive in the US as well as globally. And as we've talked about the results for KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA, both those medicines performed really, really well. We have immunomodulation with KRYSTEXXA being a major driver since the label update last year. That has continued to drive uptake since that time. We see that continuing into the future. And with UPLIZNA, it is the fastest-growing biologics in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or NMOSD, and we see that momentum continue both in the U.S. as well as outside the U.S. So I think when I look at the overall portfolio we have, we're operating from a position of strength and now we can expand that even further with the combination with Amgen.\nSalveen Richter: Thank you, Vikram.\nOperator: Thank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJay Olson: Hey, congrats on all the progress on so many fronts. Could you talk about your investments in AI technology and how that may influence your drug discovery and development over the next five to 10 years? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Sure. I'll ask Dave Reese to address that, Jay.\nDavid Reese: Yeah. Thanks, Jay. This is an area where we're very excited. You know, I'd like to characterize it as the hinge moment where we're seeing the coming together or the unification of technology and biotechnology. I really think this is going to affect over time a qualitative change in how we do drug discovery and drug development. So everything from protein structure prediction, protein-protein interaction, prediction at the molecular level, to multiomic analysis on extraordinarily large datasets which can -- which is only tractable through AI or machine learning, dense clinical trials data and then real-world evidence and real-world data. When you look across that spectrum, I believe we probably have the largest datasets in the industry. And so we are putting the tools in place and the foundation or models to really mine those data for deeper insights in the biology and then all the way out into the market. We'll talk about this more over time. But this is going to be an area of investment and it can be overhyped. It's not a panacea, but it is absolutely going to be the most powerful tool we've seen in a long, long time.\nOperator: Thank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dave, I have a two-part question on AMG 786, the oral for obesity. First, I noticed you guys dropped a cohort in your SAD portion of the trial. Is that because you ran into MTD? And then also, I noticed the exclusion criteria around suicide ideation were intensified and I can't tell if we could be reading into that or not, would love to get any color. Thank you\nDavid Reese: Yeah. Thanks. On the latter, I wouldn't overthink that at all. I don't think there's anything there. In terms of the dosing that we do, this is always adjusted as we move through Phase 1 trials. As I've indicated, we're bringing in the data now, we're taking a look at that. And the constellation of clinical data -- updated preclinical data, and I think we'll have that all together as we go into next year and that will determine the potential path forward for AMG 786. And just to remind everyone, this is a target that is not an incretin-based target.\nOperator: Thank you, Umar. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobyn Karnauskas: All right. Thanks for taking my question. I do have a follow-up to Salveen's question actually. So Tezspire has gotten a lot of market share, there is so much room to grow in the TED space. Can you walk me through, like how Amgen can actually help grow that business because I'm confused by whether it's the hearing loss or reimbursement or what are really the levers that will actually grow that company -- grow that business -- Tepezza, sorry, Tepezza, that I think that there's a lot of room to grow. And given your strength, you could probably make that work. So, how do you intend to do that?\nRobert Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Robyn. So I think it's a two-part question there on Tepezza. We may tackle it in two parts with the combination of Vikram and Murdo. So go ahead, Vikram, why don't you start?\nVikram Karnani: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Like I said earlier, the -- I think one of the areas that has -- something that happened this year was the FDA update. Now when the label updates to patients that are treated regardless of disease activity or duration, many of these patients, in fact, I would say more of these patients are being treated by prescribers, such as endocrinologists and ophthalmologists. And that's what the team has been focused on working through, making sure that our educational program is available to these physicians, so that we can widen our prescriber base from the original set of prescribers that started treating patients at launch. So it's really important to understand that expanding the prescriber base is a critical driver for that success going forward. And as we've seen new prescribers have increased 50% year-over-year. As we continue to work through these new -- this low CAS or low clinical activity patients, we also have to remember that when they are prescribed the medicine, payers need to open up access to the medicine. So our market access team has been working pretty diligently to make sure that payers continue to update their medical policies. And what we have seen is more than 30% of U.S. covered lives are now eligible patients that can access Tepezza with more open or more favorable policies. This has to continue and both of these are areas that we will continue to work on as we go into early next year and beyond. And maybe I'll turn it over to Murdo to add his comments as well.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Vikram. Hi, Robyn. I would add, much the same way when we acquired ChemoCentryx and Tavneos, we realized that there was a low level of awareness of Tavneos. What we did there was we added reminder messaging to some of our broader rheumatology-covered sales forces to increase awareness of the data associated with Tavneos in ANCA-associated vasculitis patients. We've seen a corresponding increase in utilization, of course, driven by awareness of that product. So the core team is still promoting the attributes of the product and educating physicians, but there is a broader group of field personnel building general awareness of that product. What I think Vikram and I are talking about is the Amgen teams that cover endocrinologists were involved in the diagnosing and treatment of Thyroid Eye Disease, would be an ideal opportunity for us to broaden the awareness amongst that community of endocrinologists who are diagnosing and treating thyroid eye disease today to augment the great work that is happening with the rare disease teams under Vikram's leadership. So there's a number of things like that where we can scale and speed up the building of awareness, for example, of the new data that Vikram was just describing and the broadening of the label language. Vikram also mentioned the international expansion. The original plan was quite ambitious for Horizon. We've actually increased the number of markets that we intend to file and launch in, in a shorter period of time. So that would be an additional opportunity for growth given the strength of the two companies now combined.\nRobert Bradway: Might just add also, Robyn, that in terms of the time course of events here, I think now that we flip back on a year of ownership of ChemoCentryx, we can really start to see the benefit of what Murdo just described kicking in, over the last few weeks and months. So it takes a little bit of while, but I think our confidence is that over that period of time, we've been able to find ways that we can add distinctive value to that product and we're hoping a similar thing will happen with respect to the new rare disease molecules that we brought on board. So it's not like walk in, flip a light switch and suddenly things are performing on a different track, but rather you come in, work together, identify the ways in which we can be additive in the marketplace. And I'm hopeful that we'll see during the course of '24, the momentum build for the combined organization on these products.\nOperator: Thank you, Robyn. Our next question comes from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. And so my question is on oral obesity development. Regarding Phase 1 candidate 786, management has consistently emphasized that it also has a suite of oral preclinical product. And so should we take away that we should be viewing 786 as more of a wild card, rather than something that Amgen has conviction in at this point? And when do you expect to be able to start Phase 1 for another oral preclinical candidate? Might that happen in '24 or not until '25? And then separately, just I wanted to squeeze in a quick financial question. Do you expect Horizon product channel inventory work down in the fourth quarter to significantly constrain reported net Horizon sales in the fourth quarter? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yeah. Thanks, David. Dave Reese, I'll start and then turn things over to Murdo, and Vikram. In terms of oral obesity molecule 786, as I've said, it has a novel mechanism of action, it's a Phase 1 molecule. So you should view it as a Phase 1 molecule. And we're bringing in the data I said, and we'll take a look at that as we get into the new year and make a determination on potential path forward for that molecule. I wouldn't view it as anything more or less than a Phase 1 asset with a novel mechanism of action. In terms of additional molecules and when we might file INDs and launch our first in human trials, we'll give guidance as that portfolio advances over time. Again, many of those molecules are targets that we emanated from deCODE Genetics, our colleagues in Iceland. And I'll provide further information as we get ready to move towards the clinic. But this is playing a long game. If you step back, look, this field is in its infancy. We are just beginning to understand the complex metabolic arrangements that occur with obesity and there are clearly different forms of obesity. There's a lot of work to do. And as I've indicated, our intent here is to play the long game given that this is one of the major public health challenges of the 21st Century. So let me now hand it over to Vikram and Murdo for additional commentary on your second question.\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah, David. I just want to make sure that I heard your question right, it was about inventory and product wind-down. Look, I don't think we are going to comment on that specific aspect. I think the -- our team remains focused on driving demand and working with physicians to educate them and expanding the use of Tepezza for appropriate patients and that's where we're really focused too as a primary driver of net sales growth.\nOperator: Thank you, David. Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Raymond: Hey, thanks for taking the question. I just -- maybe a commercial question on your dermatology strategy and specifically on Otezla, just on the dynamic that you guys talked about with free competitor drug, presumably that's SOTYKTU scenario. And I think I heard you guys, you know, you've been calling this issue out for some time, but also with the investment that you're making in the dermatology sales force, I think I heard you say today that you're increasing that sales force sort of 20% or so. Is the implication that once the competitor free drug program runs its course, that Otezla volume should increase or what's your sense of what happens to volume? And maybe I'll ask it another way, if that volume increase doesn't materialize, do you need additional derm portfolio offerings to support that added effort? Thanks.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks for the question, Chris. This is Murdo. So let's just recapitulate what's happening in this market. At the beginning of the year, you had a number of new launches, not just SOTYKTU, with novel topicals coming into the market as well as a novel oral and every one of those products had very generous free drug programs and that had two effects on Otezla. There were topical patients who would have normally moved to their first systemic option who tried the new topical treatments on a free drug basis. And at the same time, there was a launch of a new oral that had a very generous free drug program. And so, Otezla, which sources the majority of its growth from topical patients for systemic, in other words, biologic naive patients. Otezla got squeezed in the first and second quarter on the basis of those new programs coming into the market. What we've seen since those two events in the market is that the novel topicals have flattened out in their growth and have pulled back to some extent on their free drug offering. The other oral therapy SOTYKTU continues to provide free drug, and so continues to have some effect on Otezla. What we think will happen and we're already seeing the very early signals of this is that we will continue to source our new growth from the topical patients, bio-naive patients. Given that Otezla is the ideal for a systemic agent, we have established ourselves with really strong access in the market. So we don't need to provide free drug programs to the extent that everybody else is. And then as the contracting cycle for 2024 matures and we see what the actual access is for some of the other competitors in the market, including the new oral, we should be able to give better guidance on our growth prospects for the future. But we almost certainly expect the impact of the free goods program to continue to reduce and that will help us grow Otezla. The investments we've made are really just kicking in this quarter. So the expansion in the field force, and your number was right, by 20%, the derm team was just deployed at the beginning of Q4. So they are only in-field as of a few weeks. So that impact is not in the historical performance of the brand. And our direct-to-consumer spend has been increased for the fourth quarter as well. So we will be able to tell you more as we go forward, but we feel given the very large number of patients here who continue to persist on topicals, when they really are better candidates for a systemic agent, will convert to Otezla as we build into that market. And just a reminder, we're the only product in the market that has a broad label regardless of severity of psoriasis. So we're optimistic and we're enthusiastic and that's why we've made these investments and we'll continue to look to add to our dermatology portfolio as we go forward.\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] Chris. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Hey. Thank you very much for taking my question and thank you for changing the time to make sure people can enjoy Halloween. So maybe one question on sequential growth. If I look at second quarter from third quarter, it seems like pretty much every product, even including Nplate accounts for the government budget, seems to be down. I know that you warned about this in the second quarter call regarding Medicare donut hole, but can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there and how should we be thinking about this going forward?\nRobert Bradway: Yeah, Mohit. I don't think every product is down. I think we had a number of products posting pretty significant double-digit growth in the quarter. And those are products that we continue to expect long-term growth from products like Repatha, EVENITY, Prolia, our hemo portfolio, BLINCYTO in particular. So, we're seeing some strength in our priority growth brands that we expect to continue to drive. What we did have in the quarter were a number of adjustments from prior period on net sales. So there was one particular adjustment on LUMAKRAS, which was based on a year-over-year change in the negotiations that we have on reimbursement. So in France, for example, we have an early temporary access program, and ATU program. Since 2021 LUMAKRAS has been available in France and we took a $22 million accrual in the quarter for those sales on the basis of price negotiations we are having in France. So we had a number of events like that related to price in the quarter. And as you mentioned, we are entering the donut hole for some of our products. So overall, I think unit volume growth is very strong. A few price effects on select products in the portfolio and a little bit of donut hole impact.\nOperator: Thank you, Mohit. Our next question comes from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead your line is open.\nGregory Renza: Great. Good morning, Bob and team and congrats on the progress, and thanks for taking my question. Bob, just circling back to the obesity market again, and as you and the team focused on really being first or -- and/or best in class across markets, I'm just curious how you and the team view and anticipate how different the obesity market can look and how you see the unmet need morphing by the time a program from Amgen is ready for prime time. But would there be a need to look not just internally but externally to accelerate those efforts, especially if things are evolving so quickly? Thanks again and congrats on the progress.\nRobert Bradway: Now, we're very excited about what we see so far emerging from our early work in obesity. I think over time you've got the sense of this from Dave Reese. This is likely to be a heterogeneous disease, they're probably going to be a number of different ways to have to go at it. But what encourages us right now is, what we think as an emerging differentiated profile for our approach versus the competition. And maybe, Murdo, you want to just jump in and remind Gregory about the basis of differentiation that we see so far in our data from the competition and why we think that gives us a good foothold for entering the markets.\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah. Thanks, Bob. I like the way the question was framed. It sometimes gets framed as, what are you going to do when the -- with these entrenched products in the market. And I'd just like [Technical Difficulty] people how young this market is and how much more is left to unfold. What we're seeing in the early days is, we're seeing a lot of patients trying these products, losing weight, but then not persisting with their treatment and regaining weight. So we think that there is an opportunity in the market long term for a product that can bring about very strong weight loss, both rapid and sustained over time with convenient dosing. And I think that that's where 133 or maridebart cafraglutide really has an opportunity to differentiate itself from what is available in the market today. We've seen the durability of that product between doses, and we think based on the Phase 2 in a number of different dosing cohorts we have being explored in that trial, we will be able to find the right balance of efficacy and the ability, based on convenient dosing to sustain that weight-loss over time. And, of course, the goal here is not just to lose weight, but to improve a number of sequelae or outcomes from people who carry extra weight over the course of their life, and that's what we're starting to see with others reading out in event trials. We will see more data as the medical congress has passed these next few months. But our hope is to bring about real improvement in outcomes with a highly efficacious and highly convenient product, like 133.\nOperator: Thank you, Gregory. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Murdo, it's been a long time coming for Repatha in submission. Are you guys finally hitting a commercial tipping point with payers, or do you think there is an increasing interest among cardiologists? I guess, I wasn't sure how, you know, the current market is and looking forward, how about the impact? How do you guys see it from a couple of the ongoing Phase 3s and 4s? Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks for the question, Geoff. Yes, it's been a bit of a journey. And the COVID pandemic didn't help us in our efforts to educate and convince cardiologists that they needed to do more to be more aggressive in treating their patients; LDL, cholesterol. I do think we've reached a tipping point in cardiology and I do think we've reached a tipping point with payers. We now have over 90% commercial lives covered. We anticipate being able to continue to progress our Medicare Part-D coverage, and we're seeing, you know, the PCSK9 category driven primarily by our 80% share of that category. Really, really starting to move now. Our new patient volume growth is good, not just in the US, but around the world. We are now seeing more and more primary care physicians using PCSK9s in combination with other drugs to more aggressively lower LDL in high-risk ASCVD patients. So the phases are pretty clear, payer coverage established, affordability for patients established, cardiologists are now prescribing with frequency and now moving into primary care. And we'll be adding direct-to-consumer campaign investment to that mix. So, yeah, I think we've reached a tipping point on Repatha Geoff and I'm bullish on what we can do to further expand that product, both from a volume and net sales perspective.\nOperator: Thank you, Geoff. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. Just a question on longer-term margins. So I guess post Horizon and I guess with the ramp of your pipeline, including some potentially very large obesity studies over time, I guess, just directionally, how should we be thinking about margins from here? I guess is this kind of 50% or slightly above 50% range a reasonable target for the company, or just any considerations we should keep in mind as we kind of balance, I guess, Horizon versus investment? Thank you\nRobert Bradway: Well, we're not going to give updated margin guidance on this call, Chris, but I think we've been pretty clear about what the trail should look like. We're focused on remaining a leading efficient player in our industry. We've been able to achieve leading operating margins over time. There is nothing that we see in the Horizon business specifically that would lead us to conclude differently from that. So we expect that at a full run rate, capitalizing on our in-place infrastructure internationally and manufacturing and process development that the margins in that business would be attractive in our hands. And the reference that Peter made to R&D spend earlier, obviously, to the extent that we get into a number of Phase 3 trials in the middle years here of the decade for Lp(a) and for obesity products, that may have an effect on overall margins, but we'll have plenty of time to talk about that in advance so that nobody is surprised if the margin starts moving around. So again, we've demonstrated a pretty consistent ability to manage the cost structure of the business and that's something that we're determined to maintain.\nOperator: Thank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for the color on the call today. So the growth in perspective is pretty impressive. Just wondering how the mentioned $1 billion run rate compares with your expectations going into the deal. And then taking a step back, we saw on a JAMA article about the use of type 2 diabetes and then for gout. How are you seeing that in the broader gout space? Is this something we should be concerned about when it comes to KRYSTEXXA? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Maybe we'll take this in two-parts. First, with respect to KRYSTEXXA, I'd say KRYSTEXXA is performing very well and we believed it would. Again, we think there is a tremendously large unmet medical need here and that KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate is serving the marketplace well. So we're looking forward to working with our colleagues on it. And overall, I'd say that the business is proceeding as we thought it would to this point. The things that we were -- that we thought were important to have in hand, like the chronic indication for Tepezza, like, international datasets that were made available with the OPTIC-J trial, like the progress we've made in Brazil, et cetera. Those were things that we wanted to have in hand and now do. And, again, UPLIZNA also performing very much in line as we expected it would. So we see three growth opportunities there and we see ways for the Amgen-based business to add value to what Vikram will be running now in our rare business area. And then, with respect to the question on diabetes, I\u2019ll ask Dave, [Multiple Speakers]\nDavid Reese: I mean, I think, the broader context here is important. These patients have severe uncontrolled gout. They are often facing amputations, for example, because of the severity of the disease. And so there are large number of these patients that are currently not being served in the market in clinical practice. And so our focus is on reaching those patients where the quality-of-life impediments are quite significant, and the effects of the drug can be quite dramatic in improving the disease course and improving that sort of quality of life. So that's the focus right now. I wouldn't get distracted by some of the other potential associations.\nRobert Bradway: Now, operator, I think we have two more calls in the log here. So why don't we take two more and then we'll thank our colleagues and let them get on with the day.\nOperator: Certainly. Thank you, Evan. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. On AMG 133, maybe this is a silly question, but is it at all possible that you can start Phase 3 in 2024? The main way to do this would be to do an early or interim look of sorts at the Phase 2 trial before the primary completion date. And I know you're guiding for top-line on that in late '24. Thank you.\nDavid Reese: Yeah. I mean, as we go through '24, we will give guidance on when we expect, you know, the Phase 3 program to launch. You know, as is customary in these programs, we will take an interim look. That will remain blinded, we will not release that externally, because this is a 52-week study, but that will help at least guide our thinking. Also recall that the FDA requires a certain safety database before you launch Phase 3 trials here. And so as we get into next year and start to have those conversations, we will be able to give more definitive guidance as to when you can expect the launch of the Phase 3 program and what that suite of studies might look like.\nRobert Bradway: And let's take our last question.\nOperator: Thank you, Tim. Our last question will come from Colin Bristow from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nColin Bristow: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a quick follow-up on 133. Just as we think about this from a commercial perspective, this is obviously an antibody backbone. It's going to be an injectable. Just in light of margin that's achievable with this, just help us think through that. Thanks.\nVikram Karnani: Well, Colin, you rightly point out that this is an antibody backbone. The properties of that, obviously, as I was alluding to earlier, could be that you can dose it much less frequently than you have to with the current therapies on the market. We also think, given the potential differentiation on efficacy and possibly tolerability, that we will be able to establish a very strong position in the market for people who need rapid, deep, and sustained weight-loss that they can manage over time, so that they can gain the benefits, the reduction in cardiovascular risk, the improvement in outcomes from that treatment. But we expect, as Dave said, to develop this product across a suite of Phase 3 experiments, and we expect to be able to take a decent share of the market, which will drive a good return on our investment in that product.\nOperator: Thank you, Colin. I would now like to turn the call back over to Bob Bradway for closing remarks.\nRobert Bradway: Okay. Well, let me thank all of you for joining us this morning. And we hope that the choice of doing this in the morning frees you up to go enjoy the afternoon and evening of trick-or-treating wherever you are. But we again, appreciate your support. It's been an eventful few months at Amgen. And we'll look forward to having an opportunity to regather with you and report on the fourth quarter when we get to the new year. Many thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our 2023 Q3 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Bradway",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Justin and thank all of you for joining our call. It's an exciting time here at Amgen. And we're continuing to execute well this year, serving many more patients around the world with medicines such as Repatha, EVENITY and Tezspire, advancing a number of promising first-in-class medicines rapidly through our pipeline and preparing for our next wave of biosimilar launches. However, as this is our first earnings call following the close of our acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, I thought we might turn our attention there first. The Horizon acquisition, coupled with our purchase of ChemoCentryx, which we acquired a little more than a year ago, gives Amgen a significant rare disease business that fits squarely within our overall strategy and will be additive to the growth we expect from our base business. At the heart of our strategy of course is innovation. First, our best-in-class medicines that make a big difference for patients suffering from serious diseases. The medicines in our rare disease portfolio like Tavneos, Tepezza, KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA fit this description perfectly and they'll benefit from Amgen's decades of experience in inflammatory diseases. These medicines are also early enough in their lifecycles that we can positively impact their growth by leveraging Amgen's capabilities in process development, lifecycle management and manufacturing. Finally, we spent the past decade or so building out our international footprint with Amgen medicines now available in about 100 countries. And today our rare disease sales come almost exclusively from the U.S. So, we'll be able to leverage our global presence to quickly bring these medicines to patients around the world. You'll hear more in a minute from Vikram Karnani, who joined us through the Horizon acquisition and is leading a newly created rare disease business that is now the fourth leg of Amgen's commercial stool, alongside our inflammation, oncology and general medicine businesses. Turning to our financial performance in the quarter. Total revenues were up 4% and earnings per share were up 6% compared with a year ago. Volume increased 11% globally, which represents our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth. And we achieved good balance across all of our geographic regions and therapeutic areas. Seven of our medicines generated record sales in the quarter. And I'll highlight one of these, BLINCYTO, which delivered 55% sales growth in the third quarter. We see continued upside potential for BLINCYTO as it is increasingly used in earlier lines of therapy and as practice guidelines are updated to reflect the role this medicine can play in treating a broad range of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Turning to our pipeline. We had the opportunity to discuss six potential first-in-class oncology assets with you recently following ESMO. Three of these have earned Breakthrough Therapy designations from the FDA; tarlatamab, BLINCYTO and LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in colorectal cancer. We also continue to progress trials for bemarituzumab in gastric cancer, for Xaluritamig in prostate cancer and for AMG 193, our PRMT5 inhibitor, which has generated responses across six solid tumors. I'll just quickly note that AMG 193 was identified through our proprietary DNA encoded library technology which we added through the 2019 acquisition of Nuevolution, and it demonstrates our leadership in the emerging field of multi-specific drugs that can address pathways that have long been recognized but considered inaccessible to traditional drug discovery efforts. In other pipeline news, we've completed enrollment in our Phase 2 obesity study for maridebart cafraglutide, which was formerly known as AMG 133. And finally, the FDA has accepted our BLA for our biosimilar to EYLEA. Looking at our business, we feel we have good momentum across the board. We have everything we need with the portfolio, the pipeline and the people to deliver attractive sales and earnings growth through the end of the decade and beyond. As always, I want to thank Amgen employees around the world, including some 2,000 new colleagues focused on rare diseases for their commitment to strong execution on behalf of the patients we serve. With that, I'll now turn it over to Murdo Gordon. Murdo? Revenues. Yeah. Maybe we'll take this in two parts, Salveen, it's Bob. Obviously, we're not going to provide '24 guidance here this morning. But we'll see whether we can give you a clear sense of the things that are exciting us when we look at those products for -- heading into next year. And just generally on the question of long-term guidance, as you've heard us say on a number of occasions, we remain confident that we're on track to meet or beat the objectives that we established for 2030, in some ways now frankly, we're more focused on what we can deliver through 2031 and soon to be 2032 as well. So we reviewed -- in-depth review of the oncology portfolio a couple of weeks ago and gave you a good sense for the moving pieces through the end of the decade. And we may seek to present a picture of the business in that way now heading into next year, so that you can get a more comprehensive deep-dive into the different segments of the business that are driving growth. But let's turn to first question, which is the outlook for Horizon and the initiatives that are underway, in particular, with respect to Tepezza, and KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA. So Vikram, why don't you fire away? Sure. I'll ask Dave Reese to address that, Jay. Okay. Thank you, Robyn. So I think it's a two-part question there on Tepezza. We may tackle it in two parts with the combination of Vikram and Murdo. So go ahead, Vikram, why don't you start? Might just add also, Robyn, that in terms of the time course of events here, I think now that we flip back on a year of ownership of ChemoCentryx, we can really start to see the benefit of what Murdo just described kicking in, over the last few weeks and months. So it takes a little bit of while, but I think our confidence is that over that period of time, we've been able to find ways that we can add distinctive value to that product and we're hoping a similar thing will happen with respect to the new rare disease molecules that we brought on board. So it's not like walk in, flip a light switch and suddenly things are performing on a different track, but rather you come in, work together, identify the ways in which we can be additive in the marketplace. And I'm hopeful that we'll see during the course of '24, the momentum build for the combined organization on these products. Yeah, Mohit. I don't think every product is down. I think we had a number of products posting pretty significant double-digit growth in the quarter. And those are products that we continue to expect long-term growth from products like Repatha, EVENITY, Prolia, our hemo portfolio, BLINCYTO in particular. So, we're seeing some strength in our priority growth brands that we expect to continue to drive. What we did have in the quarter were a number of adjustments from prior period on net sales. So there was one particular adjustment on LUMAKRAS, which was based on a year-over-year change in the negotiations that we have on reimbursement. So in France, for example, we have an early temporary access program, and ATU program. Since 2021 LUMAKRAS has been available in France and we took a $22 million accrual in the quarter for those sales on the basis of price negotiations we are having in France. So we had a number of events like that related to price in the quarter. And as you mentioned, we are entering the donut hole for some of our products. So overall, I think unit volume growth is very strong. A few price effects on select products in the portfolio and a little bit of donut hole impact. Now, we're very excited about what we see so far emerging from our early work in obesity. I think over time you've got the sense of this from Dave Reese. This is likely to be a heterogeneous disease, they're probably going to be a number of different ways to have to go at it. But what encourages us right now is, what we think as an emerging differentiated profile for our approach versus the competition. And maybe, Murdo, you want to just jump in and remind Gregory about the basis of differentiation that we see so far in our data from the competition and why we think that gives us a good foothold for entering the markets. Well, we're not going to give updated margin guidance on this call, Chris, but I think we've been pretty clear about what the trail should look like. We're focused on remaining a leading efficient player in our industry. We've been able to achieve leading operating margins over time. There is nothing that we see in the Horizon business specifically that would lead us to conclude differently from that. So we expect that at a full run rate, capitalizing on our in-place infrastructure internationally and manufacturing and process development that the margins in that business would be attractive in our hands.

So again, we've demonstrated a pretty consistent ability to manage the cost structure of the business and that's something that we're determined to maintain. Maybe we'll take this in two-parts. First, with respect to KRYSTEXXA, I'd say KRYSTEXXA is performing very well and we believed it would. Again, we think there is a tremendously large unmet medical need here and that KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate is serving the marketplace well. So we're looking forward to working with our colleagues on it. And overall, I'd say that the business is proceeding as we thought it would to this point. The things that we were -- that we thought were important to have in hand, like the chronic indication for Tepezza, like, international datasets that were made available with the OPTIC-J trial, like the progress we've made in Brazil, et cetera. Those were things that we wanted to have in hand and now do. And, again, UPLIZNA also performing very much in line as we expected it would. So we see three growth opportunities there and we see ways for the Amgen-based business to add value to what Vikram will be running now in our rare business area. And then, with respect to the question on diabetes, I'll ask Dave, [Multiple Speakers] Now, operator, I think we have two more calls in the log here. So why don't we take two more and then we'll thank our colleagues and let them get on with the day. And let's take our last question. Okay. Well, let me thank all of you for joining us this morning. And we hope that the choice of doing this in the morning frees you up to go enjoy the afternoon and evening of trick-or-treating wherever you are. But we again, appreciate your support.

            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. I'll review our third quarter results before discussing our updated 2023 guidance. Turning to our third quarter financial results, which are shown on Slide 44, total revenues of $6.9 billion grew 4% year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.96 grew 6% year-over-year. The growth in revenues was due to product sales increasing 5% year-over-year, driven by a 11% volume growth. Third quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% year-over-year. We advanced our pipeline and invested in growth opportunities in the quarter, while delivering a non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales of 52%. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 1.3 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 17.4%, primarily driven by higher profit shares and changes in product mix. Non-GAAP R&D expenses in the quarter decreased 2% year-over-year due to lower spend in research and early pipeline activities, partially offset by higher spend in later-stage clinical programs and marketed products. Year-to-date, non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 5% due to higher spend in later-stage clinical programs and marketed products, partially offset by lower spend in research and early pipeline. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the third quarter increased 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments, digitalization, driving productivity and accelerating use cases for artificial intelligence. Non-GAAP OI&E were a net $225 million expense in the third quarter. The year-over-year favorability was driven primarily by higher interest income and the change in Beijing accounting from equity method to a mark-to-market investments, with the impact included only in our GAAP results. Our third quarter non-GAAP tax rate increased 3.2 percentage points to 16.1%, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change that replaced the excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue to prioritize investments in both internal and external innovation. In the third quarter, we increased investments in programs, including maridebart cafraglutide, I'll call it mari from now on, Rocatinlimab, Tavneos and ABP 206, our biosimilar to OPDIVO. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth, including through simultaneous construction of our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. We're excited for the anticipated licensure of our Ohio facility in the first half of 2024. Additionally, we're making investments in all parts of our business to leverage the power of Generative AI opportunities. Third, we have a strong track record of returning capital to our shareholders and pay dividends of $2.13 per share in the third quarter, representing a 10% increase over the third quarter in 2022. The company generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the third quarter of 2023 compared with $2.8 billion in the third quarter of 2022. We will continue to generate strong cash flows. However, Q4 cash flow will be lower than historical patterns due to the timing of tax payments and Horizon transaction-related expenses. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2023 on Slide 46. We're pleased to have closed the acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. We're updating our full-year 2023 guidance to include Horizon financial results starting October 6, 2023. So our Q4 results will exclude approximately one week of Horizon's results. We are raising our 2023 revenue guidance to$28.0 billion to $28.4 billion versus previous guidance of $26.6 billion to $27.4 billion. For 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share, we are narrowing the range to $18.20 to $18.80 versus previous guidance of $17.80 to $18.80. We will add Horizon's business into Q4 without material non-GAAP EPS dilution. However, we do expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be lower than Q3 non-GAAP EPS because of planned investment increases in our business, including key assets in our innovative pipeline, beginning with mari, Olpasiran and AMG 193, and other strategic business investments, including Generative AI use cases in all parts of our business. This sequential pattern is consistent with historical trends. And in addition, Q4 non-GAAP EPS will begin to include the recognition of interest expense related to the Horizon financing as a non-GAAP expense, important additional points to consider as you model the remainder of 2023. We now expect other revenue for 2023 to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion versus our prior range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. With the Horizon acquisition, we now anticipate full year non-GAAP operating expense for 2023 to increase from our previous estimate of 3% (ph) to approximately 10% versus last year. Horizon represents approximately 5 percentage points of this 10% year-over-year increase. We continue to expect the full year 2023 operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost of sales as a percentage of product sales to be between 16% and 17%. We now expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses to increase from our prior guidance of 5% to about 10% year-over-year. Horizon represents approximately 3 percentage points of this 10% year-over-year increase. The additional 2 percentage points are driven by planned increase in our investments in our innovative pipeline, including mari, Olpasiran, and AMG 193. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A to be down year-over-year as a percentage of product sales slightly. We now expect non-GAAP OI&E expenses to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, up from our prior guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect Q4 OI&E to be about $700 million, reflecting interest expense related to the Horizon financing, which will be included in our non-GAAP results effective October 6. And as you begin to model 2024, note that we expect 2024 OI&E to be consistent with this Q4 run rate. This higher interest expense is driven by the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition at a weighted average interest rate of 5.6%. We expect to end 2023 with approximately $65 billion of long-term debt, including the current portion of it, and $11 billion of cash and cash equivalents. For the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.5% to 17%, down from prior guidance of 17.5% to 18.5%. We expect approximately 540 million shares to be outstanding in Q4. This increase from Q3 is driven by the conversion of unvested Horizon equity awards and the Amgen equity awards. Our 2023 capital expenditures are now projected to be approximately $950 million, up from our prior guidance of $925 million. The addition of Horizon's rare disease team further strengthens our confidence in delivering against our long-term growth objectives. We continue to allocate capital to advance innovation at speed and at scale. And I'm incredibly grateful to our now 26,000-plus colleagues for successfully executing our mission of serving patients. This concludes the financial update. And now, I will ask our operator, Julianne, please open the lines for Q&A and remind our participants of the procedure to ask their questions. Julianne? Right. Thank you, Yaron. The 700 is everything, so that's the full run rate. And on the question on R&D, as I said in my remarks, we've focused our spending on the later clinical and in-market portfolio that was slightly offset by some decreases in early research. But we continue to spend and invest in the business and we'll continue to do that. As you can see, we're fortunate to have a significant number of opportunities in Phase 3 in the later stages. So that's what we'll stay focused on, will continue to differentially invest in the opportunities in innovation and we're very excited about that. Yeah. So -- excuse me. On the tax rate, let me start with that '24 tax rate. We'll guide on that as we always do at the beginning of the year. I would just say, I think you're thinking about the global minimum tax and Pillar 2, and I would just note, there is no consensus or predictability about how that whole OECD framework is going to be implemented. I know different countries are doing different situations. Rest assured, we look at everything, optimize our position as appropriate on something like that. So we'll give you guidance on that next year at the beginning of the year. First part of the question? Yeah. On revenue, look, we don't really break that down. I would just suggest that we continue to see strength in the business and we continue to see our in-line portfolio perform very, very well. I would just note, we had seven products with record sales in the quarter, we had Repatha up 31%, up in the quarter year-over-year. And we've continue to see the hematology-oncology portfolio was up 16%. So everything's, strong in our base business. We're excited about that base business, that continues to perform really well and we're very excited to have the rare disease business now. And looking forward to having that as, as we said, it's kind of the four stool of our commercial thrust forward. So we're seeing good strength around the business in different areas and we'll just continue to get more and more medicines to patients. I'd note, the 11% volume growth is really important. Underneath that 12% volume growth outside the United States. And underneath that 27% volume growth in JPAC, our fastest-growing region. So that's how we're looking at that. We're pleased with the momentum and we're pleased to be able to raise the 28.0 to 28.4."

            "content": "Thanks, Murdo. We're excited to bring together Horizon's medicines, pipeline and rare disease expertise with Amgen's history of leadership in inflammatory diseases, global infrastructure and world-class biologic capabilities. For those that are not as familiar with Horizon's portfolio, I will spend the next few minutes providing some background on our rare disease medicines. Horizon's business delivered $945 million of sales in the third quarter, representing 2% year-over-year sales growth with multiple positive leading indicators. Let me describe in more detail. Tepezza, the first and only medicine approved for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, regardless of disease activity or duration, generated $453 million of sales in the third quarter, representing 2% quarter-over-quarter growth. We are confident that now as we have officially joined forces and have on-boarded the full commercial team, we will make significant progress in advancing this important product over time to patients. We are driving several initiatives to continue to build the U.S. thyroid eye disease market. In the third quarter, we saw a greater than 50% year-over-year increase in the number of Tepezza prescribers, supported by the April 2023 FDA label update to treat patients with thyroid eye disease, regardless of disease activity or duration. We are pleased with this progress and are continuing to educate the physician community on new clinical data and updated indication across the full spectrum of TED patients. Second, large national and regional payers are continuing to make favorable policy changes to help eligible patients access Tepezza. To date, we have obtained favorable policy changes for greater than 30% of U.S.-covered lives, which are expected to take effect later this year and early next year. As a reminder, for Tepezza, there is a time lag between a patient being identified for Tepezza treatment and treatment being initiated. It can take up to 90 days for a patient enrollment form to move through the prior authorization process. Once that step is complete, then the patient's infusion needs to be scheduled at an appropriate site of care. This process takes time and we have taken several important steps to minimize the time between patient identification and treatment initiation. Finally, we continue to see approximately 100,000 patients with moderate-to-severe disease in the U.S. that are appropriate for Tepezza, with the majority of these patients in low Clinical Activity Score settings. Therefore, the patients -- the FDA's label update, combined with favorable medical policy changes by payers and supported by the expanding base of prescribing physicians, gives us a significant opportunity to reach more patients. These positive execution trends underpin our confidence in Tepezza's growth potential in the U.S. Moving on to markets outside the U.S. We continue to see international expansion as a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for Tepezza which received its first ex-U.S. approval in Brazil in the second quarter of this year. We are particularly excited about the opportunity to leverage Amgen's long-standing presence in multiple major ex-U.S. markets, including Europe and in Japan, where we have reported positive data from the Phase 3 OPTIC-J trial. We also continue to enroll a Tepezza Phase 3 trial in Japanese patients with chronic or low clinical activity thyroid eye disease. KRYSTEXXA, the first and only medicine approved for uncontrolled gout, delivered a record $253 million of sales in the third quarter, representing 32% year-over-year growth. Sales are now annualizing at a $1 billion run rate. Performance in the third quarter reflected continued strong uptake in both the rheumatology and nephrology segments. Strong results were driven by execution across all phases of the patient journey, demand-generation, stakeholder education and adherence to treatment. The FDA approved KRYSTEXXA's label change for combination with methotrexate in July 2022. We have seen a steady increase in uptake since then. Immunomodulation usage remained above 70% of new patient starts in the third quarter. We see an opportunity to redefine KRYSTEXXA with methotrexate as a standard of care and reach even more of the over 100,000 uncontrolled gout patients in the U.S. UPLIZNA sales increased 54% year-over-year in the third quarter to $67 million. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex-U.S. markets, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Brazil. Additional indications in development also support UPLIZNA's long-term growth potential with Phase 3 trials underway in both IgG4-related disease, and myasthenia gravis. The rest of Horizon's portfolio generated $173 million of sales in the third quarter, primarily driven by our portfolio of ultra-rare medicines; RAVICTI, PROCYSBI and ACTIMMUNE. We see an opportunity for this basket of products to continue to generate robust sales. Before I turn it over to Dave Reese, I want to take the opportunity to thank all my colleagues in the rare disease business for maintaining their focus on patients throughout a period of distraction over the last several months. Looking ahead, we are excited to work together by leveraging Amgen and Horizon's combined capabilities to ensure our medicines reach more patients even faster who are suffering from serious and rare diseases globally. I'll now turn it over to Dave. Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we have a lot of positive leading indicators as we look at the business. I'll start with Tepezza. We're continuing to build that U.S. TED market following the FDA's April 2023 label updates. And that really helps us get the medicine to TED patients regardless of disease activity or duration. And what we've seen following that label update is that the payers are continuing to update their medical policies and make them more favorable so that more of these patients, more in the low CAS setting or the low Clinical Activity Score setting can now access Tepezza. And I think, finally, from an execution standpoint, we see newer prescribers from both ophthalmologists, as well as endocrinologists increasing 50% year-over-year in this third quarter. So all of these indicators for Tepezza are positive and we feel good about the execution of the team. And as I said, we have now combined forces with Amgen and together we should be able to drive business in a positive way moving forward. Think -- talking about -- the story around Tepezza also is one of international growth. While we see a lot of positive trends in the U.S., we're pretty excited about what we can do as a combined company for patients outside the U.S. as well. We've talked about Brazil getting approval recently. We've got [indiscernible] OPTIC-J as our trial in Japan. We've talked about the chronic trial that's enrolling. And finally, we're getting ready for other markets and we hope to bring the medicines to many more markets now as part of the combined company than we were talking about previously. So Tepezza, both signs very positive in the US as well as globally. And as we've talked about the results for KRYSTEXXA and UPLIZNA, both those medicines performed really, really well. We have immunomodulation with KRYSTEXXA being a major driver since the label update last year. That has continued to drive uptake since that time. We see that continuing into the future. And with UPLIZNA, it is the fastest-growing biologics in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or NMOSD, and we see that momentum continue both in the U.S. as well as outside the U.S. So I think when I look at the overall portfolio we have, we're operating from a position of strength and now we can expand that even further with the combination with Amgen. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Like I said earlier, the -- I think one of the areas that has -- something that happened this year was the FDA update. Now when the label updates to patients that are treated regardless of disease activity or duration, many of these patients, in fact, I would say more of these patients are being treated by prescribers, such as endocrinologists and ophthalmologists. And that's what the team has been focused on working through, making sure that our educational program is available to these physicians, so that we can widen our prescriber base from the original set of prescribers that started treating patients at launch. So it's really important to understand that expanding the prescriber base is a critical driver for that success going forward. And as we've seen new prescribers have increased 50% year-over-year. As we continue to work through these new -- this low CAS or low clinical activity patients, we also have to remember that when they are prescribed the medicine, payers need to open up access to the medicine. So our market access team has been working pretty diligently to make sure that payers continue to update their medical policies. And what we have seen is more than 30% of U.S. covered lives are now eligible patients that can access Tepezza with more open or more favorable policies. This has to continue and both of these are areas that we will continue to work on as we go into early next year and beyond. And maybe I'll turn it over to Murdo to add his comments as well. Well, Colin, you rightly point out that this is an antibody backbone. The properties of that, obviously, as I was alluding to earlier, could be that you can dose it much less frequently than you have to with the current therapies on the market. We also think, given the potential differentiation on efficacy and possibly tolerability, that we will be able to establish a very strong position in the market for people who need rapid, deep, and sustained weight-loss that they can manage over time, so that they can gain the benefits, the reduction in cardiovascular risk, the improvement in outcomes from that treatment. But we expect, as Dave said, to develop this product across a suite of Phase 3 experiments, and we expect to be able to take a decent share of the market, which will drive a good return on our investment in that product."

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. I'm pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Execution is strong across the business with record quarterly sales for seven brands and robust volume growth across our general medicine, inflammation and hematology/oncology portfolios. Product sales increased 5% year-over-year. Volume growth was 11% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 11% and volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle-East and Canada region was 8%. Consistent with our international expansion strategy, Asia-Pacific continues to be our fastest growing region with 27% volume growth in the quarter. Starting with our general medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, Evenity and Aimovig. Overall revenue for these four products grew 21% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by 20% volume growth. Repatha sales increased 31% year-over-year in the third quarter, with volume growth of 44%, partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., volume growth of 45% was driven by a record number of new patients starting treatment, more than doubling year-over-year. We saw declining net selling prices in the US, primarily driven by new formulary coverage by CVS in July for commercial patients. Outside the U.S., we saw a 43% volume growth with strength across our regions. There are still many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha and we're rising to meet that challenge by investing and executing to drive awareness amongst physicians and patients. In the U.S., we have significantly expanded our primary care sales force and activated more than 15,000 new prescribers this year. We're also increasing promotion to patients through direct-to-consumer media efforts. Transitioning to bone health, Prolia sales grew 14% year-over-year in the third quarter, primarily driven by 7% volume growth and higher net selling price. We expect volumes for Prolia to grow supported by real-world evidence data presented earlier this year that demonstrate Prolia's superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with post-menopausal osteoporosis. EVENITY had record sales of $307 million for the quarter, driven by 48% volume growth. Osteoporosis disproportionately impacts postmenopausal women, and the diagnosis and treatment rates for these patients are low. In 2023, we expect approximately 3 million patients in the U.S. will be treated for post-menopausal osteoporosis, an estimated 40% of treated patients will be at very high risk of fracture. But only 6% of those high risk patients will be treated with a bone-building product. EVENITY plays an important role in the bone builder market with a 58% share in the U.S. and a 44% share in Japan. There's much more work to be done and we'll continue to invest to ensure EVENITY reaches the patients who need it. Otezla sales declined 10% year-over-year, driven by lower net selling price, unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, and lower inventory levels, partially offset by 1% volume growth in the U.S. Otezla net price declines were driven by higher rebates to support and expand access for commercial and Medicare Part-D patients. Our U.S. Otezla business has been impacted by free drug programs associated with new treatment options that have entered the psoriasis marketplace. We're beginning to see a reduced impact of these free drug programs as physicians and patients are experiencing barriers to access, given prior authorization requirements for these newer therapies. We have strong conviction in the growth potential of Otezla, with its unique indication for all severities of psoriasis, combined with an established clinical profile, broad payer coverage, a lack of testing required for initiation and convenient oral administration. To realize that potential, we have increased our investment to ensure physician and patients understand both the importance of treating psoriasis systemically and the safety and efficacy profile that Otezla offers. We are already seeing positive results from that increased investment, including significant growth in the number of patients requesting educational information and taking action on the Otezla website that generally indicate preparation for a discussion with the healthcare professional. And also recently increased our dermatology sales force by 20% to educate physicians about the benefits of Otezla for appropriate patients. With these increased investments, we expect to drive a return to growth for Otezla. Enbrel sales decreased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by an 8% decline from unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. Year-over-year volume increased 1% in the third quarter and the number of new patients in the U.S. starting treatment increased by 22% driven by improved payer coverage and Enbrel's 20-plus year track record of safety and efficacy. For the remainder of 2023, we expect our improved coverage will lead to continued growth in new patients and declining net selling price. Tezspire continues to show strong growth with $161 million in sales in the third quarter. Sales increased 21% sequentially, driven by 18% volume growth that benefited from the launch of our self-administered pre-filled single-use pen, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first quarter. We've now obtained coverage of the patent with the majority of pharmacy benefit managers, enabling easy access and convenient self-administration for patients in the U.S. with severe uncontrolled asthma. As we expected, Tezspire has both penetrated and helped grow the U.S. asthma biologics market. In 2023, the number of new patients on asthma biologics has increased by over 20% year-over-year and Tezspire's share of this expanded market is approximately 20%. Sales of Tavneos were $37 million in the quarter with 26% quarter-over-quarter volume growth. In the U.S., approximately 2,300 patients have now been treated with Tavneos by over 1,500 healthcare professionals. We continue to see an increase in awareness of Tavneos by rheumatologists and nephrologists. And exiting the quarter, we saw an increase in new patient start forms. Looking forward, we expect to bring Tavneos to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Amjevita sales increased 30% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by 53% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. Ex-U.S. sales increased 10%, driven by 22% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. Moving to our hematology-oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO . Strong commercial execution and compelling new clinical data drove 15% volume growth year-over-year for these six innovative products. BLINCYTO sales grew 55% year-over-year to a record $220 million for the third quarter. Volume growth of 56% was supported by broad prescribing to acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients following positive data from the registration-enabling E1910 study presented late 2022, and updated NCCN guidelines that were issued in May. Long-term, we see significant additional growth potential for BLINCYTO from earlier lines of therapy. LUMAKRAS reported $52 million in sales for the third quarter, a decline of 31% year-over-year. $22 million of this decline was driven by ongoing reimbursement negotiations in France. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS, driven by launches in new markets and our comprehensive global clinical development program. Vectibix sales increased 2% year-over-year for the third quarter to a record $252 million, driven by higher net selling price and 4% volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact. KYPROLIS grew 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by 8% volume growth. And Nplate sales increased 45% year-over-year for the third quarter, resulting from a $142 million order from the U.S. government. In the fourth quarter, we expect to fulfill an additional $62 million order for Nplate by the U.S. government. Given the strong performance of our hematology-oncology products and the exciting new positive data presented at ESMO on our oncology pipeline, we look forward to helping more patients with their cancer therapy. Overall, our execution is strong across the business, driving growth and demonstrating our dedication to serving patients. And with the expansion of our rare disease portfolio, we're excited to serve many more patients around the world who can benefit from our therapies. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram. Yes. Thanks, Vikram. Hi, Robyn. I would add, much the same way when we acquired ChemoCentryx and Tavneos, we realized that there was a low level of awareness of Tavneos. What we did there was we added reminder messaging to some of our broader rheumatology-covered sales forces to increase awareness of the data associated with Tavneos in ANCA-associated vasculitis patients. We've seen a corresponding increase in utilization, of course, driven by awareness of that product. So the core team is still promoting the attributes of the product and educating physicians, but there is a broader group of field personnel building general awareness of that product. What I think Vikram and I are talking about is the Amgen teams that cover endocrinologists were involved in the diagnosing and treatment of Thyroid Eye Disease, would be an ideal opportunity for us to broaden the awareness amongst that community of endocrinologists who are diagnosing and treating thyroid eye disease today to augment the great work that is happening with the rare disease teams under Vikram's leadership. So there's a number of things like that where we can scale and speed up the building of awareness, for example, of the new data that Vikram was just describing and the broadening of the label language. Vikram also mentioned the international expansion. The original plan was quite ambitious for Horizon. We've actually increased the number of markets that we intend to file and launch in, in a shorter period of time. So that would be an additional opportunity for growth given the strength of the two companies now combined. Yeah, David. I just want to make sure that I heard your question right, it was about inventory and product wind-down. Look, I don't think we are going to comment on that specific aspect. I think the -- our team remains focused on driving demand and working with physicians to educate them and expanding the use of Tepezza for appropriate patients and that's where we're really focused too as a primary driver of net sales growth. Thanks for the question, Chris. This is Murdo. So let's just recapitulate what's happening in this market. At the beginning of the year, you had a number of new launches, not just SOTYKTU, with novel topicals coming into the market as well as a novel oral and every one of those products had very generous free drug programs and that had two effects on Otezla. There were topical patients who would have normally moved to their first systemic option who tried the new topical treatments on a free drug basis. And at the same time, there was a launch of a new oral that had a very generous free drug program. And so, Otezla, which sources the majority of its growth from topical patients for systemic, in other words, biologic naive patients. Otezla got squeezed in the first and second quarter on the basis of those new programs coming into the market. What we've seen since those two events in the market is that the novel topicals have flattened out in their growth and have pulled back to some extent on their free drug offering. The other oral therapy SOTYKTU continues to provide free drug, and so continues to have some effect on Otezla. What we think will happen and we're already seeing the very early signals of this is that we will continue to source our new growth from the topical patients, bio-naive patients. Given that Otezla is the ideal for a systemic agent, we have established ourselves with really strong access in the market. So we don't need to provide free drug programs to the extent that everybody else is. And then as the contracting cycle for 2024 matures and we see what the actual access is for some of the other competitors in the market, including the new oral, we should be able to give better guidance on our growth prospects for the future. But we almost certainly expect the impact of the free goods program to continue to reduce and that will help us grow Otezla. The investments we've made are really just kicking in this quarter. So the expansion in the field force, and your number was right, by 20%, the derm team was just deployed at the beginning of Q4. So they are only in-field as of a few weeks. So that impact is not in the historical performance of the brand. And our direct-to-consumer spend has been increased for the fourth quarter as well. So we will be able to tell you more as we go forward, but we feel given the very large number of patients here who continue to persist on topicals, when they really are better candidates for a systemic agent, will convert to Otezla as we build into that market. And just a reminder, we're the only product in the market that has a broad label regardless of severity of psoriasis. So we're optimistic and we're enthusiastic and that's why we've made these investments and we'll continue to look to add to our dermatology portfolio as we go forward. Yeah. Thanks, Bob. I like the way the question was framed. It sometimes gets framed as, what are you going to do when the -- with these entrenched products in the market. And I'd just like [Technical Difficulty] people how young this market is and how much more is left to unfold. What we're seeing in the early days is, we're seeing a lot of patients trying these products, losing weight, but then not persisting with their treatment and regaining weight. So we think that there is an opportunity in the market long term for a product that can bring about very strong weight loss, both rapid and sustained over time with convenient dosing. And I think that that's where 133 or maridebart cafraglutide really has an opportunity to differentiate itself from what is available in the market today. We've seen the durability of that product between doses, and we think based on the Phase 2 in a number of different dosing cohorts we have being explored in that trial, we will be able to find the right balance of efficacy and the ability, based on convenient dosing to sustain that weight-loss over time. And, of course, the goal here is not just to lose weight, but to improve a number of sequelae or outcomes from people who carry extra weight over the course of their life, and that's what we're starting to see with others reading out in event trials. We will see more data as the medical congress has passed these next few months. But our hope is to bring about real improvement in outcomes with a highly efficacious and highly convenient product, like 133. Thanks for the question, Geoff. Yes, it's been a bit of a journey. And the COVID pandemic didn't help us in our efforts to educate and convince cardiologists that they needed to do more to be more aggressive in treating their patients; LDL, cholesterol. I do think we've reached a tipping point in cardiology and I do think we've reached a tipping point with payers. We now have over 90% commercial lives covered. We anticipate being able to continue to progress our Medicare Part-D coverage, and we're seeing, you know, the PCSK9 category driven primarily by our 80% share of that category. Really, really starting to move now. Our new patient volume growth is good, not just in the US, but around the world. We are now seeing more and more primary care physicians using PCSK9s in combination with other drugs to more aggressively lower LDL in high-risk ASCVD patients. So the phases are pretty clear, payer coverage established, affordability for patients established, cardiologists are now prescribing with frequency and now moving into primary care. And we'll be adding direct-to-consumer campaign investment to that mix. So, yeah, I think we've reached a tipping point on Repatha Geoff and I'm bullish on what we can do to further expand that product, both from a volume and net sales perspective."

            "name": "David Reese",
            "content": "Thank you, Vikram. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by welcoming our new colleagues from Horizon. We are excited to be integrating Horizon's R&D capabilities with Amgen's to advance the promising Horizon pipeline. For R&D, the third quarter was one of high quality execution as we progressed our innovative pipeline with important oncology data readouts, the addition of two breakthrough therapy designations and completion of enrollment on key studies. We also advanced our innovative pipeline through rapid enrollment on multiple registration enabling studies. Starting with general medicine, we have completed enrollment in the Phase 2 study of maridebart cafraglutide in patients with obesity with or without diabetes. The goal of this study is to generate data that will provide optionality to design a broad Phase 3 program, leveraging the unique properties of maridebart cafraglutide that could potentially allow us to take a differentiated approach. We anticipate top-line data from this 52-week study towards the end of 2024. The Phase 3 outcomes study of Olpasiran are potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is enrolling very well. In inflammation, beyond severe asthma, we are investigating additional indications with Tezspire, including separate Phase 3 studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, which is fully enrolled and eosinophilic esophagitis. We also have a Phase 2 study in COPD that has been fully enrolled with top-line data anticipated in the first half of 2024. This study has recruited a broad population of COPD patients, including patients with both high and low eosinophil counts. Rocatinlimab, a first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, recruitment is off to a strong start on the ROCKET Phase 3 clinical development program. We have now randomized over 1,500 patients across the program. We are excited to present additional data from our expanded rheumatology portfolio following the acquisition of Horizon, including data from a Phase 2 study of dazodalibep in Sjogren's Syndrome, along with data from KRYSTEXXA, Tavneos, Otezla and other molecules from our broad portfolio at the American College of Rheumatology Convergence 2023 Meeting in November. I'll be brief with my remarks on our oncology portfolio, given the detailed oncology review last week. Based on the E1910 Phase 3 study, the FDA has granted BLINCYTO Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with CD19-positive Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the consolidation phase of multiphase therapy. We see future growth in BLINCYTO from advancements into earlier lines of therapy and subcutaneous administration. BLINCYTO also serves as a blueprint for how we plan to rapidly progress tarlatamab and Xaluritamig into earlier lines of therapy [indiscernible] setting a lower tumor burden. Along with experts in the field, we are very encouraged by tarlatamab, our BiTE molecule, targeting DLL3. At ESMO, we presented data from DeLLphi-301, a Phase 2 study in late-stage small-cell lung cancer, where we saw impressive response rates, durability of response, and overall survival in a setting where patients typically have limited options and a very poor prognosis. We are submitting these data to the FDA and are pleased that the FDA has granted tarlatamab Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Given our confidence in these data, we are rapidly advancing tarlatamab into earlier lines of treatment with multiple Phase 3 studies underway or planned. Based on emerging clinical data, we are discontinuing PSMA-targeting bispecific AMG 340, and we will focus our efforts on rapidly advancing Xaluritamig in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. We expect Xaluritamig dose expansion cohorts to be fully enrolled by the end of the year, and are planning to initiate additional studies in patients with earlier-stage prostate cancer. With AMG 193, a small molecule MTA-cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor, we are encouraged by the responses we've seen across six MTAP-null solid tumors, the manageable safety profile and preclinical evidence of CNS penetrants. We are now rapidly enrolling dose expansion cohorts. And with that, I'll turn things over to Peter for the financial update. Yeah. Sure. As we've discussed before, Mike, with 133, we believe we have a potentially differentiated product based on the mechanism of action, it's a bi-functional to remind everyone, that antagonizes GIPR based on a genetic evidence, largely compiled by us, with two GLP-1 peptides stapled to the molecule for that mechanism of action. As I noted in the remarks, we've rapidly enrolled the Phase 2 trial. There are multiple arms to this trial that explore three different doses as well as different dosing intervals that I think will give us broad optionality going forward. We were quite pleased with the Phase 1 data in terms of depth of response, the kinetics of response, as well as persistence, and these are the things that we will be looking at in Phase 2 as we go forward. So it's full steam ahead on this program. And we're looking forward to data from the Phase 2 trial next year which will really inform the breadth of the Phase 3 trial that we're contemplating, which could be quite large. In terms of AMG 186 -- or 786, this is an orthogonal mechanism of action. We're bringing in data. And as we've indicated, after, you know, the first half of next year or so, we anticipate presenting those data in determining the path forward. As you note, it's a high bar in this field and we'd have to see the sort of profile that would, give us the confidence to invest broadly in a molecule like that. I would also note, we've got a suite of preclinical molecules, many of them non-incretin based in terms of mechanisms of action that we will be bringing forward over the next few years. So this is an area where we expect it to be a long-term player. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks, Jay. This is an area where we're very excited. You know, I'd like to characterize it as the hinge moment where we're seeing the coming together or the unification of technology and biotechnology. I really think this is going to affect over time a qualitative change in how we do drug discovery and drug development. So everything from protein structure prediction, protein-protein interaction, prediction at the molecular level, to multiomic analysis on extraordinarily large datasets which can -- which is only tractable through AI or machine learning, dense clinical trials data and then real-world evidence and real-world data. When you look across that spectrum, I believe we probably have the largest datasets in the industry. And so we are putting the tools in place and the foundation or models to really mine those data for deeper insights in the biology and then all the way out into the market. We'll talk about this more over time. But this is going to be an area of investment and it can be overhyped. It's not a panacea, but it is absolutely going to be the most powerful tool we've seen in a long, long time. Yeah. Thanks. On the latter, I wouldn't overthink that at all. I don't think there's anything there. In terms of the dosing that we do, this is always adjusted as we move through Phase 1 trials. As I've indicated, we're bringing in the data now, we're taking a look at that. And the constellation of clinical data -- updated preclinical data, and I think we'll have that all together as we go into next year and that will determine the potential path forward for AMG 786. And just to remind everyone, this is a target that is not an incretin-based target. Yeah. Thanks, David. Dave Reese, I'll start and then turn things over to Murdo, and Vikram. In terms of oral obesity molecule 786, as I've said, it has a novel mechanism of action, it's a Phase 1 molecule. So you should view it as a Phase 1 molecule. And we're bringing in the data I said, and we'll take a look at that as we get into the new year and make a determination on potential path forward for that molecule. I wouldn't view it as anything more or less than a Phase 1 asset with a novel mechanism of action. In terms of additional molecules and when we might file INDs and launch our first in human trials, we'll give guidance as that portfolio advances over time. Again, many of those molecules are targets that we emanated from deCODE Genetics, our colleagues in Iceland. And I'll provide further information as we get ready to move towards the clinic. But this is playing a long game. If you step back, look, this field is in its infancy. We are just beginning to understand the complex metabolic arrangements that occur with obesity and there are clearly different forms of obesity. There's a lot of work to do. And as I've indicated, our intent here is to play the long game given that this is one of the major public health challenges of the 21st Century. So let me now hand it over to Vikram and Murdo for additional commentary on your second question. I mean, I think, the broader context here is important. These patients have severe uncontrolled gout. They are often facing amputations, for example, because of the severity of the disease. And so there are large number of these patients that are currently not being served in the market in clinical practice. And so our focus is on reaching those patients where the quality-of-life impediments are quite significant, and the effects of the drug can be quite dramatic in improving the disease course and improving that sort of quality of life. So that's the focus right now. I wouldn't get distracted by some of the other potential associations. Yeah. I mean, as we go through '24, we will give guidance on when we expect, you know, the Phase 3 program to launch. You know, as is customary in these programs, we will take an interim look. That will remain blinded, we will not release that externally, because this is a 52-week study, but that will help at least guide our thinking. Also recall that the FDA requires a certain safety database before you launch Phase 3 trials here. And so as we get into next year and start to have those conversations, we will be able to give more definitive guidance as to when you can expect the launch of the Phase 3 program and what that suite of studies might look like."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we would like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood. You may now begin.\nArvind Sood: Thank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call to discuss our results for the second quarter. We continued down the path of strong unit volume growth during the quarter that led to an improved outlook for the rest of the year. This also sets the stage for growth longer term augmented by some meaningful pipeline updates, particularly with an oncology development. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the call with some prepared remarks, followed by a broader review of our performance by other members of our leadership team. You should have received a link to our slides that we have posted. Through the course of our discussion, we\u2019ll make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance. And just a reminder that actual results can vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you for joining our call. It was an excellent quarter across the board for Amgen and one that demonstrates why we remain very confident about our ability to deliver attractive long-term growth in sales and earnings. We delivered $7 billion in quarterly revenue, up 6% from a year ago, along with record non-GAAP earnings per share of $5 a share, up 8% over the prior year. Volume growth globally was 11% in the quarter, and that reflects all three of our therapeutic areas and all three of our geographic regions contributing to performance. For example, volume in our general medicine business grew by 21% in the quarter, while volume in our Asia Pacific region, which we have previously identified as a key source of growth for us, was up 46%. At a time of product shortages in the industry, our world-class manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to meet growing demand for our products and continue our longstanding tradition of serving every patient every time. Nine of our medicines generated record sales in the quarter. This is consistent with my comments from our first quarter call in April when I said we see the potential for many of our currently marketed products to reach significantly more patients over time and to contribute substantially to our long-term growth. In April, I spoke about Repatha and the growing contribution it\u2019s making in the fight against cardiovascular disease. Today I\u2019ll highlight Prolia, which achieved $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time, up 11%. Prolia is one of the first biologics to be widely prescribed by primary care physicians to treat a chronic disease, something we expect to see replicated over time in other categories like cardiovascular disease. For all of Prolia success though we know that osteoporosis remains an underdiagnosed and undertreated disease placing millions of elderly women at risk for life-changing fractures. With recently generated real world data, we\u2019ve established that Prolia is superior to alendronate, the most frequently prescribed bisphosphonate treatment in the U.S. in reducing fractures, and not by a little, but by a lot. To give you one data point, in May we announced that in a real world study, Prolia reduced the risk of hip fracture by 36% compared to alendronate. That\u2019s superior. Prolia and EVENITY, which achieved 47% sales growth in the quarter give us a powerful one two punch against osteoporosis, a disease that will only become more prevalent as the world grows older. You\u2019ll hear more from Murdo shortly about our very strong commercial performance through the first half of 2023. We\u2019re seeing strong momentum in our pipeline too, as you\u2019ll hear in detail from Dave Reese, we\u2019re sharing positive data today for our BiTE, tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer and for LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in colorectal cancer. We are especially excited about the tarlatamab readout, not only because of what it may mean for patients whose prognosis is otherwise exceptionally poor, but also because it adds to our growing conviction that bispecific T-cell engagers are an effective way to treat solid tumors as well as liquid tumors as we have demonstrated with BLINCYTO. Elsewhere in our pipeline, we continue to advance registration enabling trials for several potential new first-in-class medicines including Olpasiran in heart disease, rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis, and of course bemarituzumab in gastric cancer. We look forward to additional readouts from our pipeline in the second half of the year. Turning to our planned acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, we remain very enthusiastic about what our companies can achieve together for patients suffering from rare serious diseases. Horizon has certainly accomplished a great deal as an independent company. Amgen\u2019s global commercial manufacturing and R&D capabilities, especially for biologic products, will enable Horizon\u2019s medicines to reach even more patients more quickly than Horizon could have achieved on its own. As you know, this combination has been approved by regulators around the world, with the exception of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States. The FTC\u2019s arguments in this case are based on speculation and hypothetical notions. Their arguments are not grounded in long established antitrust law. Notwithstanding that in choosing to pursue this case, they\u2019ve ignored the commitments we made to address their stated concerns. Life-changing medicines that Amgen and Horizon offer treat different diseases and different patient populations. Simply put, there are no competitive overlaps and no incentives to bundle our drugs with theirs. We look forward to making our case in court in September and I\u2019m confident rather that we will prevail. In the meantime, we\u2019re working closely on integration plans with Horizon, so we can hit the ground running by mid-December, which is when we anticipate being able to close the deal. And let me just reiterate one more point before I hand over to Murdo. As the second quarter illustrates, Amgen\u2019s business is performing very well and our organic outlook for growth is strong, adding Horizon will serve to enhance our growth prospects even further. And let me close by thanking my Amgen colleagues around the world for their unwavering commitment to patients and to our business. We\u2019re excited about the future and our ability to serve many, many more patients than we do today. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Bob. I am very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, fueled by a commitment to deliver on our mission to bring innovative products to millions of patients globally. Execution is strong across the business with record quarterly sales for nine brands and robust volume growth across our general medicine, inflammation and hematology-oncology portfolios. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, second quarter global product sales grew 8% year-over-year. Including the impact of foreign exchange product sales increased 6% year-over-year. Volume growth was 11% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 9%. And volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Canada region was 8%. And consistent with our international expansion strategy, Asia-Pacific continues to be our fastest growing region with 46% volume growth in the quarter. Starting with our general medicines business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY, Aimovig. Overall revenue for these four products grew 19% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by 21% volume growth. Cardiovascular disease is a growing public health crisis and the state of care for high risk ASCVD patients with elevated LDL cholesterol is poor. Family heart, real world analysis of 38 million high risk Americans revealed that fewer than 30% of them ever reached their recommended LDL levels. This is a clear call to action that lowering LDL cholesterol as much and as early as possible with Repatha will reduce cardiovascular risk for patients. And so to meet this need, I\u2019m Amgen is committed to improving patient\u2019s ease of access and affordability. Today we have best-in-class formulary coverage for Repatha helping 90% of eligible U.S. patients gain access to this important medicine. Improved access is enabling broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. So, this has set the stage for growth for Repatha sales, which increased 30% year-over-year to a record $424 million in the second quarter. In the U.S. volume growth of 34% was driven by a record number of new patients starting treatment. Outside the U.S. we saw 37% volume growth with momentum across our regions. We recognize there are still many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha. And to meet that challenge, we are increasing investment to intensify our engagement with healthcare providers, bring our message directly to patients through direct-to-consumer media and drive urgency around LDLC testing and adherence to treatment guidelines. Transitioning to bone health, Prolia sales grew 11% year-over-year to a record $1 billion in second quarter driven by 11% volume growth. As Dave will discuss in more detail new real-world evidence data presented at the World Congress on Osteoporosis in May demonstrates the Prolia significantly reduces fracture risk across multiple endpoints when compared to alendronate. Our sales teams are now equipped with these data and are actively helping physicians understand the superior ability of Prolia to reduce the risk of fracture for their osteoporosis patients. EVENITY, which compliments Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $281 million for the quarter driven by strong volume growth across markets. In Japan, EVENITY had achieved a 42% share of the growing bone builder market, steadily increasing performance versus competitors and increasing initiation for na\u00efve patients. EVENITY sales are now annualizing at over $1 billion. Given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of women who are post-menopausal our success in Japan, the first launch market for EVENITY enhances our confidence in the significant growth potential through this decade. Otezla sales increased 1% year-over-year driven by 2% volume growth. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well-positioned to help the more than 1.5 million systemic na\u00efve U.S. patients with milder psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical treatment and can benefit from a systemic drug like Otezla. Our U.S. Otezla business has been impacted by free drug programs for newly launched topical and systemic competitors. And we expect new patient demand will continue to be affected by these programs for the remainder of 2023. Despite this, we see a compelling opportunity to invest in growth of Otezla and to drive increased awareness amongst physicians and patients. We are confident in the growth potential of Otezla given its unique combination of established efficacy and safety profile, broad payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and a lack of testing required for initiation, and of course, ease of administration. Enbrel sales grew 84% quarter-over-quarter following the seasonal impact on price and large drawdown of inventory during the first quarter in the U.S. Year-over-year, Enbrel sales increased 2% driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and higher net selling price partially offset by lower inventory levels. Although year-over-year volume was flat in the second quarter, the number of new patients in the U.S. starting treatment increased by 6%, driven by improved payer coverage. For the remainder of 2023 we expect this improved coverage will lead to continued growth in new patients. We also expect declining net selling price on a full year basis. Test buyer continues to show robust growth with $133 million in sales in the second quarter. Sales increased 39% sequentially driven by 37% volume growth that benefited from the introduction or self-administered, pre-filled, single-use pen approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first quarter. The pen offers patients a convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home, which improves accessibility and provides more flexibility and treatment options for all patients in the U.S. with severe, uncontrolled asthma. Sales of TAVNEOS were $30 million in the second quarter. U.S. volumes grew 28% quarter-over-quarter driven by an increase in new patients starting treatment. In the U.S. approximately 2000 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 1300 healthcare providers. Looking forward, Amgen\u2019s deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence will allow us to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with ANCA associated vasculitis. AMJEVITA sales increased 29% year-over-year for the second quarter, driven by 60% volume growth partially offset by lower inventory levels and net selling price. U.S. sales decreased 63% sequentially driven by inventory drawdowns after stocking to support a launch in the first quarter, partially offset by volume growth. Moving to our hematology and oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. Strong commercial execution and exciting new clinical data drove 12% volume growth year-over-year for these six innovative products. BLINCYTO sales grew 48% year-over-year with adoption across academic community and pediatric centers. Following positive data from the registration enabling E1910 study presented in December of 2022, an updated NCCN guidelines that were issued in May. Both the positive data and the updated guidelines support our confidence in the continued growth potential for BLINCYTO. Vectibix sales increased 20% year-over-year for the second quarter, driven by 20% volume growth supported by promotion of positive data from the Phase 3 PARADIGM trial demonstrating the superiority of Vectibix over bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for patients with wild-type RAS, colorectal cancer. KYPROLIS grew 9% year-over-year driven by 15% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. And LUMAKRAS reported $77 million of sales for the second quarter. Year-over-year sales were flat in the quarters. 20% volume growth was offset by lower net selling price and inventory levels. We see future growth opportunity for LUMAKRAS driven by launches in new markets and our comprehensive global clinical development program. Our execution is strong across the business driving growth and exemplifying our dedication to serving patients. Our business is performing at the very high level and with the announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, we have the potential to serve many more patients who can benefit from our decades of leadership in inflammation and nephrology. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave Reese.\nDave Reese: Thanks, Murdo. Good afternoon everyone. For R&D, the second quarter was one of high quality execution as we progressed our innovative pipeline with two important data readouts, multiple registration enabling studies on track and additional exciting data coming later this year. Beginning with oncology, we are exceptionally pleased to announce positive top line results from the global Phase 2 DeLLphi-301 trial evaluating tarlatamab, a first-in-class DLL3 targeting BiTE molecule in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer that progressed after two or more prior lines of treatment. Tarlatamab demonstrated an objective response rate at the primary endpoint that substantially exceeds what was previously reported in the Phase 1 study. Responses were durable and longer than what is expected with standard of care chemotherapy. Safety and tolerability were also more favorable compared to the Phase 1 study. This is the first time the device-specific T cell engager has shown unequivocal activity in a common solid tumor, a real milestone in the field. We look forward to discussing these data soon with the FDA and other regulatory agencies and presenting detailed results of this potentially registrational Phase 2 study at an upcoming Medical Congress. Based on the data we have observed, we are moving tarlatamab into earlier lines of therapy with DeLLphi-304, a Phase 3 study underway comparing tarlatamab with standard of care chemotherapy and second-line small cell lung cancer. We are also planning to initiate two additional Phase 3 studies of tarlatamab in earlier lines of small cell lung cancer. From my personal vantage point, as an oncologist, I believe this molecule can be transformative and can\u2019t wait to share these data with the field. Turning to LUMAKRAS, we continue to execute on our comprehensive clinical program designed to generate the breadth of data necessary to understand KRAS biology and the role LUMAKRAS can play in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and other solid tumors. We are delighted to announce that the global Phase 3 CodeBreaK 300 trial evaluating LUMAKRAS combined with Vectibix in chemo refractory metastatic KRAS G12C mutated colorectal cancer met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival for both the 240 milligram and 960 milligram doses. At comparable doses, efficacy results were consistent with what was previously observed in this setting with no new safety signals. We look forward to sharing these results with global health authorities and presenting the detailed results at an upcoming Medical Congress. The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation to LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix for the treatment of patients with metastatic KRAS G12C mutated colorectal cancer as determined by an FDA approved test who have received prior chemotherapy based on data from the prior CodeBreaK 101 study. Beyond these data, we continue to explore novel combinations as we seek to move LUMAKRAS into the first-line setting. Recently presented data from the SCARLET study provide the rationale to initiate a Phase 3 trial of LUMAKRAS combined with chemotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer patients with PD-L1 negative tumors and Phase 1b data in combination with Vectibix and chemotherapy support the initiation of a Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS with Vectibix and FOLFIRI in first-line G12C mutated colorectal cancer. In June, the FDA approved the supplemental biologics license application for BLINCYTO for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients with CD19-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease greater than or equal to 0.1%. The approval converts BLINCYTO\u2019s accelerated approval to a full approval. Global regulatory submissions are on track for E1910, a Phase 3 trial conducted by the National Cancer Institute, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network, Cancer Research Group that demonstrated superior overall survival with BLINCYTO treatment added to consolidation chemotherapy over standard of care consolidation chemotherapy in newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia negative ALL who were MRD negative following induction and intensification chemotherapy. Three important updates were made to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines in oncology in B-cell ALL. These included listing the BLINCYTO E1910 regimen as the only preferred regimen for the first line treatment of Philadelphia negative adult patients adding BLINCYTO to multi-agent chemotherapy as consolidation in MRD negative disease. And lastly, moving BLINCYTO in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to the top of the treatment algorithm or MRD negative Philadelphia positive disease. Finally, in April, data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrating that BLINCYTO added to chemotherapy improved two-year survival in KMT2A-rearranged B-ALL in infants as compared to historical data, BLINCYTO two-year survival was 93% versus 66% or chemotherapy alone. If you look at the totality of the data, it is clear that BLINCYTO is changing the paradigm for the treatment of B-cell ALL in late-stage disease, in early disease, in young patients and in older patients. We remain excited about its future potential and are focused on further investigating BLINCYTO in earlier lines of treatment and improving patient convenience through subcutaneous administration. As the first BiTE [ph], BLINCYTO also provides a roadmap for the development of molecules such as tarlatamab, which could have enhanced activity in settings of lower tumor burden. Two additional early oncology programs to watch are Xaluritamig and AMG 193. Xaluritamig is a first-in-class steep one targeting bispecific being studied in advanced prostate cancer where steep one is expressed on almost all tumor cells. We are observing significant anti-tumor activity with this molecule and are rapidly enrolling dose expansion cohorts. Xaluritamig provides another example of a bispecific T-cell engager demonstrating activity in a solid tumor setting. AMG 193 is a first-in-class small molecule MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor being studied in patients with advanced MTAP-null solid tumors. The overexpression of PRMT5 in the absence of MTAP leads to the accumulation of MTA and we leverage this biology in the unique design of AMG 193, which requires the presence of MTA to effectively inhibit PRMT5. Alterations in this pathway occur approximately 15% of solid tumors are often associated with a poor prognosis and historically have been very hard to drug. We are currently enrolling a Phase 1b/2 study of AMG 193, and while it is early, we are encouraged by the anti-tumor responses we\u2019ve observed in multiple tumor types. We look forward to sharing data from both Xaluritamig and AMG 193 this fall. In general medicine, we are advancing our cardiovascular franchise and emerging portfolio of obesity molecules with a focus on clinical trial execution. The Phase 3 outcomes study of Olpasiran are potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is enrolling well as is a Phase 2 study of maridebart cafraglutide formerly known as AMG 133 in patients with obesity with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The goal of the Phase 2 study is to generate data that will provide broad optionality to design a Phase 3 program leveraging the unique properties of maridebart cafraglutide that will deliver strong sustainable weight loss. In May, as mentioned, we presented data from a real world study of nearly half of a million post-menopausal women with osteoporosis in the United States Medicare program showing Prolia substantially reduced fracture risk in patients versus oral alendronate. In addition, the same study showed that longer duration of Prolia treatment was associated with a greater reduction in major osteoporotic fracture risk. These data are a great demonstration of the importance of Prolia in treating post-menopausal osteoporosis and the ability to study treatment effects in large patient populations using real world evidence. In inflammation beyond severe asthma, we are investigating multiple additional indications with TEZSPIRE including separate Phase 3 studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. We also have two Phase 2 studies, one in chronic spontaneous urticaria and the other in COPD. The CSU study is complete with top line data anticipated in imminently. The COPD trial is fully enrolled and has recruited a broad population of COPD patients, including patients with both high and low eosinophil counts. We look forward to the readout of this study in the first half of 2024. Rocatinlimab first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Recruitment is off to a strong start on the ROCKET Phase 3 clinical development program. We are also planning to initiate a Phase 2 study in moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma as we explore rocatinlimab in this additional indication. Rounding out the clinical summary, we\u2019ve continued to execute those on time and on budget with our biosimilars portfolio, including the recent initiation of a pivotal study evaluating the pharmacokinetic similarity of ABP 206 compared with OPDIVO one of six planned new biosimilars. In closing, I\u2019d like to highlight our recently announced collaboration with TScan Therapeutics. This is a multi-year collaboration that will use TScan\u2019s proprietary target discovery platform, TargetScan to identify the antigens recognized by T-cells in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease and represents a novel approach to investigating this tough to treat illness. I\u2019d like to thank Amgen staff around the world for their relentless focus on execution as we work hard to meet the needs of the patients we serve. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Dave. We\u2019re pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Growing volumes by 11% increasing investment in research and development and delivering 8% year over year non-GAAP EPS growth. This drives our confidence in delivering against our 2023 objectives and keeps us in position to meet or beat our longer term commitments. I\u2019ll review our second quarter results before discussing our 2023 guidance. As a reminder, these results and outlook reflect Amgen on a standalone basis without any adjustments for the announced Horizon acquisition. Turning to our second quarter financial results, which are shown on Slide 41, total revenues of $7.0 billion grew 6% year-over-year and represent the highest quarterly revenues in Amgen\u2019s history. Product sales increased 8% while total revenues increased 7% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Second quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 7% year-over-year. We invested in and advanced our pipeline and accelerated growth across our priority marketed products, while delivering a non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales of 52.6%, demonstrating expense discipline. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting growing investments in our pipeline, driven by higher spending on late stage programs and marketed product support. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 2.4 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 17.1%, primarily driven by higher profit shares and a changes in product mix. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the second quarter decreased 6% year-over-year. We continue to focus on our continuous improvement operating model, prioritizing investments, digitalization and driving productivity and beginning and in other cases continuing. What we have already started historically to execute in any number of uses of artificial intelligence. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were a net $307 million expense in the second quarter. This year-over-year favorability was driven primarily by the change in Beijing accounting from equity methods to a mark-to-market investment with the impact included only in our GAAP results. As expected, our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate increased 1.7 percentage points to 16.4%, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change that replaced the excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue our priority investments in the best innovation, both internal and external innovation. In Q2, we drove higher spend in late stage programs, such as AMG 133 an olpasiran as well as support for our marketed products, including [indiscernible] Second, we continue investing in our business. Capital expenditures are at near peak levels driven by simultaneous construction of our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. We expect our annual capital expenditures to begin to decline starting in 2024 with the completion and licensing of our Ohio plant and capital expenditures will then begin to return closer to historical levels over the coming years. And third, we plan to continue to return capital to our shareholders. We pay dividends of $2.13 per share in the second quarter, representing a 10% increase over the second quarter of 2022. The company generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2023 versus $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and includes higher interest income and higher operating income. We expect strong cash flow for the remainder of the year, consistent with our full year 2023 financial outlook and includes a non-GAAP operating margin of roughly 50%. Now turning to the outlook for the business for 2023 on Slide 43. Our guidance is currently provided on the Amgen standalone business and does not include any Horizon projections. As the Horizon transaction is expected to close by mid-December, resulting contributions from Horizon would be included after that period. Given our strong performance, we are raising our 2023 revenue guidance to $26.6 billion to $27.4 billion versus previous guidance of $26.2 billion to $27.3 billion. Although our results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance, we expect the third quarter sales maybe lower compared to the second quarter, due to the impact of the Medicare donut hole, which is more pronounced in the second half of the year, and also to certain favorable changes to estimated sales deductions in the second quarter. Regarding our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we intend to increase investments in our internal innovation and priority marketed products from a position of strength, given the acceleration in our business and our pipeline, reflecting our improved revenue outlook along with our investment plans we are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $17.80 to $18.80 versus previous guidance of $17.60 to $18.70. Again, although our results give us confidence to raise our full year non-GAAP EPS, we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS to be lower compared to the second quarter, resulting from the expected Q3 sales and our investments in the business. Important additional points to consider as you model the remainder of 2023, we now project full year Neulasta sales of approximately $800 million and full year combined KANJINT and MVASI sales of approximately $900 million. We now expect other revenue for 2023 to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion versus our prior range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Note that our third quarter 2022 results included about $90 million of other revenue related to our COVID antibody manufacturing agreement and the milestone we earned that we do not expect to repeat in the third quarter of 2023. We anticipate full year non-GAAP operating expense for 2023 to increase by closer to 3% versus last year compared to our previous estimate of a 1% increase with higher cost of sales from projected increase sales, additional investments driving our innovative pipeline and increase support for our growing priority marketed products, including Repatha and Otezla. We continue to expect a full year 2023 operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%, although will vary in each of the remaining two quarters. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost to sales as the percentage of product sales will be between 16% and 17%. We now expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2023 to increase about 5% year-over-year, which is higher than our prior guidance of 3% to 4%. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to be slightly down year-over-year as a percentage of product sales. We now expect non-GAAP other income and expenses to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion down from the prior guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. For the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.5% to 18.5% down from prior guidance of 18.0% to 19.0%. We expect Q3 tax rate to be near the upper end of the revised range of 17.5% to 18.5%. Our capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at approximately $925 million in 2023. Our confidence is strong in the long-term outlook and long-term growth for Amgen, and we look forward to completing the announced acquisition of Horizon by mid-December as Bob indicated. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to our 24,000 plus colleagues for successfully executing on our mission of serving patients in the second quarter and beyond. This concludes the financial update. I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob for Q&A.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Peter. And now we\u2019ll open the line for callers so they can ask questions. And I just ask our operator to remind you of the procedures for doing that, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Maybe one question on OX40. There are some concerns and people are talking about the safety of OX40. Like one concern is regarding the autoimmune phenomena, and I\u2019m reading some literature and suggests that in OX40 \u2013 lacking OX40 animal models, there is an impairment of interferon gamma. So just trying to understand how are you managing that risk in this particular drug? And how is it \u2013 what we mean phenomena? Is it a concern at all there? Thank you.\nDave Reese: Yes. Thanks. This is Dave. So we\u2019re aware of those conversations. What I can tell you is that let me approach your question in two parts. One mechanistically, OX40 is primarily expressed on activated T cells and activated pathogenic T cells in the setting of atopic dermatitis. In the Phase 2 program, we did not observe autoimmune phenomena. Obviously, this is something we are tracking, but we have no clinical signal or indication of such concerns at this time. Likewise, your question regarding interferon gamma would imply risk, for example, for infections. That\u2019s also something that we did not see at a greater rate in treated patients than placebo in the Phase 2 program. These are things that we will follow, they\u2019re followed routinely for almost all cytokine inhibition programs. But to date, we have not had signal.\nOperator: Thank you, Mohit. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Yee: Hey guys, thanks for the question. Bob commented about the enthusiasm for the Horizon deal. I know in general there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the TED market going on with sales. Can you maybe just describe your ongoing confidence with what you think is going on in the TED market, why you\u2019re excited about this and your confidence around regrowing this business? And have you been in discussions or at least aware of the ongoing dynamics or at least an ongoing dialogue with the company about the market for TED? Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Yes. Sure, Mike. We can answer in two parts. Maybe I\u2019ll kick it over to Murdo in a moment. But let me just reiterate that we remain very excited and of course, we\u2019re watching carefully developments in the marketplace and talking as appropriate with our friends at Horizon about that. And again based on our view of the clinical data and our view of the international opportunities and ability to expand the reach of the product, we\u2019re very excited about what we think we can do there. But Murdo, why don\u2019t you elaborate further.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. From our vantage point, Mike, what we see is strong execution by the Horizon team in the U.S. and there\u2019s several catalysts for growth here. They\u2019ve already expanded their commercial footprint, and so that should start to take traction. They have the data now for the low CAS patient population with the positive results from that trial in public domain, not yet published, but in public domain having been presented and in hand with their sales forces. So that\u2019s very recent and not reflected necessarily in their historical performance. Bob mentioned the international market launches. We continue to believe post-close, we will be able to help accelerate the work being done there. We\u2019re also seeing some improved medical policies being issued prior to the new calendar year and so that\u2019s very encouraging to see payers improve or remove restrictions, I should say, on the use of TEPEZZA for the lower CAS patient population. So there are many good catalysts, and what I see is horizon systematically unlocking those additional opportunities for growth, and we remain quite bullish on TEPEZZA\u2019s utility across a very large population of thyroid eye disease patients who would benefit from that treatment given the clinical data. The last thing, I should mention on TEPEZZA is they also were able to replicate the low cast population results in OPTIC-J, in their OPTIC-J trial. Sorry, they\u2019re not the low cast, but the registrational data for thyroid eye disease in OPTIC-J. So that sets them up well for future potential launch in Japan. So really good data flow, really good execution and investment and focus here. And look beyond TEPEZZA. We also remain very, very excited about their other two large inline brands with KRYSTEXXA and obviously UPLIZNA. So overall, we remain excited and confident that the two companies working together on this really strong portfolio will be a good parent.\nOperator: Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Could you put the top-line Phase 2 data for tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer into context for us, and share any more details on the profile. In particular, how does this compare to the Phase 1 data where you had a confirmed objective response rate of 23% in a median duration of response of 13 months? I think you noted it substantially exceeds the Phase 1 results. Thank you.\nDave Reese: Yes, Salveen, thanks for the question. Very, very excited about this small molecule. If you step back, I think, it represents what we had hoped to see in the BiTE platform and substantial clinical effects in a major solid tumor. To put the data in the context in comparison to a Phase 1, as noted, we substantially exceeded the 23% response rate that we reported in Phase 1. We are planning to present these data at a Fall Conference on embargoed in terms \u2013 of course, in terms of providing more specifics. But I can tell you that it couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the response rate data, the duration of response, and overall survival. For context in patients with small cell lung cancer in the third-line response rates are typically well under 50%, but importantly, they are vanishingly brief in most instances, often a matter of weeks or a few months. And so, based on what we\u2019re observing, I think we really have a chance to change the natural history of this disease, particularly as we march towards earlier lines of therapy where the activity of the BiTE in a lower tumor disease burden setting should be enhanced as we have observed with BLINCYTO. So all of our efforts now are focused on executing earlier line trials. So, this is one to I think pay attention to as we go forward and we\u2019re really looking forward to presenting these results this fall.\nSalveen Richter: Dave, you want to say anything about safety? Obviously \u2026\nDave Reese: I\u2019m sorry. And in terms of the safety, I think we have learned a lot in the development program about the clinical management here. We\u2019re quite pleased with the rates of principal side effects, like cytokine release syndrome and we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ll look forward to sharing those details as well when we present the data this fall. But exceptionally happy with the tolerability and safety profile as well.\nOperator: Thank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJay Olson: Oh, hey, congrats on the quarter and especially the tarlatamab and LUMAKRAS results. And happy birthday to Arvind.\nArvind Sood: Thanks.\nJay Olson: For the LUMAKRAS Phase 3, in colorectal cancer. Can you just talk about the filing strategy and timeline, and maybe a little bit about the market opportunity in CRC for LUMAKRAS? Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Yes. In regards, this is obviously a smaller patient population, about 4% of colorectal cancers harbor the G12C mutation. In terms of next steps here our plans are to have discussions with the FDA and other regulatory authorities on these Phase 3 data. And as those conversations on unfold, I\u2019ll provide guidance about the potential regulatory pathway. And then, as I mentioned, based on the strength of these data and Phase 1b data in the first-line setting using a Vectibix chemotherapy LUMAKRAS combination we are also advancing a Phase 3 trial in first-line disease. So, I think its full steam ahead in colorectal cancer as well. And again, I\u2019ll give guidance about next steps as we\u2019ve had the appropriate conversations.\nOperator: Thank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Raymond: Thanks. And warm birthday wishes to Arvind from us here at Piper as well. Just a question on am AMJEVITA. So, obviously the uptake in the U.S. has not been maybe what was originally sort of contemplated, when you guys were first talking about that opportunity. But maybe a couple questions. Can you maybe talk about first maybe the split in scripts between the high and low priced SKU. And then second, maybe there\u2019s been a lot of talk around what AbbVie has done to sort of blunt uptake, biosimilars to date. What, if anything on their part has surprised you guys, maybe the most in terms of what they\u2019ve done and what\u2019s the plan maybe going forward?\nArvind Sood: Sure. Yes. Do you want to take that, Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Sure. Thank you for the question, Chris. We\u2019re obviously very early innings still in this biosimilar market with AMJEVITA, and we\u2019re seeing clearly what is new payer behavior in light of such a large product having biosimilar competition. With respect to the high versus the low, we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a different mix. We see mostly the high in PBM utilization and the low in the IDN utilization where the low cost \u2013 low net cost is attractive to them. But again, it\u2019s very early in the product mix, I don\u2019t think has settled out yet between those two SKUs. I would also say that we are still waiting to see what happens in the next payer negotiation cycle going into 2024. As you\u2019ve seen many of the PBMs are on record as saying that they haven\u2019t done a whole lot in terms of driving utilization of biosimilars in 2023, but plan to do more of that in 2024. So I think there\u2019s a lot more to follow here. And with respect to AbbVie strategy, look, we compete against them in the innovative site and we now compete against them with our biosimilar, and we know their practices well. So not a lot of surprises there, but I think the \u2013 I think that the clarity of how pharmacy benefit works with biosimilar uptake, or lack thereof is becoming clear to us and to other biosimilar manufacturers and other onlookers. So more to follow there. I would say though, we remain very excited about the growth of biosimilars in the longer term. We continue \u2013 as Dave mentioned, we continue to commit research investment in the development of additional biosimilars with most recently with the initiation of ABP 206, a biosimilar to OPDIVO. We also are continuing to look at being able to launch other biosimilars in the medical benefit reimbursement system in the U.S. and that\u2019s where we were successful, obviously with KANJINTI and MVASI in our previous launches. So going forward, the majority of our biosimilar growth will come from ex-U.S. and U.S. medical benefit biosimilars. And we continue to believe we\u2019ll be able to generate strong growth. Having previously said that we would more than double our 2021 annual sales of roughly $2 billion.\nOperator: Thank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Dave, I felt like you were on a roll on Arvind\u2019s birthday today, so congrats on all the data. My question is three and a half month was the PFS in the prior data, I think it was 20 plus percent response rate. And judging by the way you were describing it as transformative, is it fair to say PFS also improved in a meaningful way in the DL3 study? And secondly back on the horizon deal, I feel like two things are clear. You\u2019re very committed to the deal, but also that TEPEZZA is falling dramatically short at least so far. And the question that\u2019s coming up from investors is, is there any way to renegotiate the purchase price? Thank you very much.\nDave Reese: Yes. What I can say Umer, without getting into specifics on the number being under embargo is that I\u2019m very happy with the overall \u2013 the efficacy package \u2013 overall response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, and overall survival. And we\u2019ll have presentation of all of those data at an upcoming medical Congress. But to me this is \u2013 it\u2019s a very, very compelling efficacy package.\nMurdo Gordon: Okay. And on horizon, Umer, you\u2019re right, we remain enthusiastic about proceeding on the basis of the deal that we announced. I would take issue at least with our perspective is different from what was implicit in your question, but we\u2019ll leave that for another day.\nOperator: Thank you, Umer. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nYaron Werber: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have a question on OTEZLA and sort of as relating to Enbrel too, specifically, Enbrel sort of bouncing back, which is good to see. It looks like that\u2019s really a net benefiting from the contracting that you\u2019ve put in place given AMJEVITA and generic Humira. OTEZLA though is facing SOTYKTU, which is actually doing pretty well in terms of uptake. It\u2019s got a benign label and obviously a drug program. What gives you a lot of confidence in the outlook ahead? Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Thanks Yaron for the question. Yes, you\u2019re right. Enbrel has \u2013 did have a strong quarter and is benefiting from quite frankly, the best access we\u2019ve ever had on Enbrel, where we\u2019re covered across all the major PBMs now. So we\u2019re seeing really nice new patient growth on Enbrel, so more new patients coming onto treatment with Enbrel, and we think that that will support sustained volume through the course of the year. We did give up a bit of price to do that, so that\u2019s also flowing through Enbrel. But overall, I think there was some concerns perhaps last quarter that the biosimilar activity in this category was somehow impacting Enbrel. And I was pretty clear last quarter that wasn\u2019t what we were seeing. And it\u2019s definitely now clear in second quarter that biosimilar competition for Humira is not negatively impacting Enbrel. So we\u2019re \u2013 we see stability in Enbrel going forward. For OTEZLA, we\u2019re actually seeing some strength in OTEZLA. We are pleased with what new patient acquisition looks like. We think we can do better and we \u2013 as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are investing more in OTEZLA through the backend of this year. And Peter also mentioned that. And the reason we\u2019re optimistic is we\u2019re gaining momentum in helping those post topical first systemic patients. And the epi here is pretty significant as there\u2019s 1.5 million of these patients in the U.S. that persist with topical treatment. That would be better being initiated on a systemic agent. And OTEZLA is really the ideal for a systemic agent. We have great commercial coverage with OTEZLA with very little prior authorization requirement. We have no testing requirement for initiation. And the affordability and out-of-pocket is very good. So OTEZLA is an attractive option for PBMs and pairs to maintain on their formularies. And it\u2019s an easy option for dermatologists as the first systemic agent that they would choose for a patient coming off the topicals and being treated. And again, this is milder form of disease and no one else has indicated for that mild population from a systemic perspective. So overall, the thesis is good. Now, I think, SOTYKTU coming into the market clearly put pressure on us where there were patients who were probably on our oral and didn\u2019t have full resolution of their psoriasis symptoms and they would\u2019ve switched to SOTYKTU. What we\u2019re seeing is that, that has slowed. We are losing less to SOTYKTU in our current mix of patients that we have on Otezla. And we think that the other \u2013 the other dynamic that put pressure on us in the first part of the year was the topical treatments also had free goods programs out there, and they were getting trial, and that has abated, they flattened out. So we\u2019re getting less pressure from topicals and much less patient movement away from Otezla to SOTYKTU. So I think we really have to see into 24 how the access will evolve for the novel agents, but we\u2019re very confident with our current access and the current perception of the safety and efficacy of Otezla, we can further penetrate that population of patients. So going forward, we\u2019re feeling good about it.\nOperator:\n,:\nGregory Renza: Great. Thanks. Thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. Bob, we certainly appreciate you framing up the case for the Horizon deal before the eyes of regulators and the courts. And maybe just to build on the conviction that, that you laid out, I just wanted to ask on your thoughts on the implication to potentially a negative outcome on the biopharma, value creation, ecosystem and essentially the ability for companies like Amgen to, to bring medicines to patients. So if we just call it that this novel legal theory like bundling does prevail what impact would that have? And maybe to that, how far would you and the Amgen team really be willing to take this to preserve that opportunity to close the deal? Thanks so much.\nBob Bradway: Well, again, I think I would reiterate what I said in my prepared remarks, right, which is that they, we don\u2019t believe that their case is based on any established antitrust law. We think it\u2019s based on hypotheticals and speculative notions. And we look forward to having a chance to assert that in court. And again, we expect to prevail in court. And I think what \u2013 what\u2019s implicit in your question is the recognition that we live in a very fragmented industry, and that there are a lot of innovators in particular that are a size that makes it difficult for them to capitalize on the full potential of their innovation, especially globally. And so there is a role for companies like ours to play in bringing value to companies like Horizon. We\u2019ve talked about it repeatedly, but we think the capabilities we have with our global commercial organization that demonstrated expertise we have in manufacturing, research and development for products like this, I think will enable us to reach far more patients than the company would be able to on its own. So this is an industry that has flourished by being able to capitalize on the innovation ecosystem that exists for biotechnology companies, for the most part in the United States. And again, we expect that that will continue and think that were it not possible for companies to combine to benefit from each other\u2019s strengths, the result would be fewer innovation, reaching fewer patients. So that would be an unfortunate outcome.\nOperator: Thank you, Gregory. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. Maybe one for you, Dave; can you just expand on the biologic rationale to target steep one versus PSMA and prostate cancer? And I\u2019m asking this in context of an update you we had from a competitor today, whereas their PSMA program different than yours, they had to modify significantly due to safety issues? Thank you very much.\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks Evan. We\u2019re \u2013 so a couple reasons to target steep one. Number one it\u2019s almost universally expressed on advanced cancer cells. There is not e extensive high level normal tissue expression, so that allows you to generate the therapeutic window that we\u2019re always looking for with bispecific T-cell engagers. PSMA has been a challenging target. There appear to be unique properties with that target. As I think you\u2019re aware, multiple molecules including some of our own have gone into and then fallen out of clinical development. And I\u2019ve come to the belief that that maybe in part target related. So steep one is a relatively novel target, we are in the clinic, I think are far advanced compared to anyone else. And based on the clinical data that we\u2019re seeing now, this is a program we really want to accelerate. This is another one of the programs where, we\u2019ll be presenting data this fall and either urge you to put [indiscernible] under the radar screen and pay attention to those data; but this one I think has a real opportunity.\nOperator: Thank you, Evan. Our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nColin Bristow: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for clicking the questions. Maybe just a quick one on TEZSPIRE, and you have the upcoming COPD data in the first half of 2024. I was just curious as to get your expectations here. What\u2019s the threshold for success, especially in light of the recent sort of very positive [indiscernible] data? Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Yes. I think in light of what we\u2019ve seen in the field, we would love to see something that is competitive with that. Just to level set everyone, the rationale for this study is that the target of TEZSPIRE, TSLP is expressed in bronchial mucosa. Sputum can be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with COPD. The pathway may be a contributor or driver of exacerbations and that\u2019s really the hypothesis that we are testing here. So we\u2019ll look at the totality of the clinical data, but I think some of the things you\u2019ve seen recently published give us benchmarks as to what we\u2019ll hope to see.\nOperator: Thank you, Colin. Our next question comes from Dane Leone from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDane Leone: Thank you. Maybe just two quick ones for me; firstly, in terms of the rebound in Otezla and the good strength that seems to be coming out of some of those trialing periods for competitive products on the topical side and also oral side. Can you just maybe provide whatever response makes sense to your competitors\u2019 analysis on the oral side suggesting they\u2019ve achieved over 40% TRx share and whether you think that share could go back in favor of Otezla during the back half of this year, or is that something you would see steady state from here on out? And then secondly, just regarding the Phase 2 tarlatamab, is there anything we need to be aware of that maybe the patient population in this Phase 2 small cell lung cancer study, was maybe less heavy or pre \u2013 less heavily pretreated as opposed to what was seen in the Phase 1 study, which is sometimes the case? Thank you.\nArvind Sood: Yes, why don\u2019t we take it in two parts?\nBob Bradway: Yes. Dane, I\u2019ll attempt to answer your Otezla question. As I said, we are encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in the market here. It\u2019s really hard for me to comment on market share claims from other companies, particularly when that they\u2019re adding what we can see versus what we can\u2019t see in their free drug program. So they\u2019re giving a lot of product away, and I think they\u2019re including that in their denominator when they\u2019re providing share. I actually don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be reflective of what their ultimate in market performance will look like, because we\u2019ve seen that in many categories where free programs or bridging programs are not representative ultimately of the final access picture and the final effect that new access picture will have on demand. So, I think that given our very good access coverage with little to no prior authorization requirements across many of those plans, we are definitely in a position should some of those free drug patients end up getting rejected for sustained actual insurance coverage. Because of the broad coverage, we have not factored that into our go-forward, but it could happen.\nArvind Sood: Regarding tarlatamab, no substantive differences, very heavily pretreated our population. We\u2019ll provide details this fall.\nOperator: Thank you, Dane. Our next question comes from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. Could you please provide an update on your oral obesity Phase 1 trial, and also discuss your evaluation of backup candidates? Thanks very much.\nBob Bradway: Yes, in terms of the oral obesity program, it\u2019s moving through, it\u2019s Phase 1, which includes, single dose and short-term multiple dose. We expect probably now to have data in the first half of next year. Behind that we have multiple programs looking at orthogonal mechanisms of action, many of them non-incretin based. And as some of those progress towards the clinic, we\u2019ll start to talk about them and give you insights into our portfolio approach here. So thank you.\nArvind Sood: Hey, Julian, why don\u2019t we take one last question as we are over our allotted time?\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question will come from Robin Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRobin Karnauskas: Great, thank you. So congratulations on tarlatamab, or I\u2019m going to call TMAb to make my life easier. But can you just opine a little bit, usually first, the first innovators expand a market like small cell to be much bigger than what people think of today. And walk us through the cadence of these Phase 1 trials in particular, I think the checkpoint inhibitor combination trial, like when could we see data from that and how do you view like even Harpoon, the competitive landscape and how you are differentiated from them? Thanks so much.\nArvind Sood: Sure. Let me start with the tarlatamab [ph]. I\u2019m extremely enthusiastic about this molecule, you know, as always, I\u2019ll let others talk about their molecules. But, this one is one that we\u2019re really putting muscle behind to sort of level set everyone here. As you start to think about the unmet medical need, there are roughly 240,000 cases of lung cancer in the United States each year. Roughly 15% of them are small cell lung cancer, comparable numbers in Western Europe for example. So that gives you a sense of the patient numbers. The clinical development program overtime is going to be designed to look at really that broad swath of patients. Of course, we\u2019re starting in third-line therapy, but our goal here is to quickly advance into second and earlier lines of treatment. And, we\u2019ll talk more about those clinical studies as we get through later in the year. But this is one again, where I think when we get into settings of lower tumor burden as we\u2019ve observed with BLINCYTO, we can really affect the natural history of the disease. Recall that upon initial diagnosis, only 7% of patients with small cell lung cancer will be alive five years later. And that\u2019s the opportunity to change that, I think is in front of us now.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Well, thank you for your question Robin, and thank you all for joining. As Arvind said, we know we\u2019re a couple minutes over allotted time, so I want to be respectful of your calendars, but I also just do want to make one more statement, if I may, which is before we break, I wanted to announce that after nearly 19 years in the role Arvind Sood will be transitioning his Head of IR responsibility to our Treasurer, Justin Claeys. And Arvind will remain a VP in Finance and will help Justin transition seamlessly into this new role. So he is, while he is not leaving this is nonetheless a big moment and I wanted to acknowledge it because I know Arvind is something of a legend and a fixture in the investor relations world. And I \u2013 on a personal note, I want to just add that I\u2019ve worked with Arvind now for more than 20 years. So we began working together even before we both joined Amgen. So I want to publicly congratulate him on his accomplishments in the IR profession. And I want to again, publicly state that I\u2019m delighted that he\u2019s going to remain part of the finance group working with me and Peter and the rest of the team. So on his birthday, we have a second thing to celebrate, which is the culmination of nearly 19 years in his role at Amgen. And those of you, who haven\u2019t met Justin, will enjoy getting to know him. He\u2019s been with Amgen for more than 20 years and served as our Treasurer for most of the past four years. So I know you\u2019ll all join me in wishing Justin well as he begins his transition into this role. And I know you\u2019ll all join me in wishing Arvind a good celebration here with us later this evening. Thank you. We\u2019ll talk to you after the next quarter.\nArvind Sood: Great. Thank you everybody. And we\u2019ll keep in touch.\nOperator: This concludes our 2023 Q2 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Bradway",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you for joining our call. It was an excellent quarter across the board for Amgen and one that demonstrates why we remain very confident about our ability to deliver attractive long-term growth in sales and earnings. We delivered $7 billion in quarterly revenue, up 6% from a year ago, along with record non-GAAP earnings per share of $5 a share, up 8% over the prior year. Volume growth globally was 11% in the quarter, and that reflects all three of our therapeutic areas and all three of our geographic regions contributing to performance. For example, volume in our general medicine business grew by 21% in the quarter, while volume in our Asia Pacific region, which we have previously identified as a key source of growth for us, was up 46%. At a time of product shortages in the industry, our world-class manufacturing capabilities have enabled us to meet growing demand for our products and continue our longstanding tradition of serving every patient every time. Nine of our medicines generated record sales in the quarter. This is consistent with my comments from our first quarter call in April when I said we see the potential for many of our currently marketed products to reach significantly more patients over time and to contribute substantially to our long-term growth. In April, I spoke about Repatha and the growing contribution it's making in the fight against cardiovascular disease. Today I'll highlight Prolia, which achieved $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time, up 11%. Prolia is one of the first biologics to be widely prescribed by primary care physicians to treat a chronic disease, something we expect to see replicated over time in other categories like cardiovascular disease. For all of Prolia success though we know that osteoporosis remains an underdiagnosed and undertreated disease placing millions of elderly women at risk for life-changing fractures. With recently generated real world data, we've established that Prolia is superior to alendronate, the most frequently prescribed bisphosphonate treatment in the U.S. in reducing fractures, and not by a little, but by a lot. To give you one data point, in May we announced that in a real world study, Prolia reduced the risk of hip fracture by 36% compared to alendronate. That's superior. Prolia and EVENITY, which achieved 47% sales growth in the quarter give us a powerful one two punch against osteoporosis, a disease that will only become more prevalent as the world grows older. You'll hear more from Murdo shortly about our very strong commercial performance through the first half of 2023. We're seeing strong momentum in our pipeline too, as you'll hear in detail from Dave Reese, we're sharing positive data today for our BiTE, tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer and for LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in colorectal cancer. We are especially excited about the tarlatamab readout, not only because of what it may mean for patients whose prognosis is otherwise exceptionally poor, but also because it adds to our growing conviction that bispecific T-cell engagers are an effective way to treat solid tumors as well as liquid tumors as we have demonstrated with BLINCYTO. Elsewhere in our pipeline, we continue to advance registration enabling trials for several potential new first-in-class medicines including Olpasiran in heart disease, rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis, and of course bemarituzumab in gastric cancer. We look forward to additional readouts from our pipeline in the second half of the year. Turning to our planned acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, we remain very enthusiastic about what our companies can achieve together for patients suffering from rare serious diseases. Horizon has certainly accomplished a great deal as an independent company. Amgen's global commercial manufacturing and R&D capabilities, especially for biologic products, will enable Horizon's medicines to reach even more patients more quickly than Horizon could have achieved on its own. As you know, this combination has been approved by regulators around the world, with the exception of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States. The FTC's arguments in this case are based on speculation and hypothetical notions. Their arguments are not grounded in long established antitrust law. Notwithstanding that in choosing to pursue this case, they've ignored the commitments we made to address their stated concerns. Life-changing medicines that Amgen and Horizon offer treat different diseases and different patient populations. Simply put, there are no competitive overlaps and no incentives to bundle our drugs with theirs. We look forward to making our case in court in September and I'm confident rather that we will prevail. In the meantime, we're working closely on integration plans with Horizon, so we can hit the ground running by mid-December, which is when we anticipate being able to close the deal. And let me just reiterate one more point before I hand over to Murdo. As the second quarter illustrates, Amgen's business is performing very well and our organic outlook for growth is strong, adding Horizon will serve to enhance our growth prospects even further. And let me close by thanking my Amgen colleagues around the world for their unwavering commitment to patients and to our business. We're excited about the future and our ability to serve many, many more patients than we do today. Murdo? Okay. Thank you, Peter. And now we'll open the line for callers so they can ask questions. And I just ask our operator to remind you of the procedures for doing that, please. Yes. Sure, Mike. We can answer in two parts. Maybe I'll kick it over to Murdo in a moment. But let me just reiterate that we remain very excited and of course, we're watching carefully developments in the marketplace and talking as appropriate with our friends at Horizon about that. And again based on our view of the clinical data and our view of the international opportunities and ability to expand the reach of the product, we're very excited about what we think we can do there. But Murdo, why don't you elaborate further. Yes. In regards, this is obviously a smaller patient population, about 4% of colorectal cancers harbor the G12C mutation. In terms of next steps here our plans are to have discussions with the FDA and other regulatory authorities on these Phase 3 data. And as those conversations on unfold, I'll provide guidance about the potential regulatory pathway. And then, as I mentioned, based on the strength of these data and Phase 1b data in the first-line setting using a Vectibix chemotherapy LUMAKRAS combination we are also advancing a Phase 3 trial in first-line disease. So, I think its full steam ahead in colorectal cancer as well. And again, I'll give guidance about next steps as we've had the appropriate conversations. Thanks Yaron for the question. Yes, you're right. Enbrel has \u2013 did have a strong quarter and is benefiting from quite frankly, the best access we've ever had on Enbrel, where we're covered across all the major PBMs now. So we're seeing really nice new patient growth on Enbrel, so more new patients coming onto treatment with Enbrel, and we think that that will support sustained volume through the course of the year. We did give up a bit of price to do that, so that's also flowing through Enbrel. But overall, I think there was some concerns perhaps last quarter that the biosimilar activity in this category was somehow impacting Enbrel. And I was pretty clear last quarter that wasn't what we were seeing. And it's definitely now clear in second quarter that biosimilar competition for Humira is not negatively impacting Enbrel. So we're \u2013 we see stability in Enbrel going forward. For OTEZLA, we're actually seeing some strength in OTEZLA. We are pleased with what new patient acquisition looks like. We think we can do better and we \u2013 as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, are investing more in OTEZLA through the backend of this year. And Peter also mentioned that. And the reason we're optimistic is we're gaining momentum in helping those post topical first systemic patients. And the epi here is pretty significant as there's 1.5 million of these patients in the U.S. that persist with topical treatment. That would be better being initiated on a systemic agent. And OTEZLA is really the ideal for a systemic agent. We have great commercial coverage with OTEZLA with very little prior authorization requirement. We have no testing requirement for initiation. And the affordability and out-of-pocket is very good. So OTEZLA is an attractive option for PBMs and pairs to maintain on their formularies. And it's an easy option for dermatologists as the first systemic agent that they would choose for a patient coming off the topicals and being treated. And again, this is milder form of disease and no one else has indicated for that mild population from a systemic perspective. So overall, the thesis is good. Now, I think, SOTYKTU coming into the market clearly put pressure on us where there were patients who were probably on our oral and didn't have full resolution of their psoriasis symptoms and they would've switched to SOTYKTU. What we're seeing is that, that has slowed. We are losing less to SOTYKTU in our current mix of patients that we have on Otezla. And we think that the other \u2013 the other dynamic that put pressure on us in the first part of the year was the topical treatments also had free goods programs out there, and they were getting trial, and that has abated, they flattened out. So we're getting less pressure from topicals and much less patient movement away from Otezla to SOTYKTU. So I think we really have to see into 24 how the access will evolve for the novel agents, but we're very confident with our current access and the current perception of the safety and efficacy of Otezla, we can further penetrate that population of patients. So going forward, we're feeling good about it. Well, again, I think I would reiterate what I said in my prepared remarks, right, which is that they, we don't believe that their case is based on any established antitrust law. We think it's based on hypotheticals and speculative notions. And we look forward to having a chance to assert that in court. And again, we expect to prevail in court. And I think what \u2013 what's implicit in your question is the recognition that we live in a very fragmented industry, and that there are a lot of innovators in particular that are a size that makes it difficult for them to capitalize on the full potential of their innovation, especially globally. And so there is a role for companies like ours to play in bringing value to companies like Horizon. We've talked about it repeatedly, but we think the capabilities we have with our global commercial organization that demonstrated expertise we have in manufacturing, research and development for products like this, I think will enable us to reach far more patients than the company would be able to on its own. So this is an industry that has flourished by being able to capitalize on the innovation ecosystem that exists for biotechnology companies, for the most part in the United States. And again, we expect that that will continue and think that were it not possible for companies to combine to benefit from each other's strengths, the result would be fewer innovation, reaching fewer patients. So that would be an unfortunate outcome. Yes. I think in light of what we've seen in the field, we would love to see something that is competitive with that. Just to level set everyone, the rationale for this study is that the target of TEZSPIRE, TSLP is expressed in bronchial mucosa. Sputum can be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with COPD. The pathway may be a contributor or driver of exacerbations and that's really the hypothesis that we are testing here. So we'll look at the totality of the clinical data, but I think some of the things you've seen recently published give us benchmarks as to what we'll hope to see. Yes. Dane, I'll attempt to answer your Otezla question. As I said, we are encouraged by what we're seeing in the market here. It's really hard for me to comment on market share claims from other companies, particularly when that they're adding what we can see versus what we can't see in their free drug program. So they're giving a lot of product away, and I think they're including that in their denominator when they're providing share. I actually don't think that's going to be reflective of what their ultimate in market performance will look like, because we've seen that in many categories where free programs or bridging programs are not representative ultimately of the final access picture and the final effect that new access picture will have on demand. So, I think that given our very good access coverage with little to no prior authorization requirements across many of those plans, we are definitely in a position should some of those free drug patients end up getting rejected for sustained actual insurance coverage. Because of the broad coverage, we have not factored that into our go-forward, but it could happen. Yes, in terms of the oral obesity program, it's moving through, it's Phase 1, which includes, single dose and short-term multiple dose. We expect probably now to have data in the first half of next year. Behind that we have multiple programs looking at orthogonal mechanisms of action, many of them non-incretin based. And as some of those progress towards the clinic, we'll start to talk about them and give you insights into our portfolio approach here. So thank you. Okay. Well, thank you for your question Robin, and thank you all for joining. As Arvind said, we know we're a couple minutes over allotted time, so I want to be respectful of your calendars, but I also just do want to make one more statement, if I may, which is before we break, I wanted to announce that after nearly 19 years in the role Arvind Sood will be transitioning his Head of IR responsibility to our Treasurer, Justin Claeys. And Arvind will remain a VP in Finance and will help Justin transition seamlessly into this new role. So he is, while he is not leaving this is nonetheless a big moment and I wanted to acknowledge it because I know Arvind is something of a legend and a fixture in the investor relations world. And I \u2013 on a personal note, I want to just add that I've worked with Arvind now for more than 20 years. So we began working together even before we both joined Amgen. So I want to publicly congratulate him on his accomplishments in the IR profession. And I want to again, publicly state that I'm delighted that he's going to remain part of the finance group working with me and Peter and the rest of the team. So on his birthday, we have a second thing to celebrate, which is the culmination of nearly 19 years in his role at Amgen. And those of you, who haven't met Justin, will enjoy getting to know him. He's been with Amgen for more than 20 years and served as our Treasurer for most of the past four years. So I know you'll all join me in wishing Justin well as he begins his transition into this role. And I know you'll all join me in wishing Arvind a good celebration here with us later this evening. Thank you. We'll talk to you after the next quarter."

            "name": "Dave Reese",
            "content": "Thanks, Murdo. Good afternoon everyone. For R&D, the second quarter was one of high quality execution as we progressed our innovative pipeline with two important data readouts, multiple registration enabling studies on track and additional exciting data coming later this year. Beginning with oncology, we are exceptionally pleased to announce positive top line results from the global Phase 2 DeLLphi-301 trial evaluating tarlatamab, a first-in-class DLL3 targeting BiTE molecule in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer that progressed after two or more prior lines of treatment. Tarlatamab demonstrated an objective response rate at the primary endpoint that substantially exceeds what was previously reported in the Phase 1 study. Responses were durable and longer than what is expected with standard of care chemotherapy. Safety and tolerability were also more favorable compared to the Phase 1 study. This is the first time the device-specific T cell engager has shown unequivocal activity in a common solid tumor, a real milestone in the field. We look forward to discussing these data soon with the FDA and other regulatory agencies and presenting detailed results of this potentially registrational Phase 2 study at an upcoming Medical Congress. Based on the data we have observed, we are moving tarlatamab into earlier lines of therapy with DeLLphi-304, a Phase 3 study underway comparing tarlatamab with standard of care chemotherapy and second-line small cell lung cancer. We are also planning to initiate two additional Phase 3 studies of tarlatamab in earlier lines of small cell lung cancer. From my personal vantage point, as an oncologist, I believe this molecule can be transformative and can't wait to share these data with the field. Turning to LUMAKRAS, we continue to execute on our comprehensive clinical program designed to generate the breadth of data necessary to understand KRAS biology and the role LUMAKRAS can play in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and other solid tumors. We are delighted to announce that the global Phase 3 CodeBreaK 300 trial evaluating LUMAKRAS combined with Vectibix in chemo refractory metastatic KRAS G12C mutated colorectal cancer met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival for both the 240 milligram and 960 milligram doses. At comparable doses, efficacy results were consistent with what was previously observed in this setting with no new safety signals. We look forward to sharing these results with global health authorities and presenting the detailed results at an upcoming Medical Congress. The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation to LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix for the treatment of patients with metastatic KRAS G12C mutated colorectal cancer as determined by an FDA approved test who have received prior chemotherapy based on data from the prior CodeBreaK 101 study. Beyond these data, we continue to explore novel combinations as we seek to move LUMAKRAS into the first-line setting. Recently presented data from the SCARLET study provide the rationale to initiate a Phase 3 trial of LUMAKRAS combined with chemotherapy in first-line non-small cell lung cancer patients with PD-L1 negative tumors and Phase 1b data in combination with Vectibix and chemotherapy support the initiation of a Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS with Vectibix and FOLFIRI in first-line G12C mutated colorectal cancer. In June, the FDA approved the supplemental biologics license application for BLINCYTO for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients with CD19-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease greater than or equal to 0.1%. The approval converts BLINCYTO's accelerated approval to a full approval. Global regulatory submissions are on track for E1910, a Phase 3 trial conducted by the National Cancer Institute, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and the American College of Radiology Imaging Network, Cancer Research Group that demonstrated superior overall survival with BLINCYTO treatment added to consolidation chemotherapy over standard of care consolidation chemotherapy in newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia negative ALL who were MRD negative following induction and intensification chemotherapy. Three important updates were made to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines in oncology in B-cell ALL. These included listing the BLINCYTO E1910 regimen as the only preferred regimen for the first line treatment of Philadelphia negative adult patients adding BLINCYTO to multi-agent chemotherapy as consolidation in MRD negative disease. And lastly, moving BLINCYTO in combination with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to the top of the treatment algorithm or MRD negative Philadelphia positive disease. Finally, in April, data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrating that BLINCYTO added to chemotherapy improved two-year survival in KMT2A-rearranged B-ALL in infants as compared to historical data, BLINCYTO two-year survival was 93% versus 66% or chemotherapy alone. If you look at the totality of the data, it is clear that BLINCYTO is changing the paradigm for the treatment of B-cell ALL in late-stage disease, in early disease, in young patients and in older patients. We remain excited about its future potential and are focused on further investigating BLINCYTO in earlier lines of treatment and improving patient convenience through subcutaneous administration. As the first BiTE [ph], BLINCYTO also provides a roadmap for the development of molecules such as tarlatamab, which could have enhanced activity in settings of lower tumor burden. Two additional early oncology programs to watch are Xaluritamig and AMG 193. Xaluritamig is a first-in-class steep one targeting bispecific being studied in advanced prostate cancer where steep one is expressed on almost all tumor cells. We are observing significant anti-tumor activity with this molecule and are rapidly enrolling dose expansion cohorts. Xaluritamig provides another example of a bispecific T-cell engager demonstrating activity in a solid tumor setting. AMG 193 is a first-in-class small molecule MTA cooperative PRMT5 inhibitor being studied in patients with advanced MTAP-null solid tumors. The overexpression of PRMT5 in the absence of MTAP leads to the accumulation of MTA and we leverage this biology in the unique design of AMG 193, which requires the presence of MTA to effectively inhibit PRMT5. Alterations in this pathway occur approximately 15% of solid tumors are often associated with a poor prognosis and historically have been very hard to drug. We are currently enrolling a Phase 1b/2 study of AMG 193, and while it is early, we are encouraged by the anti-tumor responses we've observed in multiple tumor types. We look forward to sharing data from both Xaluritamig and AMG 193 this fall. In general medicine, we are advancing our cardiovascular franchise and emerging portfolio of obesity molecules with a focus on clinical trial execution. The Phase 3 outcomes study of Olpasiran are potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA molecule and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is enrolling well as is a Phase 2 study of maridebart cafraglutide formerly known as AMG 133 in patients with obesity with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The goal of the Phase 2 study is to generate data that will provide broad optionality to design a Phase 3 program leveraging the unique properties of maridebart cafraglutide that will deliver strong sustainable weight loss. In May, as mentioned, we presented data from a real world study of nearly half of a million post-menopausal women with osteoporosis in the United States Medicare program showing Prolia substantially reduced fracture risk in patients versus oral alendronate. In addition, the same study showed that longer duration of Prolia treatment was associated with a greater reduction in major osteoporotic fracture risk. These data are a great demonstration of the importance of Prolia in treating post-menopausal osteoporosis and the ability to study treatment effects in large patient populations using real world evidence. In inflammation beyond severe asthma, we are investigating multiple additional indications with TEZSPIRE including separate Phase 3 studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. We also have two Phase 2 studies, one in chronic spontaneous urticaria and the other in COPD. The CSU study is complete with top line data anticipated in imminently. The COPD trial is fully enrolled and has recruited a broad population of COPD patients, including patients with both high and low eosinophil counts. We look forward to the readout of this study in the first half of 2024. Rocatinlimab first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Recruitment is off to a strong start on the ROCKET Phase 3 clinical development program. We are also planning to initiate a Phase 2 study in moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma as we explore rocatinlimab in this additional indication. Rounding out the clinical summary, we've continued to execute those on time and on budget with our biosimilars portfolio, including the recent initiation of a pivotal study evaluating the pharmacokinetic similarity of ABP 206 compared with OPDIVO one of six planned new biosimilars. In closing, I'd like to highlight our recently announced collaboration with TScan Therapeutics. This is a multi-year collaboration that will use TScan's proprietary target discovery platform, TargetScan to identify the antigens recognized by T-cells in patients with Crohn's disease and represents a novel approach to investigating this tough to treat illness. I'd like to thank Amgen staff around the world for their relentless focus on execution as we work hard to meet the needs of the patients we serve. I'll now turn it over to Peter. Yes. Thanks. This is Dave. So we're aware of those conversations. What I can tell you is that let me approach your question in two parts. One mechanistically, OX40 is primarily expressed on activated T cells and activated pathogenic T cells in the setting of atopic dermatitis. In the Phase 2 program, we did not observe autoimmune phenomena. Obviously, this is something we are tracking, but we have no clinical signal or indication of such concerns at this time. Likewise, your question regarding interferon gamma would imply risk, for example, for infections. That's also something that we did not see at a greater rate in treated patients than placebo in the Phase 2 program. These are things that we will follow, they're followed routinely for almost all cytokine inhibition programs. But to date, we have not had signal. Yes, Salveen, thanks for the question. Very, very excited about this small molecule. If you step back, I think, it represents what we had hoped to see in the BiTE platform and substantial clinical effects in a major solid tumor. To put the data in the context in comparison to a Phase 1, as noted, we substantially exceeded the 23% response rate that we reported in Phase 1. We are planning to present these data at a Fall Conference on embargoed in terms \u2013 of course, in terms of providing more specifics. But I can tell you that it couldn't be more pleased with the response rate data, the duration of response, and overall survival. For context in patients with small cell lung cancer in the third-line response rates are typically well under 50%, but importantly, they are vanishingly brief in most instances, often a matter of weeks or a few months. And so, based on what we're observing, I think we really have a chance to change the natural history of this disease, particularly as we march towards earlier lines of therapy where the activity of the BiTE in a lower tumor disease burden setting should be enhanced as we have observed with BLINCYTO. So all of our efforts now are focused on executing earlier line trials. So, this is one to I think pay attention to as we go forward and we're really looking forward to presenting these results this fall. I'm sorry. And in terms of the safety, I think we have learned a lot in the development program about the clinical management here. We're quite pleased with the rates of principal side effects, like cytokine release syndrome and we're \u2013 we'll look forward to sharing those details as well when we present the data this fall. But exceptionally happy with the tolerability and safety profile as well. Yes. What I can say Umer, without getting into specifics on the number being under embargo is that I'm very happy with the overall \u2013 the efficacy package \u2013 overall response rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, and overall survival. And we'll have presentation of all of those data at an upcoming medical Congress. But to me this is \u2013 it's a very, very compelling efficacy package."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. We're pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Growing volumes by 11% increasing investment in research and development and delivering 8% year over year non-GAAP EPS growth. This drives our confidence in delivering against our 2023 objectives and keeps us in position to meet or beat our longer term commitments. I'll review our second quarter results before discussing our 2023 guidance. As a reminder, these results and outlook reflect Amgen on a standalone basis without any adjustments for the announced Horizon acquisition. Turning to our second quarter financial results, which are shown on Slide 41, total revenues of $7.0 billion grew 6% year-over-year and represent the highest quarterly revenues in Amgen's history. Product sales increased 8% while total revenues increased 7% year-over-year, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Second quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 7% year-over-year. We invested in and advanced our pipeline and accelerated growth across our priority marketed products, while delivering a non-GAAP operating margin as a percent of product sales of 52.6%, demonstrating expense discipline. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting growing investments in our pipeline, driven by higher spending on late stage programs and marketed product support. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 2.4 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 17.1%, primarily driven by higher profit shares and a changes in product mix. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses in the second quarter decreased 6% year-over-year. We continue to focus on our continuous improvement operating model, prioritizing investments, digitalization and driving productivity and beginning and in other cases continuing. What we have already started historically to execute in any number of uses of artificial intelligence. Non-GAAP other income and expenses were a net $307 million expense in the second quarter. This year-over-year favorability was driven primarily by the change in Beijing accounting from equity methods to a mark-to-market investment with the impact included only in our GAAP results. As expected, our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate increased 1.7 percentage points to 16.4%, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change that replaced the excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue our priority investments in the best innovation, both internal and external innovation. In Q2, we drove higher spend in late stage programs, such as AMG 133 an olpasiran as well as support for our marketed products, including [indiscernible] Second, we continue investing in our business. Capital expenditures are at near peak levels driven by simultaneous construction of our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. We expect our annual capital expenditures to begin to decline starting in 2024 with the completion and licensing of our Ohio plant and capital expenditures will then begin to return closer to historical levels over the coming years. And third, we plan to continue to return capital to our shareholders. We pay dividends of $2.13 per share in the second quarter, representing a 10% increase over the second quarter of 2022. The company generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow in the second quarter of 2023 versus $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the timing of tax payments and includes higher interest income and higher operating income. We expect strong cash flow for the remainder of the year, consistent with our full year 2023 financial outlook and includes a non-GAAP operating margin of roughly 50%. Now turning to the outlook for the business for 2023 on Slide 43. Our guidance is currently provided on the Amgen standalone business and does not include any Horizon projections. As the Horizon transaction is expected to close by mid-December, resulting contributions from Horizon would be included after that period. Given our strong performance, we are raising our 2023 revenue guidance to $26.6 billion to $27.4 billion versus previous guidance of $26.2 billion to $27.3 billion. Although our results give us confidence to raise our full year guidance, we expect the third quarter sales maybe lower compared to the second quarter, due to the impact of the Medicare donut hole, which is more pronounced in the second half of the year, and also to certain favorable changes to estimated sales deductions in the second quarter. Regarding our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance, we intend to increase investments in our internal innovation and priority marketed products from a position of strength, given the acceleration in our business and our pipeline, reflecting our improved revenue outlook along with our investment plans we are revising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $17.80 to $18.80 versus previous guidance of $17.60 to $18.70. Again, although our results give us confidence to raise our full year non-GAAP EPS, we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS to be lower compared to the second quarter, resulting from the expected Q3 sales and our investments in the business. Important additional points to consider as you model the remainder of 2023, we now project full year Neulasta sales of approximately $800 million and full year combined KANJINT and MVASI sales of approximately $900 million. We now expect other revenue for 2023 to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion versus our prior range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. Note that our third quarter 2022 results included about $90 million of other revenue related to our COVID antibody manufacturing agreement and the milestone we earned that we do not expect to repeat in the third quarter of 2023. We anticipate full year non-GAAP operating expense for 2023 to increase by closer to 3% versus last year compared to our previous estimate of a 1% increase with higher cost of sales from projected increase sales, additional investments driving our innovative pipeline and increase support for our growing priority marketed products, including Repatha and Otezla. We continue to expect a full year 2023 operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50%, although will vary in each of the remaining two quarters. We continue to expect non-GAAP cost to sales as the percentage of product sales will be between 16% and 17%. We now expect our non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2023 to increase about 5% year-over-year, which is higher than our prior guidance of 3% to 4%. We continue to expect non-GAAP SG&A spend to be slightly down year-over-year as a percentage of product sales. We now expect non-GAAP other income and expenses to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion down from the prior guidance of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. For the full year, we anticipate a non-GAAP tax rate of 17.5% to 18.5% down from prior guidance of 18.0% to 19.0%. We expect Q3 tax rate to be near the upper end of the revised range of 17.5% to 18.5%. Our capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at approximately $925 million in 2023. Our confidence is strong in the long-term outlook and long-term growth for Amgen, and we look forward to completing the announced acquisition of Horizon by mid-December as Bob indicated. I'm incredibly grateful to our 24,000 plus colleagues for successfully executing on our mission of serving patients in the second quarter and beyond. This concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Bob for Q&A."

            "content": "Thanks, Bob. I am very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, fueled by a commitment to deliver on our mission to bring innovative products to millions of patients globally. Execution is strong across the business with record quarterly sales for nine brands and robust volume growth across our general medicine, inflammation and hematology-oncology portfolios. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, second quarter global product sales grew 8% year-over-year. Including the impact of foreign exchange product sales increased 6% year-over-year. Volume growth was 11% with strength across our regions. U.S. volume growth was 9%. And volume growth in our Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Canada region was 8%. And consistent with our international expansion strategy, Asia-Pacific continues to be our fastest growing region with 46% volume growth in the quarter. Starting with our general medicines business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY, Aimovig. Overall revenue for these four products grew 19% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by 21% volume growth. Cardiovascular disease is a growing public health crisis and the state of care for high risk ASCVD patients with elevated LDL cholesterol is poor. Family heart, real world analysis of 38 million high risk Americans revealed that fewer than 30% of them ever reached their recommended LDL levels. This is a clear call to action that lowering LDL cholesterol as much and as early as possible with Repatha will reduce cardiovascular risk for patients. And so to meet this need, I'm Amgen is committed to improving patient's ease of access and affordability. Today we have best-in-class formulary coverage for Repatha helping 90% of eligible U.S. patients gain access to this important medicine. Improved access is enabling broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. So, this has set the stage for growth for Repatha sales, which increased 30% year-over-year to a record $424 million in the second quarter. In the U.S. volume growth of 34% was driven by a record number of new patients starting treatment. Outside the U.S. we saw 37% volume growth with momentum across our regions. We recognize there are still many more patients around the world who can benefit from Repatha. And to meet that challenge, we are increasing investment to intensify our engagement with healthcare providers, bring our message directly to patients through direct-to-consumer media and drive urgency around LDLC testing and adherence to treatment guidelines. Transitioning to bone health, Prolia sales grew 11% year-over-year to a record $1 billion in second quarter driven by 11% volume growth. As Dave will discuss in more detail new real-world evidence data presented at the World Congress on Osteoporosis in May demonstrates the Prolia significantly reduces fracture risk across multiple endpoints when compared to alendronate. Our sales teams are now equipped with these data and are actively helping physicians understand the superior ability of Prolia to reduce the risk of fracture for their osteoporosis patients. EVENITY, which compliments Prolia in our bone portfolio, had record sales of $281 million for the quarter driven by strong volume growth across markets. In Japan, EVENITY had achieved a 42% share of the growing bone builder market, steadily increasing performance versus competitors and increasing initiation for nai\u0308ve patients. EVENITY sales are now annualizing at over $1 billion. Given the severe impact of fractures on the lives of women who are post-menopausal our success in Japan, the first launch market for EVENITY enhances our confidence in the significant growth potential through this decade. Otezla sales increased 1% year-over-year driven by 2% volume growth. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well-positioned to help the more than 1.5 million systemic nai\u0308ve U.S. patients with milder psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical treatment and can benefit from a systemic drug like Otezla. Our U.S. Otezla business has been impacted by free drug programs for newly launched topical and systemic competitors. And we expect new patient demand will continue to be affected by these programs for the remainder of 2023. Despite this, we see a compelling opportunity to invest in growth of Otezla and to drive increased awareness amongst physicians and patients. We are confident in the growth potential of Otezla given its unique combination of established efficacy and safety profile, broad payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and a lack of testing required for initiation, and of course, ease of administration. Enbrel sales grew 84% quarter-over-quarter following the seasonal impact on price and large drawdown of inventory during the first quarter in the U.S. Year-over-year, Enbrel sales increased 2% driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and higher net selling price partially offset by lower inventory levels. Although year-over-year volume was flat in the second quarter, the number of new patients in the U.S. starting treatment increased by 6%, driven by improved payer coverage. For the remainder of 2023 we expect this improved coverage will lead to continued growth in new patients. We also expect declining net selling price on a full year basis. Test buyer continues to show robust growth with $133 million in sales in the second quarter. Sales increased 39% sequentially driven by 37% volume growth that benefited from the introduction or self-administered, pre-filled, single-use pen approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the first quarter. The pen offers patients a convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home, which improves accessibility and provides more flexibility and treatment options for all patients in the U.S. with severe, uncontrolled asthma. Sales of TAVNEOS were $30 million in the second quarter. U.S. volumes grew 28% quarter-over-quarter driven by an increase in new patients starting treatment. In the U.S. approximately 2000 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 1300 healthcare providers. Looking forward, Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence will allow us to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with ANCA associated vasculitis. AMJEVITA sales increased 29% year-over-year for the second quarter, driven by 60% volume growth partially offset by lower inventory levels and net selling price. U.S. sales decreased 63% sequentially driven by inventory drawdowns after stocking to support a launch in the first quarter, partially offset by volume growth. Moving to our hematology and oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. Strong commercial execution and exciting new clinical data drove 12% volume growth year-over-year for these six innovative products. BLINCYTO sales grew 48% year-over-year with adoption across academic community and pediatric centers. Following positive data from the registration enabling E1910 study presented in December of 2022, an updated NCCN guidelines that were issued in May. Both the positive data and the updated guidelines support our confidence in the continued growth potential for BLINCYTO. Vectibix sales increased 20% year-over-year for the second quarter, driven by 20% volume growth supported by promotion of positive data from the Phase 3 PARADIGM trial demonstrating the superiority of Vectibix over bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for patients with wild-type RAS, colorectal cancer. KYPROLIS grew 9% year-over-year driven by 15% volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling price. And LUMAKRAS reported $77 million of sales for the second quarter. Year-over-year sales were flat in the quarters. 20% volume growth was offset by lower net selling price and inventory levels. We see future growth opportunity for LUMAKRAS driven by launches in new markets and our comprehensive global clinical development program. Our execution is strong across the business driving growth and exemplifying our dedication to serving patients. Our business is performing at the very high level and with the announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics, we have the potential to serve many more patients who can benefit from our decades of leadership in inflammation and nephrology. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave Reese. Yes. From our vantage point, Mike, what we see is strong execution by the Horizon team in the U.S. and there's several catalysts for growth here. They've already expanded their commercial footprint, and so that should start to take traction. They have the data now for the low CAS patient population with the positive results from that trial in public domain, not yet published, but in public domain having been presented and in hand with their sales forces. So that's very recent and not reflected necessarily in their historical performance. Bob mentioned the international market launches. We continue to believe post-close, we will be able to help accelerate the work being done there. We're also seeing some improved medical policies being issued prior to the new calendar year and so that's very encouraging to see payers improve or remove restrictions, I should say, on the use of TEPEZZA for the lower CAS patient population. So there are many good catalysts, and what I see is horizon systematically unlocking those additional opportunities for growth, and we remain quite bullish on TEPEZZA's utility across a very large population of thyroid eye disease patients who would benefit from that treatment given the clinical data. The last thing, I should mention on TEPEZZA is they also were able to replicate the low cast population results in OPTIC-J, in their OPTIC-J trial. Sorry, they're not the low cast, but the registrational data for thyroid eye disease in OPTIC-J. So that sets them up well for future potential launch in Japan. So really good data flow, really good execution and investment and focus here. And look beyond TEPEZZA. We also remain very, very excited about their other two large inline brands with KRYSTEXXA and obviously UPLIZNA. So overall, we remain excited and confident that the two companies working together on this really strong portfolio will be a good parent. Sure. Thank you for the question, Chris. We're obviously very early innings still in this biosimilar market with AMJEVITA, and we're seeing clearly what is new payer behavior in light of such a large product having biosimilar competition. With respect to the high versus the low, we're \u2013 it's kind of a different mix. We see mostly the high in PBM utilization and the low in the IDN utilization where the low cost \u2013 low net cost is attractive to them. But again, it's very early in the product mix, I don't think has settled out yet between those two SKUs. I would also say that we are still waiting to see what happens in the next payer negotiation cycle going into 2024. As you've seen many of the PBMs are on record as saying that they haven't done a whole lot in terms of driving utilization of biosimilars in 2023, but plan to do more of that in 2024. So I think there's a lot more to follow here. And with respect to AbbVie strategy, look, we compete against them in the innovative site and we now compete against them with our biosimilar, and we know their practices well. So not a lot of surprises there, but I think the \u2013 I think that the clarity of how pharmacy benefit works with biosimilar uptake, or lack thereof is becoming clear to us and to other biosimilar manufacturers and other onlookers. So more to follow there. I would say though, we remain very excited about the growth of biosimilars in the longer term. We continue \u2013 as Dave mentioned, we continue to commit research investment in the development of additional biosimilars with most recently with the initiation of ABP 206, a biosimilar to OPDIVO. We also are continuing to look at being able to launch other biosimilars in the medical benefit reimbursement system in the U.S. and that's where we were successful, obviously with KANJINTI and MVASI in our previous launches. So going forward, the majority of our biosimilar growth will come from ex-U.S. and U.S. medical benefit biosimilars. And we continue to believe we'll be able to generate strong growth. Having previously said that we would more than double our 2021 annual sales of roughly $2 billion. Okay. And on horizon, Umer, you're right, we remain enthusiastic about proceeding on the basis of the deal that we announced. I would take issue at least with our perspective is different from what was implicit in your question, but we'll leave that for another day."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks Evan. We're \u2013 so a couple reasons to target steep one. Number one it's almost universally expressed on advanced cancer cells. There is not e extensive high level normal tissue expression, so that allows you to generate the therapeutic window that we're always looking for with bispecific T-cell engagers. PSMA has been a challenging target. There appear to be unique properties with that target. As I think you're aware, multiple molecules including some of our own have gone into and then fallen out of clinical development. And I've come to the belief that that maybe in part target related. So steep one is a relatively novel target, we are in the clinic, I think are far advanced compared to anyone else. And based on the clinical data that we're seeing now, this is a program we really want to accelerate. This is another one of the programs where, we'll be presenting data this fall and either urge you to put [indiscernible] under the radar screen and pay attention to those data; but this one I think has a real opportunity."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speakers prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood. You may now begin.\nArvind Sood: Thank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2023. Strong unit volume growth that sets up the stage nicely for improved outlook for the balance of the year. These are some of the key themes that you're going to hear about today. Our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, will lead the call with some prepared remarks, followed by a broader review of our performance by other members of our leadership team. You should have received a link to our slides that we have posted. Through the course of our discussion today, we'll make some forward-looking statements and use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and just a reminder that actual results can vary materially. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and let me thank all of you for joining our call. I'll begin by calling your attention to the 14% volume growth we delivered in the first quarter. That illustrates two points worth keeping in mind when thinking about the remainder of the year and beyond. First, on the COVID front seem to have finally turned the page on the pandemic in terms of its impact on the overall health care system. For example, we've seen year-over-year prescription growth across most specialties in the US, including cardiology and oncology, and that's good news because it suggests that patients are returning to their pre-pandemic routines with doctor visits once again enabling appropriate diagnoses and treatments. It's obviously something that bodes well for our portfolio of medicines. Second, we're seeing that the demand for medicines is resilient despite the current macroeconomic challenges. Repatha, EVENITY , BLINCYTO and KYPROLIS, for example, all delivered record sales in the quarter, driven by extremely strong growth in volumes of 33%, 55%, 49% and 18% respectively. We don't see this volume driven growth as a single quarter phenomenon either, rather we see this as the potential for these medicines and others in our portfolio to reach many more patients over time and contribute substantially to our long-term growth. Take Repatha. We believe there's tremendous upside opportunity for Repatha at a time when most high risk cardiovascular patients still never reach their recommended LDL levels or do so only for a brief insufficient period of time. The global public health crisis and heart disease demands that all players in the system work together to drive change, and with Repatha, we've proven we have a proven innovation that we know can be an essential part of the solution. Two of our newest medicines, TEZSPIRE and TAVNEOS achieved quarter-over-quarter volume growth in the US of 28% and 27% respectively. TEZSPIRE has enjoyed strong adoption in the US by both allergists and pulmonologists and recently approved, excuse me, a recently approved pre-filled pen gives patients the option for self-administration. A few quarters into our ownership of TAVNEOS, we are convinced that our deep experience in rheumatology and nephrology will enable us to bring this first-in-class medicine to many more patients who can benefit from it. Outside the US, volumes grew more than 20% in the quarter. In the Asia-Pacific region in particular, we generated nearly 50% volume growth, as we expand the number of patients we serve in Japan and China, two of the world's most rapidly ageing nations with medicines like Repatha and Prolia. Amgen's R&D investment was up 12% in the quarter. That growth reflects the investments we are making in registration enabling trials for several potential new first-in-class medicines, including Olpasiran in heart disease, Rocatinlimab in inflammation and bemarituzumab and tarlatamab in cancer. All four of these medicines are quintessentially Amgen. Innovative molecules that deliver large effect sizes against serious diseases for which new treatments are very much needed. We are pursuing a number of significant new indications for TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO and LUMAKRAS as well. We look forward to several data readouts from our pipeline, mainly in the second half of the year. We continue to invest heavily in early research where we've built a differentiated set of capabilities over the past decade that position us well to take advantage of the rapid convergence of biology and technology that we see happening today. At a time when the world marvels at ChatGPT, we've been deploying artificial intelligence and machine learning in our research labs for some time now, giving us dry lab capabilities that, when applied to biologics development, have already yielded proof success rates and reduced cycle times beyond our initial expectations. This is indeed an exciting time for biologic innovation. We remain optimistic about our announced acquisition of Horizon and similar to our experience with TAVNEOS, the more time we've spent with the team at Horizon, the more excited we've become about the potential to bring Amgen's capabilities and global presence to bear on Horizon's portfolio of first-in-class innovative medicines and its pipeline. It's an exciting time for all of us at Amgen, and the demand for innovative medicines is proven to be resilient and growing around the world. At the same time that our ability to innovate has never been greater. Always, I'm grateful to my Amgen colleagues around the world for their commitment to patients and to our business. Now, let me turn it over to Murdo.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Bob. We kicked off 2023 with strong execution of our mission to bring innovative products to millions of patients globally. We saw record sales for ten brands in the first quarter with strong volume gains across our general medicine and hematology oncology growth brands. Our inflammation therapeutic area expanded with the US launch of AMGEVITA and the growth of TEZSPIRE and TAVNEOS and our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will soon add several important medicines to our portfolio. Volume growth in the first quarter was 14%, with 10% growth in the US and 22% growth outside the US. Asia-Pacific continues to be our fastest growing region with 47% volume growth in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange first quarter global product sales grew 4%, including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact. Product sales increased 2% year-over-year. Starting with our general medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY and Aimovig. Overall, revenue for these four products grew 13% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by 19% volume growth. Cardiovascular disease is a growing public health crisis. In the US someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds and we know LDLC is a major risk factor for heart attack or stroke. However, the state of care for high risk ASCVD patients with elevated LDL cholesterol is shockingly poor. However, we have recently released a real world analysis from the FH foundation of 38 million high risk Americans showing that fewer than 30% of them ever reached their recommended LDL levels. These statistics emphasize the importance of therapies like Repatha to address the significant medical need and we're pleased that more and more patients are now benefiting from Repatha and with volume growth of 33% in the first quarter leading to an increase in sales of 18%. Price erosion also slowed in the first quarter and declined less than prior year. In the US, volume growth of 32% was driven by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. Outside the US, we saw 34% volume growth with strong momentum across our international business. There's clearly more work to be done to address this cardiovascular health crisis. This March at the American College of Cardiology, we convened the first ever annual LDLC Action Summit to address the state of cardiovascular care in the US by identifying strategies and delivering solutions to improve lipid management among the highest risk ASCVD patients. By intensifying the focus on lowering LDLC, a coalition of leading stakeholders in cardiovascular care have come together with Amgen to unite on a bold goal. By 2030, our ambition is to have the number of cardiovascular events in the US. We are confident that Repatha will play an important role in achieving this ambition. Transitioning to bone health. Prolia sales grew 9% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by 8% volume growth. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bond portfolio had record sales of $254 million for the quarter, primarily driven by strong volume growth across markets. Now to our inflammation portfolio. OTEZLA volume increased 5% in the quarter. Sales decreased 13% year-over-year, driven by lower inventory levels and price declines resulting from patient and payer mix. Additional rebates were also provided to improve the quality of coverage. Growth of our US OTEZLA business has been impacted by free drug programs for newly launched topical and systemic competitors and we expect new patient demand will continue to be impacted by these programs throughout 2023. Longer term, we see strong growth potential for OTEZLA given its established efficacy and safety profile. Strong payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and ease of administration. OTEZLA remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the more than 1.5 million systemic naive US patients with milder psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical and can benefit from a systemic treatment like OTEZLA. Enbrel volumes in the US increased 1% in the quarter, supported by improved payer coverage. Several important factors to consider when reflecting on Enbrel performance in the quarter. Global sales decreased 33% year-over-year, driven by declines in net selling price, lower inventory levels compared to previous years and a 9% unfavorable impact of changes to estimated sales deductions related to prior periods. Going forward, we expect low-single digit volume growth throughout 2023 lower year-over-year declines in net selling price and a gradual recovery in inventory levels. The TEZSPIRE launch is progressing well with $96 million in sales in the first quarter, driven by strong adoption in the US by allergists and pulmonologists. TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated profile offers broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe, uncontrolled asthma without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations. During the first quarter, the US Food and Drug Administration approved TEZSPIRE for self-administration in a prefilled single use pen, which offers patients the convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home. This improves accessibility and provides more flexibility in treatment options for all patients in the United States. Sales of TAVNEOS were $23 million in the first quarter. US volumes grew 27% quarter-over-quarter, driven by an increase in new patients starting treatment. In the US TAVNEOS has now been prescribed to over 1700 patients, confirming our belief that Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence allows us to bring TAVNEOS to more patients with ANCA associated vasculitis. In the first quarter, AMGEVITA launched as the first US biosimilar to HUMIRA, a medicine used by more than 1 million patients living with serious inflammatory diseases. We saw the first prescriptions to patients being fulfilled this quarter and we're encouraged by the high awareness of AMGEVITA among gastroenterologists and rheumatologists. With our track record of developing and manufacturing biologics and decades of experience in inflammation, Amgen is uniquely equipped to patients with this biosimilar medicine. Looking ahead, we expect Q2 AMGEVITA sales in the US to be lower than Q1 sales is a majority of our US AMGEVITA sales in the first quarter stemmed from inventory build. Moving to our hematology and oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. Sales and volume for these six innovative products grew 21% year-over-year for the quarter, with KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO achieving record quarterly sales. Growth in our hematology and oncology business was supported by important new clinical data. BLINCYTO sales grew 41% in the first quarter, supported by strong adoption across academic and community centers, following positive data from the registration enabling E1910 study presented in December of 2022. Vectibix sales increased 16% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by 15% volume growth supported by positive data from the Phase 3 paradigm trial demonstrating the superiority of Vectibix over bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy. KYPROLIS continued its strong trajectory with 25% growth in the quarter driven by 18% volume growth. LUMAKRAS reported $74 million in sales in the first quarter and a 19% increase year-over-year, driven by 40% volume growth partially offset by lower net selling price. Outside the US, LUMAKRAS has been approved in 50 countries and we're actively launching in over 30 markets and pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 27% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by lower net selling price. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares in the US. We expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines driven by increased competition. Over time we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. Given the strong performance of our hematology and oncology portfolio and the recent positive data on BLINCYTO and VECTIBI as well as ongoing clinical development of LUMAKRAS and our oncology pipeline. I look forward to the future growth potential of this portfolio. As we close out this first quarter of 2023, I'm pleased with our strong execution across our portfolio both in the US and internationally. And with that, I'll turn it to Dave.\nDavid Reese: Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. For R&D, last quarter was one of high quality execution as we progressed our innovative pipeline with multiple registration enabling studies on track. In general medicine, we advanced our cardiovascular franchise in emerging portfolio of obesity molecules with a focus on clinical execution. Let's start with Olpasiran. Phase 3 outcome study in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is enrolling well. In March, we presented additional data demonstrating that Olpasiran markedly reduced Lp(a) concentration irrespective of baseline levels in individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and Lp(a) levels greater than 150 nanomoles per liter. We also initiated the African-American heart study in collaboration with the Association of Black Cardiologists and the Morehouse School of Medicine. This study will measure the association between Lp(a) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in 5000 African-American individuals. African-Americans show a higher average Lp(a) concentration than white individuals, but Lp(a) research to date has primarily been conducted in those of European descent. We are collaborating on the African-American Heart Study to bridge this gap. Turning to obesity, we are rapidly enrolling a Phase 2 study of AMG133in patients with obesity with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The study will investigate different dosing levels and regimens with the overall goal of generating data that will provide broad optionality to design a Phase 3 program that will deliver strong, sustainable weight loss. A Phase 1 trial of AMG 786, a small molecule targeting non-incretin pathways in obesity is enrolling patients. Multiple preclinical molecules, all with different mechanisms of action than GLP-1 or GIPR based therapies are also advancing towards the clinic. In inflammation beyond severe asthma, we are investigating multiple additional indications with TEZSPIRE, including separate Phase 3 studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. We also have two Phase 2 studies, one in chronic spontaneous urticaria and the other in COPD. The CSU study is complete with top line data anticipated in mid-2023. The COPD trial is fully enrolled and has recruited a broad population of COPD patients, including patients with both high and low eosinophil counts. Emerging evidence suggests that TSLP is involved in chronic inflammatory disorders, including COPD and that TSLP may be a key driver of the severe exacerbations experienced by COPD patients. We look forward to the readout of this study in the first half of 2024. Rocatinlimab potentially first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Recruitment is off to a strong start on the ROCKET Phase 3 clinical development program. This program is a suite of seven studies that will establish safety and efficacy in a broad population of patients with atopic dermatitis, including biologic naive, biologic or JAK experienced, diverse ethnic groups and adolescents and also testing different dosing regimens, including the potential for monthly or less frequent dosing. We were encouraged to see Horizon report on the statistically significant and clinically meaningful top line results from a Phase 4 clinical trial of TEPEZZA. As revised FDA label states TEPEZZA is indicated for the treatment of thyroid eye disease regardless of clinical activity score or disease duration. Phase 2b studies in systemic lupus erythematosus of rozibafusp alfa and efavaleukin alfa were stopped for futility. These studies utilize novel adaptive designs, which enabled us to generate decision making data more quickly, and cost effectively. SLE remains a challenging area for drug development, one that will be an area of focus for us as we further explore these data sets to advance our knowledge in the field. In addition to our organic pipeline, we look forward to incorporating the Horizon molecules upon deal close to further enhance our efforts to address inflammatory disease. In oncology. global regulatory submissions are planned in the second half of 2023 for E1910, a Phase three trial led by the ECOG ACRIN Cooperative Group, demonstrating that addition of BLINCYTO to standard of care consolidation, chemotherapy significantly increased overall survival versus standard of care in MRD negative adult patients with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL. Beyond this study, we are investing to move BLINCYTO into earlier lines of treatment and to improve patient convenience through subcutaneous administration. DeLLphi-304, a Phase 3 study comparing tarlatamab, BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 with standard of care chemotherapy in second line small cell lung cancer will be initiated this month. We'll have top line data from a potentially registrational Phase 2 study of tarlatamab and heavily pretreated patients with small cell lung cancer in the second half of 2023, potential milestone for patients with small cell lung cancer. As you are aware, we are exploring novel combinations with LUMAKRAS. Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in third line colorectal cancer is fully enrolled with data readout anticipated in the second half of 2023. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS and chemotherapy in first line non-small cell lung cancer in PDL-1 negative patients. At ASCO, data will be presented from studies of LUMAKRAS in combination with standard of care, chemotherapy and non-small cell lung cancer and in combination with Vectibix and standard of care chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. We also completed submission of the LUMAKRAS code break 200 data along with data from the Phase 2 dose comparison Substudy to the US FDA and to the European Medicines Agency or EMA. For AMG 509, a steep one targeting bispecific now named Xaluritamig. We have determined target doses and open monotherapy expansion cohorts in patients with advanced prostate cancer. We look forward to sharing initial data in the second half of 2023. To add to our growing biosimilars portfolio, we are pleased to announce that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for BEKEMV our biosimilar to SOLIRIS. BEKEMV is the first biosimilar to SOLIRIS approved by the EC and is approved only for the treatment of adults and children with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or PNH, a rare life threatening bone marrow disorder. We have also submitted the US Biologics license application to the FDA for this product. Additionally, Phase 3 switching study to support an interchangeability designation in the US using an investigational high concentration formulation of AMGEVITA met its primary endpoint of similarity for the primary pharmacokinetics endpoints. In conclusion, I would like to thank Amgen staff around the world for their relentless focus on execution as we work hard to meet the needs of the patients we serve. I'll now turn things over to Peter.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Dave. We're pleased with our execution and remain on track to deliver against our full year 2023 and longer term objectives driven again by strong 14% volume growth across a number of products including Repatha, EVENITY, BLINCYTO, TEZSPIRE and TAVNEOS. While we advance our late stage pipeline and work to complete the acquisition of Horizon by the end of June. We continue to invest for long-term growth. I'll review our first quarter results before discussing our 2023 guidance. As a reminder, these results and outlook reflect Amgen on a standalone basis without any adjustments for the announced Horizon acquisition. Turning to our first quarter financial results, which are shown on slide 38 of the slide deck. Total revenue at $6.1 billion declined 2% year-over-year. However, excluding the 2% negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, product sales increased 4% and total revenues were unchanged versus the first quarter of 2022. The four percentage point difference was due to an expected decrease in other revenue due to lower profit and cost sharing from our COVID-19 collaboration with Lilly. First quarter product sales are seasonally the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year due to benefit plan changes, insurance re-verification and increased co-pay expenses. In our first quarter, product sales increased 2% year-over-year, driven by 14% volume growth, partially offset by 5% lower net selling price, 3% unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, 2% lower inventory levels and the 2% impact of FX rates previously mentioned. First quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year, driven by investments in research and development. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter increased 12% year-over-year, with higher spending and later stage program support. Discovery research and early pipeline and marketed product support. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 0.8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 17.4%, primarily due to changes in product mix and higher profit share expense. Now, recall that cost of sales in the first quarter was impacted by a portion of the $125 million of Puerto Rico excise tax. That was previously capitalized to inventory with the residual impact expected in the second quarter. Non-GAAP G&A expenses in the first quarter increased 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments, digitalization and driving productivity. Non-GAAP OI&E benefited from higher interest income and approximately 110 million of gains from deleveraging related to the repurchase of a portion of our debt portfolio. Also recall we now mark-to-market our investment in Beijing with the impact included on our GAAP income statement. In the first quarter, this resulted in a GAAP only pre-tax gain of about $1.9 billion. As expected, our first quarter non-GAAP tax rate increased 3.7 percentage points to 17.8%, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change that replaced the excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023 as well as increased interest expense on our existing tax reserves. We are committed to our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue our investments in internal and external innovation that drive our long-term growth. Our increased spending and non-GAAP R&D of 12% in Q1 '23 over Q1 '22, coupled with our acquisition of TAVNEOS and our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will further broaden and strengthen our portfolio of first-in-class and best-in-class therapeutics to deliver to more patients globally. Second, we continue investing in our business to further long-term growth. Capital expenditures are at near peak levels, driven by simultaneous construction of our state of the art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. We expect our annual capital expenditures to decline starting in 2024 with the completion and licensing of our Ohio plant. And third, we continue to return capital to our shareholders as we pay dividends of $2.13 per share in the first quarter. This represented a 10% increase over that paid in each of 2022 four quarters. Free cash flow for the quarter was driven lower by the timing of sales rebates and incentives, lower operating income and higher capital expenditures from the building out of the state-of-the-art facilities in North Carolina and Ohio. We expect strong cash flow for the remainder of the year consistent with our full year 2023 financial outlook that includes a non-GAAP operating margin of roughly 50%. We expect sequential growth in our free cash flow in the second quarter, although there may be an impact to Q2 and free cash flow from the expected closing of the Horizon acquisition due to the accounting treatment of certain items that were all expected in our Horizon acquisition financing and estimated deal costs as well as our previously announced restructuring in the first quarter. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2023 on slide 40. Our guidance is currently provided on the Amgen standalone business and does not include any Horizon projections. We are raising our 2023 guidance. We're raising our 2023 revenue guidance to $26.2 billion to $27.3 billion versus previous guidance of $26.0 billion to $27.2 billion. This reflects our confidence in the underlying business and the improving overall market conditions for our patients to access our medicines that Bob and Murdo mentioned. We are also raising our 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $17.60 to $18.70 versus previous guidance of $17.40 per share to $18.60 per share. Let me mention a few more important considerations as you model the remainder of '23. For product sales, we project solid volume growth at a portfolio level and consistent with the first quarter. We expect a mid-single digit price decline for our portfolio in 2023. We now project full year Neulasta sales of approximately $700 million and full year combined KANJINT and MVASI sales of approximately 850 million. We anticipate full year non-GAAP operating expenses to increase by about 1% over last year. We expect the 2023 operating margin as a percent of product sales to be roughly 50% and expect our second quarter operating margin to also be roughly 50%. And we also expect cost of sales as a percentage of product sales to be between 16% and 17%. Non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2023 to remain unchanged and estimated to increase 3% to 4% year over year. Non-GAAP spend is a percentage of product sales to slightly decrease year-over-year, driven by our ongoing digitalization, continuous improvement and productivity imperatives. We anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be in the range of 1.2 billion to 1.3 billion, reflecting the first quarter deleveraging related to the debt repurchases I mentioned. With the remainder of the year's R&D expense to be evenly split over the remaining three quarters. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18% to 19%. We plan to continue to meaningfully increase our dividend. We continue to expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2023. Our capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at approximately 925 million in 2023. Our confidence is strong and the long-term outlook for Amgen and our long-term growth. We look forward to completing the announced acquisition of Horizon. We expect to provide updated guidance as appropriate after the transaction closes. Many thanks as always to our 24,000 plus dedicated colleagues all over the world executing each day on behalf of our patients and our future patients. That concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Bob for Q&A.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Peter. All right, Julianne, if you could remind our callers of the process for asking a question. I know they've had a long day already, so ask them to hold their questions to one each and do our best to get to everybody who has one for us.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. For TEZSPIRE you've highlighted the broad clinical program and given the Phase 2 data sets we're expecting this year and next year, could you just comment on the indications where you have the most confidence in. Thank you.\nBob Bradway: Reese, over to you.\nDavid Reese: Yeah, thanks, Salveen. All of the indications that we're pursuing have some mechanistic basis. Chronic spontaneous urticarial is an eosinophilic driven disease in part as is eosinophilic esophagitis. And given the mechanism of T-cell inhibition that underlay the thinking behind pursuing those indications. As I've mentioned briefly in COPD as another example, the -- there is accumulating evidence that triggers such as viral infection, smoke particles from pollutants can trigger TSLP release from bronchial epithelium. These are consistent with data showing that in patients with COPD, TSLP levels are elevated in sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and bronchial mucosa. And so as I mentioned that trial is fully enrolled. We expect a data readout, given the duration of therapy that one wants to see in these patients in the first half of next year. So I think there's good mechanistic basis. We're in clinical trial execution mode now and really waiting data readouts.\nOperator: Thank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Yee: Thank you. Following on the pipeline maybe for David. I think what's interesting is that you obviously had AMG 133 obesity data and now you are emphasizing AMG 786. And I think it's enrolling in treating people now. Can you just talk a little bit about why you'd be excited about that? Is that synergistic? Is there an angle with that to be excited about, given all of the things going on in obesity? Thank you.\nDavid Reese: I think what you said at the end there is very important, Mike, you know, in terms of everything that's going on in obesity. If we just step back for a second and think about what the magnitude of the problem is here, you know, there are hundreds of millions of patients now globally. We are doing an experiment in the 21st century that the world has never done by creating an obesity crisis. Now we call obesity a single disease, but it is clearly a complex, heterogeneous disorder. There are undoubtedly patient subsets buried within that. And different patients may well, you know, benefit from different therapies. This is an disorder that's rooted in human evolution and now is a function of our environment. And so our development program for both 133 and for the molecules that will follow behind really intends to capitalize on the fact that there's a very large volume of patients. It's a heterogeneous disorder. I think this is a field that is in its infancy and we have a chance to help define what those patient subsets are and who will benefit from specific therapies using, for example, you know, our industry leading database of multi-omic profiling, which we, you know, intend to employ aggressively in these development programs. You mentioned AMG 786, and I'll just conclude with a comment on that. That is a non-incretin based mechanism of action. And I think that is also an area that will be very fertile for drug development and it's a focus of us pre-clinically as well right now. So thanks for the question. It's early days, but we think that this is one of the big public health challenges of the current century.\nOperator: Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'm a little confused today about some of the numbers I'm looking at. So, for example, I mean, you know, well, Abbvie's Humira went biosimilar. You guys are the ones that launched it and AbbVie reported they're down 26% year-over-year. So I guess what I don't understand is how come Enbrel is down 33% year-over-year, more so than the company that did go biosimilar. And I think some of that speaks to a little bit of the inventory issues that are happening. And they seem quite significant. The more I think about the magnitude reported, for example, 21% drop on Enbrel and 28% drop on OTEZLA, which almost sounds like three weeks' worth of work down. I usually think of total inventory in the channel being about three weeks, so we'd love to get any clarity there. Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah, thanks, Umer. You're on to some of the fact pattern. Let me just go through kind of the elements of Enbrel specifically. First off, we were up 1% in volume in the quarter. So the leading indicators of Enbrel volume performance all look quite good. And that's a function of strong demand for the product in the market, good quality execution and an additional pharmacy benefit formulary win starting in January of the year. So we would expect continued low-single digit volume growth throughout the course of 2023. So that's the kind of high quality leading indicators of the volume performance of the product. The inventory component is pretty substantial. As you highlight, it is a function of both wholesaler inventory levels being down as well as specialty pharmacy. And I think it's partly a function of the fact that we did have volume increase and there was also a pretty significant work down through the quarter. We would expect those inventory levels to return to normal inventory levels throughout the course of the year. And then the last piece of Enbrel is an out-of-period adjustment, an unfavorable adjustment of about 9% related to prior period. And that's a function of things like state Medicaid, true ups coming in, as well as some other price adjustments from prior period. So overall, again, the leading indicators for Enbrel are good, low-single digit volume anticipated for the year, a little bit of price concession to get that formulary win. But then the other two events in the quarter are likely to improve over the course of the year as well being inventory and prior period adjustment.\nPeter Griffith: Maybe, Murdo, just to jump in quickly that prior period adjustment, I mean, that's an estimated sales tax sales deduction adjustment.\nMurdo Gordon: Thank you, Peter.\nPeter Griffith: So just to clarify that and as Murdo said, we're looking for a slowing year-over-year price erosion on that too. So we think we've got some trends in our favor here.\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah, there is a big piece of that prior period that's also PHS and given the program that we're running for PHS patients. We expect that to be a lower impact throughout the course of the year as well.\nOperator: Thank you, Umer. Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Raymond: Hey, thanks. I have a question on the biosimilar business. I'm not sure I heard this correctly or not, but from Murdo's comments, it sounds like Amgevita revenue might be fairly frontloaded given the inventory build that I think you guys described. I know you guys don't give quarterly granularity. But maybe talk about the outlook for the rest of the year, especially given that you have a bunch of other launches, other biosimilar launches happening in that specific space. And then maybe just more strategically, just given the expectations have been kind of tempered here with Amgevita, you guys still seem pretty committed to this business with SOLIRIS, EYLEA, STELARA launches. Just maybe talk about why these won't maybe see a similar tempering of expectations. Thanks.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. On Amgevita specifically, a lot of that Q1 revenue was what we would call buy-in from primarily IDNs. And so it's hard for us to see how much of that buy-in has been used up in actual prescription fill. So our conservative estimate is that the majority of that is buy-in and that Q2 could be lower than Q1 revenues based on that. So that's our estimate for Amgevita. Obviously, we're very early in the launch here. We're building demand physician by physician and patient by patient. And some of that IDN pull-through is not visible to us because they don't share data necessarily with the IQVIAs of the world. So that's Amgevita. But overall, we have been extremely successful in developing biosimilars at Amgen. We are very pleased with what we've been able to do so far by developing successful molecules that are either first or first wave launches. We continue to plan on being first or first wave in the biosimilar products that we're targeting. We have been able to continuously supply, thanks to the hard work of our manufacturing and supply chain colleagues around the world. When we approach both institutional customers, payers and providers, I think there's a lot of trust in the Amgen brand when it comes to the biosimilars that we manufacture. Certainly, last but not least, we do feel strongly that we will continue to be able to deliver on our 2x '21 sales by the end of the decade in our biosimilars business, so more than double our 2021 revenues. And we think we'll do that by continuing to launch both pharmacy benefit and medical benefit biosimilars, but the majority of that growth is going to be driven by medical benefit biosimilars. So still a very important part of our business, and the people that work on it continue to deliver value to the health care system as we move forward.\nBob Bradway: The only thing I'd add to that, Chris, is that we're running this business very efficiently, and we think when we look at the cash that we're generating on this business, we're earning an attractive return for our shareholders. So again, in order for us to continue to succeed in biosimilars, we need to execute effectively. And as you can see in the quarter with BEKEMV the progress and with the launch of Amgevita, we continue to do what we plan to do in biosimilars. And again, I would reiterate, we think we're earning an attractive return for our shareholders, some of those commitments.\nOperator: Thank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And my question is also related to biosimilar. Given that the demand so far doesn't look to be ticking up for Humira, and your comments about next quarter do not also suggest that it may be a slow launch here, do you think this would mean that you are losing the first mover advantage here? Or is there a way next year it could be more -- Amgevita could be more on a preferred side of formally rather than parity? Because it seems like parity is not cutting it just yet.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mohit. I think we've definitely taken advantage of the first mover, particularly with the IDN channel. That's really where a lot of the initial uptake will be. I think we're also differentiated versus the other biosimilar manufacturers that have biosimilars to Humira in that we do cover the customer base here quite effectively both in rheumatology and gastroenterology having deployed medical and sales teams that are out there right now building awareness and demand for Amgevita. Lastly, I would say that given that we've got parity access across the large three PBMs, we are in very good position to be able to pull through a lot of that Amgevita. I think we were clear in saying this would be a gradual uptake for this product. And we think that we still have been able to use the time that we have ahead of competition wisely to build that demand.\nOperator: Thank you, Mohit. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJay Olson: Thanks for taking questions. Curious about OTEZLA and how you expect -- pricing dynamics to evolve over the course of the year, especially in the context of sort of TYK2 mostly 3 drugs right now. And how do you expect the pricing for OTEZLA to evolve following the transition to TYK2 paid customers? Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thank you, Jay. I think what we're pleased with is the broad access coverage we have on Otezla, we have very good coverage. We did actually add additional coverage at the beginning of the year with United Optum Part D plan coming online. And so there's a little bit of price concession to do that in the year. But beyond that, we've got good stable access for 2023, and we look forward to being able to maintain that in 2024. So I don't see more decrement on price. In fact, we think price will -- the negative price effects you saw in Q1 should abate a little bit in Q2 and beyond. So overall very stable. The one thing that you mentioned that's interesting is the free goods program that competitors have out there. I do think that, that's a little bit of a disruption in the market right now that's probably causing a bit of softness in our new patient demand. We get about 80% of our new patient growth coming from systemic naive topical patients receiving OTEZLA as their first systemic agent. I think when you have free good programs in the market, sometimes that free goods is a very easy way for a prescriber to try a novel agent. And I think that, that's taking away some of that new patient growth that we're used to seeing. I do think that will be different once those competitors contract for their market access, and that's likely to be a 24% impact.\nOperator: Thank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nColin Bristow: Hey, good afternoon, and congrats on the quarter. So one for Murdo. We've now got the chronic TEPEZZA data. I just wondered, could you give us your thoughts on the -- and does this in any way change your view on the size of the commercial opportunity? And then a quick kind of housekeeping one on LUMAKRAS. How much of the weakness this quarter was sort of net pricing versus competition from Mirati? Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Colin. Maybe I could take a minute just on TEPEZZA because there are quite a few analysts on the call that would be unfamiliar with how the patient journey for thyroid eye disease actually works. And it's important because it has a bearing on the demand pattern for TEPEZZA. The way in which the Horizon team actually track the performance as they look at something called patient enrollment forms, which is the initial request, if you will, to start a thyroid eye disease patient on TEPEZZA. It then takes quite a while for that patient enrollment form to move its way through the prior authorization process against medical policies that payers have in place. That can take up to 90 days. Then you need to schedule that patient's first infusion. And in thyroid eye disease, it's not like in oncology where there's a clinical oncologist relatively evenly distributed throughout the country that can do infused drug administration. This is a lot more concentrated. And so it takes a while for the patient to be referred to the right site of care to receive their first infusion of TEPEZZA. So that also adds time. So while tracking the early leading indicator that we look at, which is patient enrollment form, there's quite a lag between that patient enrollment form starting and when that first infusion will occur. And that's really important to keep in mind when you see either flat or, in this case, I think strengthening demand for TEPEZZA in patient enrollment forms. That will take a while to flow through into net sales. So that would be my prefacing comment. Now besides that, I think we're really excited, as Dave said, about the chronic data that were recently announced. And my congratulations to the entire Horizon team for executing a high-quality trial and showing how TEPEZZA can benefit a broader cross-section of patients with lower clinical activity score and truly highlighting the need for chronic care in this category. So I think that's a fantastic accomplishment. I think the simultaneous label change is just a nod to the conviction that even the regulator has about the utility of this product and this disease. And then I think the Horizon team has spent a lot of time over the last few months expanding their commercial capabilities and their medical capabilities. And they're in really good shape to take this great new data, which is on label to providers and to payers and to help expand the use of that product in the U.S. So we're quite optimistic about the future growth of TEPEZZA. And then, of course, from our side, we're also excited about being able to launch TEPEZZA in other markets around the world once we close this transaction. We have the capabilities and the structure and the scale given that we've been expanding Amgen's footprint globally over the last several years. And so we're ready to go. And we'll work closely with Horizon to do that so that TEPEZZA has multiple opportunities to grow over time. On LUMAKRAS, just real quick. We did see a little bit of increased inventory in the fourth quarter of last year. So the year-on-year compare or quarter-on-quarter compare, I should say, is really more about that inventory coming through. The actual demand is pretty flat from Q4 to Q1. And so we've been able to hold on quite nicely despite competitors in the market.\nOperator: Thank you, Colin. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Please go ahead . Your line is open.\nBrendan Smith: Hey, guys. This is Brendan on for Yaron. Thanks very much for taking the question. Just another quick one, follow-up on TEZSPIRE. Maybe specifically in CSU. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of where you maybe see the bar for this midyear readout here? Our understanding is that the mast cells are really one of the key players in CSU? And if TSLP is maybe a bit of a broader target, how do you see its impact in the disease course? Just trying to kind of understand relative positioning here and maybe gauge expectations for the Phase 2 data. Thanks very much.\nDavid Reese: Yes. Thanks. Look, the trial is fully enrolled. We're bringing in data. I think within a few months, we're going to have the data set in hand. I think I've outlined mechanistically why TSLP being upstream could be one of the triggers that, if inhibited, could serve to -- as a therapy for the disease. At this point, I think it's really just getting the data set.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much or taking my questions. On OTEZLA, we've noted over several quarters, we know the demand kind of issues that are playing out. Anything you can do from a commercial perspective that could help accelerate growth even in light of the free drug programs we're seeing? Or do we really have to wait until that kind of tapers off come next year to maybe see some more growth from the brand? Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Evan. We're obviously doing quite a bit in the market from a commercial perspective. We've actually increased the breadth of our promotion to include much more primary care targets given that the milder patient who's on topical therapy today, that 1.5 million patient pool, it's a large addressable pool of patients, are currently under the care of primary care physicians and tend not to be referred as frequently to dermatologists as the moderate to severe patients. So we've increased our primary care footprint and we're actually seeing growth in our primary care targets. Where we're seeing a little bit of pressure or a little bit of quarter-on-quarter pressure is in the higher-end dermatology practices that treat more complex patients. And that's kind of where you would expect to see some of the novel agents being tried. So I do think that will stabilize over time, but that's going to take most of the year to take place. We'll continue to expand our primary care presence, and we're also working to expand our direct-to-consumer efforts to a mild to moderate patient population that might be on a topical, but still seeing unresolved symptoms due to their psoriasis, whether it be hands, face, scalp or other areas where the patient really wants to resolve those symptoms. So overall, there's quite a bit that we're putting into the market to increase our growth in that bio-naive or systemic-naive milder patient. And we would expect that, that will strengthen our new patient capture over the course of the year, and we expect to see good growth FOR OTEZLA for many years to come.\nOperator: Thank you, Evan Our next question comes from Robin Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead . Your line is open.\nNicole Germino: Thanks for taking our question. This is Nicole on for Robin. Can you help us think through the -- franchise and how Amgen plans on maintaining share given that there's a competitor or there are competitors with biosimilars with auto injector devices and other devices in the market? How much pressure should we see going forward? How should we think about the Neulasta franchise?\nMurdo Gordon: Thank you, Nicole, for the question. Look, we're really pleased with what we've been able to do with the Neulasta franchise to date. We've been able to defend our volume successfully. Obviously, we've had to concede some price to do that. And the volume on the prefilled syringe side has been under some pressure. I'm very pleased with what we've done with the Neulasta Onpro device, and we've held on to substantial share there. We think we've established good contractual commitments for this year. And we'll continue to battle with competitors if they come to market with a different device than is currently available. But we expect some continued pricing pressure there, as we've indicated. And overall, I think the team that's working on Neulasta has done very well.\nOperator: Thank you, Nicole. Our next question comes from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGregory Renza: Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. At the top of the call, you spoke about your R&D and identified, I think, it was four medicines that you described as quintessentially Amgen. And just my question is for you and the team. As you look across your portfolio, but also externally in other areas, are there specific areas of opportunity that you think could benefit from the Amgen capabilities that perhaps are not represented or underrepresented in your portfolio today? Thanks so much.\nBob Bradway: David and I can tackle that together. I think we've been very clear about what we look for in the outside, which are molecules that fit in our areas of strategic interest or where we think we have strength. And in particular, we're looking for opportunities in inflammation and in oncology and in general medicine. And we look for medicines that could be first-in-class, best-in-class and have a big effect size in the patient populations that, again, where we think we can add value. So we're constantly looking. I don't think we feel like we're particularly exposed or we need to emphasize business development in any one of those three particular areas, but we're always looking for attractive opportunities early and late. Dave?\nDavid Reese: Yes. And I would add, the other component is technology platforms. Bob mentioned briefly in his opening remarks the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I think we've quietly become a leader in this area. We are using artificial intelligence and machine learning across the R&D spectrum now from molecular engineering, where we've been extraordinarily pleased with -- it's the effect of dry labs or in silico design on the engineering of new protein molecules in time frames that are much, much shorter than were previously achievable with a higher success rate, success here being defined as a candidate going forward that has the molecular attributes that you want. We are using it extensively in the clinical trials arena for site selection, for example, and other aspects of trial design. So this is something that I'll talk about more as we go through the course of the year. But these sorts of technology platforms lead us to what I think is an absolute hinge moment in this industry where the union of tech and biotech will move us forward to a qualitatively different time in drug discovery and drug development. And I think we're going to be very well positioned to take advantage of this union.\nOperator: Thank you, Gregory. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTim Anderson: Thank you very much. On OTEZLA, I'm wondering if you have any market share or performance metrics in the mild psoriasis segment, specifically, where you've had approval for coming up on 1.5 years. I'm guessing you have some idea of the penetration you're making in that very different segment.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes, Tim, thanks for the question. Unfortunately, the differentiation between mild and moderate is difficult because there isn't really good coding that we can use as a surrogate for determining which is which. So what we look at is what percentage of our business is being sourced from systemic-naive patients, which we infer that they are milder and that their last treatment that they've been on prior to OTEZLA was a topical. And 80% of our new patient growth right now is coming from the post-topical pre-systemic patient type. So we are definitely making progress. What we're doing right now, as I mentioned earlier, is we're scaling our promotional effort that targets where these patients are being treated and we expect to be able to grow the volume of patients that we're securing. As you'll note, we grew the volume of OTEZLA in the quarter by 5%, and we expect to be able to improve on that.\nBob Bradway: Julianne, I know we're already at half past the hour. So that's the time that we had asked our colleagues to set aside for the call. But we have a couple of more questions in the queue. We'll try to get through those and then as is our custom be available if anybody has any questions for later this evening. But let's go to the next question.\nOperator: Certainly. Thank you, Tim. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoffrey Meacham: Great. Afternoon guys. Thanks for eth queation Murdo, of your new launched products in the past few years, EVENITY stands out as one that had a really good progression each quarter. What does the long-term opportunity here look like? And then how do you think about life cycle management of the bone franchise overall later on as you get close to the LOE?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question, for noting the performance of EVENITY. The bone team have done an exceptional job with this product. And I think the Amgen legacy in building the Prolia franchise is clearly helping that, along with our partnership with UCB. I was just recently in Japan. And as Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, we have an ultra-aging society there. And EVENITY is doing extremely well and I would say is a really good leading indicator of what we could do in the U.S. with that product. So I think we're really early in our ability to penetrate the millions of patients that would benefit from a bone builder like EVENITY. We also see a very nice continuum of care for these patients where, let's say, you're on a busphosphanate or Prolia and you have a fracture, you go on EVENITY for 12 months, and then you return to a product like denosumab or Prolia for your continued care, so there really is a nice franchise opportunity here with both Prolia and EVENITY. And we see the addressable population as being extremely large, and we are still very early in growing that product, obviously now annualizing at over $1 billion. It's an exciting growth opportunity for us going forward. And we're as enthusiastic as we possibly could be.\nArvind Sood: Julianne, take -- let's take one last question, after which Bob will make some closing comments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dane Leone from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line open.\nDane Leone: As we contemplate the updated guidance for the year, probably - two competitive questions are still unclear to me on the call. Firstly, you've had a great momentum with Repatha. Earlier in the week, Novartis really highlighted Leqvio or inclisiran, finally gaining some traction in the U.S. Love to hear your thoughts around how you view competitive dynamics in the PCSK9 class for the remainder of the year. And then secondly, kind of on a similar note, I did notice LUMAKRAS declined Q-on-Q in the first quarter in the U.S. And was just curious if you saw any impact of KRAZATI the competitive agent from Mirati. Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: Yes, thanks. Maybe I'll flip the answer around -- it's really too early to tell with Mirati impact. I think what I've mentioned in response to an earlier question, the actual land volume Q-on-Q is pretty flat. What we're actually seeing in the sales is a workdown of some inventory -- end-user inventory from Q4 to Q1 of this year for LUMAKRAS, but actual patients treated, pretty flat quarter-on-quarter. So we're not seeing a big impact yet from Mirati. And of course, for LUMAKRAS, we're really focused on growing LUMAKRAS through additional indications and additional data to move into earlier lines of therapy, which Dave covered in his remarks. As we look at Repatha, I think we really are excited about what we're seeing now. We see more and more enthusiasm from cardiologists in a broad way and in a deep way, i.e., using Repatha more frequently in their prescribing practices for ASCVD patients. What we've been doing over the course of the last, call it, 18 months, is increasing our Repatha commercial presence at primary care. And this year, we're actually making another step change in primary care promotional effort by increasing the size of our primary care sales force here. So Repatha is very much moving in the right direction. Patients are benefiting from it. We maintain more than a 70% share of the PCSK9 class. But quite frankly, that's not what my team looks at. They look at trying to penetrate the millions of ASCVD patients, the tens of millions of ASCVD patients that need to lower their LDLC goal. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, less than 30% of patients, and that's not our data, that's data from the family heart organization less than 30% of patients are at their LDLC goal. So we feel like this is important work. We feel like we've got a best-in-class medicine in Repatha. We've got great coverage, and we expect to continue to grow this product globally to serve many millions of patients over the years to come.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Murdo, for your response to that question. And let me again thank all of you for joining us on the call. Just a couple of quick thoughts. Obviously, we're off to a good start here in the year, as you can see from the results in the first quarter and as I said in my opening remarks, far more important than the quarter itself is the way it's setting us up for the long term. So if you think back to the things that we've talked about as being important for us, being able to deliver on our long-term growth strategy, it starts with our growth products having to perform. As you saw in the quarter, we had 10 brands achieving record performance. And performance means growing share, growing penetration. And as Murdo said, that's what we see happening now with our important growth driving brand. The other thing we said is that for us to be successful over the long term, we've got to perform in the international markets. And again, I think the volume trends that you see here early in the year are really good in the year. We're building the kinds of platforms we need to have in order to deliver long-term growth for our medicines outside the United States. We talked a lot about biosimilars on this call. We've said that, that we think is an important contributor to our growth long term as we bring new products to market and launch them in new countries. And in order for us to do that, we need to be a leading competitor, and that means we need to execute on time and be in the first wave of launches. Once again, this quarter, you see further proof points of our being able to do that consistently with the launch of Amgevita, the approval of BEKEMV et cetera. So we think competitively, we're well positioned there and a biosimilar business to capitalize on the opportunities. And then, of course, the pipeline is always critical, and we're excited about how our pipeline is very rapidly advancing, particularly on the registration-enabling trials, whether you look at tarlatimab or bema or rocatinlimab. We have a lot of important registration-enabling work underway, and we're excited to start generating results from those portfolios -- or that portfolio of products as well as some of the products that are now attracting quite a bit of attention like 133 in our mid-stage pipeline. So all-in-all, we're off to a good start in the quarter, and we remain very enthusiastic about the long term. And in the meanwhile, we're looking forward to having an opportunity to close on the Horizon transaction once regulators have completed their work. So thank you for tuning in and we look forward to being back with all of you in August.\nArvind Sood: Great. Thanks, everybody, and we'll be around for a while. So feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. Thanks again.\nOperator: This concludes our First Quarter Full Year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. We're pleased with our execution and remain on track to deliver against our full year 2023 and longer term objectives driven again by strong 14% volume growth across a number of products including Repatha, EVENITY, BLINCYTO, TEZSPIRE and TAVNEOS. While we advance our late stage pipeline and work to complete the acquisition of Horizon by the end of June. We continue to invest for long-term growth. I'll review our first quarter results before discussing our 2023 guidance. As a reminder, these results and outlook reflect Amgen on a standalone basis without any adjustments for the announced Horizon acquisition. Turning to our first quarter financial results, which are shown on slide 38 of the slide deck. Total revenue at $6.1 billion declined 2% year-over-year. However, excluding the 2% negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates, product sales increased 4% and total revenues were unchanged versus the first quarter of 2022. The four percentage point difference was due to an expected decrease in other revenue due to lower profit and cost sharing from our COVID-19 collaboration with Lilly. First quarter product sales are seasonally the lowest quarter as a percentage of the full year due to benefit plan changes, insurance re-verification and increased co-pay expenses. In our first quarter, product sales increased 2% year-over-year, driven by 14% volume growth, partially offset by 5% lower net selling price, 3% unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, 2% lower inventory levels and the 2% impact of FX rates previously mentioned. First quarter total non-GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year, driven by investments in research and development. Non-GAAP R&D spend in the quarter increased 12% year-over-year, with higher spending and later stage program support. Discovery research and early pipeline and marketed product support. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 0.8 percentage points on a year-over-year basis to 17.4%, primarily due to changes in product mix and higher profit share expense. Now, recall that cost of sales in the first quarter was impacted by a portion of the $125 million of Puerto Rico excise tax. That was previously capitalized to inventory with the residual impact expected in the second quarter. Non-GAAP G&A expenses in the first quarter increased 1% year-over-year. We continue to focus on prioritizing key investments, digitalization and driving productivity. Non-GAAP OI&E benefited from higher interest income and approximately 110 million of gains from deleveraging related to the repurchase of a portion of our debt portfolio. Also recall we now mark-to-market our investment in Beijing with the impact included on our GAAP income statement. In the first quarter, this resulted in a GAAP only pre-tax gain of about $1.9 billion. As expected, our first quarter non-GAAP tax rate increased 3.7 percentage points to 17.8%, primarily due to the 2022 Puerto Rico tax law change that replaced the excise tax with an income tax beginning in 2023 as well as increased interest expense on our existing tax reserves. We are committed to our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue our investments in internal and external innovation that drive our long-term growth. Our increased spending and non-GAAP R&D of 12% in Q1 '23 over Q1 '22, coupled with our acquisition of TAVNEOS and our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will further broaden and strengthen our portfolio of first-in-class and best-in-class therapeutics to deliver to more patients globally. Second, we continue investing in our business to further long-term growth. Capital expenditures are at near peak levels, driven by simultaneous construction of our state of the art manufacturing facilities in Ohio and North Carolina. We expect our annual capital expenditures to decline starting in 2024 with the completion and licensing of our Ohio plant. And third, we continue to return capital to our shareholders as we pay dividends of $2.13 per share in the first quarter. This represented a 10% increase over that paid in each of 2022 four quarters. Free cash flow for the quarter was driven lower by the timing of sales rebates and incentives, lower operating income and higher capital expenditures from the building out of the state-of-the-art facilities in North Carolina and Ohio. We expect strong cash flow for the remainder of the year consistent with our full year 2023 financial outlook that includes a non-GAAP operating margin of roughly 50%. We expect sequential growth in our free cash flow in the second quarter, although there may be an impact to Q2 and free cash flow from the expected closing of the Horizon acquisition due to the accounting treatment of certain items that were all expected in our Horizon acquisition financing and estimated deal costs as well as our previously announced restructuring in the first quarter. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2023 on slide 40. Our guidance is currently provided on the Amgen standalone business and does not include any Horizon projections. We are raising our 2023 guidance. We're raising our 2023 revenue guidance to $26.2 billion to $27.3 billion versus previous guidance of $26.0 billion to $27.2 billion. This reflects our confidence in the underlying business and the improving overall market conditions for our patients to access our medicines that Bob and Murdo mentioned. We are also raising our 2023 non-GAAP EPS guidance to $17.60 to $18.70 versus previous guidance of $17.40 per share to $18.60 per share. Let me mention a few more important considerations as you model the remainder of '23. For product sales, we project solid volume growth at a portfolio level and consistent with the first quarter. We expect a mid-single digit price decline for our portfolio in 2023. We now project full year Neulasta sales of approximately $700 million and full year combined KANJINT and MVASI sales of approximately 850 million. We anticipate full year non-GAAP operating expenses to increase by about 1% over last year. We expect the 2023 operating margin as a percent of product sales to be roughly 50% and expect our second quarter operating margin to also be roughly 50%. And we also expect cost of sales as a percentage of product sales to be between 16% and 17%. Non-GAAP R&D expenses in 2023 to remain unchanged and estimated to increase 3% to 4% year over year. Non-GAAP spend is a percentage of product sales to slightly decrease year-over-year, driven by our ongoing digitalization, continuous improvement and productivity imperatives. We anticipate non-GAAP OI&E to be in the range of 1.2 billion to 1.3 billion, reflecting the first quarter deleveraging related to the debt repurchases I mentioned. With the remainder of the year's R&D expense to be evenly split over the remaining three quarters. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 18% to 19%. We plan to continue to meaningfully increase our dividend. We continue to expect share repurchases not to exceed $500 million in 2023. Our capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at approximately 925 million in 2023. Our confidence is strong and the long-term outlook for Amgen and our long-term growth. We look forward to completing the announced acquisition of Horizon. We expect to provide updated guidance as appropriate after the transaction closes. Many thanks as always to our 24,000 plus dedicated colleagues all over the world executing each day on behalf of our patients and our future patients. That concludes the financial update. I'll turn it over to Bob for Q&A. Maybe, Murdo, just to jump in quickly that prior period adjustment, I mean, that's an estimated sales tax sales deduction adjustment. So just to clarify that and as Murdo said, we're looking for a slowing year-over-year price erosion on that too. So we think we've got some trends in our favor here."

            "name": "Bob Bradway",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Arvind, and let me thank all of you for joining our call. I'll begin by calling your attention to the 14% volume growth we delivered in the first quarter. That illustrates two points worth keeping in mind when thinking about the remainder of the year and beyond. First, on the COVID front seem to have finally turned the page on the pandemic in terms of its impact on the overall health care system. For example, we've seen year-over-year prescription growth across most specialties in the US, including cardiology and oncology, and that's good news because it suggests that patients are returning to their pre-pandemic routines with doctor visits once again enabling appropriate diagnoses and treatments. It's obviously something that bodes well for our portfolio of medicines. Second, we're seeing that the demand for medicines is resilient despite the current macroeconomic challenges. Repatha, EVENITY , BLINCYTO and KYPROLIS, for example, all delivered record sales in the quarter, driven by extremely strong growth in volumes of 33%, 55%, 49% and 18% respectively. We don't see this volume driven growth as a single quarter phenomenon either, rather we see this as the potential for these medicines and others in our portfolio to reach many more patients over time and contribute substantially to our long-term growth. Take Repatha. We believe there's tremendous upside opportunity for Repatha at a time when most high risk cardiovascular patients still never reach their recommended LDL levels or do so only for a brief insufficient period of time. The global public health crisis and heart disease demands that all players in the system work together to drive change, and with Repatha, we've proven we have a proven innovation that we know can be an essential part of the solution. Two of our newest medicines, TEZSPIRE and TAVNEOS achieved quarter-over-quarter volume growth in the US of 28% and 27% respectively. TEZSPIRE has enjoyed strong adoption in the US by both allergists and pulmonologists and recently approved, excuse me, a recently approved pre-filled pen gives patients the option for self-administration. A few quarters into our ownership of TAVNEOS, we are convinced that our deep experience in rheumatology and nephrology will enable us to bring this first-in-class medicine to many more patients who can benefit from it. Outside the US, volumes grew more than 20% in the quarter. In the Asia-Pacific region in particular, we generated nearly 50% volume growth, as we expand the number of patients we serve in Japan and China, two of the world's most rapidly ageing nations with medicines like Repatha and Prolia. Amgen's R&D investment was up 12% in the quarter. That growth reflects the investments we are making in registration enabling trials for several potential new first-in-class medicines, including Olpasiran in heart disease, Rocatinlimab in inflammation and bemarituzumab and tarlatamab in cancer. All four of these medicines are quintessentially Amgen. Innovative molecules that deliver large effect sizes against serious diseases for which new treatments are very much needed. We are pursuing a number of significant new indications for TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO and LUMAKRAS as well. We look forward to several data readouts from our pipeline, mainly in the second half of the year. We continue to invest heavily in early research where we've built a differentiated set of capabilities over the past decade that position us well to take advantage of the rapid convergence of biology and technology that we see happening today. At a time when the world marvels at ChatGPT, we've been deploying artificial intelligence and machine learning in our research labs for some time now, giving us dry lab capabilities that, when applied to biologics development, have already yielded proof success rates and reduced cycle times beyond our initial expectations. This is indeed an exciting time for biologic innovation. We remain optimistic about our announced acquisition of Horizon and similar to our experience with TAVNEOS, the more time we've spent with the team at Horizon, the more excited we've become about the potential to bring Amgen's capabilities and global presence to bear on Horizon's portfolio of first-in-class innovative medicines and its pipeline. It's an exciting time for all of us at Amgen, and the demand for innovative medicines is proven to be resilient and growing around the world. At the same time that our ability to innovate has never been greater. Always, I'm grateful to my Amgen colleagues around the world for their commitment to patients and to our business. Now, let me turn it over to Murdo. Okay. Thank you, Peter. All right, Julianne, if you could remind our callers of the process for asking a question. I know they've had a long day already, so ask them to hold their questions to one each and do our best to get to everybody who has one for us. Reese, over to you. The only thing I'd add to that, Chris, is that we're running this business very efficiently, and we think when we look at the cash that we're generating on this business, we're earning an attractive return for our shareholders. So again, in order for us to continue to succeed in biosimilars, we need to execute effectively. And as you can see in the quarter with BEKEMV the progress and with the launch of Amgevita, we continue to do what we plan to do in biosimilars. And again, I would reiterate, we think we're earning an attractive return for our shareholders, some of those commitments. David and I can tackle that together. I think we've been very clear about what we look for in the outside, which are molecules that fit in our areas of strategic interest or where we think we have strength. And in particular, we're looking for opportunities in inflammation and in oncology and in general medicine. And we look for medicines that could be first-in-class, best-in-class and have a big effect size in the patient populations that, again, where we think we can add value. So we're constantly looking. I don't think we feel like we're particularly exposed or we need to emphasize business development in any one of those three particular areas, but we're always looking for attractive opportunities early and late. Dave? Julianne, I know we're already at half past the hour. So that's the time that we had asked our colleagues to set aside for the call. But we have a couple of more questions in the queue. We'll try to get through those and then as is our custom be available if anybody has any questions for later this evening. But let's go to the next question. Okay. Thank you, Murdo, for your response to that question. And let me again thank all of you for joining us on the call. Just a couple of quick thoughts. Obviously, we're off to a good start here in the year, as you can see from the results in the first quarter and as I said in my opening remarks, far more important than the quarter itself is the way it's setting us up for the long term.

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. We kicked off 2023 with strong execution of our mission to bring innovative products to millions of patients globally. We saw record sales for ten brands in the first quarter with strong volume gains across our general medicine and hematology oncology growth brands. Our inflammation therapeutic area expanded with the US launch of AMGEVITA and the growth of TEZSPIRE and TAVNEOS and our announced acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics will soon add several important medicines to our portfolio. Volume growth in the first quarter was 14%, with 10% growth in the US and 22% growth outside the US. Asia-Pacific continues to be our fastest growing region with 47% volume growth in the quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange first quarter global product sales grew 4%, including the 2% negative foreign exchange impact. Product sales increased 2% year-over-year. Starting with our general medicine business, which includes Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY and Aimovig. Overall, revenue for these four products grew 13% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by 19% volume growth. Cardiovascular disease is a growing public health crisis. In the US someone has a heart attack every 40 seconds and we know LDLC is a major risk factor for heart attack or stroke. However, the state of care for high risk ASCVD patients with elevated LDL cholesterol is shockingly poor. However, we have recently released a real world analysis from the FH foundation of 38 million high risk Americans showing that fewer than 30% of them ever reached their recommended LDL levels. These statistics emphasize the importance of therapies like Repatha to address the significant medical need and we're pleased that more and more patients are now benefiting from Repatha and with volume growth of 33% in the first quarter leading to an increase in sales of 18%. Price erosion also slowed in the first quarter and declined less than prior year. In the US, volume growth of 32% was driven by broad adoption of Repatha by cardiologists and increasing adoption by primary care providers. Outside the US, we saw 34% volume growth with strong momentum across our international business. There's clearly more work to be done to address this cardiovascular health crisis. This March at the American College of Cardiology, we convened the first ever annual LDLC Action Summit to address the state of cardiovascular care in the US by identifying strategies and delivering solutions to improve lipid management among the highest risk ASCVD patients. By intensifying the focus on lowering LDLC, a coalition of leading stakeholders in cardiovascular care have come together with Amgen to unite on a bold goal. By 2030, our ambition is to have the number of cardiovascular events in the US. We are confident that Repatha will play an important role in achieving this ambition. Transitioning to bone health. Prolia sales grew 9% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by 8% volume growth. EVENITY, which complements Prolia in our bond portfolio had record sales of $254 million for the quarter, primarily driven by strong volume growth across markets. Now to our inflammation portfolio. OTEZLA volume increased 5% in the quarter. Sales decreased 13% year-over-year, driven by lower inventory levels and price declines resulting from patient and payer mix. Additional rebates were also provided to improve the quality of coverage. Growth of our US OTEZLA business has been impacted by free drug programs for newly launched topical and systemic competitors and we expect new patient demand will continue to be impacted by these programs throughout 2023. Longer term, we see strong growth potential for OTEZLA given its established efficacy and safety profile. Strong payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and ease of administration. OTEZLA remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the more than 1.5 million systemic naive US patients with milder psoriasis that cannot be optimally addressed by a topical and can benefit from a systemic treatment like OTEZLA. Enbrel volumes in the US increased 1% in the quarter, supported by improved payer coverage. Several important factors to consider when reflecting on Enbrel performance in the quarter. Global sales decreased 33% year-over-year, driven by declines in net selling price, lower inventory levels compared to previous years and a 9% unfavorable impact of changes to estimated sales deductions related to prior periods. Going forward, we expect low-single digit volume growth throughout 2023 lower year-over-year declines in net selling price and a gradual recovery in inventory levels. The TEZSPIRE launch is progressing well with $96 million in sales in the first quarter, driven by strong adoption in the US by allergists and pulmonologists. TEZSPIRE's unique differentiated profile offers broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe, uncontrolled asthma without any phenotypic and biomarker limitations. During the first quarter, the US Food and Drug Administration approved TEZSPIRE for self-administration in a prefilled single use pen, which offers patients the convenient option to administer TEZSPIRE at home. This improves accessibility and provides more flexibility in treatment options for all patients in the United States. Sales of TAVNEOS were $23 million in the first quarter. US volumes grew 27% quarter-over-quarter, driven by an increase in new patients starting treatment. In the US TAVNEOS has now been prescribed to over 1700 patients, confirming our belief that Amgen's deep experience in inflammation and nephrology and substantial market presence allows us to bring TAVNEOS to more patients with ANCA associated vasculitis. In the first quarter, AMGEVITA launched as the first US biosimilar to HUMIRA, a medicine used by more than 1 million patients living with serious inflammatory diseases. We saw the first prescriptions to patients being fulfilled this quarter and we're encouraged by the high awareness of AMGEVITA among gastroenterologists and rheumatologists. With our track record of developing and manufacturing biologics and decades of experience in inflammation, Amgen is uniquely equipped to patients with this biosimilar medicine. Looking ahead, we expect Q2 AMGEVITA sales in the US to be lower than Q1 sales is a majority of our US AMGEVITA sales in the first quarter stemmed from inventory build. Moving to our hematology and oncology business, which includes LUMAKRAS, KYPROLIS, XGEVA, Vectibix, Nplate and BLINCYTO. Sales and volume for these six innovative products grew 21% year-over-year for the quarter, with KYPROLIS and BLINCYTO achieving record quarterly sales. Growth in our hematology and oncology business was supported by important new clinical data. BLINCYTO sales grew 41% in the first quarter, supported by strong adoption across academic and community centers, following positive data from the registration enabling E1910 study presented in December of 2022. Vectibix sales increased 16% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by 15% volume growth supported by positive data from the Phase 3 paradigm trial demonstrating the superiority of Vectibix over bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy. KYPROLIS continued its strong trajectory with 25% growth in the quarter driven by 18% volume growth. LUMAKRAS reported $74 million in sales in the first quarter and a 19% increase year-over-year, driven by 40% volume growth partially offset by lower net selling price. Outside the US, LUMAKRAS has been approved in 50 countries and we're actively launching in over 30 markets and pursuing reimbursement in the remaining countries. Sales of our oncology biosimilars declined 27% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by lower net selling price. While our biosimilars for MVASI and KANJINTI both hold leading shares in the US. We expect continued net selling price deterioration and accelerating volume declines driven by increased competition. Over time we expect long-term growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. Given the strong performance of our hematology and oncology portfolio and the recent positive data on BLINCYTO and VECTIBI as well as ongoing clinical development of LUMAKRAS and our oncology pipeline. I look forward to the future growth potential of this portfolio. As we close out this first quarter of 2023, I'm pleased with our strong execution across our portfolio both in the US and internationally. And with that, I'll turn it to Dave. Yeah, thanks, Umer. You're on to some of the fact pattern. Let me just go through kind of the elements of Enbrel specifically. First off, we were up 1% in volume in the quarter. So the leading indicators of Enbrel volume performance all look quite good. And that's a function of strong demand for the product in the market, good quality execution and an additional pharmacy benefit formulary win starting in January of the year. So we would expect continued low-single digit volume growth throughout the course of 2023. So that's the kind of high quality leading indicators of the volume performance of the product. The inventory component is pretty substantial. As you highlight, it is a function of both wholesaler inventory levels being down as well as specialty pharmacy. And I think it's partly a function of the fact that we did have volume increase and there was also a pretty significant work down through the quarter. We would expect those inventory levels to return to normal inventory levels throughout the course of the year. And then the last piece of Enbrel is an out-of-period adjustment, an unfavorable adjustment of about 9% related to prior period. And that's a function of things like state Medicaid, true ups coming in, as well as some other price adjustments from prior period. So overall, again, the leading indicators for Enbrel are good, low-single digit volume anticipated for the year, a little bit of price concession to get that formulary win. But then the other two events in the quarter are likely to improve over the course of the year as well being inventory and prior period adjustment. Thank you, Peter. Yeah, there is a big piece of that prior period that's also PHS and given the program that we're running for PHS patients. We expect that to be a lower impact throughout the course of the year as well. Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. On Amgevita specifically, a lot of that Q1 revenue was what we would call buy-in from primarily IDNs. And so it's hard for us to see how much of that buy-in has been used up in actual prescription fill. So our conservative estimate is that the majority of that is buy-in and that Q2 could be lower than Q1 revenues based on that. So that's our estimate for Amgevita. Obviously, we're very early in the launch here. We're building demand physician by physician and patient by patient. And some of that IDN pull-through is not visible to us because they don't share data necessarily with the IQVIAs of the world. So that's Amgevita. But overall, we have been extremely successful in developing biosimilars at Amgen. We are very pleased with what we've been able to do so far by developing successful molecules that are either first or first wave launches. We continue to plan on being first or first wave in the biosimilar products that we're targeting. We have been able to continuously supply, thanks to the hard work of our manufacturing and supply chain colleagues around the world. When we approach both institutional customers, payers and providers, I think there's a lot of trust in the Amgen brand when it comes to the biosimilars that we manufacture. Certainly, last but not least, we do feel strongly that we will continue to be able to deliver on our 2x '21 sales by the end of the decade in our biosimilars business, so more than double our 2021 revenues. And we think we'll do that by continuing to launch both pharmacy benefit and medical benefit biosimilars, but the majority of that growth is going to be driven by medical benefit biosimilars. So still a very important part of our business, and the people that work on it continue to deliver value to the health care system as we move forward. Yes. Thanks for the question, Mohit. I think we've definitely taken advantage of the first mover, particularly with the IDN channel. That's really where a lot of the initial uptake will be. I think we're also differentiated versus the other biosimilar manufacturers that have biosimilars to Humira in that we do cover the customer base here quite effectively both in rheumatology and gastroenterology having deployed medical and sales teams that are out there right now building awareness and demand for Amgevita. Lastly, I would say that given that we've got parity access across the large three PBMs, we are in very good position to be able to pull through a lot of that Amgevita. I think we were clear in saying this would be a gradual uptake for this product. And we think that we still have been able to use the time that we have ahead of competition wisely to build that demand. Yes. Thank you, Jay. I think what we're pleased with is the broad access coverage we have on Otezla, we have very good coverage. We did actually add additional coverage at the beginning of the year with United Optum Part D plan coming online. And so there's a little bit of price concession to do that in the year. But beyond that, we've got good stable access for 2023, and we look forward to being able to maintain that in 2024. So I don't see more decrement on price. In fact, we think price will -- the negative price effects you saw in Q1 should abate a little bit in Q2 and beyond. So overall very stable. The one thing that you mentioned that's interesting is the free goods program that competitors have out there. I do think that, that's a little bit of a disruption in the market right now that's probably causing a bit of softness in our new patient demand. We get about 80% of our new patient growth coming from systemic naive topical patients receiving OTEZLA as their first systemic agent. I think when you have free good programs in the market, sometimes that free goods is a very easy way for a prescriber to try a novel agent. And I think that, that's taking away some of that new patient growth that we're used to seeing. I do think that will be different once those competitors contract for their market access, and that's likely to be a 24% impact. Thanks, Colin. Maybe I could take a minute just on TEPEZZA because there are quite a few analysts on the call that would be unfamiliar with how the patient journey for thyroid eye disease actually works. And it's important because it has a bearing on the demand pattern for TEPEZZA. The way in which the Horizon team actually track the performance as they look at something called patient enrollment forms, which is the initial request, if you will, to start a thyroid eye disease patient on TEPEZZA. It then takes quite a while for that patient enrollment form to move its way through the prior authorization process against medical policies that payers have in place. That can take up to 90 days. Then you need to schedule that patient's first infusion. And in thyroid eye disease, it's not like in oncology where there's a clinical oncologist relatively evenly distributed throughout the country that can do infused drug administration. This is a lot more concentrated. And so it takes a while for the patient to be referred to the right site of care to receive their first infusion of TEPEZZA. So that also adds time. So while tracking the early leading indicator that we look at, which is patient enrollment form, there's quite a lag between that patient enrollment form starting and when that first infusion will occur. And that's really important to keep in mind when you see either flat or, in this case, I think strengthening demand for TEPEZZA in patient enrollment forms. That will take a while to flow through into net sales. So that would be my prefacing comment. Now besides that, I think we're really excited, as Dave said, about the chronic data that were recently announced. And my congratulations to the entire Horizon team for executing a high-quality trial and showing how TEPEZZA can benefit a broader cross-section of patients with lower clinical activity score and truly highlighting the need for chronic care in this category. So I think that's a fantastic accomplishment. I think the simultaneous label change is just a nod to the conviction that even the regulator has about the utility of this product and this disease. And then I think the Horizon team has spent a lot of time over the last few months expanding their commercial capabilities and their medical capabilities. And they're in really good shape to take this great new data, which is on label to providers and to payers and to help expand the use of that product in the U.S. So we're quite optimistic about the future growth of TEPEZZA. And then, of course, from our side, we're also excited about being able to launch TEPEZZA in other markets around the world once we close this transaction. We have the capabilities and the structure and the scale given that we've been expanding Amgen's footprint globally over the last several years. And so we're ready to go. And we'll work closely with Horizon to do that so that TEPEZZA has multiple opportunities to grow over time. On LUMAKRAS, just real quick. We did see a little bit of increased inventory in the fourth quarter of last year. So the year-on-year compare or quarter-on-quarter compare, I should say, is really more about that inventory coming through. The actual demand is pretty flat from Q4 to Q1. And so we've been able to hold on quite nicely despite competitors in the market. Yes. Thanks, Evan. We're obviously doing quite a bit in the market from a commercial perspective. We've actually increased the breadth of our promotion to include much more primary care targets given that the milder patient who's on topical therapy today, that 1.5 million patient pool, it's a large addressable pool of patients, are currently under the care of primary care physicians and tend not to be referred as frequently to dermatologists as the moderate to severe patients. So we've increased our primary care footprint and we're actually seeing growth in our primary care targets. Where we're seeing a little bit of pressure or a little bit of quarter-on-quarter pressure is in the higher-end dermatology practices that treat more complex patients. And that's kind of where you would expect to see some of the novel agents being tried. So I do think that will stabilize over time, but that's going to take most of the year to take place. We'll continue to expand our primary care presence, and we're also working to expand our direct-to-consumer efforts to a mild to moderate patient population that might be on a topical, but still seeing unresolved symptoms due to their psoriasis, whether it be hands, face, scalp or other areas where the patient really wants to resolve those symptoms. So overall, there's quite a bit that we're putting into the market to increase our growth in that bio-naive or systemic-naive milder patient. And we would expect that, that will strengthen our new patient capture over the course of the year, and we expect to see good growth FOR OTEZLA for many years to come. Thank you, Nicole, for the question. Look, we're really pleased with what we've been able to do with the Neulasta franchise to date. We've been able to defend our volume successfully. Obviously, we've had to concede some price to do that. And the volume on the prefilled syringe side has been under some pressure. I'm very pleased with what we've done with the Neulasta Onpro device, and we've held on to substantial share there. We think we've established good contractual commitments for this year. And we'll continue to battle with competitors if they come to market with a different device than is currently available. But we expect some continued pricing pressure there, as we've indicated. And overall, I think the team that's working on Neulasta has done very well. Yes, Tim, thanks for the question. Unfortunately, the differentiation between mild and moderate is difficult because there isn't really good coding that we can use as a surrogate for determining which is which. So what we look at is what percentage of our business is being sourced from systemic-naive patients, which we infer that they are milder and that their last treatment that they've been on prior to OTEZLA was a topical. And 80% of our new patient growth right now is coming from the post-topical pre-systemic patient type. So we are definitely making progress. What we're doing right now, as I mentioned earlier, is we're scaling our promotional effort that targets where these patients are being treated and we expect to be able to grow the volume of patients that we're securing. As you'll note, we grew the volume of OTEZLA in the quarter by 5%, and we expect to be able to improve on that. Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question, for noting the performance of EVENITY. The bone team have done an exceptional job with this product. And I think the Amgen legacy in building the Prolia franchise is clearly helping that, along with our partnership with UCB. I was just recently in Japan. And as Bob mentioned in his opening remarks, we have an ultra-aging society there. And EVENITY is doing extremely well and I would say is a really good leading indicator of what we could do in the U.S. with that product. So I think we're really early in our ability to penetrate the millions of patients that would benefit from a bone builder like EVENITY. We also see a very nice continuum of care for these patients where, let's say, you're on a busphosphanate or Prolia and you have a fracture, you go on EVENITY for 12 months, and then you return to a product like denosumab or Prolia for your continued care, so there really is a nice franchise opportunity here with both Prolia and EVENITY. And we see the addressable population as being extremely large, and we are still very early in growing that product, obviously now annualizing at over $1 billion. It's an exciting growth opportunity for us going forward. And we're as enthusiastic as we possibly could be. Yes, thanks. Maybe I'll flip the answer around -- it's really too early to tell with Mirati impact. I think what I've mentioned in response to an earlier question, the actual land volume Q-on-Q is pretty flat. What we're actually seeing in the sales is a workdown of some inventory -- end-user inventory from Q4 to Q1 of this year for LUMAKRAS, but actual patients treated, pretty flat quarter-on-quarter. So we're not seeing a big impact yet from Mirati. And of course, for LUMAKRAS, we're really focused on growing LUMAKRAS through additional indications and additional data to move into earlier lines of therapy, which Dave covered in his remarks. As we look at Repatha, I think we really are excited about what we're seeing now. We see more and more enthusiasm from cardiologists in a broad way and in a deep way, i.e., using Repatha more frequently in their prescribing practices for ASCVD patients. What we've been doing over the course of the last, call it, 18 months, is increasing our Repatha commercial presence at primary care. And this year, we're actually making another step change in primary care promotional effort by increasing the size of our primary care sales force here. So Repatha is very much moving in the right direction. Patients are benefiting from it. We maintain more than a 70% share of the PCSK9 class. But quite frankly, that's not what my team looks at. They look at trying to penetrate the millions of ASCVD patients, the tens of millions of ASCVD patients that need to lower their LDLC goal. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, less than 30% of patients, and that's not our data, that's data from the family heart organization less than 30% of patients are at their LDLC goal. So we feel like this is important work. We feel like we've got a best-in-class medicine in Repatha. We've got great coverage, and we expect to continue to grow this product globally to serve many millions of patients over the years to come."

            "name": "David Reese",
            "content": "Thanks, Murdo, and good afternoon, everyone. For R&D, last quarter was one of high quality execution as we progressed our innovative pipeline with multiple registration enabling studies on track. In general medicine, we advanced our cardiovascular franchise in emerging portfolio of obesity molecules with a focus on clinical execution. Let's start with Olpasiran. Phase 3 outcome study in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is enrolling well. In March, we presented additional data demonstrating that Olpasiran markedly reduced Lp(a) concentration irrespective of baseline levels in individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and Lp(a) levels greater than 150 nanomoles per liter. We also initiated the African-American heart study in collaboration with the Association of Black Cardiologists and the Morehouse School of Medicine. This study will measure the association between Lp(a) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in 5000 African-American individuals. African-Americans show a higher average Lp(a) concentration than white individuals, but Lp(a) research to date has primarily been conducted in those of European descent. We are collaborating on the African-American Heart Study to bridge this gap. Turning to obesity, we are rapidly enrolling a Phase 2 study of AMG133in patients with obesity with or without diabetes and related comorbidities. The study will investigate different dosing levels and regimens with the overall goal of generating data that will provide broad optionality to design a Phase 3 program that will deliver strong, sustainable weight loss. A Phase 1 trial of AMG 786, a small molecule targeting non-incretin pathways in obesity is enrolling patients. Multiple preclinical molecules, all with different mechanisms of action than GLP-1 or GIPR based therapies are also advancing towards the clinic. In inflammation beyond severe asthma, we are investigating multiple additional indications with TEZSPIRE, including separate Phase 3 studies in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. We also have two Phase 2 studies, one in chronic spontaneous urticaria and the other in COPD. The CSU study is complete with top line data anticipated in mid-2023. The COPD trial is fully enrolled and has recruited a broad population of COPD patients, including patients with both high and low eosinophil counts. Emerging evidence suggests that TSLP is involved in chronic inflammatory disorders, including COPD and that TSLP may be a key driver of the severe exacerbations experienced by COPD patients. We look forward to the readout of this study in the first half of 2024. Rocatinlimab potentially first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody being investigated in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Recruitment is off to a strong start on the ROCKET Phase 3 clinical development program. This program is a suite of seven studies that will establish safety and efficacy in a broad population of patients with atopic dermatitis, including biologic naive, biologic or JAK experienced, diverse ethnic groups and adolescents and also testing different dosing regimens, including the potential for monthly or less frequent dosing. We were encouraged to see Horizon report on the statistically significant and clinically meaningful top line results from a Phase 4 clinical trial of TEPEZZA. As revised FDA label states TEPEZZA is indicated for the treatment of thyroid eye disease regardless of clinical activity score or disease duration. Phase 2b studies in systemic lupus erythematosus of rozibafusp alfa and efavaleukin alfa were stopped for futility. These studies utilize novel adaptive designs, which enabled us to generate decision making data more quickly, and cost effectively. SLE remains a challenging area for drug development, one that will be an area of focus for us as we further explore these data sets to advance our knowledge in the field. In addition to our organic pipeline, we look forward to incorporating the Horizon molecules upon deal close to further enhance our efforts to address inflammatory disease. In oncology. global regulatory submissions are planned in the second half of 2023 for E1910, a Phase three trial led by the ECOG ACRIN Cooperative Group, demonstrating that addition of BLINCYTO to standard of care consolidation, chemotherapy significantly increased overall survival versus standard of care in MRD negative adult patients with newly diagnosed B-cell ALL. Beyond this study, we are investing to move BLINCYTO into earlier lines of treatment and to improve patient convenience through subcutaneous administration. DeLLphi-304, a Phase 3 study comparing tarlatamab, BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 with standard of care chemotherapy in second line small cell lung cancer will be initiated this month. We'll have top line data from a potentially registrational Phase 2 study of tarlatamab and heavily pretreated patients with small cell lung cancer in the second half of 2023, potential milestone for patients with small cell lung cancer. As you are aware, we are exploring novel combinations with LUMAKRAS. Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS in combination with Vectibix in third line colorectal cancer is fully enrolled with data readout anticipated in the second half of 2023. We plan to initiate a Phase 3 study of LUMAKRAS and chemotherapy in first line non-small cell lung cancer in PDL-1 negative patients. At ASCO, data will be presented from studies of LUMAKRAS in combination with standard of care, chemotherapy and non-small cell lung cancer and in combination with Vectibix and standard of care chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. We also completed submission of the LUMAKRAS code break 200 data along with data from the Phase 2 dose comparison Substudy to the US FDA and to the European Medicines Agency or EMA. For AMG 509, a steep one targeting bispecific now named Xaluritamig. We have determined target doses and open monotherapy expansion cohorts in patients with advanced prostate cancer. We look forward to sharing initial data in the second half of 2023. To add to our growing biosimilars portfolio, we are pleased to announce that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for BEKEMV our biosimilar to SOLIRIS. BEKEMV is the first biosimilar to SOLIRIS approved by the EC and is approved only for the treatment of adults and children with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria or PNH, a rare life threatening bone marrow disorder. We have also submitted the US Biologics license application to the FDA for this product. Additionally, Phase 3 switching study to support an interchangeability designation in the US using an investigational high concentration formulation of AMGEVITA met its primary endpoint of similarity for the primary pharmacokinetics endpoints. In conclusion, I would like to thank Amgen staff around the world for their relentless focus on execution as we work hard to meet the needs of the patients we serve. I'll now turn things over to Peter. Yeah, thanks, Salveen. All of the indications that we're pursuing have some mechanistic basis. Chronic spontaneous urticarial is an eosinophilic driven disease in part as is eosinophilic esophagitis. And given the mechanism of T-cell inhibition that underlay the thinking behind pursuing those indications. As I've mentioned briefly in COPD as another example, the -- there is accumulating evidence that triggers such as viral infection, smoke particles from pollutants can trigger TSLP release from bronchial epithelium. These are consistent with data showing that in patients with COPD, TSLP levels are elevated in sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and bronchial mucosa. And so as I mentioned that trial is fully enrolled. We expect a data readout, given the duration of therapy that one wants to see in these patients in the first half of next year. So I think there's good mechanistic basis. We're in clinical trial execution mode now and really waiting data readouts. I think what you said at the end there is very important, Mike, you know, in terms of everything that's going on in obesity. If we just step back for a second and think about what the magnitude of the problem is here, you know, there are hundreds of millions of patients now globally. We are doing an experiment in the 21st century that the world has never done by creating an obesity crisis. Now we call obesity a single disease, but it is clearly a complex, heterogeneous disorder. There are undoubtedly patient subsets buried within that. And different patients may well, you know, benefit from different therapies. This is an disorder that's rooted in human evolution and now is a function of our environment. And so our development program for both 133 and for the molecules that will follow behind really intends to capitalize on the fact that there's a very large volume of patients. It's a heterogeneous disorder. I think this is a field that is in its infancy and we have a chance to help define what those patient subsets are and who will benefit from specific therapies using, for example, you know, our industry leading database of multi-omic profiling, which we, you know, intend to employ aggressively in these development programs. You mentioned AMG 786, and I'll just conclude with a comment on that. That is a non-incretin based mechanism of action. And I think that is also an area that will be very fertile for drug development and it's a focus of us pre-clinically as well right now. So thanks for the question. It's early days, but we think that this is one of the big public health challenges of the current century. Yes. Thanks. Look, the trial is fully enrolled. We're bringing in data. I think within a few months, we're going to have the data set in hand. I think I've outlined mechanistically why TSLP being upstream could be one of the triggers that, if inhibited, could serve to -- as a therapy for the disease. At this point, I think it's really just getting the data set. Yes. And I would add, the other component is technology platforms. Bob mentioned briefly in his opening remarks the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I think we've quietly become a leader in this area. We are using artificial intelligence and machine learning across the R&D spectrum now from molecular engineering, where we've been extraordinarily pleased with -- it's the effect of dry labs or in silico design on the engineering of new protein molecules in time frames that are much, much shorter than were previously achievable with a higher success rate, success here being defined as a candidate going forward that has the molecular attributes that you want. We are using it extensively in the clinical trials arena for site selection, for example, and other aspects of trial design. So this is something that I'll talk about more as we go through the course of the year. But these sorts of technology platforms lead us to what I think is an absolute hinge moment in this industry where the union of tech and biotech will move us forward to a qualitatively different time in drug discovery and drug development. And I think we're going to be very well positioned to take advantage of this union."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at conclusion of the last speakers\u2019 prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin.\nJustin Claeys: Thank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Vikram Karnani, Jay Bradner and Peter Griffith. Through the course of our discussion today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements, which are qualified by our safe harbor statement, and please note that actual results can vary materially. Over to you, Bob.\nRobert Bradway: Thank you for joining us today. Our performance this quarter reflects the strength of our business across our core therapeutic areas and geographies. Our in-market medicines performed well in the quarter with third quarter revenues up 23% to $8.5 billion and 10 of our products delivering double-digit or better sales growth. We're also rapidly advancing our pipeline with a significant number of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class medicines, positioning us for long-term growth. Let me address MariTide directly. Our ongoing Phase II study is progressing well, and we look forward to sharing results later this year. We're well advanced in preparing to launch a broad Phase III program for MariTide, including obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. You may have noted that we recently initiated a Phase II study in patients with type 2 diabetes. As we shared after the interim analysis, we're confident that MariTide's differentiated profile will address important unmet medical needs across a number of diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Beyond obesity, we have momentum across each of our therapeutic areas, and I'll start with oncology. In the third quarter, we saw strong in-market performance with 17% sales growth across the innovative oncology portfolio and several products experienced double-digit growth, including BLINCYTO, which, of course, is our first bispecific T cell engager or BiTE, which is now established as the standard of care in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The launch of our next BiTE IMDELLTRA is also progressing well with strong clinical conviction and three Phase III studies underway in small cell lung cancer. And further demonstrating the strength and promise of this platform in solid tumors, we're pleased to announce today that we will advance xaluritamig into Phase III clinical development in advanced prostate cancer in the fourth quarter. Let me remind you to also keep an eye out for Phase III bemarituzumab data in gastric cancer, which we should have in the next few months. Our rare disease portfolio delivered $1.2 billion of sales in the quarter, growing 21% year-over-year, driven by TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA, UPLIZNA and TAVNEOS. These medicines are highly innovative, are still in the early stages of their life cycles and have significant upside potential, including expansion into new indications and geographies. For example, TEPEZZA was recently approved in Japan. Also in rare disease, UPLIZNA demonstrated compelling data in generalized myasthenia gravis and was granted breakthrough therapy designation in IgG4-related diseases. We're excited about the promise of inebilizumab in these settings and potentially in other B cell mediated autoimmune diseases. In inflammation, TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with 67% growth year-over-year in the quarter. We're further encouraged by the potential of TEZSPIRE in COPD and additional indications that we're also actively exploring. And finally, in General Medicine, Repatha and EVENITY are each delivering strong volume growth again this quarter. These products are pivotal as we continue to serve more patients and meet the growing demand for therapies that address some of the most serious health challenges worldwide, like heart disease and osteoporosis. Looking ahead, we remain confident that Amgen is well positioned to deliver long-term growth and innovation across each of our therapeutic areas. Our balanced portfolio, combined with the strength of our pipeline, we think will continue to drive our business forward. As always, I'd like to thank my colleagues across Amgen for their unwavering commitment to patients. And I want to now turn the call over to Murdo.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Bob. Execution was strong across our core therapeutic areas in the third quarter, driving 24% year-over-year product sales growth. Each of our regions delivered double-digit volume growth. And sales of 10 products grew by double-digits or better, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO, EVENITY and TAVNEOS, all brands that are important to our future growth trajectory. Starting with our general medicine portfolio, sales of Repatha, EVENITY and Prolia collectively grew 18% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by volume growth. We serve large patient populations with these therapies. For example, we expect Repatha and Prolia alone will help over 11 million patients in 2024. Repatha sales increased 40% year-over-year to $567 million for the third quarter, now annualizing at over $2 billion in sales. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year volume growth of 41% and favorable changes to estimated sales deductions of 8%, partially offset by lower net selling price of 10%. In the U.S., our expanded primary care field force efforts drove a 50% year-over-year increase in primary care physician prescribers. U.S. volume growth was enabled by broad reimbursement and removal of prior authorization requirements by several payers. Outside the U.S., Repatha retains category leadership and continues to grow across major markets despite increased competition in the segment. EVENITY sales increased 30% year-over-year to almost $400 million for the third quarter. In the U.S., EVENITY continues to be the segment leader with 61% of the bone builder market. Strong U.S. volume growth was supported by an increase in prescription volume from both established and new EVENITY prescribers with a 34% quarter-over-quarter increase in new provider accounts ordering EVENITY. In Japan, EVENITY continues to hold a leading position with 47% of the bone builder segment. Since launching in Japan in 2019, EVENITY has been prescribed to approximately 600,000 patients. EVENITY sales are now annualizing at approximately $1.5 billion. We're encouraged by the growth momentum we are driving and have conviction in the potential for EVENITY to help the many more women globally who remain at risk of a fracture due to their post-menopausal osteoporosis. Prolia sales increased 6% year-over-year to $1 billion for the third quarter, driven by 9% volume growth. In the U.S., we see broad prescribing base with more than 13,000 provider accounts using Prolia so far this year. In inflammation, TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with $269 million in sales in the third quarter. Sales increased 67% year-over-year, supported by TEZSPIRE's uniquely differentiated profile and increased adoption by pulmonologists. We're encouraged by the growth of TEZSPIRE to date and its potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma. Otezla sales decreased 1% year-over-year for the third quarter with 5% volume growth. This volume growth was offset by 7% lower net selling price. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the more than 1.5 million systemic treatment-naive U.S. patients with milder psoriasis who cannot be optimally addressed by a topical treatment. Enbrel sales decreased 20% year-over-year for the third quarter, primarily driven by 13% unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and 12% lower net selling price. Volumes grew 4% in the quarter. Going forward, we expect continued declining net selling price, relatively stable volume, providing strong cash flow for our business. Sales of our biosimilar products increased 9% year-over-year in the third quarter. We have fully deployed our team in support of the recent U.S. launch of PAVBLU, a biosimilar to EYLEA. Our teams moved quickly to engage retina specialists, and we're encouraged by the enthusiastic feedback from customers. Our teams are also ready for the upcoming U.S. launches of WEZLANA, a biosimilar to STELARA and BEKEMV, a biosimilar to Solaris, expected in the first and second quarters of 2025, respectively. Overall, our biosimilars portfolio continues to deliver attractive returns driven by our efficient business model. In oncology, sales of our seven innovative products, BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate, XGEVA and IMDELLTRA grew 17% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by volume growth and higher net selling price. In total, these products contributed over $2 billion of sales in the third quarter. BLINCYTO sales grew 49% year-over-year to $327 million for the third quarter. Growth was supported by the recent expansion of the BLINCYTO label, now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell ALL in the consolidation phase regardless of measurable residual disease status. Our U.S. launch of IMDELLTRA is progressing well, generating $36 million of sales in the third quarter. There's strong clinical conviction in both academic and community settings, driven by IMDELLTRA's breakthrough efficacy. We have a strong sense of urgency to bring IMDELLTRA to patients living with this aggressive disease. LUMAKRAS sales increased 88% year-over-year to $98 million for the third quarter. Vectibix sales increased 12% year-over-year to $282 million for the third quarter, now annualizing at over $1 billion. And KYPROLIS grew 8% year-over-year to $378 million in the quarter. Nplate sales increased 9% to $456 million for the third quarter. If we exclude government sales, Nplate sales grew 18% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by 14% volume growth and higher net selling price. We've made significant progress in this quarter, driving execution and accelerating performance of our most important growth brands. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram, who will cover our rare disease portfolio.\nVikram Karnani: Thank you, Murdo. I am pleased to provide an update on rare disease, which delivered product sales of $1.2 billion in Q3. Beginning with TEPEZZA for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, third quarter sales were $488 million, reflecting growth of 8% year-over-year when compared to results from the legacy Horizon business. Recall, there are roughly 100,000 TED patients in the U.S. and penetration is currently only in the single digits. We are excited about the growth opportunity presented by the roughly 80% of TED patients who have a lower clinical activity score, or CAS. As we have discussed previously, to more effectively reach these patients, we have recently reorganized and expanded our field force into two separate and dedicated teams, one focused on comprehensive ophthalmologists and ocular specialists and the other focused on endocrinologists. This approach reflects an optimized footprint to continue to serve patients with high CAS disease while expanding our reach to those patients with low CAS disease who can benefit from TEPEZZA. We made this change in the third quarter. And over the last few weeks, these teams have been actively focused on establishing new relationships with potential new prescribers. We expect this optimized focus to gain traction over the next few quarters as physicians become more experienced identifying the right patients for treatment and navigating the reimbursement process to enable access to TEPEZZA. Following our 8% year-over-year growth this quarter, we remain confident in the long-term potential for TEPEZZA in the U.S. as we expand our reach to patients with low CAS disease and continue to work closely with payers to expand access. International expansion remains a key growth opportunity with regulatory filings completed or in progress across multiple regions. TEPEZZA's approval in Japan in September marked a key milestone ahead of its launch, which is expected by early 2025. We also initiated a Phase III subcutaneous study and see this as an opportunity to increase adoption and improve the patient experience with an alternative option to our current IV formulation. KRYSTEXXA for patients with chronic refractory gout delivered $310 million in sales in Q3, representing 23% year-over-year growth driven by volume growth from strong commercial execution. KRYSTEXXA with immunomodulation has established a new standard of care for chronic refractory gout. UPLIZNA for patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or NMOSD, delivered $106 million in sales in Q3, representing 58% year-over-year growth. International expansion of UPLIZNA is also underway with launches in multiple markets, including Canada, which launched earlier this year. Additionally, we're excited by the growth potential of UPLIZNA driven by the striking data in both IgG4-related disease, which affects over 20,000 patients in the U.S. and generalized myasthenia gravis or gMG, which affects nearly 80,000 to 100,000 patients in the U.S. Sales of TAVNEOS were $80 million for the third quarter. Sales increased 116% year-over-year, driven by volume growth. In the U.S., more than 4,300 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis have been treated with TAVNEOS. Over 2,600 health care professionals have now prescribed TAVNEOS, a roughly 53% increase in the prescriber base so far this year. As we reflect on the past year, it's clear how far we've come in the integration and how well we're progressing. I want to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to all the team members that are working tirelessly to serve the needs of patients suffering from rare diseases. Looking ahead, we're excited about the opportunities and confident in what we'll achieve in our rare disease business and beyond. Now I'll hand it over to Jay for our R&D update.\nJames Bradner: Thank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. In the third quarter, we made significant progress advancing our broad clinical pipeline, which includes a number of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class therapies. Since our last update, we have initiated a Phase II study of MariTide in type 2 diabetes and delivered positive potentially practice changing Phase III data with UPLIZNA in generalized myasthenia gravis. Additionally, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for UPLIZNA in IgG4-related diseases underscoring the important potential impact of this medicine. We also showcased promising data from several oncology programs at major medical conferences, including IMDELLTRA, xaluritamig and AMG 193, while reporting positive results from the first of eight Phase III studies evaluating rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis. Let's begin with general medicine. As previously mentioned, based upon the interim analysis of the ongoing Phase II study of MariTide in chronic weight management, we are seeing a differentiated profile and are confident MariTide will address important unmet medical needs in obesity, obesity-related conditions in type 2 diabetes. We remain on track and look forward to top line 52-week data from the MariTide Phase II study in late 2024. We are actively planning and expect to initiate a broad Phase III program in obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. This quarter, we initiated a dedicated Phase II trial investigating MariTide in patients with type 2 diabetes, living with and without obesity. MariTide has the potential to be the first therapy in this setting with monthly or even less frequent dosing. Beyond MariTide, our Phase I trial of AMG 513 is actively enrolling patients. We also continue to advance our preclinical obesity programs, which include both oral and injectable approaches comprising both incretin and non-incretin mechanisms. Also in general medicine is olpasiran, our potentially best-in-class LP(a) targeting small interfering RNA medicine. The fully enrolled Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial of olpasiran continues to progress. In oncology, IMDELLTRA, a first-in-class bispecific T cell engager or BiTE molecule, targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer is rapidly advancing into earlier lines of therapy with three Phase III studies underway in both extensive stage and limited stage disease. To further enhance the patient experience, we are evaluating reduced monitoring protocols as part of the Phase III program, and we have initiated a Phase Ib study evaluating subcutaneous tarlatamab in patients with second line or later extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. In September, we presented impressive follow-up data from our DeLLphi 301 Phase II study of IMDELLTRA in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer, demonstrating sustained anticancer activity and a manageable safety profile. We also presented data from DeLLphi 303, the Phase Ib study of IMDELLTRA combined with a PD-L1 inhibitor as maintenance therapy following four cycles of chemotherapy and first-line extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. This design is similar to our ongoing Phase III study, DeLLphi 305, which test the efficacy of IMDELLTRA and PD-L1 inhibition versus PD-L1 inhibition alone, in first-line extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, following platinum-based chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 10 months, IMDELLTRA has demonstrated a manageable safety profile, median duration of disease control of 9.3 months, median progression-free survival of 5.6 months and a nine month estimated overall survival of 89%. Moving to our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific molecule, xaluritamig, we are pleased to announce that following consultation with regulatory authorities, we will initiate a Phase III study in post-taxane metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, this quarter. The promise of xaluritamig was recently evidenced by data presented in September from a Phase I dose exploration cohort evaluating monotherapy in patients with mCRPC. With a median follow-up of 27.9 months, the median overall survival was 17.7 months across all cohorts, a potential improvement upon the historical median survival of 12 to 15 months in this patient population. Additional data from a Phase I randomized dose expansion and optimization cohort has identified the recommended dose and schedule for Phase III clinical investigation. Additionally, we are studying xaluritamig in earlier lines of therapy in combination and in earlier stages of prostate cancer. Our Phase I study of xaluritamig in combination with enzalutamide and abiraterone is ongoing. Recently, we have initiated two additional Phase Ib studies investigating xaluritamig in the upfront management of more localized disease. The first study evaluates neoadjuvant xaluritamig therapy that is prior to radical prostatectomy in patients with newly diagnosed, localized, intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer. The second study evaluates xaluritamig in high-risk non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer after definitive therapy. We are particularly excited about the potential of xaluritamig, now our third bispecific T cell engager entering late-stage clinical development. Beyond our T cell engagers, we have completed enrollment of FORTITUDE-102, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab, our first-in-class fibroblast growth factor receptor IIb directed monoclonal antibody combined with chemotherapy and nivolumab in first-line gastric cancer. In the coming months, we expect to read out the results of FORTITUDE-101, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab combined with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in first-line gastric cancer. This study was designed based on the successful Phase II FIGHT study, which reported numerically longer progression-free survival and overall survival. Lastly, we are also rapidly advancing AMG 193, our oral PRMT5 inhibitor developed for MTAP-null solid tumors. We recently initiated a Phase II study of AMG 193 in patients with MTAP-null previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This study will help to address regulatory agency requirements for dose optimization and selection. In September, we presented encouraging data from a Phase I dose escalation and initial dose expansion study, demonstrating promising monotherapy activity and an acceptable safety profile. Turning to inflammation. Based upon encouraging Phase II data from TEZSPIRE in patients with COPD, we are planning to initiate Phase III studies in collaboration with AstraZeneca. These trials will target patients with moderate to very severe COPD with blood eosinophil counts greater than or equal to 150 cells per microliter. We expect to begin enrollment in the first half of 2025. TEZSPIRE is also being investigated in separate Phase III studies of patients with eosinophilic esophagitis and in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected later this year. In September, we announced positive results from the Phase III Horizon study of rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis. The study met its co-primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints. We anticipate additional data readouts from the ROCKET program will deepen our understanding of rocatinlimab profile. Beyond atopic dermatitis, we continue to explore rocatinlimab in moderate to severe asthma and prurigo nodularis. To expand the impact of our CD19 directed therapeutics for even more patients suffering from serious inflammatory diseases, we have initiated Phase II studies of blinatumomab our CD19 targeting BiTE molecule approved as BLINCYTO and inebilizumab, our CD19 targeting monoclonal antibody approved as UPLIZNA. These studies build on mounting evidence of therapeutic benefit for B-cell depletion in autoimmune diseases from small investigator-sponsored trials of blinatumomab in systemic sclerosis and refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Our initial focus will be on systemic lupus erythematosus with nephritis with plans to expand into additional indications. Shifting to rare disease. We recently presented potentially practice-changing results from the Phase III MINT study, the largest placebo-controlled trial for a biologic therapy in generalized myothenia gravis. MINT evaluated UPLIZNA in both acetylcholine receptor autoantibody positive ACHR positive and muscle-specific kinase autoantibody positive or MuSK-positive populations. At the reported 26-week time point, UPLIZNA demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in the myasthenia gravis activities of daily living score after just two doses compared to placebo. This efficacy was observed in the combined ACHR and MuSK-positive populations as well as in each population separately. UPLIZNA also achieved statistically significant improvements in the quantitative myasthenia gravis score, compared to placebo at week 26 in the combined populations. Importantly, in the MINT study, patients taking corticosteroids were tapered down starting at week 4 to a 5-milligram per day dose by week 24. MINT is the first and only Phase III placebo-controlled myasthenia gravis trial for a biologic that tapered corticosteroid use. As such, the efficacy observed with UPLIZNA in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis offers a chance for meaningful benefit without the burden and toxicity of chronic steroid use. We look forward to 52-week data for the ACHR positive cohort and results from both ACHR positive and MuSK-positive patient populations. In the open-label period of the MINT study, where UPLIZNA has the potential to demonstrate durable efficacy. Moving beyond generalized myasthenia gravis in August, the FDA granted UPLIZNA Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related diseases, or IgG4-related disease based upon data from the Phase III MITIGATE study. This data will be presented at the American College of Rheumatology Conference in November. We are extremely encouraged by the potential of UPLIZNA in both myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease and are actively working to file these data with regulatory authorities. In closing, I want to thank my Amgen colleagues for their unwavering commitment to patients facing grievous illnesses for the focus and for the collaboration during this productive year. I'll now turn it over to Peter for the financial update.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong third quarter performance and are on track with our 2024 full year goals and long-term objectives. We have a strong long-term growth outlook with breadth and depth across each of our four therapeutic areas, including our innovative pipeline and in-market products, serving patients with serious illnesses around the globe. We will continue to allocate capital to innovation first and with our strong cash flows, also intend to fund our other capital allocation priorities. Starting with our third quarter results as shown on Slide 28 of the slide deck, we delivered $8.5 billion in total revenues, a 23% year-over-year increase. Excluding the addition of Horizon, product sales increased 8% year-over-year, driven by 12% volume growth. In the U.S., our sales in the quarter were impacted by $173 million and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. In the third quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 49.6% as a percentage of product sales with total non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 27% year-over-year, largely driven by the addition of Horizon. Non-GAAP R&D spending in the third quarter increased 35% year-over-year to $1.4 billion as we invested in the rapidly advancing late-stage pipeline including MariTide, bemarituzumab and olpasiran as well as Horizon acquired programs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 21% year-over-year, primarily driven by the addition of Horizon, excluding the addition of Horizon, non-GAAP SG&A expenses were relatively flat year-over-year. The Horizon integration is progressing well, and we expect to reach $500 million in pretax cost synergies by year three post-acquisition with more than 50% to be realized by the end of this year. The acquisition is accretive to non-GAAP EPS year-to-date, and we expect it to be for the full year as well. Our non-GAAP OI&E resulted in a $554 million expense, up $329 million year-over-year, almost entirely due to increased interest expense from the Horizon acquisition. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with $2.5 billion of debt retired in the third quarter and expect to return to our pre-Horizon acquisition capital structure by the end of 2025. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 2.7 percentage points year-over-year to 13.4%, primarily due to the change in earnings mix from the inclusion of Horizon. In the third quarter of 2024, the company generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $2.5 billion from the previous year. Our strong cash flows enable investing in our business for long-term growth, including advancing our exciting pipeline opportunities and expanding capacity in our state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and facilities. Our past investments enable us to serve a significant number of patients today. For example, with over 43 million units expected for Repatha and Prolia alone in 2024, ongoing and future investments will support MariTide and other products across the portfolio. In addition, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid competitive dividend of $2.25 per share in the second quarter, this represented a 6% increase compared to 2023. Let's turn to the outlook for the business for 2024 on Slide 30. We expect our 2024 total revenues in the range of $33.0 billion to $33.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS between $19.20 to $20. We do expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be lower than Q3 non-GAAP EPS, because of planned investment increases in our business, including key assets in our innovative pipeline beginning with MariTide and olpasiran and other strategic business investments. This sequential pattern is consistent with historical trends. Let me mention a few consideration as you model the remainder of 2024. We now project full year new asset sales at approximately $400 million and other revenue at approximately $1.4 billion. We expect TEPEZZA sales in Q4 to be flat to slightly down versus the third quarter, resulting in full year sales being up roughly 5% year-over-year as compared to the full year of TEPEZZA sales in 2023. Consistent with prior years, we expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to be the highest of the year and expect approximately 28% of our full year operating expenses to be in the fourth quarter. This includes additional investments to drive momentum into 2025, for example, in key brands like Repatha and EVENITY. For the full year, our total non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow approximately 25% year-over-year, including from the addition of Horizon. We still expect full year non-GAAP R&D growth of more than 25% year-over-year. We now expect OI&E to be approximately $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion, which includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition. We now expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be in the 14% to 15% range, including the full year benefits associated with the inclusion of the Horizon business and favorable items in the quarter identified in the return to provision process. Finally, our capital expenditure guidance remains at $1.3 billion for 2024. Our long-term growth outlook remains strong and I'm grateful to our colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serving patients. This concludes our financial update. I'll now hand it back to Bob for our Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]\nRobert Bradway: Thank you, Julianne. Sorry, go ahead.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. The Phase II MariTide data clearly remains the key update into year-end. Can you help us understand what you will share with regard to this update in terms of actual data and also the Phase III developmental plan and timelines and when we might get an update from the other obesity programs? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: Okay. It sounded like a few questions there, Salveen. As we said, we're continuing to be very excited about the prospects for MariTide, and we added the disclosure on this call that we have begun the Phase II study in type 2 diabetes. The conduct of the trial is continuing to progress well, and we're expecting to have the data here by the end of the year. And when we have those data, we'll obviously look forward to being able to share that with our investors.\nJustin Claeys: Julianne, let\u2019s go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, Salveen. Our next question comes from Olivia Brayer from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nOlivia Brayer: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for the question. You are getting a lot closer to kicking off a Phase III MariTide program. So how do you think about the level of spend that will go into that kind of undertaking? I mean I assume we're looking at billions as it relates to investments just around R&D, but also manufacturing. But yes, hoping you guys can put some numbers around it or at least better characterize how you're thinking about things from here. Also hoping you can clarify whether or not you have seen those Phase II data in-house?\nRobert Bradway: So with respect to the Phase III trial, we would reiterate that we are expecting to pursue a broad Phase III trial in obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. It will be, we would expect a large global trial, fully exploring the molecule. And Jay, I'd invite you to add any color you'd like about the Phase III program. But obviously, our investment will reflect our view that this is a differentiated molecule, and we look forward to having the full characterization of its safety and efficacy profile.\nJames Bradner: Yeah. Thanks, Bob. We're fully on track actively planning and expect to initiate a broad Phase III program. This will include obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes, as you've heard already, we're progressing the Phase II study to characterize dose response, tolerability efficacy in patients. Importantly, without obesity but having type 2 diabetes. So we're fully on track, actively planning the broad program.\nRobert Bradway: And we'll -- as part of our normal guidance process in the coming year, I'm sure we'll give an updated perspective then that reflects our plans for the Phase III trial. And then we'll also add any perspective that may be helpful on the capital expenditure front. I think what I just would remind you is that this molecule is designed on our existing antibody platform. It fits very well with our network as currently configured. And so again, we'll have more to say about that through time as necessary.\nPeter Griffith: Maybe to suggest, Bob -- Olivia, it's Peter here. I would just remind you of Amgen's long history of being a leader in the science and manufacturing and process development that creates opportunities in terms of how we might view yield going forward. So while it might not just be bricks, mortar and steel, yield is really important, and we've got a really strong history in that. And we did raise the CapEx guide this year, as you know, to about $1.3 billion. We're very thoughtful about that. And you also heard me mention that research and development spend up 35% quarter-over-quarter to the prior year. We expect it to be up over 25% for the year. So we certainly are investing where we always say we will in innovation and MariTide is right at the front of that, and we look forward to investing to be a key player in this global public health crisis.\nJustin Claeys: Julliane, let\u2019s take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Olivia. Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Yee: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe for Jay, it sounds like you guys are quite confident about MariTide, and yet you are also building a greater portfolio I think you announced 513. And yet you also don't have an oral, I don't believe so. Can you just comment about your philosophy or thinking about the totality of the portfolio given 133 is so far in the Phase III, but the other things are so early, and whether you believe you have the portfolio today to be competitive with everybody else who have so many things at late stage? Thank you.\nJames Bradner: Thanks, Mike. I really appreciate the question. With MariTide, we're really pleased with the execution of the study await data later this year, fully focused as I shared on setting up the broad Phase III program. The development of additional medicines for obesity and obesity-related conditions is a source of really active investigation here, preclinically and clinically now with 513 as you nicely mentioned. We've not as yet disclosed the mechanism of action of 513, which is a very interesting program. And as you note, and this is on clinicaltrials.gov, the SAD/MAD ascending dose study has been announced is enrolling and feature subcutaneous or intravenous administration. To reach smaller segments, other segments within the obesity landscape to serve all the patients with obesity and it's related conditions. We, like many others, are interested in both injectable as well as oral non-injectable medicines. We're very interested in incretin pathway as well as non incretin pathway mechanisms of action, and our portfolio reflects each of these.\nJustin Claeys: Julliane, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCourtney Breen: Thank you so much for the question today. Just anchoring on some of the conversations that you shared around the Horizon products and specifically TEPEZZA. Can you please provide some more context on the path to growth and when you expect to see the impact of the sales team there, particularly in the context of the final comments that we shared in terms of expectations for Q4 relative to Q3.\nRobert Bradway: Yeah. Let's take it in a couple of pieces. First, as you heard us say, the quarter grew 8%. Vikram, why don't you just remind our investors of the plans for expanding Salesforce and then also perhaps speak to Japan or international more general?\nVikram Karnani: Yeah. Thanks, Bob. So as Bob just said and as I said in my prepared remarks, TEPEZZA grew 8% year-over-year. And as we have also said previously, we're continuing to focus on growth coming not only from the high CAS patients, but also the 80,000 -- roughly 80,000 patients that suffer from low CAS disease. What we have learned over our time serving these patients and these prescribers is that in order to most effectively reach these low CAS patients, we need to have a dedicated effort towards both comprehensive ophthalmologists and ocular specialists -- as well as endocrinologists. And what we have found is that type of coverage is necessary in order to serve the 80,000 or so low CAS disease patients that we have discussed previously. This approach reflects an optimized footprint. We believe that this approach will allow us to not only help the right physicians and new prescribers find the right patients for TEPEZZA, but also help to enable access to TEPEZZA the most appropriate way. Finally, what I would say here is we -- this is something that has been -- we've been working on for a little bit here. And this change occurred in the third quarter. So we do expect the momentum to play out here in the next several quarters. In the last few weeks, the teams have been actively focused on establishing new relationships with these new prescribers, and we look forward to updating you as we go. Final point on the global aspects of TEPEZZA. As you're aware, beyond the U.S., we are also looking forward to bringing to TEPEZZA to patients around the globe, including Japan. Japan is a really important country for us in terms of our next launch. Let me remind you that we received approval in Japan for TEPEZZA with high CAS patients in September, and we're actively working to an early 2025 launch there as well.\nJustin Claeys: Julianne, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, Courtney. Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a two part question on MariTide, if I may. Perhaps, first, from a vomiting profile perspective, I recall in the Phase I trial, specifically in Phase I, the vomiting profile was generally fairly consistent between low and high doses, which would imply perhaps titration in and of itself may not solve for vomiting. But Jay, I'm curious, is there anything super important in the design of Phase I which wasn't incorporated that could have addressed that vomiting. That's number one. And then secondly, on the cadence of weight loss, is there any reason to expect the plateau in weight loss to not happen before -- do not happen past month seven or so because we've seen other GLP trials kind of do that in six to seven months post titration. Thank you very much.\nJames Bradner: Yeah. Thanks, Umer. I really appreciate it. The Phase I study published now in January has been pretty thoroughly considered. This was a standard Phase I dose escalation study that did not have antecedent dose titration. So if that answers your question, I suppose there's only so much that can be learned from the Phase I. We're honestly just really focused on these Phase II data, where at the interim, we saw the differentiated profile. And as you know, we're in Phase III planning. Regarding weight loss plateau, this will be an interesting thing to observe and learn from the data, which we wait later this year.\nJustin Claeys: All right. Julianne, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, Umer. Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJay Olson: Congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking the question. Maybe I'll shift gears to oncology. Congrats on all the progress and impressive growth, especially for BLINCYTO. For subcu BLINCYTO, it looks like the registrational study is now going to initiate in the second half of next year. Can you talk about what may have changed there and maybe share some color on the plans for that study? Thank you.\nJames Bradner: Yeah. Thanks, Jay. This is Jay. The subcutaneous development of BLINCYTO is a major priority for us. We're very encouraged by the efficacy that we've seen with subcutaneous BLINCYTO in prior studies. You'll remember perhaps that this medicine is dosed 3 times a week. We did a Phase I study back in 2022 at ASH with striking data, among 21 evaluable patients, we saw 67% CR rate within one cycle. There's been further data in the American Journal of Hematology since that time, 27 patients with an 85% CR rate, 75% of whom were MRD negative. And this is all without any grade for CRS. So subcutaneous BLINCYTO was a major priority for us. It is progressing in clinical investigation. And there's really nothing to read into the timing that you allude to in your excellent question. Thank you.\nJustin Claeys: All right. Julianne, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, Jay. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two part on MariTide as well. Just wondering if you can confirm if the data disclosure will be a press release or it will be at a conference. I think the Phase I data were presented at the insulin resistance conference in December. So just wondering the venue. And then for the Phase III, Jay, do you think you're going to have to make any changes to the titration schedule you employed in Phase II? I know Lilly had extended their tirzepatide titration schedule when they move from Phase II to Phase III. Do you think that's something that could be necessary here? Thank you.\nRobert Bradway: In terms of the release, Terence and how we share that with investors. Well, again, we're focused on getting the data in hand and when we have them, we'll try to do whatever in best interest of the shareholders. So stay tuned as soon as we have them. We look forward to being able to report those. And Jay, do you want to address the question on Phase III?\nJames Bradner: The Phase III planning, as we've shared, is fully on track, and we won't today give any news or insights into our approach to dosing, but we feel confident it will be well informed by the Phase II study that is ongoing, and we'll read out later this year.\nJustin Claeys: Next question, please, Julianne.\nOperator: Thank you, Terence. Our next question comes from Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I want to maybe switch it up a little bit and ask you around the PAVBLU launch. Amgen's biosimilars have some have gone really well, others a little bit less so. You've historically talked about the importance of being first. But how do you think about adoption ahead of a Q code and in discussions with any payers, your expectation or step edits for biosimilars ahead of some of the other newer entrants? Thanks.\nRobert Bradway: Yeah. Thanks, Carter. Murdo, why don't you share your thoughts in general on the biosimilar franchise. We don't often get a chance to talk about it, but please also on PAVBLU.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Bob. We're obviously quite excited about the next wave of launch is not just PAVBLU, but our other biosimilar launches that we are expecting in the not-too-distant future, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, with WEZLANA and BEKEMV. On PAVBLU, as you mentioned, Carter, it's important to be first or in the first wave. And clearly, we're in that position now as we're launching this product as we speak. And we expect there to be strong interest in PAVBLU pretty much early on in the launch phase. Obviously, having permanent Q codes in this case, given that it's biosimilar are important, but there's a lot of interest out there even as we may have a temporary reimbursement code.\nRobert Bradway: And generally, Carter, as we've built what we think is industry-leading biosimilar franchise. It's a franchise that is performing very well, and we think it's earning attractive returns for our shareholders.\nJustin Claeys: All right. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, Carter. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChristopher Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just a quick question on TEZSPIRE in COPD. Obviously, some really nice Phase II data earlier this year, but just was interested of how you think about the potential landscape here as we consider both DUPIXENT potentially the IL-33 is coming to market ahead of you. It seems like you might have a broader program and some interesting data. But just help me a little bit about how you're just commercially seeing that fitting into the landscape? Thank you.\nPeter Griffith: Well, Chris, why don't I start and this is Jay and Murdo hand off to you. So TEZSPIRE, as all here knows our TSLP monoclonal antibody that we're developing with AstraZeneca. And recently, we had a chance to read out a very compelling Phase II study in moderate to very severe COPD. This is a 337 patient study. They have -- these patients were having exacerbations despite triple therapy. And we went head-to-head against placebo over a 52-week period of time. The population actually broader even than DUPI and Murdo perhaps invite you to reflect on that. The data were quite positive with a numerically reduced exacerbation rate by 17%. We learned a lot from biomarker studies of blood eosinophils as to which subsets of patients, all pre-planned stand to benefit the most. And with these learnings, we're now pleased to announce that we're planning to initiate Phase III studies together with AstraZeneca. This trial is well structured and set up to definitively answer the question around efficacy TEZSPIRE in COPD. And Murdo, would you like to reflect a little bit about our competitive posture?\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chris. We're obviously really pleased with the performance of TEZSPIRE so far in uncontrolled -- severe uncontrolled asthma. We're actually now the second most prescribed product when it comes to new-to-brand prescriptions in that category. So I think it's clear now that allergists and pulmonologists appreciate the differentiated profile and the unique mechanism of action that is TEZSPIRE. And we also believe, as Jay has highlighted that, that ability to address a broader population of patients because of the unique mechanism of action and the upstream way in which it intervenes in the immuno inflammation cascade. We're hopeful that, that differentiation and will continue to play out in COPD and we feel really good about the opportunity to compete there. With the combined resources of our partners at AstraZeneca and Amgen, we have a very strong share of voice currently in severe uncontrolled asthma, and we expect to be able to affect that same strong share of voice on the successful completion of the Phase III trial.\nJustin Claeys: Julianne, let's take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, Chris. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I want to touch on the biosimilar launch for the [indiscernible] biosimilar. Maybe talk about some of the launch strategy and more specifically, how you can stimulate demand among Ophtalmologists who would otherwise use a branded product. Are you able to offer rebates or extended invoicing for these practices? Thank you so much.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks for the question. Obviously, I'm not going to talk about what we're doing commercially with respect to contracting. I will just say that we have a very broad deployed field force covering the key customers in this therapeutic area. We have very strong institutional organization that covers the purchasing groups and the large networks that treat a large percentage of the populations here. And the receptivity has been high. This isn't our first biosimilar launch, and we've been preparing effectively, and we're excited to be in the market.\nJustin Claeys: Julianne, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Evan. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe a question for Jay. So given that you have diabetes patients with obesity in the ongoing Phase II trial, do you think you would be able to look into the A1C profile of the drug as well? Or is it just too small a trial to make any conclusion about that at this point?\nMurdo Gordon: Yeah. Thank you, Mohit. As you know, type 2 diabetes runs regrettably with obesity and with overweight. And so we do hope and expect to have some insights into diabetic -- anti-diabetic activity from the Phase II study, but we need to have an experience in a dedicated Phase II study of diabetes, in particular, in patients without obesity. So more to follow there towards later this year.\nJustin Claeys: Next question, please, Julliane.\nOperator: Thank you. Mohit. Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nYaron Werber: Great. Murdo, I got maybe a couple of questions for you. One, just on Enbrel, this quarter was that we didn't see the normal Q3 bounce back. It's just this a new normal now? Or is there any particular one-timers in the quarter? And then secondly, you mentioned 12,000 accounts or 13,000 accounts ordering Prolia. I presume you're mentioning that on purpose is relating to the upcoming biosimilar launches late May next year. Can you talk about maybe just that dynamic in Prolia versus XGEVA, what to expect next year? Thank you.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks for the question, Yaron. Yes, as you picked up, Enbrel was impacted by 2 negative trends in the quarter. One, of course, the regular decline in net price and then another one, which was a 30% adjustment in the quarter. So the quarter is a little softer than you normally see. Volume was up 4% in the quarter. So Enbrel continues to do quite well in terms of prescribers treating patients but we are expecting continued net price declines going forward. When we look at Prolia, I mentioned that we have 13,000 provider accounts having treated patients with Prolia so far this year. This is just to give an idea of the breadth and utility of this important product. The other thing that we enjoy with Prolia is it's an important way for us to source potential patients for EVENITY, which we continue to see very strong growth in. So our presence in the bone community and the treating physician population that treat the many women who are trying to reduce their risk of fracture despite the effect of their osteoporosis, we feel really good about it. And yes, it could end up becoming something that helps us in terms of market presence in the face of biosimilar competition in the future.\nJustin Claeys: All right. Julianne, let's take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you, Yaron. Our next question comes from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGregory Renza: Great. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Bob, maybe just looking at the rare disease franchise. And we've always mentioned -- you've mentioned it's certainly a different approach in this space. And to that, what is Amgen's approach on pipeline replenishment when it comes to the rare disease pillar? Certainly, being fipaxalparant discontinuation in IPF. Just curious how to think about specific disease areas in rare disease and also how you think about kind of supporting and following your current marketed products in the rare disease franchise. Thanks so much.\nRobert Bradway: Yeah. We take this in a couple of pieces. And we're obviously very excited about rare disease and what we think we can bring to the field. With respect to the molecules that are already on the market, each of them, as you know, is in an early stage of this life cycle and involves either diseases or molecular attributes that we think we can add a lot of value to over time. So we're excited about what we think we can do with those domestically and in international markets. And we're also excited about, frankly, how our genetics resource, which you're familiar with has enabled us to glean insights both from existing molecules in the rare disease portfolio as well as potentially others that we might be able to add to it. But I'd invite Jay to share his thoughts. He's already brought a lot of energy to this topic with our rare disease organization. So Jay, fire away.\nJames Bradner: Thanks, Bob, and thanks for Gregory for the question. The acquisition of Horizon has really activated and energized our staff in R&D. I think inspired by the mechanistic repositioning of a TEPEZZA for thyroid eye disease, the capacity to bring rare disease medicines expertly to patients around the world has really activated the imagination of our R&D colleagues, and we've had multiple new project launches since the acquisition of Horizon. Second, I would say that the integration has gone very smoothly. And the staff who've joined us through the Horizon acquisition have both seamlessly executed the development priorities for the rare disease portfolio and also have brought a lot of really interesting ideas. We have now a rare disease initiative with dedicated leadership. We have dedicated leadership in rare disease drug development. And we hope and expect to continue just the best-in-class external innovation that Horizon was really known for in this space. So a blend of internal and external innovation will, I think, more than replenish the rare disease mid- and early-stage pipeline in the years to come.\nRobert Bradway: We're also very excited about the talent that joined us from Horizon, particularly on the research and the medical side. So we feel really well equipped now to continue to invest in this area and make a difference for patients.\nJustin Claeys: Great. So, Julianne, as we're getting to the half hour here, maybe we'll take two more questions.\nOperator: Certainly. Thank you, Gregory. Our next question comes from Matt Phipps from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Phipps: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to confirm if the 420 mg dose is that's going to be taken COPD trials. And is that something that you can formulate into a single injection given it's twice, I believe the current size? And then just to confirm, this is two separate Phase III trial? Will they be identical in design? Thank you.\nJames Bradner: Yeah, Matt. Thanks for the question. They're good questions, but none that we can address here today. Together with our colleagues from AstraZeneca, we'll have a chance to describe in full the design of the Phase III program that will support the consideration of TEZSPIRE and COPD soon to come.\nJustin Claeys: All right. Julianne, I think we have time for one more.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChristopher Raymond: Thanks for squeezing me in. Just back on PAVBLU. We've gotten some interesting doc feedback on this with a decent amount of receptivity to this option. And one thing that's kind of a new development, I think, at least in the U.S. market has been a recent supply disruption to Avastin which may actually provide maybe more of an opening for this launch. Maybe just curious, as you looked at the market, talk about how you looked at the role of biosimilars in this predominantly buy and bill market with a very inexpensive option on Avastin, but one that seems to be fading at least in terms of suppliers wanting to provide the drug I guess, bottom line, does this Avastin supply issue make this even more interesting to you guys? Thanks.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks for the question, Chris. But first and foremost, obviously, when you're treating serious illness, you want to have -- as a provider, you want to have a reliable supply of the product that you and your staff get used to handling. And I can say we are very fortunate to have world-class manufacturing here at Amgen, and we continue to have a highly reliable supply chain and manufacturing capability. We have benefited from shortages with other biosimilars including Avastin. As I'll remind you, we have MVASI, our own biosimilar to that product. So we are seeing customers coming to us given some shortages here in the U.S. and around the world. And again, I'm thankful for our manufacturing colleagues here at Amgen who are putting us in a very strong position to be able to speak to institutional customers to individual providers and obviously communicate with patients about the ability for us to supply and the reliability of that over time. That being said, I think we're definitely looking at our own opportunity here in the market with PAVBLU. I think you mentioned that there's high interest in the customers that you've talked to. These retina specialists are sophisticated customers. They understand that if they're going to go with a manufacturer, they're going to want a relationship that is persistent over time, and we believe we're well positioned for that. We have a great device in a prefilled syringe. We also have vials. So we're able to supply this demand in this market. And that's what we intend to do, and that's what our teams are in the field establishing right now. But thanks for your interest.\nJustin Claeys: Okay, Julianne. Thanks for moderating our call, and thank you all for joining us. If there were any of you who didn\u2019t get a chance to ask your questions, Justin and his team will be around still for a few more hours. So we look forward to gathering with you when we next have relevant information. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes our 2024 Q3 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert Bradway",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. Our performance this quarter reflects the strength of our business across our core therapeutic areas and geographies. Our in-market medicines performed well in the quarter with third quarter revenues up 23% to $8.5 billion and 10 of our products delivering double-digit or better sales growth. We're also rapidly advancing our pipeline with a significant number of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class medicines, positioning us for long-term growth. Let me address MariTide directly. Our ongoing Phase II study is progressing well, and we look forward to sharing results later this year. We're well advanced in preparing to launch a broad Phase III program for MariTide, including obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. You may have noted that we recently initiated a Phase II study in patients with type 2 diabetes. As we shared after the interim analysis, we're confident that MariTide's differentiated profile will address important unmet medical needs across a number of diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Beyond obesity, we have momentum across each of our therapeutic areas, and I'll start with oncology. In the third quarter, we saw strong in-market performance with 17% sales growth across the innovative oncology portfolio and several products experienced double-digit growth, including BLINCYTO, which, of course, is our first bispecific T cell engager or BiTE, which is now established as the standard of care in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The launch of our next BiTE IMDELLTRA is also progressing well with strong clinical conviction and three Phase III studies underway in small cell lung cancer. And further demonstrating the strength and promise of this platform in solid tumors, we're pleased to announce today that we will advance xaluritamig into Phase III clinical development in advanced prostate cancer in the fourth quarter. Let me remind you to also keep an eye out for Phase III bemarituzumab data in gastric cancer, which we should have in the next few months. Our rare disease portfolio delivered $1.2 billion of sales in the quarter, growing 21% year-over-year, driven by TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA, UPLIZNA and TAVNEOS. These medicines are highly innovative, are still in the early stages of their life cycles and have significant upside potential, including expansion into new indications and geographies. For example, TEPEZZA was recently approved in Japan. Also in rare disease, UPLIZNA demonstrated compelling data in generalized myasthenia gravis and was granted breakthrough therapy designation in IgG4-related diseases. We're excited about the promise of inebilizumab in these settings and potentially in other B cell mediated autoimmune diseases. In inflammation, TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with 67% growth year-over-year in the quarter. We're further encouraged by the potential of TEZSPIRE in COPD and additional indications that we're also actively exploring. And finally, in General Medicine, Repatha and EVENITY are each delivering strong volume growth again this quarter. These products are pivotal as we continue to serve more patients and meet the growing demand for therapies that address some of the most serious health challenges worldwide, like heart disease and osteoporosis. Looking ahead, we remain confident that Amgen is well positioned to deliver long-term growth and innovation across each of our therapeutic areas. Our balanced portfolio, combined with the strength of our pipeline, we think will continue to drive our business forward. As always, I'd like to thank my colleagues across Amgen for their unwavering commitment to patients. And I want to now turn the call over to Murdo. Thank you, Julianne. Sorry, go ahead. Okay. It sounded like a few questions there, Salveen. As we said, we're continuing to be very excited about the prospects for MariTide, and we added the disclosure on this call that we have begun the Phase II study in type 2 diabetes. The conduct of the trial is continuing to progress well, and we're expecting to have the data here by the end of the year. And when we have those data, we'll obviously look forward to being able to share that with our investors. So with respect to the Phase III trial, we would reiterate that we are expecting to pursue a broad Phase III trial in obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. It will be, we would expect a large global trial, fully exploring the molecule. And Jay, I'd invite you to add any color you'd like about the Phase III program. But obviously, our investment will reflect our view that this is a differentiated molecule, and we look forward to having the full characterization of its safety and efficacy profile. And we'll -- as part of our normal guidance process in the coming year, I'm sure we'll give an updated perspective then that reflects our plans for the Phase III trial. And then we'll also add any perspective that may be helpful on the capital expenditure front. I think what I just would remind you is that this molecule is designed on our existing antibody platform. It fits very well with our network as currently configured. And so again, we'll have more to say about that through time as necessary. Yeah. Let's take it in a couple of pieces. First, as you heard us say, the quarter grew 8%. Vikram, why don't you just remind our investors of the plans for expanding Salesforce and then also perhaps speak to Japan or international more general? In terms of the release, Terence and how we share that with investors. Well, again, we're focused on getting the data in hand and when we have them, we'll try to do whatever in best interest of the shareholders. So stay tuned as soon as we have them. We look forward to being able to report those. And Jay, do you want to address the question on Phase III? Yeah. Thanks, Carter. Murdo, why don't you share your thoughts in general on the biosimilar franchise. We don't often get a chance to talk about it, but please also on PAVBLU. And generally, Carter, as we've built what we think is industry-leading biosimilar franchise. It's a franchise that is performing very well, and we think it's earning attractive returns for our shareholders. Yeah. We take this in a couple of pieces. And we're obviously very excited about rare disease and what we think we can bring to the field. With respect to the molecules that are already on the market, each of them, as you know, is in an early stage of this life cycle and involves either diseases or molecular attributes that we think we can add a lot of value to over time. So we're excited about what we think we can do with those domestically and in international markets. And we're also excited about, frankly, how our genetics resource, which you're familiar with has enabled us to glean insights both from existing molecules in the rare disease portfolio as well as potentially others that we might be able to add to it. But I'd invite Jay to share his thoughts. He's already brought a lot of energy to this topic with our rare disease organization. So Jay, fire away.

            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong third quarter performance and are on track with our 2024 full year goals and long-term objectives. We have a strong long-term growth outlook with breadth and depth across each of our four therapeutic areas, including our innovative pipeline and in-market products, serving patients with serious illnesses around the globe. We will continue to allocate capital to innovation first and with our strong cash flows, also intend to fund our other capital allocation priorities. Starting with our third quarter results as shown on Slide 28 of the slide deck, we delivered $8.5 billion in total revenues, a 23% year-over-year increase. Excluding the addition of Horizon, product sales increased 8% year-over-year, driven by 12% volume growth. In the U.S., our sales in the quarter were impacted by $173 million and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. In the third quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 49.6% as a percentage of product sales with total non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 27% year-over-year, largely driven by the addition of Horizon. Non-GAAP R&D spending in the third quarter increased 35% year-over-year to $1.4 billion as we invested in the rapidly advancing late-stage pipeline including MariTide, bemarituzumab and olpasiran as well as Horizon acquired programs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 21% year-over-year, primarily driven by the addition of Horizon, excluding the addition of Horizon, non-GAAP SG&A expenses were relatively flat year-over-year. The Horizon integration is progressing well, and we expect to reach $500 million in pretax cost synergies by year three post-acquisition with more than 50% to be realized by the end of this year. The acquisition is accretive to non-GAAP EPS year-to-date, and we expect it to be for the full year as well. Our non-GAAP OI&E resulted in a $554 million expense, up $329 million year-over-year, almost entirely due to increased interest expense from the Horizon acquisition. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet with $2.5 billion of debt retired in the third quarter and expect to return to our pre-Horizon acquisition capital structure by the end of 2025. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 2.7 percentage points year-over-year to 13.4%, primarily due to the change in earnings mix from the inclusion of Horizon. In the third quarter of 2024, the company generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow, an increase of $2.5 billion from the previous year. Our strong cash flows enable investing in our business for long-term growth, including advancing our exciting pipeline opportunities and expanding capacity in our state-of-the-art manufacturing processes and facilities. Our past investments enable us to serve a significant number of patients today. For example, with over 43 million units expected for Repatha and Prolia alone in 2024, ongoing and future investments will support MariTide and other products across the portfolio. In addition, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid competitive dividend of $2.25 per share in the second quarter, this represented a 6% increase compared to 2023. Let's turn to the outlook for the business for 2024 on Slide 30. We expect our 2024 total revenues in the range of $33.0 billion to $33.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS between $19.20 to $20. We do expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be lower than Q3 non-GAAP EPS, because of planned investment increases in our business, including key assets in our innovative pipeline beginning with MariTide and olpasiran and other strategic business investments. This sequential pattern is consistent with historical trends. Let me mention a few consideration as you model the remainder of 2024. We now project full year new asset sales at approximately $400 million and other revenue at approximately $1.4 billion. We expect TEPEZZA sales in Q4 to be flat to slightly down versus the third quarter, resulting in full year sales being up roughly 5% year-over-year as compared to the full year of TEPEZZA sales in 2023. Consistent with prior years, we expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to be the highest of the year and expect approximately 28% of our full year operating expenses to be in the fourth quarter. This includes additional investments to drive momentum into 2025, for example, in key brands like Repatha and EVENITY. For the full year, our total non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow approximately 25% year-over-year, including from the addition of Horizon. We still expect full year non-GAAP R&D growth of more than 25% year-over-year. We now expect OI&E to be approximately $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion, which includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition. We now expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be in the 14% to 15% range, including the full year benefits associated with the inclusion of the Horizon business and favorable items in the quarter identified in the return to provision process. Finally, our capital expenditure guidance remains at $1.3 billion for 2024. Our long-term growth outlook remains strong and I'm grateful to our colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serving patients. This concludes our financial update. I'll now hand it back to Bob for our Q&A session. Maybe to suggest, Bob -- Olivia, it's Peter here. I would just remind you of Amgen's long history of being a leader in the science and manufacturing and process development that creates opportunities in terms of how we might view yield going forward. So while it might not just be bricks, mortar and steel, yield is really important, and we've got a really strong history in that. And we did raise the CapEx guide this year, as you know, to about $1.3 billion. We're very thoughtful about that. And you also heard me mention that research and development spend up 35% quarter-over-quarter to the prior year. We expect it to be up over 25% for the year. So we certainly are investing where we always say we will in innovation and MariTide is right at the front of that, and we look forward to investing to be a key player in this global public health crisis. Well, Chris, why don't I start and this is Jay and Murdo hand off to you. So TEZSPIRE, as all here knows our TSLP monoclonal antibody that we're developing with AstraZeneca. And recently, we had a chance to read out a very compelling Phase II study in moderate to very severe COPD. This is a 337 patient study. They have -- these patients were having exacerbations despite triple therapy. And we went head-to-head against placebo over a 52-week period of time. The population actually broader even than DUPI and Murdo perhaps invite you to reflect on that. The data were quite positive with a numerically reduced exacerbation rate by 17%. We learned a lot from biomarker studies of blood eosinophils as to which subsets of patients, all pre-planned stand to benefit the most. And with these learnings, we're now pleased to announce that we're planning to initiate Phase III studies together with AstraZeneca. This trial is well structured and set up to definitively answer the question around efficacy TEZSPIRE in COPD. And Murdo, would you like to reflect a little bit about our competitive posture?"

            "name": "Vikram Karnani",
            "content": "Thank you, Murdo. I am pleased to provide an update on rare disease, which delivered product sales of $1.2 billion in Q3. Beginning with TEPEZZA for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, third quarter sales were $488 million, reflecting growth of 8% year-over-year when compared to results from the legacy Horizon business. Recall, there are roughly 100,000 TED patients in the U.S. and penetration is currently only in the single digits. We are excited about the growth opportunity presented by the roughly 80% of TED patients who have a lower clinical activity score, or CAS. As we have discussed previously, to more effectively reach these patients, we have recently reorganized and expanded our field force into two separate and dedicated teams, one focused on comprehensive ophthalmologists and ocular specialists and the other focused on endocrinologists. This approach reflects an optimized footprint to continue to serve patients with high CAS disease while expanding our reach to those patients with low CAS disease who can benefit from TEPEZZA. We made this change in the third quarter. And over the last few weeks, these teams have been actively focused on establishing new relationships with potential new prescribers. We expect this optimized focus to gain traction over the next few quarters as physicians become more experienced identifying the right patients for treatment and navigating the reimbursement process to enable access to TEPEZZA. Following our 8% year-over-year growth this quarter, we remain confident in the long-term potential for TEPEZZA in the U.S. as we expand our reach to patients with low CAS disease and continue to work closely with payers to expand access. International expansion remains a key growth opportunity with regulatory filings completed or in progress across multiple regions. TEPEZZA's approval in Japan in September marked a key milestone ahead of its launch, which is expected by early 2025. We also initiated a Phase III subcutaneous study and see this as an opportunity to increase adoption and improve the patient experience with an alternative option to our current IV formulation. KRYSTEXXA for patients with chronic refractory gout delivered $310 million in sales in Q3, representing 23% year-over-year growth driven by volume growth from strong commercial execution. KRYSTEXXA with immunomodulation has established a new standard of care for chronic refractory gout. UPLIZNA for patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or NMOSD, delivered $106 million in sales in Q3, representing 58% year-over-year growth. International expansion of UPLIZNA is also underway with launches in multiple markets, including Canada, which launched earlier this year. Additionally, we're excited by the growth potential of UPLIZNA driven by the striking data in both IgG4-related disease, which affects over 20,000 patients in the U.S. and generalized myasthenia gravis or gMG, which affects nearly 80,000 to 100,000 patients in the U.S. Sales of TAVNEOS were $80 million for the third quarter. Sales increased 116% year-over-year, driven by volume growth. In the U.S., more than 4,300 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis have been treated with TAVNEOS. Over 2,600 health care professionals have now prescribed TAVNEOS, a roughly 53% increase in the prescriber base so far this year. As we reflect on the past year, it's clear how far we've come in the integration and how well we're progressing. I want to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to all the team members that are working tirelessly to serve the needs of patients suffering from rare diseases. Looking ahead, we're excited about the opportunities and confident in what we'll achieve in our rare disease business and beyond. Now I'll hand it over to Jay for our R&D update. Yeah. Thanks, Bob. So as Bob just said and as I said in my prepared remarks, TEPEZZA grew 8% year-over-year. And as we have also said previously, we're continuing to focus on growth coming not only from the high CAS patients, but also the 80,000 -- roughly 80,000 patients that suffer from low CAS disease. What we have learned over our time serving these patients and these prescribers is that in order to most effectively reach these low CAS patients, we need to have a dedicated effort towards both comprehensive ophthalmologists and ocular specialists -- as well as endocrinologists. And what we have found is that type of coverage is necessary in order to serve the 80,000 or so low CAS disease patients that we have discussed previously. This approach reflects an optimized footprint. We believe that this approach will allow us to not only help the right physicians and new prescribers find the right patients for TEPEZZA, but also help to enable access to TEPEZZA the most appropriate way. Finally, what I would say here is we -- this is something that has been -- we've been working on for a little bit here. And this change occurred in the third quarter. So we do expect the momentum to play out here in the next several quarters. In the last few weeks, the teams have been actively focused on establishing new relationships with these new prescribers, and we look forward to updating you as we go. Final point on the global aspects of TEPEZZA. As you're aware, beyond the U.S., we are also looking forward to bringing to TEPEZZA to patients around the globe, including Japan. Japan is a really important country for us in terms of our next launch. Let me remind you that we received approval in Japan for TEPEZZA with high CAS patients in September, and we're actively working to an early 2025 launch there as well."

And sales of 10 products grew by double-digits or better, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, BLINCYTO, EVENITY and TAVNEOS, all brands that are important to our future growth trajectory. Starting with our general medicine portfolio, sales of Repatha, EVENITY and Prolia collectively grew 18% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by volume growth. We serve large patient populations with these therapies. For example, we expect Repatha and Prolia alone will help over 11 million patients in 2024. Repatha sales increased 40% year-over-year to $567 million for the third quarter, now annualizing at over $2 billion in sales. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year volume growth of 41% and favorable changes to estimated sales deductions of 8%, partially offset by lower net selling price of 10%. In the U.S., our expanded primary care field force efforts drove a 50% year-over-year increase in primary care physician prescribers. U.S. volume growth was enabled by broad reimbursement and removal of prior authorization requirements by several payers. Outside the U.S., Repatha retains category leadership and continues to grow across major markets despite increased competition in the segment. EVENITY sales increased 30% year-over-year to almost $400 million for the third quarter. In the U.S., EVENITY continues to be the segment leader with 61% of the bone builder market. Strong U.S. volume growth was supported by an increase in prescription volume from both established and new EVENITY prescribers with a 34% quarter-over-quarter increase in new provider accounts ordering EVENITY. In Japan, EVENITY continues to hold a leading position with 47% of the bone builder segment. Since launching in Japan in 2019, EVENITY has been prescribed to approximately 600,000 patients. EVENITY sales are now annualizing at approximately $1.5 billion. We're encouraged by the growth momentum we are driving and have conviction in the potential for EVENITY to help the many more women globally who remain at risk of a fracture due to their post-menopausal osteoporosis. Prolia sales increased 6% year-over-year to $1 billion for the third quarter, driven by 9% volume growth. In the U.S., we see broad prescribing base with more than 13,000 provider accounts using Prolia so far this year. In inflammation, TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with $269 million in sales in the third quarter. Sales increased 67% year-over-year, supported by TEZSPIRE's uniquely differentiated profile and increased adoption by pulmonologists. We're encouraged by the growth of TEZSPIRE to date and its potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma. Otezla sales decreased 1% year-over-year for the third quarter with 5% volume growth. This volume growth was offset by 7% lower net selling price. Otezla remains the only approved oral systemic therapy with a broad indication and is well positioned to help the more than 1.5 million systemic treatment-naive U.S. patients with milder psoriasis who cannot be optimally addressed by a topical treatment. Enbrel sales decreased 20% year-over-year for the third quarter, primarily driven by 13% unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and 12% lower net selling price. Volumes grew 4% in the quarter. Going forward, we expect continued declining net selling price, relatively stable volume, providing strong cash flow for our business. Sales of our biosimilar products increased 9% year-over-year in the third quarter. We have fully deployed our team in support of the recent U.S. launch of PAVBLU, a biosimilar to EYLEA. Our teams moved quickly to engage retina specialists, and we're encouraged by the enthusiastic feedback from customers. Our teams are also ready for the upcoming U.S. launches of WEZLANA, a biosimilar to STELARA and BEKEMV, a biosimilar to Solaris, expected in the first and second quarters of 2025, respectively. Overall, our biosimilars portfolio continues to deliver attractive returns driven by our efficient business model. In oncology, sales of our seven innovative products, BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate, XGEVA and IMDELLTRA grew 17% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by volume growth and higher net selling price. In total, these products contributed over $2 billion of sales in the third quarter. BLINCYTO sales grew 49% year-over-year to $327 million for the third quarter. Growth was supported by the recent expansion of the BLINCYTO label, now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell ALL in the consolidation phase regardless of measurable residual disease status. Our U.S. launch of IMDELLTRA is progressing well, generating $36 million of sales in the third quarter. There's strong clinical conviction in both academic and community settings, driven by IMDELLTRA's breakthrough efficacy. We have a strong sense of urgency to bring IMDELLTRA to patients living with this aggressive disease. LUMAKRAS sales increased 88% year-over-year to $98 million for the third quarter. Vectibix sales increased 12% year-over-year to $282 million for the third quarter, now annualizing at over $1 billion. And KYPROLIS grew 8% year-over-year to $378 million in the quarter. Nplate sales increased 9% to $456 million for the third quarter. If we exclude government sales, Nplate sales grew 18% year-over-year for the third quarter, driven by 14% volume growth and higher net selling price. We've made significant progress in this quarter, driving execution and accelerating performance of our most important growth brands. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram, who will cover our rare disease portfolio. Thanks, Bob. We're obviously quite excited about the next wave of launch is not just PAVBLU, but our other biosimilar launches that we are expecting in the not-too-distant future, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, with WEZLANA and BEKEMV. On PAVBLU, as you mentioned, Carter, it's important to be first or in the first wave. And clearly, we're in that position now as we're launching this product as we speak. And we expect there to be strong interest in PAVBLU pretty much early on in the launch phase. Obviously, having permanent Q codes in this case, given that it's biosimilar are important, but there's a lot of interest out there even as we may have a temporary reimbursement code. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Chris. We're obviously really pleased with the performance of TEZSPIRE so far in uncontrolled -- severe uncontrolled asthma. We're actually now the second most prescribed product when it comes to new-to-brand prescriptions in that category. So I think it's clear now that allergists and pulmonologists appreciate the differentiated profile and the unique mechanism of action that is TEZSPIRE. And we also believe, as Jay has highlighted that, that ability to address a broader population of patients because of the unique mechanism of action and the upstream way in which it intervenes in the immuno inflammation cascade. We're hopeful that, that differentiation and will continue to play out in COPD and we feel really good about the opportunity to compete there. With the combined resources of our partners at AstraZeneca and Amgen, we have a very strong share of voice currently in severe uncontrolled asthma, and we expect to be able to affect that same strong share of voice on the successful completion of the Phase III trial. Thanks for the question. Obviously, I'm not going to talk about what we're doing commercially with respect to contracting. I will just say that we have a very broad deployed field force covering the key customers in this therapeutic area. We have very strong institutional organization that covers the purchasing groups and the large networks that treat a large percentage of the populations here. And the receptivity has been high. This isn't our first biosimilar launch, and we've been preparing effectively, and we're excited to be in the market. Yeah. Thank you, Mohit. As you know, type 2 diabetes runs regrettably with obesity and with overweight. And so we do hope and expect to have some insights into diabetic -- anti-diabetic activity from the Phase II study, but we need to have an experience in a dedicated Phase II study of diabetes, in particular, in patients without obesity. So more to follow there towards later this year. Thanks for the question, Yaron. Yes, as you picked up, Enbrel was impacted by 2 negative trends in the quarter. One, of course, the regular decline in net price and then another one, which was a 30% adjustment in the quarter. So the quarter is a little softer than you normally see. Volume was up 4% in the quarter. So Enbrel continues to do quite well in terms of prescribers treating patients but we are expecting continued net price declines going forward. When we look at Prolia, I mentioned that we have 13,000 provider accounts having treated patients with Prolia so far this year. This is just to give an idea of the breadth and utility of this important product. The other thing that we enjoy with Prolia is it's an important way for us to source potential patients for EVENITY, which we continue to see very strong growth in. So our presence in the bone community and the treating physician population that treat the many women who are trying to reduce their risk of fracture despite the effect of their osteoporosis, we feel really good about it. And yes, it could end up becoming something that helps us in terms of market presence in the face of biosimilar competition in the future. Thanks for the question, Chris. But first and foremost, obviously, when you're treating serious illness, you want to have -- as a provider, you want to have a reliable supply of the product that you and your staff get used to handling. And I can say we are very fortunate to have world-class manufacturing here at Amgen, and we continue to have a highly reliable supply chain and manufacturing capability. We have benefited from shortages with other biosimilars including Avastin. As I'll remind you, we have MVASI, our own biosimilar to that product. So we are seeing customers coming to us given some shortages here in the U.S. and around the world. And again, I'm thankful for our manufacturing colleagues here at Amgen who are putting us in a very strong position to be able to speak to institutional customers to individual providers and obviously communicate with patients about the ability for us to supply and the reliability of that over time. That being said, I think we're definitely looking at our own opportunity here in the market with PAVBLU. I think you mentioned that there's high interest in the customers that you've talked to. These retina specialists are sophisticated customers. They understand that if they're going to go with a manufacturer, they're going to want a relationship that is persistent over time, and we believe we're well positioned for that. We have a great device in a prefilled syringe. We also have vials. So we're able to supply this demand in this market. And that's what we intend to do, and that's what our teams are in the field establishing right now. But thanks for your interest."

            "name": "James Bradner",
            "content": "Thank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. In the third quarter, we made significant progress advancing our broad clinical pipeline, which includes a number of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class therapies. Since our last update, we have initiated a Phase II study of MariTide in type 2 diabetes and delivered positive potentially practice changing Phase III data with UPLIZNA in generalized myasthenia gravis. Additionally, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for UPLIZNA in IgG4-related diseases underscoring the important potential impact of this medicine. We also showcased promising data from several oncology programs at major medical conferences, including IMDELLTRA, xaluritamig and AMG 193, while reporting positive results from the first of eight Phase III studies evaluating rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis. Let's begin with general medicine. As previously mentioned, based upon the interim analysis of the ongoing Phase II study of MariTide in chronic weight management, we are seeing a differentiated profile and are confident MariTide will address important unmet medical needs in obesity, obesity-related conditions in type 2 diabetes. We remain on track and look forward to top line 52-week data from the MariTide Phase II study in late 2024. We are actively planning and expect to initiate a broad Phase III program in obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. This quarter, we initiated a dedicated Phase II trial investigating MariTide in patients with type 2 diabetes, living with and without obesity. MariTide has the potential to be the first therapy in this setting with monthly or even less frequent dosing. Beyond MariTide, our Phase I trial of AMG 513 is actively enrolling patients. We also continue to advance our preclinical obesity programs, which include both oral and injectable approaches comprising both incretin and non-incretin mechanisms. Also in general medicine is olpasiran, our potentially best-in-class LP(a) targeting small interfering RNA medicine. The fully enrolled Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial of olpasiran continues to progress. In oncology, IMDELLTRA, a first-in-class bispecific T cell engager or BiTE molecule, targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer is rapidly advancing into earlier lines of therapy with three Phase III studies underway in both extensive stage and limited stage disease. To further enhance the patient experience, we are evaluating reduced monitoring protocols as part of the Phase III program, and we have initiated a Phase Ib study evaluating subcutaneous tarlatamab in patients with second line or later extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. In September, we presented impressive follow-up data from our DeLLphi 301 Phase II study of IMDELLTRA in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer, demonstrating sustained anticancer activity and a manageable safety profile. We also presented data from DeLLphi 303, the Phase Ib study of IMDELLTRA combined with a PD-L1 inhibitor as maintenance therapy following four cycles of chemotherapy and first-line extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. This design is similar to our ongoing Phase III study, DeLLphi 305, which test the efficacy of IMDELLTRA and PD-L1 inhibition versus PD-L1 inhibition alone, in first-line extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, following platinum-based chemotherapy. With a median follow-up of 10 months, IMDELLTRA has demonstrated a manageable safety profile, median duration of disease control of 9.3 months, median progression-free survival of 5.6 months and a nine month estimated overall survival of 89%. Moving to our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific molecule, xaluritamig, we are pleased to announce that following consultation with regulatory authorities, we will initiate a Phase III study in post-taxane metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC, this quarter. The promise of xaluritamig was recently evidenced by data presented in September from a Phase I dose exploration cohort evaluating monotherapy in patients with mCRPC. With a median follow-up of 27.9 months, the median overall survival was 17.7 months across all cohorts, a potential improvement upon the historical median survival of 12 to 15 months in this patient population. Additional data from a Phase I randomized dose expansion and optimization cohort has identified the recommended dose and schedule for Phase III clinical investigation. Additionally, we are studying xaluritamig in earlier lines of therapy in combination and in earlier stages of prostate cancer. Our Phase I study of xaluritamig in combination with enzalutamide and abiraterone is ongoing. Recently, we have initiated two additional Phase Ib studies investigating xaluritamig in the upfront management of more localized disease. The first study evaluates neoadjuvant xaluritamig therapy that is prior to radical prostatectomy in patients with newly diagnosed, localized, intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer. The second study evaluates xaluritamig in high-risk non-metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer after definitive therapy. We are particularly excited about the potential of xaluritamig, now our third bispecific T cell engager entering late-stage clinical development. Beyond our T cell engagers, we have completed enrollment of FORTITUDE-102, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab, our first-in-class fibroblast growth factor receptor IIb directed monoclonal antibody combined with chemotherapy and nivolumab in first-line gastric cancer. In the coming months, we expect to read out the results of FORTITUDE-101, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab combined with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in first-line gastric cancer. This study was designed based on the successful Phase II FIGHT study, which reported numerically longer progression-free survival and overall survival. Lastly, we are also rapidly advancing AMG 193, our oral PRMT5 inhibitor developed for MTAP-null solid tumors. We recently initiated a Phase II study of AMG 193 in patients with MTAP-null previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This study will help to address regulatory agency requirements for dose optimization and selection. In September, we presented encouraging data from a Phase I dose escalation and initial dose expansion study, demonstrating promising monotherapy activity and an acceptable safety profile. Turning to inflammation. Based upon encouraging Phase II data from TEZSPIRE in patients with COPD, we are planning to initiate Phase III studies in collaboration with AstraZeneca. These trials will target patients with moderate to very severe COPD with blood eosinophil counts greater than or equal to 150 cells per microliter. We expect to begin enrollment in the first half of 2025. TEZSPIRE is also being investigated in separate Phase III studies of patients with eosinophilic esophagitis and in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected later this year. In September, we announced positive results from the Phase III Horizon study of rocatinlimab in atopic dermatitis. The study met its co-primary endpoints and all key secondary endpoints. We anticipate additional data readouts from the ROCKET program will deepen our understanding of rocatinlimab profile. Beyond atopic dermatitis, we continue to explore rocatinlimab in moderate to severe asthma and prurigo nodularis. To expand the impact of our CD19 directed therapeutics for even more patients suffering from serious inflammatory diseases, we have initiated Phase II studies of blinatumomab our CD19 targeting BiTE molecule approved as BLINCYTO and inebilizumab, our CD19 targeting monoclonal antibody approved as UPLIZNA. These studies build on mounting evidence of therapeutic benefit for B-cell depletion in autoimmune diseases from small investigator-sponsored trials of blinatumomab in systemic sclerosis and refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Our initial focus will be on systemic lupus erythematosus with nephritis with plans to expand into additional indications. Shifting to rare disease. We recently presented potentially practice-changing results from the Phase III MINT study, the largest placebo-controlled trial for a biologic therapy in generalized myothenia gravis. MINT evaluated UPLIZNA in both acetylcholine receptor autoantibody positive ACHR positive and muscle-specific kinase autoantibody positive or MuSK-positive populations. At the reported 26-week time point, UPLIZNA demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in the myasthenia gravis activities of daily living score after just two doses compared to placebo. This efficacy was observed in the combined ACHR and MuSK-positive populations as well as in each population separately. UPLIZNA also achieved statistically significant improvements in the quantitative myasthenia gravis score, compared to placebo at week 26 in the combined populations. Importantly, in the MINT study, patients taking corticosteroids were tapered down starting at week 4 to a 5-milligram per day dose by week 24. MINT is the first and only Phase III placebo-controlled myasthenia gravis trial for a biologic that tapered corticosteroid use. As such, the efficacy observed with UPLIZNA in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis offers a chance for meaningful benefit without the burden and toxicity of chronic steroid use. We look forward to 52-week data for the ACHR positive cohort and results from both ACHR positive and MuSK-positive patient populations. In the open-label period of the MINT study, where UPLIZNA has the potential to demonstrate durable efficacy. Moving beyond generalized myasthenia gravis in August, the FDA granted UPLIZNA Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related diseases, or IgG4-related disease based upon data from the Phase III MITIGATE study. This data will be presented at the American College of Rheumatology Conference in November. We are extremely encouraged by the potential of UPLIZNA in both myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease and are actively working to file these data with regulatory authorities. In closing, I want to thank my Amgen colleagues for their unwavering commitment to patients facing grievous illnesses for the focus and for the collaboration during this productive year. I'll now turn it over to Peter for the financial update. Yeah. Thanks, Bob. We're fully on track actively planning and expect to initiate a broad Phase III program. This will include obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes, as you've heard already, we're progressing the Phase II study to characterize dose response, tolerability efficacy in patients. Importantly, without obesity but having type 2 diabetes. So we're fully on track, actively planning the broad program. Thanks, Mike. I really appreciate the question. With MariTide, we're really pleased with the execution of the study await data later this year, fully focused as I shared on setting up the broad Phase III program. The development of additional medicines for obesity and obesity-related conditions is a source of really active investigation here, preclinically and clinically now with 513 as you nicely mentioned. We've not as yet disclosed the mechanism of action of 513, which is a very interesting program. And as you note, and this is on clinicaltrials.gov, the SAD/MAD ascending dose study has been announced is enrolling and feature subcutaneous or intravenous administration. To reach smaller segments, other segments within the obesity landscape to serve all the patients with obesity and it's related conditions. We, like many others, are interested in both injectable as well as oral non-injectable medicines. We're very interested in incretin pathway as well as non incretin pathway mechanisms of action, and our portfolio reflects each of these. Yeah. Thanks, Umer. I really appreciate it. The Phase I study published now in January has been pretty thoroughly considered. This was a standard Phase I dose escalation study that did not have antecedent dose titration. So if that answers your question, I suppose there's only so much that can be learned from the Phase I. We're honestly just really focused on these Phase II data, where at the interim, we saw the differentiated profile. And as you know, we're in Phase III planning. Regarding weight loss plateau, this will be an interesting thing to observe and learn from the data, which we wait later this year. Yeah. Thanks, Jay. This is Jay. The subcutaneous development of BLINCYTO is a major priority for us. We're very encouraged by the efficacy that we've seen with subcutaneous BLINCYTO in prior studies. You'll remember perhaps that this medicine is dosed 3 times a week. We did a Phase I study back in 2022 at ASH with striking data, among 21 evaluable patients, we saw 67% CR rate within one cycle. There's been further data in the American Journal of Hematology since that time, 27 patients with an 85% CR rate, 75% of whom were MRD negative. And this is all without any grade for CRS. So subcutaneous BLINCYTO was a major priority for us. It is progressing in clinical investigation. And there's really nothing to read into the timing that you allude to in your excellent question. Thank you. The Phase III planning, as we've shared, is fully on track, and we won't today give any news or insights into our approach to dosing, but we feel confident it will be well informed by the Phase II study that is ongoing, and we'll read out later this year. Thanks, Bob, and thanks for Gregory for the question. The acquisition of Horizon has really activated and energized our staff in R&D. I think inspired by the mechanistic repositioning of a TEPEZZA for thyroid eye disease, the capacity to bring rare disease medicines expertly to patients around the world has really activated the imagination of our R&D colleagues, and we've had multiple new project launches since the acquisition of Horizon. Second, I would say that the integration has gone very smoothly. And the staff who've joined us through the Horizon acquisition have both seamlessly executed the development priorities for the rare disease portfolio and also have brought a lot of really interesting ideas. We have now a rare disease initiative with dedicated leadership. We have dedicated leadership in rare disease drug development. And we hope and expect to continue just the best-in-class external innovation that Horizon was really known for in this space. So a blend of internal and external innovation will, I think, more than replenish the rare disease mid- and early-stage pipeline in the years to come. Yeah, Matt. Thanks for the question. They're good questions, but none that we can address here today. Together with our colleagues from AstraZeneca, we'll have a chance to describe in full the design of the Phase III program that will support the consideration of TEZSPIRE and COPD soon to come."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a question-and-answer session at conclusion of the last speaker\u2019s prepared remarks. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate, we will like to request that you limit yourself to asking one question during the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin.\nJustin Claeys: Thank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Murdo Gordon, Vikram Karnani, Jay Bradner and Peter Griffith. Through the course of our discussion today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements, which are qualified by our safe harbor statement. And please note that actual results can vary materially. Over to you, Bob.\nBob Bradway: Okay. Well, thank you, Justin, and let me thank all of you for joining the call today. We're especially grateful in light of all of the volatility in the markets that you would carve out the time to be with us. So thank you. Through the first half of the year, our business is performing well, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive long-term growth. We're achieving strong results the same way we always have, which is by providing innovative medicines to address challenging diseases. Starting with the in-market portfolio. Second quarter revenues grew 20% to $8.4 billion with numerous medicines delivering double-digit sales growth, including in general medicine, Repatha and EVENITY, in oncology, of course, BLINCYTO, an inflammation TEZSPIRE, and then turning to rare disease, which delivered more than $1 billion on the quarter. I would highlight that KRYSTEXXA, UPLIZNA and TAVNEOS, each delivered at least double-digit sales growth in the quarter, and TEPEZZA grew 8% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. All of these first or best-in-class medicines are still early in their life cycles and have plenty of room to run through geographic expansion, new indications and/or new formulations. You'll hear more about these brands in a moment. Turning to research and development. We believe our pipeline looks very promising as well, not just in obesity, but across all of our therapeutic areas. We told you at the beginning of the year that we were anticipating more than a dozen significant pipeline milestones in 2024. We are, so far, so good. In the second quarter alone, we received accelerated approval for IMDELLTRA, a landmark new medicine for small cell lung cancer. And in fact, the physicians I've spoken to since approval are really excited about this drug as the first meaningful innovation in decades for these patients. We also received approval for BLINCYTO in the frontline treatment for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, based on significantly improved overall survival rates. The frontline approval meaningfully expands the potential impact of BLINCYTO for all patients with B-ALL. We announced impressive Phase III data for UPLIZNA in IgG4-related disease, which is a grievous illness for which there are no currently approved therapies of any kind. Building on our success with TEZSPIRE in treating severe asthma, we announced exciting data from our Phase II study in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that earned this molecule breakthrough therapy designation. COPD is the world's third leading cause of death, and new treatment options are very much needed. We look forward to additional data readouts later this year across therapeutic areas, highlighted, of course, by top line data from the ongoing MariTide Phase II study. We're encouraged by the emerging data in this field, particularly in cardiovascular and renal disease areas of long-standing strategic focus for us. We are laser focused on preparing to launch a broad Phase III program for MariTide that includes obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes, and we're further ramping our investment to support MariTide in the rest of the pipeline. You'll hear more about that pipeline shortly on this call. All in all, this is a very exciting time for us at Amgen. And as always, I'm grateful to my Amgen colleagues all around the world for their enduring commitment to patients. And now let me turn things over to Murdo.\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Bob. Execution was strong in the second quarter, driving 20% year-over-year sales growth and all of our regions delivered attractive growth. Sales of 12 products grew at least double digits, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, TAVNEOS and BLINCYTO, all brands that are important to our future growth. Starting with our General Medicine portfolio. Sales of Repatha, EVENITY and Prolia collectively grew 20% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by volume growth. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year to $532 million for the second quarter, now well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar business. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year volume growth of 46%, partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., we see increased recognition of the importance of lowering LDL cholesterol by health care providers, payers and patients, which has significantly accelerated volume growth for Repatha. Our efforts have broadened insurance coverage and removed prior authorization requirements by several payers. In a recent survey, roughly 95% of cardiologists responded that Repatha is accessible and that access has improved significantly versus two years ago. EVENITY sales increased 39% year-over-year to $391 million for the second quarter. In the U.S., volume growth was supported by both increased prescription volume from existing EVENITY prescribers and an expansion of new prescribers. In Japan, EVENITY has been prescribed to approximately 600,000 patients to date and continues to be the segment leader with 45% of the bone builder segment. There are many women who remain at risk of a fracture due to postmenopausal osteoporosis. We're encouraged by the growth momentum we are driving and have conviction in the potential for EVENITY to help even more patients. Prolia sales increased 13% year-over-year to $1.2 billion for the second quarter. Volume growth continues to be supported by real-world evidence demonstrating Prolia superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. In inflammation, TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with $234 million sales in the second quarter. Sales increased 76% year-over-year, primarily driven by uptake of the prefilled single-use pen. We see strong growth opportunity for TEZSPIRE given its unique differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma. Otezla sales decreased 9% year-over-year for the second quarter with 2% volume growth offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. In the U.S., we saw a 3% year-over-year growth in new patient prescriptions in the quarter, driven by strong execution by our dermatology sales force and increased Otezla direct-to-consumer media activity. We've seen an increasingly competitive environment in dermatology with the introduction of novel topicals and new biologic treatments. Otezla retains an important role in this landscape given its broad label, safety profile and unique positioning as a first systemic treatment option for patients with cirrhosis. Enbrel sales decreased 15% year-over-year for the second quarter, primarily driven by lower net selling price. Going forward, we expect continued declining net selling price and relatively flat volumes. Enbrel is known for its efficacy and trusted by physicians. Its substantial health benefits and cash flow generation provide a solid foundation for our business. Turning now to biosimilars, where sales of our biosimilar products were relatively stable year-over-year for the second quarter. We're positioned for future growth with upcoming launches, WEZLANA, a biosimilar to Stelara and BEKEMV, a biosimilar to Soliris, are both expected to launch in the U.S. in Q1 of 2025. Our vertically integrated biosimilar business model ensures efficiency and provides attractive cash flows and returns for our shareholders. In oncology, sales of our seven innovative products, BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate, XGEVA and IMDELLTRA grew 12% year-over-year for the second quarter, driven by volume growth and higher net selling prices. In total, these products contributed almost $2 billion of sales in the second quarter. BLINCYTO sales grew 28% year-over-year to $264 million for the second quarter, driven by broad prescribing across academic and community segments for patients with B-cell ALL. BLINCYTO was recently granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a frontline consolidation treatment for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell ALL. Our commercial and medical teams are engaging key academic, regional and community customers in establishing BLINCYTO as a standard of care in this setting. LUMAKRAS sales increased 10% year-over-year to $85 million for the second quarter. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS coming from launches in new markets and additional indications. Back to back sales increased 9% year-over-year to $270 million for the second quarter, now annualizing at over $1 billion. We also drove strong performance of KYPROLIS, which grew 9% year-over-year and Nplate, which grew 12% year-over-year. Since our U.S. launch of IMDELLTRA in mid-May, we generated $12 million of sales in the second quarter. IMDELLTRA was recently approved for the treatment of adult patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. We're seeing strong clinical conviction in IMDELLTRA in both academic and community settings, and while very early in the launch, we're encouraged by the adoption of IMDELLTRA and look forward to its potential to bring new possibilities to patients living with this aggressive disease. I'm pleased with our execution in the quarter, driving accelerated performance for our most important growth brands. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram, who will cover our rare disease portfolio.\nVikram Karnani: Thank you, Murdo. I am pleased to provide an update on rare disease, which delivered product sales of over $1.1 billion in Q2. Beginning with TEPEZZA for the treatment of thyroid-eye disease, second quarter sales were $479 million, reflecting growth of 8% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter, when compared to results from the legacy Horizon business. Recall that there are roughly 100,000 TED patients in the U.S., and penetration is currently only in the single digits. The main growth opportunity is within the roughly 80% of TED patients who have a low clinical activity score or CAS. We are expanding our reach among new prescribers, particularly ophthalmologists and endocrinologists who manage many of the low cash patients who can benefit from TEPEZZA. The impact of thyroid-eye disease on quality of life is often underestimated. So our focus is on educating health care providers about the significant effects on patients, even those with less visible symptoms. In addition, we are increasing our strategic focus in endocrinology with a dedicated sales force to engage in this important space. We are also making significant strides in improving access. Thanks to the recognition of TEPEZZA's efficacy by payers. To date, we have achieved favorable medical policy changes for greater than 55% of U.S. covered lives, compared to 50% last quarter and just 5% roughly one year ago. We expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024. International expansion remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA with regulatory filings complete or underway in multiple geographies. With Japan as the next significant launch expected by early 2025. We also initiated a Phase III subcutaneous study and see this as an opportunity to increase adoption and improve the patient experience with an alternative option to our current IV formulation. KRYSTEXXA for patients with chronic refractory gout, delivered $294 million in sales in Q2, representing 20% year-over-year growth driven by volume growth from strong commercial execution. KRYSTEXXA with immunomodulation continues to redefine the standard of care for uncontrolled gout. UPLIZNA, for patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or NMOSD, delivered $92 million in sales in Q2, representing 35% year-over-year growth. International expansion of UPLIZNA is also underway with launches in multiple ex U.S. markets, including Canada, which launched earlier this year. In addition to NMOSD, we are excited about the impressive Phase III results with UPLIZNA in IgG4-related disease. And the potential it has to address a debilitating condition that impacts more than 20,000 patients in the U.S. We also look forward to the Phase III readout for UPLIZNA in myasthenia gravis later this year. Jay will address these in more detail in a moment. Sales of TAVNEOS were $71 million for the second quarter. Sales increased 137% year-over-year driven by volume growth. In the U.S., more than 3,500 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis have been treated with TAVNEOS. Over 2,300 health care professionals have now prescribed TAVNEOS, a roughly 35% increase in the prescriber base so far this year. The integration of the legacy Horizon business is progressing nicely as we leverage Amgen's leadership in inflammation, world-class manufacturing and process development and extensive global footprint. Now I will pass it over to Jay for our R&D update.\nJay Bradner: Thank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter, we rapidly advanced our broad clinical pipeline of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class programs. We received two approvals in the quarter, a breakthrough therapy designation and delivered exciting clinical data for many programs, while eagerly awaiting additional data readouts later this year. Let's begin with general medicine. As previously mentioned, based on the interim analysis, we are seeing a differentiated profile with MariTide and are confident it will address important unmet medical needs in obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. We remain on track and look forward to top line 52-week data from the ongoing MariTide Phase II study in late 2024. We are actively planning and expect to initiate a broad Phase III program in obesity, obesity-related conditions and diabetes, along with a Phase II trial investigating MariTide for the treatment of diabetes in patients with and without obesity. Beyond MariTide, we continue to progress our early obesity programs that consists of both oral and injectable incretin and non-incretin approaches. We expect one of these programs to enter clinical development later this year. Also in Gen med is olpasiran, our potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA medicine, the fully enrolled Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial of olpasiran continues to progress. To remind, Lp(a) is a genetically defined cardiovascular risk factor that is elevated in approximately 20% of individuals and for whom no effective or targeted therapies currently exist. In oncology, we continue to deliver on high conviction targets with differentiated therapies capable of delivering transformative clinical benefit for patients. Let's begin with IMDELLTRA, a first-in-class bispecific T-cell engager or BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. We're very pleased that the FDA granted accelerated approval to IMDELLTRA for the treatment of adult patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Further, we are pleased that the NCCN guidelines have been updated to include IMDELLTRA as a preferred option for patients with a chemotherapy-free interval less than or equal to six months and as an other recommended treatment option for patients with a chemotherapy-free interval greater than sixmonths. Based on the remarkable activity observed as a single agent in patients receiving second and third-line therapy, we are rapidly advancing IMDELLTRA into frontline therapy with three Phase III studies underway in both extensive and limited stage disease. One of these studies, DeLLphi-304, our confirmatory Phase III study in second-line small cell lung cancer has completed enrollment. Notably, IMDELLTRA is the first bispecific T-cell engager approved to treat a common solid tumor. The present study of tarlatamab in earlier lines and in the context of lower tumor burden, draws from our experience with our first approved bispecific T-cell engager BLINCYTO and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we observed a dramatic improvement in overall survival in minimal residual disease negative patients, along with improved tolerability. These BLINCYTO data provide evidence that directing the T cell in this manner is an effective means of finding and eliminating residual cancer cells that are drivers of occurrence. This June, based on the profound survival benefit observed in the treatment of frontline disease, the FDA approved an additional indication for BLINCYTO for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients one month or older with CD19 positive, Philadelphia chromosome negative, B-cell ALL and the consolidation phase of treatment, here regardless of minimal residual disease status. We continue to seek to expand the impact of BLINCYTO in newly diagnosed B-ALL through ongoing studies and with the further investigation of subcutaneous administration. Our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific molecule, xaluritamig, has also demonstrated profound clinical activity in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, importantly, demonstrating our ability to target a second common solid tumor with a bispecific T-cell engager therapy. We are rapidly advancing this program and have now fully enrolled the monotherapy Phase I dose expansion as we continue to enroll patients in reduced monitoring and outpatient cohorts. Further, we are advancing the study of xaluritamig earlier in the prostate cancer treatment paradigm with combinations of xaluritamig and enzalutamide or abiraterone ongoing while we plan additional studies in earlier disease settings. In sum, with regard IMDELLTRA, BLINCYTO, xaluritamig as major advances, further establishing the broad potential of our leading bispecific T cell engager platform. To round out oncology, we have completed enrollment of FORTITUDE-101, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab, a first-in-class fibroblast growth factor receptor IIb directed monoclonal antibody administered in combination with chemotherapy in frontline gastric cancer. We are also rapidly advancing AMG 193, our oral PRMT5 inhibitor developed for MTAP-null solid tumors as both a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies. Additional data from the Phase I dose escalation and initial dose expansion study of AMG 193 in patients with MTAP-null solid tumors will be presented at ESMO in September. Lastly, we are pleased also to share that the FDA has granted an orphan drug designation to AMG 193 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Turning to inflammation. We are encouraged by the data arising from our Phase II study of TEZSPIRE in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. Together with AstraZeneca, we are actively planning for Phase III development in COPD. We are also pleased to announce that the FDA recently granted TEZSPIRE, a Breakthrough Therapy Designation as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients with moderate to very severe COPD, characterized by the eosinophilic phenotype. Beyond COPD, we continue to explore TEZSPIRE in separate Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected later this year. Turning to rocatinlimab, a first-in-class T cell rebalancing monoclonal antibody targeting the OX40 receptor. The comprehensive rocatinlimab Phase III ROCKET program has successfully enrolled over 3,100 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Five of the eight studies are now fully enrolled. The Phase III HORIZON study, part of this ROCKET program evaluates rocatinlimab monotherapy versus placebo in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. And it is ongoing with data readout anticipated in H2. Beyond atopic dermatitis, we continue to explore the potential of rocatinlimab in additional indications and have initiated a Phase II study in moderate to severe asthma as well as a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis. Shifting to rare disease, we are encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline with several mid- to late-stage opportunities. UPLIZNA, a CD19 B-cell depleting therapy offers a differentiated mechanism of action than other autoimmune therapies, durable efficacy with a convenient every six-month IV dosing schedule. This could be very important for chronic inflammatory diseases. Recently, we were excited to announce positive top line results from a Phase III clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of UPLIZNA for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease. The trial met its primary endpoint, showing an astonishing 87% reduction in the risk of IgG4-related disease flare, as compared to placebo during the 52-week placebo-controlled window. All key secondary endpoints were also met and no new safety signals were identified. This is the first randomized controlled trial to demonstrate efficacy in the IgG4-related disease patient population. Regulatory filing activities are underway and full data from the trial will be presented at a future medical meeting. We are also studying a UPLIZNA in generalized myasthenia gravis through the ongoing Phase III MINT study. The MINT study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of UPLIZNA in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis, who are of a comparable disease severity and a comparable treatment experience to other recently approved biologic therapies. We are investigating UPLIZNA in the two predominant antibody serotypes that drive this disease, acetylcholine receptor positive and in muscle specific tyrosine kinase positive patients. MINT is the only trial attempting to demonstrate efficacy while removing the treatment benefit of steroids. Patients in the MINT trial who entered on steroids had a protocol specified taper by 24 weeks. We look forward to data readout in the second half of 2024. To expand the impact of our CD19 directed therapeutics to even more patients suffering from serious inflammatory diseases, compelled by both biological inferences and insights from small studies of CD19-directed therapies, we are launching a development program targeting CD19 positive B cell-mediated autoimmune disease with UPLIZNA and blinatumomab. This is an exciting and promising space with Amgen's strong capabilities in inflammatory disease and two well-characterized assets, we are very well positioned to lead in this rapidly advancing field. We will have more to say about these programs in due course. Lastly, in May, the FDA approved BEKEMV as the first interchangeable biosimilar to Soliris or eculizumab. Also in biosimilar development, registration-enabling studies are underway for ABP 234 and a biosimilar candidate to KEYTRUDA and ABP 206, a biosimilar candidate to OPDIVO. In closing, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their strong sense of service to patients facing serious illness, their intense focus and spirited collaboration during this momentous year and their commitment to growing the impact of both our research and our business through this portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines. I'll now turn it over to Peter.\nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong second quarter performance and are on track with our 2024 full year goals and long-term objectives. We have a strong long-term growth outlook across our four therapeutic areas, driven by the breadth and depth of our innovative pipeline and in-market products, serving patients with serious illnesses around the globe. Starting with our second quarter results, as shown on Slide 27 of the slide deck, we delivered $8.4 billion in total revenue, a 20% increase year-over-year. It's the highest quarterly revenue in Amgen history, achieved with 26% volume growth. This means more patients than ever are receiving Amgen medicines. Excluding the addition of Horizon, product sales increased 5% year-over-year, driven by 10% volume growth. In the second quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 48.2% as a percentage of product sales with total non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 30% year-over-year. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 0.4 percentage points on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher royalties and profit share due to changes in sales mix. Non-GAAP R&D spending in the second quarter increased 30% year-over-year as we strategically invested in the late-stage pipeline, including MariTide, rocatinlimab and bemarituzumab as well as Horizon acquired programs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by the addition of Horizon. Excluding the addition of Horizon, non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 14% year-over-year, driven by investment in Repatha, Otezla and EVENITY. Our non-GAAP OI&E resulted in a $700 million expense, up $400 million year-over-year, almost entirely due to increased interest expenses from the Horizon acquisition. We remain on track to deleverage with line of sight to retiring greater than $10 billion of debt by the end of 2025. This includes $1.4 billion of debt retired in the second quarter and $2.0 billion year-to-date. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 1.5 percentage points year-over-year to 14.9%, primarily due to the change in sales mix from the inclusion of our Horizon. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow, a decrease of $3.8 billion -- a decrease from $3.8 billion in the previous year, driven by the timing of tax payments. In 2023, federal tax payments, including our repatriation tax were made in the fourth quarter, whereas in 2024, these payments were made in the second quarter. The Horizon integration is progressing well, and we expect to reach $500 million in pretax synergies by year three post acquisition, with roughly 50% to be realized by the end of this year. We expect accretion to non-GAAP earnings per share in 2024. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. We're investing in the best innovation, both internally and externally to rapidly advance an innovative pipeline, multiple potentially first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicines across the four therapeutic areas. As I said earlier, this is reflected in our second quarter non-GAAP R&D spend of $1.4 billion, an increase of 30% year-over-year. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth. We are expanding capacity in our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, including investments to support MariTide. Beyond manufacturing, we are opening a new global technology and innovation center in Hyderabad, India, which will attract talent at scale and accelerate digital capabilities across the organization, including artificial intelligence, data science, life science and medical. And third, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid competitive dividends of $2.25 per share in the second quarter. This represented a 6% increase compared to 2023. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2024 on Slide 29. We expect our 2024 total revenues in the range of $32.8 billion to $33.8 billion in non-GAAP earnings per share between $19.10 and $20.10. I will mention a few considerations as you model the remainder of 2024. On revenues, we expect mid-single-digit growth quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter compared to Q3. Our full year non-GAAP R&D expenses are now expected to increase more than 25% year-over-year as we further invest in our late-stage pipeline to support multiple late-stage studies underway across all therapeutic areas. As a result, we now project the full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 47% with Q3 operating margin lower than Q2. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter are expected to grow at a similar rate to the first two quarters of this year. We expect OI&E to be approximately $2.5 billion, which includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition. We continue to expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be in the 15% to 16% range, including the full year benefits associated with the inclusion of the Horizon business. As we have previously indicated, we have initiated activities to further expand MariTide manufacturing capacity. To support these initial efforts, we now expect capital expenditures of $1.3 billion in 2024 versus our most recent guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Our long-term outlook remains robust, and I am grateful to our 27,000-plus colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serve patients. This concludes our financial update. We will now begin our Q&A session. Julianne, please remind our participants of the process. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen.\nYaron Werber: Jay, maybe a question for you, actually. I want to start with the UPLIZNA. And we noticed a few things. The MINT study was supposed to have complete -- completion around mid-May. And Amgen just posted a whole bunch of new job postings for GMJ and you have a slot on October 15 at the MGFA to present the data. As you noted, you're doing steroid tapering. It's a different trial design but you also did steroid tapering and the other two indications, NMO and IgG4. Can you talk a little bit sort of what are you hoping to see and what are you expecting to see from the data?\nJay Bradner: Thank you, Yaron, for the question, and for following the program so closely. we're Very excited about UPLIZNA, the CD19 B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody is showing really remarkable activity, the results in IgG4-related disease is a bellwether and is quite dramatic with a hazard ratio of 0.13, a P value of what, five to the minus seven. This was a stunning result and the first positive Phase III for patients with IgG4-related diseases. As you nicely picked up in your question, one of the opportunities of UPLIZNA is to get patients off steroids, and this is, therefore, a predefined ambition of UPLIZNA in both IgG4-related disease setting in that study as well, as in the generalized myasthenia gravis setting. Now these results won't be available until the second half of this year. And so I have no further update on that timing. But do stay tuned. We're so hopeful that this once every six months CD19 B-cell depleting therapy can differentiate substantially from available treatments like steroids and other B-cell targeting therapies and make a big difference for these patients.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs.\nSalveen Richter: Just following up here on Yaron, could you speak to the clinical bar for UPLIZNA and myasthenia gravis, both on a placebo-adjusted basis and also on an absolute basis, given the notable steroid taper, which I believe the other therapies did not have included in their design. And with regard to this MGFA scientific session meeting, should we expect top line results before that presentation?\nJay Bradner: Thanks, Salveen. As I just mentioned to Yaron, we won't be providing further guidance on the timing of the results from the UPLIZNA study, the MINT study in myasthenia gravis of that you stay tuned. And as also, as shared knowing that patients with myasthenia gravis are repeatedly and over many, many months of treatment challenge by the requirement for persistent steroids, we built in a taper steroids on to this study. And these results to read out in the second half of this year will bring to light exactly how successful we are at liberating patients from steroids with every six months UPLIZNA.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets.\nEvan Seigerman: Well, not a huge growth driver. I'd love if you could characterize on some of your negotiations with CMS on Enbrel. Many of your peers are pleased with kind of the fair price that they negotiated with CMS. Do you feel the same way? I'd also love to know how you're seeing about the impact of Part D redesign?\nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Evan, for the question. It's Murdo here. Overall, Enbrel continues to do well in the market despite a very competitive market in psoriatic arthritis and in rheumatoid arthritis. We also continue to have relatively stable volume despite all of the conversion that's going on in adalimumab with biosimilars. So we're quite pleased with prescribers adoption and continued value of Enbrel safety and tolerability, which is well established over a long period of time now in many, many years of experience. The process with CMS has concluded. We do have our price. I would just remind you that roughly 25% of Enbrel revenues come from Medicare Part D. So that will, in part, mitigate the impact of the CMS price reduction. And we continue to see that this is not a good mechanism to incentivize and reward innovation and it does not resemble one we've commonly described as a negotiation. So we've concluded that process. And we continue to look to help patients and support them with Enbrel in the market and we will watch the Part D redesign closely. We will look to see how PBMs redesign their formularies, and we will look to see how patients are impacted by the new model. While the cap may help, the out-of-pocket for many patients may actually rise. So we're watching it closely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Yee from Jefferies.\nMike Yee: Pivoting to obesity. I know that you are on track for data later this year for the injectable product, which you claim as differentiated as other competitors have moved quickly both with their programs with injectables but also oral multiple companies are putting off. Can you just comment about how you feel about your positioning in this space, given others have multiple products moving to late stage and how you feel you can position yourself here, given just 133.\nJay Bradner: Thanks, Mike. Why don't I get started and Murdo, perhaps you could add on at the end. We are very pleased with the results that we've seen at the interim with the overall conduct of the Phase II study. Though there's been no further analysis since the interim, as of the interim all the arms were active, dropout had not been an issue. And we saw a differentiated profile with MariTide and remain confident that this medicine can address significant important unmet medical need in obesity, obesity-related conditions and, in particular, type 2 diabetes, as shared earlier in the call. There's no question that there is quite a democratized and broad base of innovation in this space. And potentially oral medicines could serve to address some of that still vast and remaining unmet need, and we follow these programs very closely. Still, the development of MariTide is advancing very briskly, as we now move to rapidly initiate a broad Phase III program. And we remain confident in what MariTide can offer for patients with obesity-related conditions as well as diabetes. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Jay. I think the data continue to emerge in the obesity and obesity-related conditions landscape, and show a clear benefit that reducing weight will indeed -- with GLP-1-based mechanisms will indeed improve outcomes in many disease settings. So that continues to expand the market and grow it. I do agree with Jay that there will be patients who may seek oral options but I continue to believe that we have a very good, differentiated product here and that monthly dosing or even less frequently will continue to help patients persist on their weight loss medication and achieve, hopefully, some of those hard endpoint risk reductions that we're seeing in clinical trial presentations. I would say that we would report that we have a really good convenient dosing here with a single-use pen that we're working on. And that weekly injectable products are probably more vulnerable to orals than a convenient monthly dosing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: I wanted to focus on MariTide, if I may. A two-part question. First, it looks like your competitors are moving forward to Phase III on either smaller data sets or lesser further along from a Phase II, Phase III perspective. Just curious why you thought you definitely needed 52-week data? Was that mostly conservatism? Or is that some FDA feedback as well? And then also on CapEx, I feel like the $150 million guidance increase seems relatively trivial but it does imply CapEx being up 80% over first half. Could you please expand on whether it's API related or something else you have in mind?\nJay Bradner: Yes. Thanks. Pete, why don't I start on the overall development plan for MariTide and the value of the Phase II data that we'll have at the end of this year. Umer, as you know, this medicine coming out of Phase I showed a quite remarkable impact on obesity with a dramatic reduction in BMI, actually proved quite durable after just three doses, MariTide in that Phase I study, we saw persistent weight loss really out 150 days or more at some doses. The Phase II study is a much larger concern. This is a 592 patient study. It has 11 arms, it has monthly or as Murdo said, even less frequent dosing. As a part two that allows us to really follow up on this durability signal, and it will allow the precision selection of dose or doses that patients and their practitioners really desire. This also confirms to regulatory requirements entering into Phase III.\nPeter Griffith: Umer, it's Peter on CapEx, as we previously indicated, we have initiated activities to further expand MariTide manufacturing capacity. So of course, those efforts, I said we now expect CapEx of $1.3 billion in '24 versus the most recent guidance, which was $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer.\nJay Olson: Congrats on all the progress, especially in your BiTE platform. Can you talk about any feedback you're getting from clinicians on the IMDELLTRA launch and potential lessons learned from BLINCYTO that you can leverage for IMDELLTRA, especially since you're launching BLINCYTO now in B-ALL and developing a subcu formulation?\nBob Bradway: Take it in a couple of parts here. Murdo, do you want to share what we're learning from the launch?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jay. Obviously, it's very early given that this was a mid-May approval but I have to say we are extremely pleased with how both thought leaders and community oncologists are receiving IMDELLTRA in the market. Their clinical conviction is very high. They are moving quickly to establish care pathways for these patients given the monitoring requirement for IMDELLTRA. And this is -- this disease setting, as you know, is a really difficult disease setting. Patients can progress relatively rapidly after platinum-based chemotherapy in the front line. And so we're obviously moving very quickly with our medical teams, our account management teams and our sales organization to build rapid awareness and to help both academic and community oncology accounts, be able to treat patients easily and safely and have the appropriate settings for care follow-up. So very early, but this product is seen as a major transformation in this disease setting. Jay?\nJay Bradner: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jay. You picked up on something really interesting and that's leveraging the learnings of BLINCYTO. I mean this really is a platform capability that we enjoy with bispecific T-cell engagers. And already in the development of IMDELLTRA after its first approval, we are seeing significant readthrough of the BLINCYTO lessons, moving from later lines of therapy to earlier lines of therapy, to drive efficacy in the setting of reduced tumor burden. The utility of these medicines in combination, which is so much easier to access and assess than other complex modalities, say, like CAR-T and moving these medicines to the point of therapy where they can have the greatest impact, namely frontline, also pathways to reduce monitoring. Jay, we are leveraging all the learnings of BLINCYTO to drive and expedite the development of IMDELLTRA to be a component of frontline small cell lung cancer therapy, both with extensive stage and limited stage disease. And as Murdo shared, we do this work really quite inspired by the impact of the medicine, even so early in its launch, significant demand to learn and access and offer this medicine.\nBob Bradway: And Jay, I'd just add that when it comes to xaluritamig, I think you're question applies well there, too. So stay tuned. We'll talk more about xaluritamig's data emerge but we're optimistic about how we can apply the lessons of BLIN and IMDELLTRA to that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: I have a question for Jay. Again, on MariTide. Is there any reason to think that MariTide may or may not exhibit a different profile versus [indiscernible] on parameters such as lipid blood pressure or C-reactive protein? And how important is benefit on those parameters while you design your Phase III trial, something like outcomes trial or not?\nJay Bradner: Yes. Thank you, Mohit. I can surely understand the interest. And indeed, we are making all these measurements and more. We won't dimensionalize what we mean when we say differentiated profile at this time. We're so focused on completing this ongoing and well-conducted MariTide Phase II study but do expect to learn and listen more when ultimately we're able to be in a position to share the outcomes of Part A of the Phase II study. We are taking a comprehensive assessment to optimize dose and schedule and impact of this medicine.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets.\nGregory Renza: Congratulations on the quarter. My question is just on the obesity franchise. As you and the team had mentioned to expect one of the early obesity programs to enter clinical development later this year. Just curious if you could elaborate on what lens you're using to nominate that first or that next program? I'd imagine it's rather complex in the assessment and any color you have on determining that choice and how to take that forward, would be great.\nJay Bradner: Gregory. Thank you. This is Jay, and thanks for following the early pipeline in its development. It's developing very nicely. As we've shared our strategy in the development of obesity medicines and medicines for obesity-related conditions. We're interested in really harvesting the insights of the incretin pathway but also moving beyond this pathway to other novel targets, some supported by genetic inferences but all of them supported by strong preclinical development packages. And so it is a multifactorial assessment that leads to the decision to resource the medicine in human clinical investigation. But it's a high degree of conviction that's required as the bars are ever rising within our portfolio for that resource as well as in the field. So more to follow on the mechanism and characteristics of this new medicine that we're intending to advance in the clinical investigation in the second half of this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler.\nChris Raymond: And if I may, another obesity question. Just on MariTide, and I've heard you guys now talk for a long time about planning for a broad Phase III program. But I don't think you guys have ever talked even in generalities, when exactly this will happen. Can you maybe give a range here for when you anticipate kicking off enrollment in that program?\nBob Bradway: Chris, as you can expect, we're focused now on completing the Phase II trial and moving as swiftly as appropriate into Phase III. So we'll have more to say that over the course of the coming year. You can appreciate it's a competitively intense field. So we're not giving dates at this point.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould from Barclays.\nCarter Gould: For Peter, on August 2, the U.S. Tax Court entered a decision against Coke. Their litigation was often referenced as sort of the best benchmark for sort of what you're facing. Appreciating that you took the deposit earlier this year but why shouldn't there be read through from that case? And maybe you could speak to your overall confidence in the outcome.\nPeter Griffith: No. Thank you very much for the question, Carter. Nothing has changed in our evaluation of the case. Court dates set for November 4. We're confident in our position, right, where we've always been. We're confident in our reserves are at an appropriate level. And -- what I would say is, first of all, I don't see -- and Coke hasn't been as much a reference and I won't get into making comparisons. We refer once in a while to the Medtronic situation. But in general, what we've seen is that the tax court in the last several years has reinforced the value of manufacturing down in Puerto Rico. And so we look forward to stating our case. We're very confident where we're at. And that's all we've got to say at this time. No change. We're at where we were in terms of confidence, which is in the same place for the last 2.5 or 3 years now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: Peter, another one for you here. I appreciate the incremental guidance on CapEx, but just was wondering if you could speak directionally about margins in 2025, given the likely scope of the MariTide obesity program.\nPeter Griffith: Terence, we don't -- as you know, we don't guide long-term margins but let me just comment on what you're seeing this year. I'm happy to speak to that. And I think it's important. We're -- at Amgen, we're committed to a capital allocation hierarchy, where we first invest in innovation and first internal innovation. And so with that in mind, Terence, we've consistently said that we would flex out margin, which remember, with us, as a percentage of product sales, not revenue, if there were opportunities to achieve strong after-tax cash returns on our investment in excess of our hurdle rate. And then we would communicate that ahead of time. So this year, we shared with you at the beginning of the year, we felt operating margin to be about 48%. We see an opportunity here during the year to make some investments in the research and development activities with an emphasis, I would say, on development. That's up 30% year-over-year in the quarter, non-GAAP R&D. We now see non-GAAP R&D spend up over 25% year-over-year for '24, which we think is great because you've heard about the deep mid- and late-stage pipeline we have, driving MariTide in that deep mid- and late-stage pipeline. We're always focused Terence, whether it's this year or next year on productivity and prioritization, always looking for opportunities to generate capital to allocate the innovation. We've got a new program called technology and workforce strategy that we're moving along at speed and scale. I spoke about opening a new talent and innovation center in Hyderabad, India. So we are doing everything we can to preserve that margin, reallocate capital innovation and be the disciplined spenders of capital that Amgen always has been.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Just had a question on MariTide and your plans in that Phase II diabetes study. Company, obviously, very excited about the broader opportunity for the drug but it does seem like diabetes is a more established market with maybe less of the capacity constraints than we've see in obesity. So can you just talk a little bit about what you think you need to see to be able to compete here in dislodging [compens]. And can you also confirm that the study is not needed to move forward in the Phase III obesity studies, or it's just a completely separate program related to the diabetes piece of things?\nBob Bradway: Can take this in two pieces again. Jay, why don't you address the first piece and then Murdo feel free to jump in.\nJay Bradner: Yes, absolutely. As you nicely identified later this year, we will initiate an additional dedicated Phase II study that will characterize MariTide from the treatment of diabetes in patients with and without obesity. And this new study is not a gating step at all for the Phase III program for patients with obesity, but conforms to regulatory guidance and importantly, allows us to optimize dosing for the diabetic patients, where medically, I can say [indiscernible], your considerable perspective, I'm unaware of a highly efficacious monthly or less frequently administered medicine for the treatment of diabetes. Murdo?\nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Jay. I would agree with you that the differentiation that we've talked about for chronic weight management would hold in a robust way in type 2 diabetes. And while there are lots of products that can control hyperglycemia and provided HbA1c control, there is a significant benefit if you can improve adherence and persistence. And we do believe that our monthly dosing could do that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities.\nKripa Devarakonda: Another obesity question but slightly tangential. I'm not sure if you've talked about this before but there's been a conversation about muscle preservation in people who are losing weight on glip. Have you evaluated this aspect with MariTide? Do you see this being the problem broadly in the space? And -- if so, where do you think MariTide would fit into that landscape?\nBob Bradway: Sure. Jay, why don't you jump in there?\nJay Bradner: Sure. No, thank you for your question. We -- as you apparently do as well, are following this class and class of medicines that provoke remarkable weight loss or the impact on healthy tissues, including but not limited to muscle, and the associated muscle loss that has been reported in the literature may relate mechanistically and may also relate to the quite dramatic cadence of weight loss of patients treated with these medicines. And in the fullness of time, we and others will have that answer. As you can imagine, we're making many of these measurements on our own study and don't have any report -- any data to report to you here today but we too are following this. And also the progress of some organizations that are seeking to administer medicine to support muscle loss with obesity medicines that is quite interesting to us given our legacy of muscle biology. But I would say these are early insights from the field. To my knowledge, they have not proven has yet to be debilitating to the patient but we like you follow with interest.\nJustin Claeys: Julianne saying we're getting to the top half of the hour here. Maybe we'll just take two more questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Shin from Deutsche Bank.\nJames Shin: For the next obesity asset that's entering clinics later this year, can you specify whether this asset is aimed to fill in for 786, and whether there's no next obesity asset will work in tandem with 133?\nJay Bradner: Thanks, James. We won't today provide any further insight into this medicine. It's just too early. And as Bob shared, this is nicely for patients, a very competitive space. But as I shared earlier, in our deeper pipeline in obesity, we remain interested in the increasing pathway. We remain interested injectable. We're also pursuing oral medicines. And so in the fullness of time, we'll have a chance to share more. We're really playing the long game to drive true differentiation benefits to the patient and to access segments of the market that are not well addressed even by the current medicines.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Gary Nachman from Raymond James.\nGary Nachman: So shifting to TEPEZZA. When do you think we'll see more of an acceleration in the low CAS patients? How has reimbursement been improving for those patients? And describe how much the Japanese opportunity could help next year? And then just talk about the overall resources you're putting behind TEPEZZA and the rest of the rare disease portfolio that obviously, a much bigger focus for you now, if that continues to ramp up at what pace and when you might get more operating leverage from that rare disease business?\nBob Bradway: A lot of questions there, Gary, but why don't we take it in a couple of pieces. Go ahead, Vikram.\nVikram Karnani: Yes. So thanks for the question, Gary. Look, we're pretty pleased with how we've been executing on TEPEZZA this year and driving it towards growth. As you rightly observed, there are a significant number of low CAS patients or low clinical activity score patients that are suffering from this disease who are not being appropriately treated. And specifically, that's about 80,000 out of the 100,000 addressable patients in the U.S. What we have been doing is seeing significant momentum on expanding our prescriber base, which now in addition to oculoplastic surgeons also includes ophthalmologists and endocrinologists. And this is a really important element here. The strategic focus in endocrinology is really important so that we can serve those low C-A-S patients, the low CAS patients favorably. You asked about improving access. To date, we have achieved favorable medical policy changes for greater than 65% of U.S. covered lives. And if you compare that to 50% last quarter and just over 5% about a year ago, I think we've made pretty good progress in enabling patient access using our Phase IV data that have become available last year. So we continue to see a significant growth opportunity for TEPEZZA in the U.S. while also recognizing that as we make progress with a lot of our execution efforts, there continues to be a time lag between when we knock down barriers for access, expand our prescriber base and see patients get on therapy.\nBob Bradway: In Japan, Gary, we expect that they'll be, again, an attractive market and this will be well received in that country, and we'll talk about that once we've launched there during the course of next year. With respect to leverage, I think I would just offer that we're on track. With respect to our synergy targets there, and we'll begin to get even more leverage as we're able to take full control of the supply chain for the rare disease products. And then I would just further observe, as we've said many times, that feel fortunate that there's a good overlap between some of our existing capabilities in sales and marketing and the needs of those rare disease products. So all in all, we remain really excited about what we're able to do for rare disease patients, the position we have and the likelihood of that just improving over time. So with that, let me thank all of you. I know we've gone a few minutes over the set time but thank you all for participating in the call, and we look forward to regrouping with you after the third quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our 2024 Q2 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Bob Bradway",
            "content": "Okay. Well, thank you, Justin, and let me thank all of you for joining the call today. We're especially grateful in light of all of the volatility in the markets that you would carve out the time to be with us. So thank you. Through the first half of the year, our business is performing well, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive long-term growth. We're achieving strong results the same way we always have, which is by providing innovative medicines to address challenging diseases. Starting with the in-market portfolio. Second quarter revenues grew 20% to $8.4 billion with numerous medicines delivering double-digit sales growth, including in general medicine, Repatha and EVENITY, in oncology, of course, BLINCYTO, an inflammation TEZSPIRE, and then turning to rare disease, which delivered more than $1 billion on the quarter. I would highlight that KRYSTEXXA, UPLIZNA and TAVNEOS, each delivered at least double-digit sales growth in the quarter, and TEPEZZA grew 8% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. All of these first or best-in-class medicines are still early in their life cycles and have plenty of room to run through geographic expansion, new indications and/or new formulations. You'll hear more about these brands in a moment. Turning to research and development. We believe our pipeline looks very promising as well, not just in obesity, but across all of our therapeutic areas. We told you at the beginning of the year that we were anticipating more than a dozen significant pipeline milestones in 2024. We are, so far, so good. In the second quarter alone, we received accelerated approval for IMDELLTRA, a landmark new medicine for small cell lung cancer. And in fact, the physicians I've spoken to since approval are really excited about this drug as the first meaningful innovation in decades for these patients. We also received approval for BLINCYTO in the frontline treatment for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, based on significantly improved overall survival rates. The frontline approval meaningfully expands the potential impact of BLINCYTO for all patients with B-ALL. We announced impressive Phase III data for UPLIZNA in IgG4-related disease, which is a grievous illness for which there are no currently approved therapies of any kind. Building on our success with TEZSPIRE in treating severe asthma, we announced exciting data from our Phase II study in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that earned this molecule breakthrough therapy designation. COPD is the world's third leading cause of death, and new treatment options are very much needed. We look forward to additional data readouts later this year across therapeutic areas, highlighted, of course, by top line data from the ongoing MariTide Phase II study. We're encouraged by the emerging data in this field, particularly in cardiovascular and renal disease areas of long-standing strategic focus for us. We are laser focused on preparing to launch a broad Phase III program for MariTide that includes obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes, and we're further ramping our investment to support MariTide in the rest of the pipeline. You'll hear more about that pipeline shortly on this call. All in all, this is a very exciting time for us at Amgen. And as always, I'm grateful to my Amgen colleagues all around the world for their enduring commitment to patients. And now let me turn things over to Murdo. Take it in a couple of parts here. Murdo, do you want to share what we're learning from the launch? And Jay, I'd just add that when it comes to xaluritamig, I think you're question applies well there, too. So stay tuned. We'll talk more about xaluritamig's data emerge but we're optimistic about how we can apply the lessons of BLIN and IMDELLTRA to that as well. Chris, as you can expect, we're focused now on completing the Phase II trial and moving as swiftly as appropriate into Phase III. So we'll have more to say that over the course of the coming year. You can appreciate it's a competitively intense field. So we're not giving dates at this point. Can take this in two pieces again. Jay, why don't you address the first piece and then Murdo feel free to jump in. Sure. Jay, why don't you jump in there? A lot of questions there, Gary, but why don't we take it in a couple of pieces. Go ahead, Vikram. In Japan, Gary, we expect that they'll be, again, an attractive market and this will be well received in that country, and we'll talk about that once we've launched there during the course of next year. With respect to leverage, I think I would just offer that we're on track. With respect to our synergy targets there, and we'll begin to get even more leverage as we're able to take full control of the supply chain for the rare disease products.

            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Jay. We're pleased with our strong second quarter performance and are on track with our 2024 full year goals and long-term objectives. We have a strong long-term growth outlook across our four therapeutic areas, driven by the breadth and depth of our innovative pipeline and in-market products, serving patients with serious illnesses around the globe. Starting with our second quarter results, as shown on Slide 27 of the slide deck, we delivered $8.4 billion in total revenue, a 20% increase year-over-year. It's the highest quarterly revenue in Amgen history, achieved with 26% volume growth. This means more patients than ever are receiving Amgen medicines. Excluding the addition of Horizon, product sales increased 5% year-over-year, driven by 10% volume growth. In the second quarter, we delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 48.2% as a percentage of product sales with total non-GAAP operating expenses increasing 30% year-over-year. Non-GAAP cost of sales as a percent of product sales increased 0.4 percentage points on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by higher royalties and profit share due to changes in sales mix. Non-GAAP R&D spending in the second quarter increased 30% year-over-year as we strategically invested in the late-stage pipeline, including MariTide, rocatinlimab and bemarituzumab as well as Horizon acquired programs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 36% year-over-year, primarily driven by the addition of Horizon. Excluding the addition of Horizon, non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 14% year-over-year, driven by investment in Repatha, Otezla and EVENITY. Our non-GAAP OI&E resulted in a $700 million expense, up $400 million year-over-year, almost entirely due to increased interest expenses from the Horizon acquisition. We remain on track to deleverage with line of sight to retiring greater than $10 billion of debt by the end of 2025. This includes $1.4 billion of debt retired in the second quarter and $2.0 billion year-to-date. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 1.5 percentage points year-over-year to 14.9%, primarily due to the change in sales mix from the inclusion of our Horizon. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company generated $2.2 billion of free cash flow, a decrease of $3.8 billion -- a decrease from $3.8 billion in the previous year, driven by the timing of tax payments. In 2023, federal tax payments, including our repatriation tax were made in the fourth quarter, whereas in 2024, these payments were made in the second quarter. The Horizon integration is progressing well, and we expect to reach $500 million in pretax synergies by year three post acquisition, with roughly 50% to be realized by the end of this year. We expect accretion to non-GAAP earnings per share in 2024. We continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. We're investing in the best innovation, both internally and externally to rapidly advance an innovative pipeline, multiple potentially first-in-class and/or best-in-class medicines across the four therapeutic areas. As I said earlier, this is reflected in our second quarter non-GAAP R&D spend of $1.4 billion, an increase of 30% year-over-year. Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth. We are expanding capacity in our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, including investments to support MariTide. Beyond manufacturing, we are opening a new global technology and innovation center in Hyderabad, India, which will attract talent at scale and accelerate digital capabilities across the organization, including artificial intelligence, data science, life science and medical. And third, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid competitive dividends of $2.25 per share in the second quarter. This represented a 6% increase compared to 2023. Turning to the outlook for the business for 2024 on Slide 29. We expect our 2024 total revenues in the range of $32.8 billion to $33.8 billion in non-GAAP earnings per share between $19.10 and $20.10. I will mention a few considerations as you model the remainder of 2024. On revenues, we expect mid-single-digit growth quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter compared to Q3. Our full year non-GAAP R&D expenses are now expected to increase more than 25% year-over-year as we further invest in our late-stage pipeline to support multiple late-stage studies underway across all therapeutic areas. As a result, we now project the full year non-GAAP operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 47% with Q3 operating margin lower than Q2. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter are expected to grow at a similar rate to the first two quarters of this year. We expect OI&E to be approximately $2.5 billion, which includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition. We continue to expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be in the 15% to 16% range, including the full year benefits associated with the inclusion of the Horizon business. As we have previously indicated, we have initiated activities to further expand MariTide manufacturing capacity. To support these initial efforts, we now expect capital expenditures of $1.3 billion in 2024 versus our most recent guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Our long-term outlook remains robust, and I am grateful to our 27,000-plus colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serve patients. This concludes our financial update. We will now begin our Q&A session. Julianne, please remind our participants of the process. Thank you. Umer, it's Peter on CapEx, as we previously indicated, we have initiated activities to further expand MariTide manufacturing capacity. So of course, those efforts, I said we now expect CapEx of $1.3 billion in '24 versus the most recent guidance, which was $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. No. Thank you very much for the question, Carter. Nothing has changed in our evaluation of the case. Court dates set for November 4. We're confident in our position, right, where we've always been. We're confident in our reserves are at an appropriate level. And -- what I would say is, first of all, I don't see -- and Coke hasn't been as much a reference and I won't get into making comparisons. We refer once in a while to the Medtronic situation. But in general, what we've seen is that the tax court in the last several years has reinforced the value of manufacturing down in Puerto Rico. And so we look forward to stating our case. We're very confident where we're at. And that's all we've got to say at this time. No change. We're at where we were in terms of confidence, which is in the same place for the last 2.5 or 3 years now. Terence, we don't -- as you know, we don't guide long-term margins but let me just comment on what you're seeing this year. I'm happy to speak to that. And I think it's important. We're -- at Amgen, we're committed to a capital allocation hierarchy, where we first invest in innovation and first internal innovation. And so with that in mind, Terence, we've consistently said that we would flex out margin, which remember, with us, as a percentage of product sales, not revenue, if there were opportunities to achieve strong after-tax cash returns on our investment in excess of our hurdle rate.

We see an opportunity here during the year to make some investments in the research and development activities with an emphasis, I would say, on development. That's up 30% year-over-year in the quarter, non-GAAP R&D. We now see non-GAAP R&D spend up over 25% year-over-year for '24, which we think is great because you've heard about the deep mid- and late-stage pipeline we have, driving MariTide in that deep mid- and late-stage pipeline. We're always focused Terence, whether it's this year or next year on productivity and prioritization, always looking for opportunities to generate capital to allocate the innovation. We've got a new program called technology and workforce strategy that we're moving along at speed and scale. I spoke about opening a new talent and innovation center in Hyderabad, India. So we are doing everything we can to preserve that margin, reallocate capital innovation and be the disciplined spenders of capital that Amgen always has been."

            "content": "Thank you, Murdo. I am pleased to provide an update on rare disease, which delivered product sales of over $1.1 billion in Q2. Beginning with TEPEZZA for the treatment of thyroid-eye disease, second quarter sales were $479 million, reflecting growth of 8% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter, when compared to results from the legacy Horizon business. Recall that there are roughly 100,000 TED patients in the U.S., and penetration is currently only in the single digits. The main growth opportunity is within the roughly 80% of TED patients who have a low clinical activity score or CAS. We are expanding our reach among new prescribers, particularly ophthalmologists and endocrinologists who manage many of the low cash patients who can benefit from TEPEZZA. The impact of thyroid-eye disease on quality of life is often underestimated. So our focus is on educating health care providers about the significant effects on patients, even those with less visible symptoms. In addition, we are increasing our strategic focus in endocrinology with a dedicated sales force to engage in this important space. We are also making significant strides in improving access. Thanks to the recognition of TEPEZZA's efficacy by payers. To date, we have achieved favorable medical policy changes for greater than 55% of U.S. covered lives, compared to 50% last quarter and just 5% roughly one year ago. We expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024. International expansion remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA with regulatory filings complete or underway in multiple geographies. With Japan as the next significant launch expected by early 2025. We also initiated a Phase III subcutaneous study and see this as an opportunity to increase adoption and improve the patient experience with an alternative option to our current IV formulation. KRYSTEXXA for patients with chronic refractory gout, delivered $294 million in sales in Q2, representing 20% year-over-year growth driven by volume growth from strong commercial execution. KRYSTEXXA with immunomodulation continues to redefine the standard of care for uncontrolled gout. UPLIZNA, for patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, or NMOSD, delivered $92 million in sales in Q2, representing 35% year-over-year growth. International expansion of UPLIZNA is also underway with launches in multiple ex U.S. markets, including Canada, which launched earlier this year. In addition to NMOSD, we are excited about the impressive Phase III results with UPLIZNA in IgG4-related disease. And the potential it has to address a debilitating condition that impacts more than 20,000 patients in the U.S. We also look forward to the Phase III readout for UPLIZNA in myasthenia gravis later this year. Jay will address these in more detail in a moment. Sales of TAVNEOS were $71 million for the second quarter. Sales increased 137% year-over-year driven by volume growth. In the U.S., more than 3,500 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis have been treated with TAVNEOS. Over 2,300 health care professionals have now prescribed TAVNEOS, a roughly 35% increase in the prescriber base so far this year. The integration of the legacy Horizon business is progressing nicely as we leverage Amgen's leadership in inflammation, world-class manufacturing and process development and extensive global footprint. Now I will pass it over to Jay for our R&D update. Yes. So thanks for the question, Gary. Look, we're pretty pleased with how we've been executing on TEPEZZA this year and driving it towards growth. As you rightly observed, there are a significant number of low CAS patients or low clinical activity score patients that are suffering from this disease who are not being appropriately treated. And specifically, that's about 80,000 out of the 100,000 addressable patients in the U.S. What we have been doing is seeing significant momentum on expanding our prescriber base, which now in addition to oculoplastic surgeons also includes ophthalmologists and endocrinologists. And this is a really important element here. The strategic focus in endocrinology is really important so that we can serve those low C-A-S patients, the low CAS patients favorably. You asked about improving access. To date, we have achieved favorable medical policy changes for greater than 65% of U.S. covered lives. And if you compare that to 50% last quarter and just over 5% about a year ago, I think we've made pretty good progress in enabling patient access using our Phase IV data that have become available last year. So we continue to see a significant growth opportunity for TEPEZZA in the U.S. while also recognizing that as we make progress with a lot of our execution efforts, there continues to be a time lag between when we knock down barriers for access, expand our prescriber base and see patients get on therapy."

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob. Execution was strong in the second quarter, driving 20% year-over-year sales growth and all of our regions delivered attractive growth. Sales of 12 products grew at least double digits, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, TAVNEOS and BLINCYTO, all brands that are important to our future growth. Starting with our General Medicine portfolio. Sales of Repatha, EVENITY and Prolia collectively grew 20% year-over-year in the second quarter, driven by volume growth. Repatha sales increased 25% year-over-year to $532 million for the second quarter, now well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar business. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year volume growth of 46%, partially offset by lower net selling price. In the U.S., we see increased recognition of the importance of lowering LDL cholesterol by health care providers, payers and patients, which has significantly accelerated volume growth for Repatha. Our efforts have broadened insurance coverage and removed prior authorization requirements by several payers. In a recent survey, roughly 95% of cardiologists responded that Repatha is accessible and that access has improved significantly versus two years ago. EVENITY sales increased 39% year-over-year to $391 million for the second quarter. In the U.S., volume growth was supported by both increased prescription volume from existing EVENITY prescribers and an expansion of new prescribers. In Japan, EVENITY has been prescribed to approximately 600,000 patients to date and continues to be the segment leader with 45% of the bone builder segment. There are many women who remain at risk of a fracture due to postmenopausal osteoporosis. We're encouraged by the growth momentum we are driving and have conviction in the potential for EVENITY to help even more patients. Prolia sales increased 13% year-over-year to $1.2 billion for the second quarter. Volume growth continues to be supported by real-world evidence demonstrating Prolia superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. In inflammation, TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with $234 million sales in the second quarter. Sales increased 76% year-over-year, primarily driven by uptake of the prefilled single-use pen. We see strong growth opportunity for TEZSPIRE given its unique differentiated profile and its broad potential to treat the 2.5 million patients worldwide with severe uncontrolled asthma. Otezla sales decreased 9% year-over-year for the second quarter with 2% volume growth offset by lower net selling price and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. In the U.S., we saw a 3% year-over-year growth in new patient prescriptions in the quarter, driven by strong execution by our dermatology sales force and increased Otezla direct-to-consumer media activity. We've seen an increasingly competitive environment in dermatology with the introduction of novel topicals and new biologic treatments. Otezla retains an important role in this landscape given its broad label, safety profile and unique positioning as a first systemic treatment option for patients with cirrhosis. Enbrel sales decreased 15% year-over-year for the second quarter, primarily driven by lower net selling price. Going forward, we expect continued declining net selling price and relatively flat volumes. Enbrel is known for its efficacy and trusted by physicians. Its substantial health benefits and cash flow generation provide a solid foundation for our business. Turning now to biosimilars, where sales of our biosimilar products were relatively stable year-over-year for the second quarter. We're positioned for future growth with upcoming launches, WEZLANA, a biosimilar to Stelara and BEKEMV, a biosimilar to Soliris, are both expected to launch in the U.S. in Q1 of 2025. Our vertically integrated biosimilar business model ensures efficiency and provides attractive cash flows and returns for our shareholders. In oncology, sales of our seven innovative products, BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate, XGEVA and IMDELLTRA grew 12% year-over-year for the second quarter, driven by volume growth and higher net selling prices. In total, these products contributed almost $2 billion of sales in the second quarter. BLINCYTO sales grew 28% year-over-year to $264 million for the second quarter, driven by broad prescribing across academic and community segments for patients with B-cell ALL. BLINCYTO was recently granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a frontline consolidation treatment for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell ALL. Our commercial and medical teams are engaging key academic, regional and community customers in establishing BLINCYTO as a standard of care in this setting. LUMAKRAS sales increased 10% year-over-year to $85 million for the second quarter. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS coming from launches in new markets and additional indications. Back to back sales increased 9% year-over-year to $270 million for the second quarter, now annualizing at over $1 billion. We also drove strong performance of KYPROLIS, which grew 9% year-over-year and Nplate, which grew 12% year-over-year. Since our U.S. launch of IMDELLTRA in mid-May, we generated $12 million of sales in the second quarter. IMDELLTRA was recently approved for the treatment of adult patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. We're seeing strong clinical conviction in IMDELLTRA in both academic and community settings, and while very early in the launch, we're encouraged by the adoption of IMDELLTRA and look forward to its potential to bring new possibilities to patients living with this aggressive disease. I'm pleased with our execution in the quarter, driving accelerated performance for our most important growth brands. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram, who will cover our rare disease portfolio. Thanks, Evan, for the question. It's Murdo here. Overall, Enbrel continues to do well in the market despite a very competitive market in psoriatic arthritis and in rheumatoid arthritis. We also continue to have relatively stable volume despite all of the conversion that's going on in adalimumab with biosimilars. So we're quite pleased with prescribers adoption and continued value of Enbrel safety and tolerability, which is well established over a long period of time now in many, many years of experience. The process with CMS has concluded. We do have our price. I would just remind you that roughly 25% of Enbrel revenues come from Medicare Part D. So that will, in part, mitigate the impact of the CMS price reduction. And we continue to see that this is not a good mechanism to incentivize and reward innovation and it does not resemble one we've commonly described as a negotiation. So we've concluded that process. And we continue to look to help patients and support them with Enbrel in the market and we will watch the Part D redesign closely. We will look to see how PBMs redesign their formularies, and we will look to see how patients are impacted by the new model. While the cap may help, the out-of-pocket for many patients may actually rise. So we're watching it closely. Yes. Thanks, Jay. I think the data continue to emerge in the obesity and obesity-related conditions landscape, and show a clear benefit that reducing weight will indeed -- with GLP-1-based mechanisms will indeed improve outcomes in many disease settings. So that continues to expand the market and grow it. I do agree with Jay that there will be patients who may seek oral options but I continue to believe that we have a very good, differentiated product here and that monthly dosing or even less frequently will continue to help patients persist on their weight loss medication and achieve, hopefully, some of those hard endpoint risk reductions that we're seeing in clinical trial presentations. I would say that we would report that we have a really good convenient dosing here with a single-use pen that we're working on. And that weekly injectable products are probably more vulnerable to orals than a convenient monthly dosing. Yes. Thanks for the question, Jay. Obviously, it's very early given that this was a mid-May approval but I have to say we are extremely pleased with how both thought leaders and community oncologists are receiving IMDELLTRA in the market. Their clinical conviction is very high. They are moving quickly to establish care pathways for these patients given the monitoring requirement for IMDELLTRA. And this is -- this disease setting, as you know, is a really difficult disease setting. Patients can progress relatively rapidly after platinum-based chemotherapy in the front line. And so we're obviously moving very quickly with our medical teams, our account management teams and our sales organization to build rapid awareness and to help both academic and community oncology accounts, be able to treat patients easily and safely and have the appropriate settings for care follow-up. So very early, but this product is seen as a major transformation in this disease setting. Jay? Yes. Thanks, Jay. I would agree with you that the differentiation that we've talked about for chronic weight management would hold in a robust way in type 2 diabetes. And while there are lots of products that can control hyperglycemia and provided HbA1c control, there is a significant benefit if you can improve adherence and persistence. And we do believe that our monthly dosing could do that."

            "name": "Jay Bradner",
            "content": "Thank you, Vikram, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter, we rapidly advanced our broad clinical pipeline of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class programs. We received two approvals in the quarter, a breakthrough therapy designation and delivered exciting clinical data for many programs, while eagerly awaiting additional data readouts later this year. Let's begin with general medicine. As previously mentioned, based on the interim analysis, we are seeing a differentiated profile with MariTide and are confident it will address important unmet medical needs in obesity, obesity-related conditions and type 2 diabetes. We remain on track and look forward to top line 52-week data from the ongoing MariTide Phase II study in late 2024. We are actively planning and expect to initiate a broad Phase III program in obesity, obesity-related conditions and diabetes, along with a Phase II trial investigating MariTide for the treatment of diabetes in patients with and without obesity. Beyond MariTide, we continue to progress our early obesity programs that consists of both oral and injectable incretin and non-incretin approaches. We expect one of these programs to enter clinical development later this year. Also in Gen med is olpasiran, our potentially best-in-class Lp(a) targeting small interfering RNA medicine, the fully enrolled Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trial of olpasiran continues to progress. To remind, Lp(a) is a genetically defined cardiovascular risk factor that is elevated in approximately 20% of individuals and for whom no effective or targeted therapies currently exist. In oncology, we continue to deliver on high conviction targets with differentiated therapies capable of delivering transformative clinical benefit for patients. Let's begin with IMDELLTRA, a first-in-class bispecific T-cell engager or BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. We're very pleased that the FDA granted accelerated approval to IMDELLTRA for the treatment of adult patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. Further, we are pleased that the NCCN guidelines have been updated to include IMDELLTRA as a preferred option for patients with a chemotherapy-free interval less than or equal to six months and as an other recommended treatment option for patients with a chemotherapy-free interval greater than sixmonths. Based on the remarkable activity observed as a single agent in patients receiving second and third-line therapy, we are rapidly advancing IMDELLTRA into frontline therapy with three Phase III studies underway in both extensive and limited stage disease. One of these studies, DeLLphi-304, our confirmatory Phase III study in second-line small cell lung cancer has completed enrollment. Notably, IMDELLTRA is the first bispecific T-cell engager approved to treat a common solid tumor. The present study of tarlatamab in earlier lines and in the context of lower tumor burden, draws from our experience with our first approved bispecific T-cell engager BLINCYTO and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we observed a dramatic improvement in overall survival in minimal residual disease negative patients, along with improved tolerability. These BLINCYTO data provide evidence that directing the T cell in this manner is an effective means of finding and eliminating residual cancer cells that are drivers of occurrence. This June, based on the profound survival benefit observed in the treatment of frontline disease, the FDA approved an additional indication for BLINCYTO for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients one month or older with CD19 positive, Philadelphia chromosome negative, B-cell ALL and the consolidation phase of treatment, here regardless of minimal residual disease status. We continue to seek to expand the impact of BLINCYTO in newly diagnosed B-ALL through ongoing studies and with the further investigation of subcutaneous administration. Our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific molecule, xaluritamig, has also demonstrated profound clinical activity in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, importantly, demonstrating our ability to target a second common solid tumor with a bispecific T-cell engager therapy. We are rapidly advancing this program and have now fully enrolled the monotherapy Phase I dose expansion as we continue to enroll patients in reduced monitoring and outpatient cohorts. Further, we are advancing the study of xaluritamig earlier in the prostate cancer treatment paradigm with combinations of xaluritamig and enzalutamide or abiraterone ongoing while we plan additional studies in earlier disease settings. In sum, with regard IMDELLTRA, BLINCYTO, xaluritamig as major advances, further establishing the broad potential of our leading bispecific T cell engager platform. To round out oncology, we have completed enrollment of FORTITUDE-101, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab, a first-in-class fibroblast growth factor receptor IIb directed monoclonal antibody administered in combination with chemotherapy in frontline gastric cancer. We are also rapidly advancing AMG 193, our oral PRMT5 inhibitor developed for MTAP-null solid tumors as both a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies. Additional data from the Phase I dose escalation and initial dose expansion study of AMG 193 in patients with MTAP-null solid tumors will be presented at ESMO in September. Lastly, we are pleased also to share that the FDA has granted an orphan drug designation to AMG 193 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Turning to inflammation. We are encouraged by the data arising from our Phase II study of TEZSPIRE in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. Together with AstraZeneca, we are actively planning for Phase III development in COPD. We are also pleased to announce that the FDA recently granted TEZSPIRE, a Breakthrough Therapy Designation as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients with moderate to very severe COPD, characterized by the eosinophilic phenotype. Beyond COPD, we continue to explore TEZSPIRE in separate Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected later this year. Turning to rocatinlimab, a first-in-class T cell rebalancing monoclonal antibody targeting the OX40 receptor. The comprehensive rocatinlimab Phase III ROCKET program has successfully enrolled over 3,100 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Five of the eight studies are now fully enrolled. The Phase III HORIZON study, part of this ROCKET program evaluates rocatinlimab monotherapy versus placebo in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. And it is ongoing with data readout anticipated in H2. Beyond atopic dermatitis, we continue to explore the potential of rocatinlimab in additional indications and have initiated a Phase II study in moderate to severe asthma as well as a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis. Shifting to rare disease, we are encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline with several mid- to late-stage opportunities. UPLIZNA, a CD19 B-cell depleting therapy offers a differentiated mechanism of action than other autoimmune therapies, durable efficacy with a convenient every six-month IV dosing schedule. This could be very important for chronic inflammatory diseases. Recently, we were excited to announce positive top line results from a Phase III clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of UPLIZNA for the treatment of immunoglobulin G4-related disease. The trial met its primary endpoint, showing an astonishing 87% reduction in the risk of IgG4-related disease flare, as compared to placebo during the 52-week placebo-controlled window. All key secondary endpoints were also met and no new safety signals were identified. This is the first randomized controlled trial to demonstrate efficacy in the IgG4-related disease patient population. Regulatory filing activities are underway and full data from the trial will be presented at a future medical meeting. We are also studying a UPLIZNA in generalized myasthenia gravis through the ongoing Phase III MINT study. The MINT study is evaluating the efficacy and safety of UPLIZNA in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis, who are of a comparable disease severity and a comparable treatment experience to other recently approved biologic therapies. We are investigating UPLIZNA in the two predominant antibody serotypes that drive this disease, acetylcholine receptor positive and in muscle specific tyrosine kinase positive patients. MINT is the only trial attempting to demonstrate efficacy while removing the treatment benefit of steroids. Patients in the MINT trial who entered on steroids had a protocol specified taper by 24 weeks. We look forward to data readout in the second half of 2024. To expand the impact of our CD19 directed therapeutics to even more patients suffering from serious inflammatory diseases, compelled by both biological inferences and insights from small studies of CD19-directed therapies, we are launching a development program targeting CD19 positive B cell-mediated autoimmune disease with UPLIZNA and blinatumomab. This is an exciting and promising space with Amgen's strong capabilities in inflammatory disease and two well-characterized assets, we are very well positioned to lead in this rapidly advancing field. We will have more to say about these programs in due course. Lastly, in May, the FDA approved BEKEMV as the first interchangeable biosimilar to Soliris or eculizumab. Also in biosimilar development, registration-enabling studies are underway for ABP 234 and a biosimilar candidate to KEYTRUDA and ABP 206, a biosimilar candidate to OPDIVO. In closing, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their strong sense of service to patients facing serious illness, their intense focus and spirited collaboration during this momentous year and their commitment to growing the impact of both our research and our business through this portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines. I'll now turn it over to Peter. Thank you, Yaron, for the question, and for following the program so closely. we're Very excited about UPLIZNA, the CD19 B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody is showing really remarkable activity, the results in IgG4-related disease is a bellwether and is quite dramatic with a hazard ratio of 0.13, a P value of what, five to the minus seven. This was a stunning result and the first positive Phase III for patients with IgG4-related diseases. As you nicely picked up in your question, one of the opportunities of UPLIZNA is to get patients off steroids, and this is, therefore, a predefined ambition of UPLIZNA in both IgG4-related disease setting in that study as well, as in the generalized myasthenia gravis setting. Now these results won't be available until the second half of this year. And so I have no further update on that timing. But do stay tuned. We're so hopeful that this once every six months CD19 B-cell depleting therapy can differentiate substantially from available treatments like steroids and other B-cell targeting therapies and make a big difference for these patients. Thanks, Salveen. As I just mentioned to Yaron, we won't be providing further guidance on the timing of the results from the UPLIZNA study, the MINT study in myasthenia gravis of that you stay tuned. And as also, as shared knowing that patients with myasthenia gravis are repeatedly and over many, many months of treatment challenge by the requirement for persistent steroids, we built in a taper steroids on to this study. And these results to read out in the second half of this year will bring to light exactly how successful we are at liberating patients from steroids with every six months UPLIZNA. Thanks, Mike. Why don't I get started and Murdo, perhaps you could add on at the end. We are very pleased with the results that we've seen at the interim with the overall conduct of the Phase II study. Though there's been no further analysis since the interim, as of the interim all the arms were active, dropout had not been an issue. And we saw a differentiated profile with MariTide and remain confident that this medicine can address significant important unmet medical need in obesity, obesity-related conditions and, in particular, type 2 diabetes, as shared earlier in the call. There's no question that there is quite a democratized and broad base of innovation in this space. And potentially oral medicines could serve to address some of that still vast and remaining unmet need, and we follow these programs very closely. Still, the development of MariTide is advancing very briskly, as we now move to rapidly initiate a broad Phase III program. And we remain confident in what MariTide can offer for patients with obesity-related conditions as well as diabetes. Murdo? Yes. Thanks. Pete, why don't I start on the overall development plan for MariTide and the value of the Phase II data that we'll have at the end of this year. Umer, as you know, this medicine coming out of Phase I showed a quite remarkable impact on obesity with a dramatic reduction in BMI, actually proved quite durable after just three doses, MariTide in that Phase I study, we saw persistent weight loss really out 150 days or more at some doses. The Phase II study is a much larger concern. This is a 592 patient study. It has 11 arms, it has monthly or as Murdo said, even less frequent dosing. As a part two that allows us to really follow up on this durability signal, and it will allow the precision selection of dose or doses that patients and their practitioners really desire. This also confirms to regulatory requirements entering into Phase III. Yes. Thanks for the question, Jay. You picked up on something really interesting and that's leveraging the learnings of BLINCYTO. I mean this really is a platform capability that we enjoy with bispecific T-cell engagers. And already in the development of IMDELLTRA after its first approval, we are seeing significant readthrough of the BLINCYTO lessons, moving from later lines of therapy to earlier lines of therapy, to drive efficacy in the setting of reduced tumor burden. The utility of these medicines in combination, which is so much easier to access and assess than other complex modalities, say, like CAR-T and moving these medicines to the point of therapy where they can have the greatest impact, namely frontline, also pathways to reduce monitoring. Jay, we are leveraging all the learnings of BLINCYTO to drive and expedite the development of IMDELLTRA to be a component of frontline small cell lung cancer therapy, both with extensive stage and limited stage disease. And as Murdo shared, we do this work really quite inspired by the impact of the medicine, even so early in its launch, significant demand to learn and access and offer this medicine. Yes. Thank you, Mohit. I can surely understand the interest. And indeed, we are making all these measurements and more. We won't dimensionalize what we mean when we say differentiated profile at this time. We're so focused on completing this ongoing and well-conducted MariTide Phase II study but do expect to learn and listen more when ultimately we're able to be in a position to share the outcomes of Part A of the Phase II study. We are taking a comprehensive assessment to optimize dose and schedule and impact of this medicine. Gregory. Thank you. This is Jay, and thanks for following the early pipeline in its development. It's developing very nicely. As we've shared our strategy in the development of obesity medicines and medicines for obesity-related conditions. We're interested in really harvesting the insights of the incretin pathway but also moving beyond this pathway to other novel targets, some supported by genetic inferences but all of them supported by strong preclinical development packages. And so it is a multifactorial assessment that leads to the decision to resource the medicine in human clinical investigation. But it's a high degree of conviction that's required as the bars are ever rising within our portfolio for that resource as well as in the field. So more to follow on the mechanism and characteristics of this new medicine that we're intending to advance in the clinical investigation in the second half of this year. Yes, absolutely. As you nicely identified later this year, we will initiate an additional dedicated Phase II study that will characterize MariTide from the treatment of diabetes in patients with and without obesity. And this new study is not a gating step at all for the Phase III program for patients with obesity, but conforms to regulatory guidance and importantly, allows us to optimize dosing for the diabetic patients, where medically, I can say [indiscernible], your considerable perspective, I'm unaware of a highly efficacious monthly or less frequently administered medicine for the treatment of diabetes. Murdo? Sure. No, thank you for your question. We -- as you apparently do as well, are following this class and class of medicines that provoke remarkable weight loss or the impact on healthy tissues, including but not limited to muscle, and the associated muscle loss that has been reported in the literature may relate mechanistically and may also relate to the quite dramatic cadence of weight loss of patients treated with these medicines. And in the fullness of time, we and others will have that answer. As you can imagine, we're making many of these measurements on our own study and don't have any report -- any data to report to you here today but we too are following this. And also the progress of some organizations that are seeking to administer medicine to support muscle loss with obesity medicines that is quite interesting to us given our legacy of muscle biology. But I would say these are early insights from the field. To my knowledge, they have not proven has yet to be debilitating to the patient but we like you follow with interest. Thanks, James. We won't today provide any further insight into this medicine. It's just too early. And as Bob shared, this is nicely for patients, a very competitive space. But as I shared earlier, in our deeper pipeline in obesity, we remain interested in the increasing pathway. We remain interested injectable. We're also pursuing oral medicines. And so in the fullness of time, we'll have a chance to share more. We're really playing the long game to drive true differentiation benefits to the patient and to access segments of the market that are not well addressed even by the current medicines."

        "content": "Operator: My name is Julianne, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to introduce Justin Claeys, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Claeys, you may now begin. \nJustin Claeys: Thank you, Julianne. Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. Bob Bradway will lead the call and be followed by a broader review of our performance by Jay Bradner, Murdo Gordon, Vikram Karnani and Peter Griffith.  \n Through the course of our discussion today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures to describe our performance and have provided appropriate reconciliations within the materials that accompany this call. We will also make some forward-looking statements, which are qualified by our safe harbor statement. And please note that actual results can vary materially. Over to you, Bob. \nRobert Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Justin, and thank you to our callers for joining us today. This is a busy and exciting time here at Amgen. And as you can see from our results, we're reaching many more patients around the world with our existing medicines, advancing a broad range of potential first-in-class medicines in our mid- and late-stage pipeline, and redefining what's possible in research as we integrate wet and dry lab capabilities and harness transformative technologies.  \n I'll touch on a few highlights from the quarter that give me great confidence that we're on a path to deliver attractive long-term growth. First, we have a number of products across general medicine, oncology and inflammation that have strong momentum and still plenty of room to grow. These include Repatha, which was up 33%; EVENITY, up 35%; BLINCYTO, up 26%; and TEZSPIRE, up 80%. With BLINCYTO, we expect an approval in June that should accelerate our efforts to integrate into earlier treatment lines for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  \n With TEZSPIRE, we'll share data later this month that reflect the attractive potential of this medicine in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. COPD is the world's third leading cause of death. Clearly, new treatments are very much needed, and we're excited by TEZSPIRE's potential to make a difference there.  \n Second, our newest pillar of growth, rare disease, contributed nearly $1 billion of sales in the quarter, up 14% compared with the sales of these products from a year ago. We see significant upside potential for first-in-class early-life cycle medicines like TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA, UPLIZNA and TAVNEOS. And we're pursuing launches in new geographic markets, new indications and/or new formulations for each. As an example, we announced last week our imminent plans to file TEPEZZA for approval in the European Union. \n Overall, the integration of Horizon, its people, products and pipeline is proceeding well, reflecting the strong fit between our organizations. Third, we are rapidly advancing a number of promising new medicines in our mid- and late-stage pipeline, spanning all 4 of our therapeutic areas. We are awaiting approval for tarlatamab, for example, and look forward to bringing this transformative innovation to patients with small cell lung cancer. Tarlatamab is the first T-cell-engaging therapy to demonstrate significant clinical activity against a common solid tumor, a watershed moment in a field that Amgen pioneered and continues to lead. \n Looking to the rest of the year, we anticipate data readouts from 5 Phase III trials. In addition, we announced today the development of a biosimilar to KEYTRUDA as we look to build upon the global leadership we have established in biosimilars. \n In sum, we have a broad range of medicines in hand today and coming through our pipeline that will enable us to meet the needs of millions of patients around the world and deliver strong growth through the end of the decade and beyond.  \n Now let me just add one other important update. Whereas we don't normally comment on interim data, especially for our Phase II trial, we recognize there is significant interest in obesity in MariTide, so we'll provide additional commentary today. The interim Phase II analysis for this study is complete, and we are very encouraged with the results that we've seen thus far and with the conduct of the trial. Following the interim analysis, I would say we're confident in MariTide's differentiated profile and believe it will address important unmet medical needs.  \n We are actively planning a broad Phase III program including obesity, obesity-related conditions and diabetes. Obviously, we expect to carefully complete our ongoing Phase II trial before then moving as swiftly as appropriate to establish the safety and efficacy of this potential medicine in Phase III trials. We've initiated activities as well to further expand manufacturing capacity with both clinical and commercial supply in mind.  \n Jay will provide a few additional remarks with respect to this ongoing study. And I would ask you to recognize that to protect the integrity of the study beyond this update, we would not expect to discuss these data in further detail before completion. As always, I want to thank our employees around the world for their commitment to our business and to the patients we serve. Jay, I'll turn it over to you. \nJames Bradner: Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with MariTide. Reiterating Bob's comments, we are very pleased with the results seen with MariTide thus far.  And we're very pleased with the overall conduct of the ongoing Phase II trial. All arms remain active, patient dropout has not been an issue, and we're fully on track for top line 52-week data from this 11-arm Phase II study in late 2024.  \n We're seeing a differentiated profile of MariTide and are confident that it will address important unmet medical needs, obesity, obesity-related conditions and diabetes. We look forward to completing the ongoing Phase II study and working with regulators to move rapidly to the broad Phase III program. \n Later this year, we plan to initiate an additional dedicated Phase II trial investigating MariTide for the treatment of diabetes in patients with and without obesity. This new trial is not a gating step for our Phase III program in patients with obesity. Informed by dose and schedule insights from the ongoing Phase II obesity study, the dedicated Phase II study in diabetes conforms to regulatory requirements for Phase III and is the next step towards a diabetes indication for MariTide.  \n In terms of patient experience, we expect to deliver MariTide in a convenient, handheld, patient-friendly auto-injector device with a monthly or even less frequent single-injection administration, assuming eventual approval. Across the portfolio, we are presently prioritizing differentiated medicines, those that stand to provide the greatest benefit for patients. Given the profile we've seen with AMG 786, we will not pursue further development. Instead, in obesity, we're differentially investing in MariTide and a number of preclinical assets.  \n Beyond MariTide, in the first quarter, we rapidly advanced our diverse clinical pipeline of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class programs. Looking ahead, the remainder of 2024 promises to be an exciting time for research and development with 2 PDUFA dates in June for tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer and BLINCYTO in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well as 5 Phase III data readouts. Each of these milestones could represent a significant advance towards our mission to deliver groundbreaking treatments to patients in real need.  \n Moving to olpasiran. We're pleased to announce that we've completed enrollment of the OCEAN(a)-Outcomes trial, a Phase III cardiovascular outcome study of olpasiran, our potentially best-in-class Lp(a)-targeting small interfering RNA medicine. Reflecting both our commitment to patients suffering from cardiovascular disease and the strong interest of the medical community, we successfully enrolled 7,297 patients across the globe in just 15.5 months. To our knowledge, this is the fastest-enrolling Phase III outcome study of its size. And to remind, Lp(a) is a genetically defined cardiovascular risk factor, which is elevated in approximately 20% of individuals and for whom no effective or targeted therapies currently exist. \n In oncology, we continue to deliver on high-conviction targets with differentiated therapies capable of delivering a large effect size for patients. Starting with tarlatamab, a first-in-class BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. We remain on track with an FDA priority review for a June 12 PDUFA date.  \n We're excited about tarlatamab as potentially the first selective therapy for small cell lung cancer. Based on the remarkable activity observed as a single agent in patients receiving second and third-line therapy, we are rapidly advancing tarlatamab in a frontline treatment with 3 Phase III studies now initiated in both extensive stage and limited stage disease. \n The rationale for studying tarlatamab in earlier lines of the context of lower tumor burden draws from our experience with BLINCYTO in B-cell ALL. There, we saw a dramatic improvement in overall survival in minimal residual disease-negative patients. These BLINCYTO data provide evidence that directing the T-cell in this manner is an effective means of finding and eliminating residual cancer cells, which are primarily the drivers of recurrent disease. We're hopeful we can build on this insight with tarlatamab, where comparable activity in early-stage small cell lung cancer patients would very meaningfully improve outcomes for patients facing the challenge of this aggressive cancer.  \n In sum, we regard tarlatamab as a major advance as the first bispecific T-cell engager to demonstrate efficacy in a common solid tumor, further establishing the broad potential of our bispecific T-cell engager platform. Our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific molecule, xaluritamig, has also demonstrated unambiguous activity in the solid tumor, namely prostate cancer, continues to advance following a presentation of encouraging Phase I data last fall. We have now fully enrolled the monotherapy Phase I dose expansion and continue to enroll patients in reduced monitoring and outpatient cohorts. Further, combination studies with xaluritamig in novel hormonal therapies are progressing in dose escalation studies with near-term plans to initiate dose expansion cohorts.  \n To round out oncology, we are rapidly advancing AMG 193, our oral PRMT5 inhibitor targeting MTAP null solid tumors. We've moved forward with monotherapy dose expansion studies and have initiated 2 additional Phase I studies targeting MTAP null tumors in thoracic, gastrointestinal, biliary tract and pancreatic cancers, exploring relevant combinations with standard of care. \n In our inflammation portfolio, we are encouraged by the results of the COURSE Phase IIa proof-of-concept study, which investigated TEZSPIRE in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. This study was designed to test TSLP inhibition across an intentionally broad range of eosinophil levels, irrespective of inflammatory drivers, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and smoking status. While TEZSPIRE achieved a clinically meaningful 17% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations compared to placebo, this result fell short of statistical significance likely owing to the broad overall patient demographic. \n However, even greater reductions in COPD exacerbations were observed in a planned subgroup of patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts greater than 150 cells per microliter with a trend for further reduction in a small number of subjects with baseline counts greater than 300.  We're excited by these data, which will be presented in an oral session of the American Thoracic Society Annual Meeting later this month. \n Together with our partner, AstraZeneca, we are actively planning for Phase III development of TEZSPIRE in COPD. Beyond COPD, we continue to explore TEZSPIRE in separate Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected in the second half of this year.  \n The ROCKET Phase III program for rocatinlimab, a first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody, has successfully enrolled over 2,800 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Indeed, 3 of the 8 studies in the rocatinlimab ROCKET study program are now fully enrolled. The Phase III Horizon study, part of this ROCKET program, evaluates rocatinlimab monotherapy versus placebo in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and remains on track for top line data readout in the second half of this year.  \n Beyond atopic dermatitis, we continue to broadly explore rocatinlimab in additional indications and have initiated a Phase II study in moderate to severe asthma with plans to initiate a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis in the second half of this year. We're encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline as well with several mid- to late-stage opportunities. \n Starting with UPLIZNA, we anticipate important Phase III data readouts this year in myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease, both diseases with significant unmet need and where we have the potential to make a real difference for patients.  \n Dazodalibep, an innovative CD40 ligand inhibitor fusion protein, has entered Phase III for Sjogren's disease with 2 studies now enrolling patients. This follows encouraging Phase II data with efficacy across patients with moderate to severe systemic disease and patients with high symptom burden. Dazodalibep is the first therapy to demonstrate efficacy in the latter patient population. \n Lastly, in our biosimilars portfolio, we've initiated a Phase III study of ABP 234, a biosimilar candidate to KEYTRUDA, in subjects with advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We're also pleased to announce that WEZLANA, our biosimilar candidate to STELARA, has received a positive CHMP opinion.  \n In closing, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their strong sense of service to patients facing serious illness and their commitment to growing the impact of both our research and our business to our portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines. And I'll now turn it over to Murdo. \nMurdo Gordon: Thanks, Jay. I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Strong execution resulted in sales growth of 22% year-over-year, with robust volume growth across the 4 therapeutic pillars of our business. We drove compelling growth across our regions with 10 products delivering at least double-digit volume growth, including Repatha, EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, TAVNEOS and BLINCYTO. Our integration of the legacy Horizon business continues to progress well with that portfolio generating $914 million in the quarter.  \n Sales in our general medicines business, including Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY and Aimovig grew 18% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by volume growth. Repatha sales increased 33% year-over-year to a record of $517 million for the first quarter, and Repatha is now well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar business. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year volume growth of 44%, partially offset with 13% lower net selling price.  \n Expanded formulary coverage for Repatha in the U.S. has accelerated volume growth. This was partially offset by lower net selling price resulting from higher rebates to support and expand access for patients. We expect this expanded formulary coverage, along with the removal of prior authorization requirements by several payers, will lead to increased cardiologist and primary care physician adoption.  \n Outside the U.S., we also delivered strong growth, helping even more patients reduce their cardiovascular risk. EVENITY had record sales of $342 million for the quarter. And in the U.S., volume growth was supported by an expansion of EVENITY prescribers. In Japan, EVENITY continues to be the segment leader with 46% of the bone builder market. And while we're happy with the growth of EVENITY, there are many women who remain at risk of a fracture due to their postmenopausal osteoporosis. And we see exciting growth potential for EVENITY to combat this risk, and we'll continue to apply our proven experience in bone health to ensure EVENITY reaches all the patients who need it.  \n Prolia sales grew 8% year-over-year. Volume growth continues to be supported by real-world evidence, reaffirming Prolia's superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis, who are at high risk of fracture. \n In our inflammation business, Otezla sales increased 1% year-over-year for the first quarter. In the U.S., we saw strong new patient volume growth early in the quarter. This was disrupted in February and March by the Change Healthcare cybersecurity issue, which created challenges for some patients trying to fill prescriptions at specialty pharmacies.  \n We've seen a return to accelerating new patient prescription growth in recent weeks. We see significant potential for future growth of Otezla, given its established efficacy and safety profile, excellent payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and, of course, ease of administration. To realize this potential, we've increased our investment in dermatology field force and Otezla direct-to-consumer media, focusing on efforts to educate physicians and patients on the importance of treating psoriasis systemically and the safety and efficacy profile of Otezla.  \n I'm also pleased that Otezla was recently granted pediatric exclusivity and approved by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. This is the first pediatric indication for Otezla. \n Enbrel sales decreased 2% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by volume decline, partially offset by higher inventory levels. Moving forward, we expect modest volume growth offset by declining net selling price. TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with $173 million in sales in the first quarter. Sales increased 80% year-over-year, primarily driven by uptake of the prefilled single-use pen. \n In our rare disease business, sales of TAVNEOS were $51 million in the first quarter. Sales increased 122% year-over-year, driven by volume growth. In the U.S., more than 3,000 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 2,000 health care professionals. Looking forward, we'll continue to leverage our expertise in nephrology and inflammation to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis.  \n Sales for our biosimilars portfolio grew 12% year-over-year for the first quarter, with volume growth partially offset by lower inventory levels and net selling price decline. We expect continued growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. \n In oncology, sales of our 6 innovative products, BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and XGEVA, grew 4% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by volume growth.  BLINCYTO sales grew 26% year-over-year to a record $244 million for the first quarter, driven by broad prescribing across academic and community segments for patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has set a PDUFA date of June 21 of this year for its decision on approving BLINCYTO as a treatment for patients with early-stage CD19-positive, B-cell ALL. We see significant growth potential for BLINCYTO from utilization in frontline treatment.  \n LUMAKRAS sales increased 11% year-over-year for the first quarter to a record $82 million. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS coming from the launches in new markets and additional indications. Vectibix sales increased 6% year-over-year, driven by higher net selling price and volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact. KYPROLIS sales grew 5% year-over-year to a record $376 million for the first quarter, primarily driven by volume growth outside the U.S. Nplate sales decreased 12% year-over-year for the first quarter, primarily driven by volume decline in comparison to the first quarter of 2023, which included a U.S. government order of $82 million. Excluding the Q1 2023 U.S. government order, Nplate sales grew 13% year-over-year. \n I'm pleased with our execution in the quarter and the momentum across the 4 pillars of our business. And we look forward to serving many more patients around the world who can benefit from our innovative therapies. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram. \nVikram Karnani: Thank you, Murdo. I am pleased to provide an update on rare disease, Amgen's fourth therapeutic pillar of growth, which delivered product sales of over $950 million in Q1. Beginning with TEPEZZA for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, or TED, first quarter sales were $424 million, reflecting growth of 5% year-over-year when compared to results from the legacy Horizon business.  \n As we discussed at our rare disease investor meeting a few months back, TED is often assessed using the clinical activity score, or CAS, which covers a number of different signs and symptoms, including pain, redness, swelling and function. And we now refer to TED in terms of high and low clinical activity score or high and low CAS. For the approximately 100,000 TED patients in the U.S. who could benefit from TEPEZZA, the majority of these patients, roughly 80%, are in low CAS settings. We continue to focus on this large number of low CAS patients not being appropriately treated. \n As we previously discussed, one of the main hurdles in the patient journey in this setting is access. To help patients overcome that challenge, we have generated favorable medical policy changes for greater than 50% of U.S. covered lives, and we expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024.  \n In addition, we are expanding our reach among new prescribers, particularly ophthalmologists and endocrinologists who manage many low CAS patients. The impact of TED on quality of life is often underestimated. So our focus is on educating health care providers about the significant effects on patients, even those with less visible symptoms. In addition to our focus on educating ocular surgeons and ophthalmologists, we are increasing our strategic focus in endocrinology and creating a dedicated sales force to engage in this important space.  \n International expansion remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA, which is currently approved in Brazil and Saudi Arabia. As a reminder, in January, we filed for high CAS approval in Japan. And our Phase III trial in low CAS is continuing to enroll. We have completed additional regulatory submissions in Australia, Canada, Great Britain and most recently with the European Medicines Agency. We initiated a Phase III subcutaneous study and see this as an opportunity to increase adoption and improve the patient experience with an alternative option to our current IV formulation. \n KRYSTEXXA, for patients with chronic refractory gout, delivered $235 million in sales in Q1, representing 26% year-over-year growth, driven by volume growth from strong commercial execution. UPLIZNA, the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD, delivered a record $80 million in net sales in Q1, representing 49% year-over-year growth. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex-U.S. markets including Canada, which launched in January of this year. \n The integration of the legacy Horizon business continues to be on track as we leverage Amgen's leadership in inflammation, world-class manufacturing and process development and extensive global footprint.  Now I will pass it over to Peter for our financial update. \nPeter Griffith: Thank you, Vikram. We're pleased with our performance and on track to meet our 2024 full goals and long-term objectives. Our strong growth outlook is driven across each of our 4 therapeutic pillars by our innovative pipeline and in-market portfolio products, which serve patients with serious illnesses around the globe. I'll review our first quarter results before discussing our 2024 guidance. \n As shown on Slide 23 of the slide deck, in the first quarter, we delivered $7.4 billion in total revenue, a 22% increase year-over-year. This reflects 25% volume growth, including over $900 million from acquired Horizon products and also key brands, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Prolia and BLINCYTO. Excluding the addition of Horizon, product sales increased 6% year-over-year, driven by 9% volume growth.  \n Our non-GAAP operating expenses rose by 33%, reflecting investments in Horizon acquired products, along with other late-stage pipeline medicines, including rocatinlimab, MariTide and tarlatamab. As a result, our Q1 operating margin was 43%, consistent with our guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call. Our non-GAAP OI&E resulted in $549 million expense, up $334 million year-over-year, almost entirely due to increased interest expense from debt issued for the Horizon acquisition, partially offset by higher interest income and gains from debt repurchases.  \n Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 2.4 percentage points year-over-year to 15.4%, primarily due to the change in earnings mix, the inclusion of the Horizon business, and net favorable items in the quarter. In the first quarter, the company generated $0.5 billion in free cash flow, a decrease from $0.7 billion in the previous year, primarily impacted by a planned $800 million tax deposit to the IRS to stop the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions, as we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call.  \n As a reminder, there is no change in our belief in the merits of our legal position as we prepare for trial later this year. This impact on free cash flow was partially offset by the timing of working capital items. The Horizon integration is on track, and we expect to reach our pretax $500 million synergy target by year 3 post acquisition. We also expect to achieve roughly 50% of this synergy target in our annual run rate by the end of this year 2024. We expect accretion to non-GAAP EPS in 2024 and anticipate maintaining strong cash flow generation while we continue to execute on our deleveraging plan to return to our pre-acquisition efficient capital structure by the end of 2025. \n We remain on track to achieve the pre-acquisition leverage ratio, normalized for certain other noncash items, including fair value, market value adjustment of equity investments and Horizon acquisition-related costs. We remain committed to our multiple capital allocation priorities. We continue to prioritize investing in the best innovation, both internally and externally, with increased spending on late-stage programs, including olpasiran, bemarituzumab, MariTide and rocatinlimab. \n Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth, including expanding capacity in our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. Our North Carolina site is expected to be operational by 2026. And Amgen Ohio opened in the first quarter and is utilizing artificial intelligence and extensive robotics to boost operational efficiencies.  \n We're actively integrating generative AI across the enterprise to spearhead innovation and reinforce our leadership in the industry. This strategic commitment to innovative technology enables us to lead advancements, streamline drug development and enhance patient care more effectively. \n Finally, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid dividends of $2.25 per share in the first quarter. This represented a 6% increase over that paid in each of 2023's 4 quarters. \n Turning to the outlook for the business for 2024 on Slide 25. We expect our 2024 total revenues in the range of $32.5 billion to $33.8 billion and anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share between $19 and $20.20. I'll mention a few considerations as you model the remainder of 2024. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to increase by approximately 25% year-over-year versus our prior guidance to you roughly 20% year-over-year. We're making incremental investments based on our confidence in our late-stage pipeline. \n Our R&D investment reflects our commitment to innovation, accelerating our pipeline, focusing on advancing multiple potentially first-in-class and best-in-class medicines, including supporting MariTide, 2 PDUFA dates scheduled for June and 5 Phase III data readouts throughout the year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses over the second and third quarters are expected to grow at a rate comparable to the first quarter. The fourth quarter rate will normalize with a comparable expense base in the fourth quarter of 2023 since the Horizon transaction completed in early October 2023. \n We continue to anticipate our operating margin will improve over the next 3 quarters. We expect OI&E to be roughly $2.6 billion, which includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16%, primarily being driven by a more favorable jurisdictional mix of income, which includes the full year benefits associated with the inclusion of the Horizon business. Our capital expenditures guidance remains unchanged at approximately $1.1 billion in 2024. We've initiated activities to further expand manufacturing capacity for MariTide. \n We project full year Neulasta sales of approximately $500 million. Our long-term outlook remains robust. I am grateful to our 27,000-plus colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serving patients. So this concludes the financial update. I'll hand it now back to Bob for our Q&A session. \nRobert Bradway: Okay. Thank you, Peter. And before you open the line, Julianne, let me just point out that, obviously, we have a lot of exciting opportunities here. And we're excited about the ways we think we can make a difference for patients. In terms of the opportunity in obesity, again, we recognize that there's significant interest. And we provided today's update to keep you apprised of our plans in this area. But I would just reiterate, we're focused on successfully completing and maintaining the integrity of the ongoing Phase II studies. \n So as we turn to Q&A, just bear in mind that we're going to have to be very limited in what we can say beyond what we've already delivered in our prepared remarks on obesity and MariTide. But with that in mind, Julianne, maybe you could remind our callers of the process for asking questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. \nSalveen Richter: On MariTide here, just given the move forward to Phase III, can you just remind us what you were looking to learn in the Phase II trial and likely did here, but that enabled you to kind of get confident here with the program on the [ forward ]? \nRobert Bradway: Sure. Salveen, thanks for the question. Why don't you jump in, Jay? \nJames Bradner: Yes. Thanks, Salveen, for your question. Look, we're benefiting from a really well-designed and well-executed Phase II study, a study that can teach us a lot about this medicine and how it's best dosed and received. And we're seeing from these data in aggregate a broad and differentiated profile that will guide and also encourage a Phase III clinical investigation. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Yee from Jefferies. \nMichael Yee: I appreciate the update. I think we all do. Just to clarify or to ease any investor concerns, is it safe to say that your interim looked at all doses and you feel comfortable including the highest doses and safety metrics, including bone? And all of that was looked at to date? \nJames Bradner: Thanks a lot, Michael. I'll take this one as well. Again, a very well-designed and well-executed study, a study that's replete with measurements. This is an ongoing study, so we have to be careful to avoid in introducing an inadvertent bias or unblinding. And so we just can't comment on individual characteristics, but we're very pleased with the results to date. We're moving rapidly forward with the Phase III program as well as the diabetes Phase II. I would reiterate that all the arms remain active, and we haven't had an issue with patient dropout to date. \nRobert Bradway: I think, again, Michael, as Jay said, it's a well-designed study, and you can be sure that we review the data carefully. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. \nTerence Flynn: Great. Jay, you mentioned on MariTide seeing a differentiated profile. Recognize you're limited in what you can say. But as we think about areas of differentiation, it's clearly efficacy, tolerability and dosing interval. So just wondering if you can comment on which of those areas you're differentiated on? And then what benchmark are you looking to? Is it semaglutide, tirzepatide, both of those? \nRobert Bradway: Thanks, Terence. Again, we can appreciate the desire to get into that detail. But maybe, Murdo, do you want to speak to the competitive differentiation? And then Jay, if there's anything you feel appropriate to elaborate on, you can jump in after Murdo. \nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks for the question, Terence. Thanks, Bob. Obviously, we're watching the in-market products very closely with respect to differentiation. And we're also looking at products that are in the clinic being developed. And we continue to feel very confident in our ability to have a differentiated and broad profile for MariTide as we develop it in this Phase II and as we consider our broader Phase III development program. \nJames Bradner: Yes. I'd just add, this is, Terence, a very exciting, very dynamic area. We follow the development of obesity medicines very closely. And I think in this case, the actions we're taking speak for themselves. We're hard at work planning a comprehensive and competitive Phase III program. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. \nJay Olson: Congrats on all the progress and thanks for providing the update. Maybe just to shift gears a little bit to tarlatamab. With the potential launch rapidly approaching, can you just talk about the work you're doing to prepare for that launch and the strategy behind the initial launch in the late line and then the clinical and commercial work to go behind expanding the profile and potential for tarlatamab? \nRobert Bradway: Yes, let's take that in 2 pieces. And maybe, Murdo, you can talk about the launch. And then I'm sure, Jay, you'd like to elaborate on the thinking for the clinical development of this. \nMurdo Gordon: Sure. Jay, thank you for the question on another exciting product in our portfolio, one that I think will deliver a lot of benefit for patients with small cell lung cancer, which is a very, very difficult diagnosis with very little in the way of highly effective treatments that deliver any kind of durable response in small cell. So we're anxiously awaiting approval from the FDA, but we are well prepared and have been for some time across our field organizations. All our field personnel, including their medical teams, are trained and prepared. \n We have very clear plans to reach treating physicians in very short order post approval. We have a very clear understanding of making sure that we can provide broad access to tarlatamab when it's approved. And we feel really good about this. This is a very important moment not just for Amgen but for the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer where, quite frankly, the survival in the late-stage setting is really dismal and is a matter of single-digit months. And so we have a huge opportunity here to impact, and we're not wasting any minute, any hour or any day in our planning to do that. \nJames Bradner: And Jay, thanks for highlighting the potential of this medicine, which we consider a major advance. The treatment of this disease has really not meaningfully evolved since I trained as an oncologist in the mid-90s with upfront chemotherapy and meaningful but incremental benefit to immuno-oncology therapy with PD-L1 agents today. And so this is the case where time just can't move fast enough to get this medicine into earlier lines of therapy. And so we have initiated 3 Phase III studies. \n And as you asked, I'll just give an architecture of them briefly. We have a study that will compare to tarlatamab to standard of care chemotherapy. And this is in the second line dedicated patients with a primary endpoint of overall survival, and this study is enrolling. We really want to get this medicine tested in frontline therapy, where, as you must know, patients progress so quickly that a great many of them never reach the chance to receive second and third-line therapy. And so in a pair of trials, one for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer and one for limited-stage small cell lung cancer, we'll study the contribution of tarlatamab immediately following upfront therapy with response. \n We've learned through the development of these BiTE molecules that they work best when they're given as early as possible in the course of treatment for a disease. That has been the case with ALL as we move into frontline. And we've also learned that they work best when there is a low burden of disease. And so the design of these 3 Phase III studies will bring this medicine to earlier patient therapy lines. And I'll say there's been intense interest and great hope in this community. And so we expect to enroll these studies expeditiously. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. \nMohit Bansal: I have a question regarding the manufacturing of AMG 133. Could you help us understand how complicated or simpler it is versus the traditional GLP-1s peptide base in terms of complexity as well as cost? And what kind of investment do you think we should be expecting as you go -- as you embark on this journey? \nRobert Bradway: Mohit, I don't think we're intimidated about the challenge on the manufacturing or the process development front. I think, again, we've established ourselves firmly as a world leader in biotherapeutic manufacturing. And as you know, this is a therapy that's based on a antibody backbone. So it's right down the middle of the fairway for us. We've -- not lost on us that these competitors who are in the market now have found it difficult to maintain supply of these medicines, and I'm sure that's not lost in the patients either. \n And we're determined to do our best to make sure that we uphold our long tradition of supplying every patient, every time in the marketplace. So again, we think this is down the middle of the fairway in terms of the technical challenges that we need to address. We think that -- we look forward to being able to do that. And again, as I said, maintaining our track record of every patient, every time. \n In terms of your question about what it will require from us over time, obviously, to the extent that, that becomes meaningful, Mohit, we'll have the opportunity to address it down the road. But as Peter said in his remarks, our capital expenditure guidance for the year embraces the activity that we have underway to make ourselves ready for the clinical and commercial challenge that we see imminently. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. \nUmer Raffat: I'll spare all my curiosities on your ongoing trial. But I will ask this. One, on manufacturing capacity. I'm curious, is your aim to have 1 million to 2 million patients worth of capacity or 5 million to 10 million? You can imagine from a modeling perspective, from a CapEx side, this would be relevant, knowing obviously how much manufacturing experience and capacity you guys have. And then secondly, the -- is it a pen device? I know you mentioned it's a \"handheld patient-friendly auto-injector\" which is a single injection. But is it a pen device or is it something else? \nRobert Bradway: Yes. So Umer, I don't think we're going to say anything more about the delivery -- expected delivery device at this point. I think we were as clear as we could be. And we think it will be patient-friendly and convenient. And with respect to the quantity of patients that we expect to serve, we recognize that the unmet need here is very large, and we want to be in position to supply the patients that we think will be interested in the differentiated profile of our medicine. \n I would point out to you and I hope you're aware that we are already serving millions of patients today around the globe with our biotherapeutics. So again, we're used to supplying many millions of patients with antibody-based therapies. I think we're pushing up on 8 million Prolia patients right now worldwide. So we understand what it takes to supply large quantities of antibody therapies and what it means to do that with successful delivery devices. \n And I'm sure it's not lost on all of you that the fact that, as Jay said, the delivery dosing schedule is likely to be monthly or less frequently implies far fewer injection devices than competitors who, for example, are administering a weekly therapy. So again, all in all, we recognize the reasons for your questions on supply. But I hope you recognize as well the reasons why we're confident that we'll be up to that challenge. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregory Renza from RBC Capital Markets. \nGregory Renza: Congrats on the updates as well. And just a question on your larger obesity and cardiometabolic strategy. Certainly, with the news on 786 and as you speak to MariTide's efforts on convenience, how are you thinking about oral options within your portfolio now that you are certainly levered towards MariTide as the lead asset? I'm just curious how oral options should fit in with the portfolio longer term. \nJames Bradner: Gregory, thank you. This differentiated profile that we're seeing with MariTide really raises the bar for Amgen obesity medicines. And the profile for 786 just did not meet that bar in our assessment. We do have a pipeline, a strong pipeline of earlier assets. There are incretin as well as non-incretin based. Some are injectable and some are oral. And we believe that the heterogeneity, the diversity of the marketplace of -- and honestly, the different types of patients that will need medicines for obesity and all the obesity-related conditions demands medicines with different profiles, and we are hard at work on that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. \nTimothy Anderson: On MariTide, I'll ask a question on differentiation that I think you should be able to answer, which is, can you remind us what in the past you felt would be differentiating based on what the Phase I showed? So I'm not asking you to comment on what you just recently saw, but just a reminder of past comments on what you felt the data seemed to show in that front. Less frequent dosing frequency, of course, is the obvious one, but what else? \nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Tim, I think we've been fairly consistent on what we believe an opportunity is to differentiate in the market, both in the past and obviously as we see the interim analysis of these results. We think that we have a broad opportunity to differentiate with MariTide. And by that, I mean a broad differentiated profile on a number of fronts. And we continue to believe that we will be able to move into the market with a differentiated product, establish MariTide as a really good opportunity to address unmet medical needs and provide access for millions of patients as we go forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Yaron Werber from TD Cowen. \nYaron Werber: Congrats on the update. So I'm just going to ask a question I think you can answer on -- it's a little technical in nature. In the interim analysis for MariTide, was it blinded or not blinded? And then just remind us, is there a dose titration in that study? \nJames Bradner: Sure. This is Jay, Yaron. Thank you. The interim analysis, we as R&D leaders have had an ability to see the assigned treatment arms of the study. But importantly, this interim analysis is blinded to investigators and to participants to preserve the integrity of the study. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. \nGeoffrey Meacham: Thanks for the question. Yet another one on MariTide. Just given Amgen's cardio portfolio and focus, do you have any updated thoughts on expanding the program beyond just diabetes and obesity? Obviously, recognizing that you now have a better picture of the safety and tolerability profile. \nJames Bradner: Yes. Thank you, Geoff, for asking and allowing a clarification. What we're observing with MariTide and what we intended for the development of MariTide continues at pace. And we're preparing for a broad Phase III program that can work to address the unmet needs in obesity and a number of obesity-related conditions and, as you heard, in diabetes as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. \nEvan Seigerman: I'm not going to ask on MariTide, although I am tempted to. I actually want to ask one on rocatinlimab. So with the Horizon ROCKET studies upcoming, can you just talk us through what the differentiations you want to see? And how would you position this asset versus, say, the entrenched Dupixent and RINVOQ in the atopic dermatitis space? \nRobert Bradway: Two pieces. Maybe Jay can address the clinical perspective on differentiation. And then Murdo, to the extent it's appropriate, you can jump in on how to think about positioning it. \nJames Bradner: Yes. It sounds as though, Evan, you're close to this work. But as you know, rocatinlimab is an OX40-directed monoclonal antibody, afucosylated IgG1, a strong ADCC. We have a program called ROCKET that has over 2,800 patients enrolled. And so to address differentiation, I'm going to limit that maybe scope to the atopic dermatitis space. And here in the Horizon, the so called Horizon study, it's a Phase III randomized controlled trial. It's in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. It's 726 patients actually enrolled. And in this case, it's rocatinlimab every 4 weeks against placebo with a 24-week treatment readout. We have endpoints at 16 and 24 weeks. We will -- it's always apples to oranges to compare between trials, but we hope to observe and expect to observe in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis a very competitive profile with strong efficacy and excellent patient experience and tolerability. Here, we think about Dupixent and follow that work in its development closely. And Murdo, I leave it to you to talk through how to best think about differentiation. \nMurdo Gordon: Yes. Thanks, Jay. And thanks for the question, Evan. We are studying, as Jay mentioned, a broad population of patients in atopic dermatitis. So we will have some patients that will have previous biologic experience as well as bio-naive. So we will know how to position this product effectively in the market. I would just -- I would perhaps use the recent experience of how we launched TEZSPIRE and differentiated against Dupixent in a different indication using a highly differentiated mechanism and the fact that prescribers in this area are looking for alternatives to nonresponsive patients and to bio-naive patients. So we feel good about the opportunity here. But obviously, we have to await data and see the readouts of the clinical trials. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. \nChristopher Schott: Can you just elaborate a little bit more on TEZSPIRE and its potential role in COPD post the Phase II data? And maybe as part of that, how broadly do you expect to study this compound in Phase III, I guess, given the efficacy across the different eosinophil counts that we saw in the Phase II program? \nJames Bradner: Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. It's Jay again. And so the Phase II COPD data will be presented in an oral presentation, as I mentioned, at the American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. And so as that work and its abstract are presently embargoed, there is a natural limit to what I'm able to share. But what I will remind, as you asked more mechanistically, is that TSLP comes from this family of what are called alarmins. And they do just what it sounds like they do. \n An epithelium, inflamed or irritated or activated, that's inflamed releases TSLP and triggers what's called type 2 inflammation. There are a number of signaling factors that participate in type 2 inflammation. But then, TSLP then converges down in this type 2 T-cell inflammatory milieu in response also involving eosinophils. And that's why we often invoke that measurement in clinical investigation. \n The rationale for COPD is as strong as it is for asthma. But COPD, if you must know, is a much more heterogeneous disease than asthma. And so the design of this clinical trial appreciated and understood that and built into it some predefined stratifications for analysis, one of which was this eosinophil threshold of 150 cells per microliter. \n And so we look forward to sharing the full data. We have already disclosed that there's clinically meaningful activity of the molecule in this randomized controlled trial. And so please expect more at the ATS. You asked about the more broad development. You are right that TSLP is not only a feature of an inflamed airway epithelium but other epithelial surfaces as well. Hence, our interest to develop it in eosinophilic esophagitis as well as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. And both of these diseases are characterized molecularly by type 2 inflammation. \nOperator: Our next question comes from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. \nJames Shin: This one is a little bit off the reservation. It's for Jay and on oncology. It's for AMG 651, the EGFR CD3. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that. I think there's going to be some data coming up soon, and there's some other data that's come out recently from peers. \nJames Bradner: Yes. Well, I would say this, James. Thanks for the question. We have a large experience of developing CD3 bispecifics. And we have learned over time to tune the potency of engagement to the cell surface antigen to the degree of engagement and activation of the CD3. And there is no news to share with you at this moment. We continue to study this and other solid tumor-targeting T-cell-engaging bispecifics, really buoyed by the confidence and the guidance from tarlatamab and xaluritamig. So I would expect more in the future on that medicine as well as other solid tumor-targeting bispecific T-cell engagers. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities. \nSrikripa Devarakonda: I have a question on TEPEZZA in TED. Can you please talk about where you are with this subcu program? I think the Phase III is ongoing. Just a little bit of update on that. And as you continue to treat more patients with TED, what are you hearing about concerns around safety concerns? And is that having any impact on uptake? \nRobert Bradway: We'll take it in 2 parts. Jay, you can address the clinical questions. And then to the extent that, Vikram, you want to share any thoughts on the marketplace, jump in. \nJames Bradner: Yes, thanks for the question. The development of a subcutaneous administration of TEPEZZA is a major priority for Amgen R&D in the program. We have initiated a Phase III study. This will be -- this is in moderate to severe active TED. And the design is akin to what we have reported already with the intravenous label-enabling studies completed to date. And Vikram, if you want to speak to the clinical experience. \nVikram Karnani: Yes, I think -- so thanks for the question. I think the question was around AEs and if that is limiting growth. And I imagine, Kripa, that you're maybe specifically referring to hearing loss or about hearing loss. \n So let's start at the top. TEPEZZA, it very effectively treats TED, which we all now is a pretty severe and debilitating disease. IGF-1, we know is going to be involved in hearing function. So during the clinical assessment and the clinical development of TEPEZZA, we very carefully have -- we looked at -- we assessed hearing function. We now have included this in the warnings and precautions section of the PI, along with a recommendation for assessment and monitoring. It's important because patients who use TEPEZZA should be monitored for any specific experience with hearing impairment. \n We're also working with professional societies to increase education. And while many physicians do use a baseline hearing assessment, getting it in the label helps standardize this approach, okay? So after working through the management of this with HCPs, this has not generally turned to be a barrier for growth as physicians generally understand the favorable risk-benefit profile of TEPEZZA. \nRobert Bradway: Thank you. So Julianne, we're pushing up to the appointed bottom of the hour here, but we still have a few questions in the queue. So we'll take a couple more to try to get through your questions. If we don't get to everybody, obviously, Justin and his team will be around this evening to answer any questions. But let's try and click through these, the ones we can quickly, Julianne. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim Partners. \nMichael Schmidt: I had one on BLINCYTO, which has recently gained some commercial momentum recently. And there was some interesting academic data reported last week in Nature Medicine showing some activity in RA. And so I was just wondering if you have any plans? Or how are you thinking about potentially developing BLINCYTO or maybe other BiTEs in autoimmune? \nRobert Bradway: Sorry. In autoimmune disorders? \nMichael Schmidt: Yes. \nJames Bradner: Thanks for your question. With very deep expertise here in CD19-directed therapeutics, with deep and committed expertise in inflammation and autoimmunity, we've been following this space very closely, the early suggestive evidence from CAR T-cell therapy and, more recently, this work that's been reported in systemic sclerosis. And as you noted, 6 patients with quite refractory rheumatoid arthritis is very exciting to see. And so you can imagine that we're well organized around this opportunity. And we found that work quite inspiring and we'll have more to report in the future. \nJustin Claeys: Julianne, I think we've got time for one more question. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Gary Nachman from Raymond James. \nGary Nachman: Great. So back to MariTide, I have to finish with that. As you're planning for the Phase III studies, do you have a sense of when you could start those? How big those might be? And anything about design and overall timing relative to other Phase III studies in this space? And any strategies you have to accelerate those studies as quickly as possible and how you'll incorporate both U.S. and ex U.S. in the program? \nRobert Bradway: So Gary, again, we appreciate it. I can understand why you'd be asking those questions. As I said in my remarks, we will do our level best now to successfully complete the Phase II study and then work swiftly with regulators to agree the program that establishes safety and efficacy in Phase III, and we'll do that as swiftly as we can. We recognize there's a huge unmet need still in the marketplace, and we believe we have an asset that can help address that. But Jay, I don't know whether you feel you can say anything more specific, but jump in if you do. \nJames Bradner: Yes, I'd say the same, Bob. Gary, as you know, this is one part, collecting the data that regulators rightly expect, and ongoing conversations around the design. This study is moving as rapidly as possible within -- this program is moving as rapidly as possible within the organization, you can rest assured. \nRobert Bradway: Okay. Well, again, let me thank you all for joining the call and reiterate that Justin and his team will be around if you have any further questions. We look forward to having an opportunity to talk to you in the summer after the second quarter and provide update on the flow of information that we expect to generate between now and then on the many programs that we've referred to on the call. So thank you for your interest. Appreciate it. \nOperator: This concludes our 2024 Q1 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Bradway",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Justin, and thank you to our callers for joining us today. This is a busy and exciting time here at Amgen. And as you can see from our results, we're reaching many more patients around the world with our existing medicines, advancing a broad range of potential first-in-class medicines in our mid- and late-stage pipeline, and redefining what's possible in research as we integrate wet and dry lab capabilities and harness transformative technologies.  \n I'll touch on a few highlights from the quarter that give me great confidence that we're on a path to deliver attractive long-term growth. First, we have a number of products across general medicine, oncology and inflammation that have strong momentum and still plenty of room to grow. These include Repatha, which was up 33%; EVENITY, up 35%; BLINCYTO, up 26%; and TEZSPIRE, up 80%. With BLINCYTO, we expect an approval in June that should accelerate our efforts to integrate into earlier treatment lines for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  \n With TEZSPIRE, we'll share data later this month that reflect the attractive potential of this medicine in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. COPD is the world's third leading cause of death. Clearly, new treatments are very much needed, and we're excited by TEZSPIRE's potential to make a difference there.  \n Second, our newest pillar of growth, rare disease, contributed nearly $1 billion of sales in the quarter, up 14% compared with the sales of these products from a year ago. We see significant upside potential for first-in-class early-life cycle medicines like TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA, UPLIZNA and TAVNEOS. And we're pursuing launches in new geographic markets, new indications and/or new formulations for each. As an example, we announced last week our imminent plans to file TEPEZZA for approval in the European Union. \n Overall, the integration of Horizon, its people, products and pipeline is proceeding well, reflecting the strong fit between our organizations. Third, we are rapidly advancing a number of promising new medicines in our mid- and late-stage pipeline, spanning all 4 of our therapeutic areas. We are awaiting approval for tarlatamab, for example, and look forward to bringing this transformative innovation to patients with small cell lung cancer. Tarlatamab is the first T-cell-engaging therapy to demonstrate significant clinical activity against a common solid tumor, a watershed moment in a field that Amgen pioneered and continues to lead. \n Looking to the rest of the year, we anticipate data readouts from 5 Phase III trials. In addition, we announced today the development of a biosimilar to KEYTRUDA as we look to build upon the global leadership we have established in biosimilars. \n In sum, we have a broad range of medicines in hand today and coming through our pipeline that will enable us to meet the needs of millions of patients around the world and deliver strong growth through the end of the decade and beyond.  \n Now let me just add one other important update. Whereas we don't normally comment on interim data, especially for our Phase II trial, we recognize there is significant interest in obesity in MariTide, so we'll provide additional commentary today. The interim Phase II analysis for this study is complete, and we are very encouraged with the results that we've seen thus far and with the conduct of the trial. Following the interim analysis, I would say we're confident in MariTide's differentiated profile and believe it will address important unmet medical needs.  \n We are actively planning a broad Phase III program including obesity, obesity-related conditions and diabetes. Obviously, we expect to carefully complete our ongoing Phase II trial before then moving as swiftly as appropriate to establish the safety and efficacy of this potential medicine in Phase III trials. We've initiated activities as well to further expand manufacturing capacity with both clinical and commercial supply in mind.  \n Jay will provide a few additional remarks with respect to this ongoing study. And I would ask you to recognize that to protect the integrity of the study beyond this update, we would not expect to discuss these data in further detail before completion. As always, I want to thank our employees around the world for their commitment to our business and to the patients we serve. Jay, I'll turn it over to you. Okay. Thank you, Peter. And before you open the line, Julianne, let me just point out that, obviously, we have a lot of exciting opportunities here. And we're excited about the ways we think we can make a difference for patients. In terms of the opportunity in obesity, again, we recognize that there's significant interest. And we provided today's update to keep you apprised of our plans in this area. But I would just reiterate, we're focused on successfully completing and maintaining the integrity of the ongoing Phase II studies. \n So as we turn to Q&A, just bear in mind that we're going to have to be very limited in what we can say beyond what we've already delivered in our prepared remarks on obesity and MariTide. But with that in mind, Julianne, maybe you could remind our callers of the process for asking questions. Sure. Salveen, thanks for the question. Why don't you jump in, Jay? I think, again, Michael, as Jay said, it's a well-designed study, and you can be sure that we review the data carefully. Thanks, Terence. Again, we can appreciate the desire to get into that detail. But maybe, Murdo, do you want to speak to the competitive differentiation? And then Jay, if there's anything you feel appropriate to elaborate on, you can jump in after Murdo. Yes, let's take that in 2 pieces. And maybe, Murdo, you can talk about the launch. And then I'm sure, Jay, you'd like to elaborate on the thinking for the clinical development of this. Mohit, I don't think we're intimidated about the challenge on the manufacturing or the process development front. I think, again, we've established ourselves firmly as a world leader in biotherapeutic manufacturing. And as you know, this is a therapy that's based on a antibody backbone. So it's right down the middle of the fairway for us. We've -- not lost on us that these competitors who are in the market now have found it difficult to maintain supply of these medicines, and I'm sure that's not lost in the patients either. \n And we're determined to do our best to make sure that we uphold our long tradition of supplying every patient, every time in the marketplace. So again, we think this is down the middle of the fairway in terms of the technical challenges that we need to address. We think that -- we look forward to being able to do that. And again, as I said, maintaining our track record of every patient, every time. \n In terms of your question about what it will require from us over time, obviously, to the extent that, that becomes meaningful, Mohit, we'll have the opportunity to address it down the road. But as Peter said in his remarks, our capital expenditure guidance for the year embraces the activity that we have underway to make ourselves ready for the clinical and commercial challenge that we see imminently. Yes. So Umer, I don't think we're going to say anything more about the delivery -- expected delivery device at this point. I think we were as clear as we could be. And we think it will be patient-friendly and convenient. And with respect to the quantity of patients that we expect to serve, we recognize that the unmet need here is very large, and we want to be in position to supply the patients that we think will be interested in the differentiated profile of our medicine. \n I would point out to you and I hope you're aware that we are already serving millions of patients today around the globe with our biotherapeutics. So again, we're used to supplying many millions of patients with antibody-based therapies. I think we're pushing up on 8 million Prolia patients right now worldwide. So we understand what it takes to supply large quantities of antibody therapies and what it means to do that with successful delivery devices. \n And I'm sure it's not lost on all of you that the fact that, as Jay said, the delivery dosing schedule is likely to be monthly or less frequently implies far fewer injection devices than competitors who, for example, are administering a weekly therapy. So again, all in all, we recognize the reasons for your questions on supply. But I hope you recognize as well the reasons why we're confident that we'll be up to that challenge. Two pieces. Maybe Jay can address the clinical perspective on differentiation. And then Murdo, to the extent it's appropriate, you can jump in on how to think about positioning it. We'll take it in 2 parts. Jay, you can address the clinical questions. And then to the extent that, Vikram, you want to share any thoughts on the marketplace, jump in. Thank you. So Julianne, we're pushing up to the appointed bottom of the hour here, but we still have a few questions in the queue. So we'll take a couple more to try to get through your questions. If we don't get to everybody, obviously, Justin and his team will be around this evening to answer any questions. But let's try and click through these, the ones we can quickly, Julianne. Sorry.

            "name": "Peter Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Vikram. We're pleased with our performance and on track to meet our 2024 full goals and long-term objectives. Our strong growth outlook is driven across each of our 4 therapeutic pillars by our innovative pipeline and in-market portfolio products, which serve patients with serious illnesses around the globe. I'll review our first quarter results before discussing our 2024 guidance. \n As shown on Slide 23 of the slide deck, in the first quarter, we delivered $7.4 billion in total revenue, a 22% increase year-over-year. This reflects 25% volume growth, including over $900 million from acquired Horizon products and also key brands, including Repatha, TEZSPIRE, EVENITY, Prolia and BLINCYTO. Excluding the addition of Horizon, product sales increased 6% year-over-year, driven by 9% volume growth.  \n Our non-GAAP operating expenses rose by 33%, reflecting investments in Horizon acquired products, along with other late-stage pipeline medicines, including rocatinlimab, MariTide and tarlatamab. As a result, our Q1 operating margin was 43%, consistent with our guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call. Our non-GAAP OI&E resulted in $549 million expense, up $334 million year-over-year, almost entirely due to increased interest expense from debt issued for the Horizon acquisition, partially offset by higher interest income and gains from debt repurchases.  \n Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased 2.4 percentage points year-over-year to 15.4%, primarily due to the change in earnings mix, the inclusion of the Horizon business, and net favorable items in the quarter. In the first quarter, the company generated $0.5 billion in free cash flow, a decrease from $0.7 billion in the previous year, primarily impacted by a planned $800 million tax deposit to the IRS to stop the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions, as we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call.  \n As a reminder, there is no change in our belief in the merits of our legal position as we prepare for trial later this year. This impact on free cash flow was partially offset by the timing of working capital items. The Horizon integration is on track, and we expect to reach our pretax $500 million synergy target by year 3 post acquisition. We also expect to achieve roughly 50% of this synergy target in our annual run rate by the end of this year 2024. We expect accretion to non-GAAP EPS in 2024 and anticipate maintaining strong cash flow generation while we continue to execute on our deleveraging plan to return to our pre-acquisition efficient capital structure by the end of 2025. \n We remain on track to achieve the pre-acquisition leverage ratio, normalized for certain other noncash items, including fair value, market value adjustment of equity investments and Horizon acquisition-related costs. We remain committed to our multiple capital allocation priorities. We continue to prioritize investing in the best innovation, both internally and externally, with increased spending on late-stage programs, including olpasiran, bemarituzumab, MariTide and rocatinlimab. \n Second, we continue investing in our business for long-term growth, including expanding capacity in our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. Our North Carolina site is expected to be operational by 2026. And Amgen Ohio opened in the first quarter and is utilizing artificial intelligence and extensive robotics to boost operational efficiencies.  \n We're actively integrating generative AI across the enterprise to spearhead innovation and reinforce our leadership in the industry. This strategic commitment to innovative technology enables us to lead advancements, streamline drug development and enhance patient care more effectively. \n Finally, we returned capital to shareholders as we paid dividends of $2.25 per share in the first quarter. This represented a 6% increase over that paid in each of 2023's 4 quarters. \n Turning to the outlook for the business for 2024 on Slide 25. We expect our 2024 total revenues in the range of $32.5 billion to $33.8 billion and anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share between $19 and $20.20. I'll mention a few considerations as you model the remainder of 2024. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses are expected to increase by approximately 25% year-over-year versus our prior guidance to you roughly 20% year-over-year. We're making incremental investments based on our confidence in our late-stage pipeline. \n Our R&D investment reflects our commitment to innovation, accelerating our pipeline, focusing on advancing multiple potentially first-in-class and best-in-class medicines, including supporting MariTide, 2 PDUFA dates scheduled for June and 5 Phase III data readouts throughout the year. Total non-GAAP operating expenses over the second and third quarters are expected to grow at a rate comparable to the first quarter. The fourth quarter rate will normalize with a comparable expense base in the fourth quarter of 2023 since the Horizon transaction completed in early October 2023. \n We continue to anticipate our operating margin will improve over the next 3 quarters. We expect OI&E to be roughly $2.6 billion, which includes the interest expense related to the $28 billion of debt raised for the Horizon acquisition. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16%, primarily being driven by a more favorable jurisdictional mix of income, which includes the full year benefits associated with the inclusion of the Horizon business. Our capital expenditures guidance remains unchanged at approximately $1.1 billion in 2024. We've initiated activities to further expand manufacturing capacity for MariTide. \n We project full year Neulasta sales of approximately $500 million. Our long-term outlook remains robust. I am grateful to our 27,000-plus colleagues worldwide for their dedication to serving patients. So this concludes the financial update. I'll hand it now back to Bob for our Q&A session."

            "name": "Vikram Karnani",
            "content": "Thank you, Murdo. I am pleased to provide an update on rare disease, Amgen's fourth therapeutic pillar of growth, which delivered product sales of over $950 million in Q1. Beginning with TEPEZZA for the treatment of thyroid eye disease, or TED, first quarter sales were $424 million, reflecting growth of 5% year-over-year when compared to results from the legacy Horizon business.  \n As we discussed at our rare disease investor meeting a few months back, TED is often assessed using the clinical activity score, or CAS, which covers a number of different signs and symptoms, including pain, redness, swelling and function. And we now refer to TED in terms of high and low clinical activity score or high and low CAS. For the approximately 100,000 TED patients in the U.S. who could benefit from TEPEZZA, the majority of these patients, roughly 80%, are in low CAS settings. We continue to focus on this large number of low CAS patients not being appropriately treated. \n As we previously discussed, one of the main hurdles in the patient journey in this setting is access. To help patients overcome that challenge, we have generated favorable medical policy changes for greater than 50% of U.S. covered lives, and we expect to continue this momentum throughout 2024.  \n In addition, we are expanding our reach among new prescribers, particularly ophthalmologists and endocrinologists who manage many low CAS patients. The impact of TED on quality of life is often underestimated. So our focus is on educating health care providers about the significant effects on patients, even those with less visible symptoms. In addition to our focus on educating ocular surgeons and ophthalmologists, we are increasing our strategic focus in endocrinology and creating a dedicated sales force to engage in this important space.  \n International expansion remains a meaningful long-term growth opportunity for TEPEZZA, which is currently approved in Brazil and Saudi Arabia. As a reminder, in January, we filed for high CAS approval in Japan. And our Phase III trial in low CAS is continuing to enroll. We have completed additional regulatory submissions in Australia, Canada, Great Britain and most recently with the European Medicines Agency. We initiated a Phase III subcutaneous study and see this as an opportunity to increase adoption and improve the patient experience with an alternative option to our current IV formulation. \n KRYSTEXXA, for patients with chronic refractory gout, delivered $235 million in sales in Q1, representing 26% year-over-year growth, driven by volume growth from strong commercial execution. UPLIZNA, the fastest-growing biologic in NMOSD, delivered a record $80 million in net sales in Q1, representing 49% year-over-year growth. International expansion is also underway with UPLIZNA now launched in multiple ex-U.S. markets including Canada, which launched in January of this year. \n The integration of the legacy Horizon business continues to be on track as we leverage Amgen's leadership in inflammation, world-class manufacturing and process development and extensive global footprint.  Now I will pass it over to Peter for our financial update. Yes, I think -- so thanks for the question. I think the question was around AEs and if that is limiting growth. And I imagine, Kripa, that you're maybe specifically referring to hearing loss or about hearing loss. \n So let's start at the top. TEPEZZA, it very effectively treats TED, which we all now is a pretty severe and debilitating disease. IGF-1, we know is going to be involved in hearing function. So during the clinical assessment and the clinical development of TEPEZZA, we very carefully have -- we looked at -- we assessed hearing function.

            "name": "Murdo Gordon",
            "content": "Thanks, Jay. I'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Strong execution resulted in sales growth of 22% year-over-year, with robust volume growth across the 4 therapeutic pillars of our business. We drove compelling growth across our regions with 10 products delivering at least double-digit volume growth, including Repatha, EVENITY, TEZSPIRE, TAVNEOS and BLINCYTO. Our integration of the legacy Horizon business continues to progress well with that portfolio generating $914 million in the quarter.  \n Sales in our general medicines business, including Repatha, Prolia, EVENITY and Aimovig grew 18% year-over-year in the first quarter, driven by volume growth. Repatha sales increased 33% year-over-year to a record of $517 million for the first quarter, and Repatha is now well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar business. In the quarter, we saw year-over-year volume growth of 44%, partially offset with 13% lower net selling price.  \n Expanded formulary coverage for Repatha in the U.S. has accelerated volume growth. This was partially offset by lower net selling price resulting from higher rebates to support and expand access for patients. We expect this expanded formulary coverage, along with the removal of prior authorization requirements by several payers, will lead to increased cardiologist and primary care physician adoption.  \n Outside the U.S., we also delivered strong growth, helping even more patients reduce their cardiovascular risk. EVENITY had record sales of $342 million for the quarter. And in the U.S., volume growth was supported by an expansion of EVENITY prescribers. In Japan, EVENITY continues to be the segment leader with 46% of the bone builder market. And while we're happy with the growth of EVENITY, there are many women who remain at risk of a fracture due to their postmenopausal osteoporosis. And we see exciting growth potential for EVENITY to combat this risk, and we'll continue to apply our proven experience in bone health to ensure EVENITY reaches all the patients who need it.  \n Prolia sales grew 8% year-over-year. Volume growth continues to be supported by real-world evidence, reaffirming Prolia's superiority in reducing fracture risk when compared to alendronate in treatment-naive patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis, who are at high risk of fracture. \n In our inflammation business, Otezla sales increased 1% year-over-year for the first quarter. In the U.S., we saw strong new patient volume growth early in the quarter. This was disrupted in February and March by the Change Healthcare cybersecurity issue, which created challenges for some patients trying to fill prescriptions at specialty pharmacies.  \n We've seen a return to accelerating new patient prescription growth in recent weeks. We see significant potential for future growth of Otezla, given its established efficacy and safety profile, excellent payer coverage with limited prior authorization requirements and, of course, ease of administration. To realize this potential, we've increased our investment in dermatology field force and Otezla direct-to-consumer media, focusing on efforts to educate physicians and patients on the importance of treating psoriasis systemically and the safety and efficacy profile of Otezla.  \n I'm also pleased that Otezla was recently granted pediatric exclusivity and approved by the FDA for the treatment of pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. This is the first pediatric indication for Otezla. \n Enbrel sales decreased 2% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by volume decline, partially offset by higher inventory levels. Moving forward, we expect modest volume growth offset by declining net selling price. TEZSPIRE continues its strong trajectory with $173 million in sales in the first quarter. Sales increased 80% year-over-year, primarily driven by uptake of the prefilled single-use pen. \n In our rare disease business, sales of TAVNEOS were $51 million in the first quarter. Sales increased 122% year-over-year, driven by volume growth. In the U.S., more than 3,000 patients have now been treated with TAVNEOS by over 2,000 health care professionals. Looking forward, we'll continue to leverage our expertise in nephrology and inflammation to bring TAVNEOS to even more patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis.  \n Sales for our biosimilars portfolio grew 12% year-over-year for the first quarter, with volume growth partially offset by lower inventory levels and net selling price decline. We expect continued growth in our biosimilars business to be driven by the addition of new molecules and additional launches. \n In oncology, sales of our 6 innovative products, BLINCYTO, LUMAKRAS, Vectibix, KYPROLIS, Nplate and XGEVA, grew 4% year-over-year for the first quarter, driven by volume growth.  BLINCYTO sales grew 26% year-over-year to a record $244 million for the first quarter, driven by broad prescribing across academic and community segments for patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has set a PDUFA date of June 21 of this year for its decision on approving BLINCYTO as a treatment for patients with early-stage CD19-positive, B-cell ALL. We see significant growth potential for BLINCYTO from utilization in frontline treatment.  \n LUMAKRAS sales increased 11% year-over-year for the first quarter to a record $82 million. We see future growth opportunities for LUMAKRAS coming from the launches in new markets and additional indications. Vectibix sales increased 6% year-over-year, driven by higher net selling price and volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact. KYPROLIS sales grew 5% year-over-year to a record $376 million for the first quarter, primarily driven by volume growth outside the U.S. Nplate sales decreased 12% year-over-year for the first quarter, primarily driven by volume decline in comparison to the first quarter of 2023, which included a U.S. government order of $82 million. Excluding the Q1 2023 U.S. government order, Nplate sales grew 13% year-over-year. \n I'm pleased with our execution in the quarter and the momentum across the 4 pillars of our business. And we look forward to serving many more patients around the world who can benefit from our innovative therapies. And with that, I'll turn it over to Vikram. Yes. Thanks for the question, Terence. Thanks, Bob. Obviously, we're watching the in-market products very closely with respect to differentiation. And we're also looking at products that are in the clinic being developed. And we continue to feel very confident in our ability to have a differentiated and broad profile for MariTide as we develop it in this Phase II and as we consider our broader Phase III development program. Sure. Jay, thank you for the question on another exciting product in our portfolio, one that I think will deliver a lot of benefit for patients with small cell lung cancer, which is a very, very difficult diagnosis with very little in the way of highly effective treatments that deliver any kind of durable response in small cell. So we're anxiously awaiting approval from the FDA, but we are well prepared and have been for some time across our field organizations. All our field personnel, including their medical teams, are trained and prepared. \n We have very clear plans to reach treating physicians in very short order post approval. We have a very clear understanding of making sure that we can provide broad access to tarlatamab when it's approved. And we feel really good about this. This is a very important moment not just for Amgen but for the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer where, quite frankly, the survival in the late-stage setting is really dismal and is a matter of single-digit months. And so we have a huge opportunity here to impact, and we're not wasting any minute, any hour or any day in our planning to do that. Yes. Tim, I think we've been fairly consistent on what we believe an opportunity is to differentiate in the market, both in the past and obviously as we see the interim analysis of these results. We think that we have a broad opportunity to differentiate with MariTide. And by that, I mean a broad differentiated profile on a number of fronts. And we continue to believe that we will be able to move into the market with a differentiated product, establish MariTide as a really good opportunity to address unmet medical needs and provide access for millions of patients as we go forward. Yes. Thanks, Jay. And thanks for the question, Evan. We are studying, as Jay mentioned, a broad population of patients in atopic dermatitis. So we will have some patients that will have previous biologic experience as well as bio-naive. So we will know how to position this product effectively in the market. I would just -- I would perhaps use the recent experience of how we launched TEZSPIRE and differentiated against Dupixent in a different indication using a highly differentiated mechanism and the fact that prescribers in this area are looking for alternatives to nonresponsive patients and to bio-naive patients. So we feel good about the opportunity here. But obviously, we have to await data and see the readouts of the clinical trials."

            "name": "James Bradner",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with MariTide. Reiterating Bob's comments, we are very pleased with the results seen with MariTide thus far.  And we're very pleased with the overall conduct of the ongoing Phase II trial. All arms remain active, patient dropout has not been an issue, and we're fully on track for top line 52-week data from this 11-arm Phase II study in late 2024.  \n We're seeing a differentiated profile of MariTide and are confident that it will address important unmet medical needs, obesity, obesity-related conditions and diabetes. We look forward to completing the ongoing Phase II study and working with regulators to move rapidly to the broad Phase III program. \n Later this year, we plan to initiate an additional dedicated Phase II trial investigating MariTide for the treatment of diabetes in patients with and without obesity. This new trial is not a gating step for our Phase III program in patients with obesity. Informed by dose and schedule insights from the ongoing Phase II obesity study, the dedicated Phase II study in diabetes conforms to regulatory requirements for Phase III and is the next step towards a diabetes indication for MariTide.  \n In terms of patient experience, we expect to deliver MariTide in a convenient, handheld, patient-friendly auto-injector device with a monthly or even less frequent single-injection administration, assuming eventual approval. Across the portfolio, we are presently prioritizing differentiated medicines, those that stand to provide the greatest benefit for patients. Given the profile we've seen with AMG 786, we will not pursue further development. Instead, in obesity, we're differentially investing in MariTide and a number of preclinical assets.  \n Beyond MariTide, in the first quarter, we rapidly advanced our diverse clinical pipeline of potentially first-in-class or best-in-class programs. Looking ahead, the remainder of 2024 promises to be an exciting time for research and development with 2 PDUFA dates in June for tarlatamab in small cell lung cancer and BLINCYTO in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well as 5 Phase III data readouts. Each of these milestones could represent a significant advance towards our mission to deliver groundbreaking treatments to patients in real need.  \n Moving to olpasiran. We're pleased to announce that we've completed enrollment of the OCEAN(a)-Outcomes trial, a Phase III cardiovascular outcome study of olpasiran, our potentially best-in-class Lp(a)-targeting small interfering RNA medicine. Reflecting both our commitment to patients suffering from cardiovascular disease and the strong interest of the medical community, we successfully enrolled 7,297 patients across the globe in just 15.5 months. To our knowledge, this is the fastest-enrolling Phase III outcome study of its size. And to remind, Lp(a) is a genetically defined cardiovascular risk factor, which is elevated in approximately 20% of individuals and for whom no effective or targeted therapies currently exist. \n In oncology, we continue to deliver on high-conviction targets with differentiated therapies capable of delivering a large effect size for patients. Starting with tarlatamab, a first-in-class BiTE molecule targeting DLL3 for small cell lung cancer. We remain on track with an FDA priority review for a June 12 PDUFA date.  \n We're excited about tarlatamab as potentially the first selective therapy for small cell lung cancer. Based on the remarkable activity observed as a single agent in patients receiving second and third-line therapy, we are rapidly advancing tarlatamab in a frontline treatment with 3 Phase III studies now initiated in both extensive stage and limited stage disease. \n The rationale for studying tarlatamab in earlier lines of the context of lower tumor burden draws from our experience with BLINCYTO in B-cell ALL. There, we saw a dramatic improvement in overall survival in minimal residual disease-negative patients. These BLINCYTO data provide evidence that directing the T-cell in this manner is an effective means of finding and eliminating residual cancer cells, which are primarily the drivers of recurrent disease. We're hopeful we can build on this insight with tarlatamab, where comparable activity in early-stage small cell lung cancer patients would very meaningfully improve outcomes for patients facing the challenge of this aggressive cancer.  \n In sum, we regard tarlatamab as a major advance as the first bispecific T-cell engager to demonstrate efficacy in a common solid tumor, further establishing the broad potential of our bispecific T-cell engager platform. Our first-in-class STEAP1 CD3 bispecific molecule, xaluritamig, has also demonstrated unambiguous activity in the solid tumor, namely prostate cancer, continues to advance following a presentation of encouraging Phase I data last fall. We have now fully enrolled the monotherapy Phase I dose expansion and continue to enroll patients in reduced monitoring and outpatient cohorts. Further, combination studies with xaluritamig in novel hormonal therapies are progressing in dose escalation studies with near-term plans to initiate dose expansion cohorts.  \n To round out oncology, we are rapidly advancing AMG 193, our oral PRMT5 inhibitor targeting MTAP null solid tumors. We've moved forward with monotherapy dose expansion studies and have initiated 2 additional Phase I studies targeting MTAP null tumors in thoracic, gastrointestinal, biliary tract and pancreatic cancers, exploring relevant combinations with standard of care. \n In our inflammation portfolio, we are encouraged by the results of the COURSE Phase IIa proof-of-concept study, which investigated TEZSPIRE in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. This study was designed to test TSLP inhibition across an intentionally broad range of eosinophil levels, irrespective of inflammatory drivers, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and smoking status. While TEZSPIRE achieved a clinically meaningful 17% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations compared to placebo, this result fell short of statistical significance likely owing to the broad overall patient demographic. \n However, even greater reductions in COPD exacerbations were observed in a planned subgroup of patients with baseline blood eosinophil counts greater than 150 cells per microliter with a trend for further reduction in a small number of subjects with baseline counts greater than 300.  We're excited by these data, which will be presented in an oral session of the American Thoracic Society Annual Meeting later this month. \n Together with our partner, AstraZeneca, we are actively planning for Phase III development of TEZSPIRE in COPD. Beyond COPD, we continue to explore TEZSPIRE in separate Phase III studies in eosinophilic esophagitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, where top line data are expected in the second half of this year.  \n The ROCKET Phase III program for rocatinlimab, a first-in-class anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody, has successfully enrolled over 2,800 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Indeed, 3 of the 8 studies in the rocatinlimab ROCKET study program are now fully enrolled. The Phase III Horizon study, part of this ROCKET program, evaluates rocatinlimab monotherapy versus placebo in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and remains on track for top line data readout in the second half of this year.  \n Beyond atopic dermatitis, we continue to broadly explore rocatinlimab in additional indications and have initiated a Phase II study in moderate to severe asthma with plans to initiate a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis in the second half of this year. We're encouraged by the advancements of our rare disease pipeline as well with several mid- to late-stage opportunities. \n Starting with UPLIZNA, we anticipate important Phase III data readouts this year in myasthenia gravis and IgG4-related disease, both diseases with significant unmet need and where we have the potential to make a real difference for patients.  \n Dazodalibep, an innovative CD40 ligand inhibitor fusion protein, has entered Phase III for Sjogren's disease with 2 studies now enrolling patients. This follows encouraging Phase II data with efficacy across patients with moderate to severe systemic disease and patients with high symptom burden. Dazodalibep is the first therapy to demonstrate efficacy in the latter patient population. \n Lastly, in our biosimilars portfolio, we've initiated a Phase III study of ABP 234, a biosimilar candidate to KEYTRUDA, in subjects with advanced or metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. We're also pleased to announce that WEZLANA, our biosimilar candidate to STELARA, has received a positive CHMP opinion.  \n In closing, I'd like to thank my Amgen colleagues for their strong sense of service to patients facing serious illness and their commitment to growing the impact of both our research and our business to our portfolio of potential first-in-class and best-in-class medicines. And I'll now turn it over to Murdo. Yes. Thanks, Salveen, for your question. Look, we're benefiting from a really well-designed and well-executed Phase II study, a study that can teach us a lot about this medicine and how it's best dosed and received. And we're seeing from these data in aggregate a broad and differentiated profile that will guide and also encourage a Phase III clinical investigation. Thanks a lot, Michael. I'll take this one as well. Again, a very well-designed and well-executed study, a study that's replete with measurements. This is an ongoing study, so we have to be careful to avoid in introducing an inadvertent bias or unblinding. And so we just can't comment on individual characteristics, but we're very pleased with the results to date. We're moving rapidly forward with the Phase III program as well as the diabetes Phase II. I would reiterate that all the arms remain active, and we haven't had an issue with patient dropout to date. Yes. I'd just add, this is, Terence, a very exciting, very dynamic area. We follow the development of obesity medicines very closely. And I think in this case, the actions we're taking speak for themselves. We're hard at work planning a comprehensive and competitive Phase III program. And Jay, thanks for highlighting the potential of this medicine, which we consider a major advance. The treatment of this disease has really not meaningfully evolved since I trained as an oncologist in the mid-90s with upfront chemotherapy and meaningful but incremental benefit to immuno-oncology therapy with PD-L1 agents today. And so this is the case where time just can't move fast enough to get this medicine into earlier lines of therapy. And so we have initiated 3 Phase III studies. \n And as you asked, I'll just give an architecture of them briefly. We have a study that will compare to tarlatamab to standard of care chemotherapy. And this is in the second line dedicated patients with a primary endpoint of overall survival, and this study is enrolling. We really want to get this medicine tested in frontline therapy, where, as you must know, patients progress so quickly that a great many of them never reach the chance to receive second and third-line therapy. And so in a pair of trials, one for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer and one for limited-stage small cell lung cancer, we'll study the contribution of tarlatamab immediately following upfront therapy with response. \n We've learned through the development of these BiTE molecules that they work best when they're given as early as possible in the course of treatment for a disease. That has been the case with ALL as we move into frontline. And we've also learned that they work best when there is a low burden of disease. And so the design of these 3 Phase III studies will bring this medicine to earlier patient therapy lines. And I'll say there's been intense interest and great hope in this community. And so we expect to enroll these studies expeditiously. Gregory, thank you. This differentiated profile that we're seeing with MariTide really raises the bar for Amgen obesity medicines. And the profile for 786 just did not meet that bar in our assessment. We do have a pipeline, a strong pipeline of earlier assets. There are incretin as well as non-incretin based. Some are injectable and some are oral. And we believe that the heterogeneity, the diversity of the marketplace of -- and honestly, the different types of patients that will need medicines for obesity and all the obesity-related conditions demands medicines with different profiles, and we are hard at work on that. Sure. This is Jay, Yaron. Thank you. The interim analysis, we as R&D leaders have had an ability to see the assigned treatment arms of the study. But importantly, this interim analysis is blinded to investigators and to participants to preserve the integrity of the study. Yes. Thank you, Geoff, for asking and allowing a clarification. What we're observing with MariTide and what we intended for the development of MariTide continues at pace. And we're preparing for a broad Phase III program that can work to address the unmet needs in obesity and a number of obesity-related conditions and, as you heard, in diabetes as well. Yes. It sounds as though, Evan, you're close to this work. But as you know, rocatinlimab is an OX40-directed monoclonal antibody, afucosylated IgG1, a strong ADCC. We have a program called ROCKET that has over 2,800 patients enrolled. And so to address differentiation, I'm going to limit that maybe scope to the atopic dermatitis space. And here in the Horizon, the so called Horizon study, it's a Phase III randomized controlled trial. It's in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. It's 726 patients actually enrolled. And in this case, it's rocatinlimab every 4 weeks against placebo with a 24-week treatment readout. We have endpoints at 16 and 24 weeks. We will -- it's always apples to oranges to compare between trials, but we hope to observe and expect to observe in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis a very competitive profile with strong efficacy and excellent patient experience and tolerability. Here, we think about Dupixent and follow that work in its development closely. And Murdo, I leave it to you to talk through how to best think about differentiation. Yes. Thanks for the question, Chris. It's Jay again. And so the Phase II COPD data will be presented in an oral presentation, as I mentioned, at the American Thoracic Society Meeting later this month. And so as that work and its abstract are presently embargoed, there is a natural limit to what I'm able to share. But what I will remind, as you asked more mechanistically, is that TSLP comes from this family of what are called alarmins. And they do just what it sounds like they do. \n An epithelium, inflamed or irritated or activated, that's inflamed releases TSLP and triggers what's called type 2 inflammation. There are a number of signaling factors that participate in type 2 inflammation. But then, TSLP then converges down in this type 2 T-cell inflammatory milieu in response also involving eosinophils. And that's why we often invoke that measurement in clinical investigation. \n The rationale for COPD is as strong as it is for asthma. But COPD, if you must know, is a much more heterogeneous disease than asthma. And so the design of this clinical trial appreciated and understood that and built into it some predefined stratifications for analysis, one of which was this eosinophil threshold of 150 cells per microliter. \n And so we look forward to sharing the full data. We have already disclosed that there's clinically meaningful activity of the molecule in this randomized controlled trial. And so please expect more at the ATS. You asked about the more broad development. You are right that TSLP is not only a feature of an inflamed airway epithelium but other epithelial surfaces as well. Hence, our interest to develop it in eosinophilic esophagitis as well as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. And both of these diseases are characterized molecularly by type 2 inflammation. Yes. Well, I would say this, James. Thanks for the question. We have a large experience of developing CD3 bispecifics. And we have learned over time to tune the potency of engagement to the cell surface antigen to the degree of engagement and activation of the CD3. And there is no news to share with you at this moment. We continue to study this and other solid tumor-targeting T-cell-engaging bispecifics, really buoyed by the confidence and the guidance from tarlatamab and xaluritamig. So I would expect more in the future on that medicine as well as other solid tumor-targeting bispecific T-cell engagers. Yes, thanks for the question. The development of a subcutaneous administration of TEPEZZA is a major priority for Amgen R&D in the program. We have initiated a Phase III study. This will be -- this is in moderate to severe active TED. And the design is akin to what we have reported already with the intravenous label-enabling studies completed to date. And Vikram, if you want to speak to the clinical experience. Thanks for your question. With very deep expertise here in CD19-directed therapeutics, with deep and committed expertise in inflammation and autoimmunity, we've been following this space very closely, the early suggestive evidence from CAR T-cell therapy and, more recently, this work that's been reported in systemic sclerosis. And as you noted, 6 patients with quite refractory rheumatoid arthritis is very exciting to see. And so you can imagine that we're well organized around this opportunity. And we found that work quite inspiring and we'll have more to report in the future. Yes, I'd say the same, Bob. Gary, as you know, this is one part, collecting the data that regulators rightly expect, and ongoing conversations around the design. This study is moving as rapidly as possible within -- this program is moving as rapidly as possible within the organization, you can rest assured."
