I will now turn the conference over to our host, Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nIrene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Deidra Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO.  As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q4 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2020, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings release. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.\nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm excited that our new CFO, Dee Merriwether is here with me. Dee brings a wealth of financial and operational expertise and a deep understanding of Grainger's business that will serve us well. She has been with Grainger for 8 years in finance, pricing and sales leadership roles. It's great to have her as our new CFO. For the call today, I'd like to provide an overview of 2020, highlighting accomplishments and challenges. Clearly, much of the year has been shaped by the pandemic, but I'll also highlight our progress on key strategic initiatives. Then I'll turn it over to Dee to review the details of our fourth quarter results. I'll close by discussing how we will resegment the business to more closely reflect how we think about the company, and we'll also touch on our high level opportunities and priorities for both the high-touch and endless assortment businesses.  2020 was obviously one of the most challenging and intense years in history. Through it all, we demonstrated agility, resilience and a steadfast focus on supporting our customers and team members. At the start of the pandemic, we laid out 3 basic priorities: to serve our customers well, support our team members and ensure we remain strong financially. I can confidently say we've been able to accomplish all 3, and I'm proud of how the team has continued to execute on our purpose to keep the world working by living our principles every day.  Over the last year, we persevered through the pandemic while continuing to deliver an exceptional customer experience. We've deepened relationships with existing customers and developed new relationships, many of which have returned from multiple purchases. We helped our customers secure product, manage their inventory and solve their problems as we further embed KeepStock and our other solutions in their facilities. Grainger was sometimes the only vendor our customers allowed on their sites to support their operations; a testament to our deep customer relationships.  Another priority was to support our team members. We operated with the perspective that the pandemic would be challenging and longer in duration than we wanted, but that it would eventually end. As such, we maintained a stable workforce, deployed personnel to safely and effectively serve customers and supported team members to ensure their safety and well-being. The pandemic is, first and foremost, a humanitarian crisis, and supporting our team members has remained a huge priority. Finally, we have remained very strong financially, generating over $1.1 billion in operating cash flow in this difficult year. As it became clear that our business model will be resilient throughout the pandemic, we reverted from a temporary focus on cash preservation to our longer-term strategic priority of growing the business profitably.  The Grainger team has been active in serving our communities through this time of need. We have great team members who value giving back to others. As a company, we provided monetary and product donations to organizations like the Red Cross and the Children's First Fund to support the pandemic response.  Key leadership challenge this year was balancing our pandemic response while continuing to build the company for the future. Throughout, we remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives.  Within our high-touch solutions model, we improve the way customers find the products they need. We know this is core to our growth. In 2020, we launched our product information management system, which provides the foundation for our merchandising efforts. We now have over $2.8 billion of our product assortment remerchandised, $1.6 billion completed in 2020 alone. We also made enhancements to our search functionality and mobile app, resulting in a better user experience. We added features like search by image, where you can take a picture of the product you're looking for and get accurate matches to relevant items quickly and easily.  We took a significant step forward with our marketing capabilities in 2020. We brought more capabilities in-house to develop the competitive advantage of industry-specific knowledge. These efforts helped us gain share and increase customer acquisition with the Grainger brand. We developed new capabilities to support on-site inventory management, including vending solutions and technology, allowing us to remotely upgrade or alter installations to better serve customers during the pandemic.  We also opened a new distribution center in Louisville earlier this year, now our largest facility, with the capacity to stock 700,000 products in a strategic geographic location. We leveraged the building to test product expansion on a set of new categories with very strong results.  We also made strong progress with our endless assortment businesses. Zoro continued to expand its product portfolio, adding 2.5 million items in 2020 to bring the total SKUs to over 6 million. Zoro also improved its marketing capabilities, resulting in improved ROI and higher customer repeat rates. They are leveraging the MonotaRO playbook to improve the fundamental growth and profitability of the business. MonotaRO continued its exceptional growth and profitability performance. All in all, a great year for the endless assortment team.  Now before I review our 2020 results, I think it's helpful to step back and take a look at the impact the pandemic has had on our operating performance. From a revenue perspective, we started to see a shift to pandemic-related products starting in mid-February of last year. In late March, as pandemic product demand surged, we saw a significant decline in other non-pandemic product as lockdowns took hold. Since that point, we have seen continued strong sales of pandemic products, which has ebbed and flowed based on the virus, including another surge in the fourth quarter, which mirrored the increase in case counts.  Non-pandemic products are slowly coming back, and while not yet at pre-pandemic levels, they have improved quite a bit from April lows. We expect the pandemic to continue to impact revenue through at least the first half of 2021 and then start to moderate as vaccinations take hold. Steve will detail our forward-looking thoughts in a bit.  The pandemic has also had a big impact on gross profit, driven by 2 main factors: First, we were impacted by product and customer mix. Pandemic products are generally lower-margin, and we sold large quantities to health care and government customers, which typically receive more favorable pricing. This was exasperated early on as we initially prioritized product allocation to those most in need like health systems and those in the front lines. So sell-through margins have been negatively affected by these mix impacts.  The second driver is that we have been aggressive in supporting our customers by trying to anticipate the needs they might have. As a result, we placed large orders for certain products in Q2 of last year. As we have gone through the pandemic surges, the supply-demand picture has changed rapidly for some products and we had to revalue our inventory to reflect this reality. The vast majority of our purchases have worked well, a few have not. We have reverted to our normal purchasing processes, and we'll continue to monitor market dynamics as the situation unfolds.  The impact on GP is easier to understand sequentially. Our GP dropped significantly in Q2 and has been impacted the remainder of the year. Moving forward, we expect U.S. GP to improve sequentially and to exit 2021 as high or higher than we started in Q1 2020. Finally, as we look at SG&A, overall net costs were lower despite some increased costs for enhanced safety including protocols and workforce disruptions. The team was able to tightly control costs while also continuing to invest for the long term. Despite these unique and challenging circumstances, we were still able to deliver strong overall performance in 2020. A few of the highlights: We delivered organic constant currency daily sales growth of 3.5% at the total company level, driven by our above-market growth of 800 basis points in the U.S. due in part to pandemic-related sales. Also, we achieved over 18% daily sales growth in the endless assortment businesses. We delivered operating margin of 11.2%, reflecting strong SG&A leverage, which helped to offset the previously mentioned pandemic fuel GP headwinds. We generated over $1.1 billion in operating cash flow while returning $939 million to shareholders to dividends and buybacks. And we remain disciplined in our capital deployment, maintaining strong adjusted ROIC of over 28% for the company. In order to focus on our core high-touch and endless assortment businesses, we divested Fabory and China, 2 non-core businesses abroad.  Overall, I am confident in the direction we are heading and very excited about the future. We have gained significant share and strong capabilities. We are in a very good position to deliver strong performance this year and for years to come as the pandemic loses its grip. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through the fourth quarter results. Dee?\nDeidra Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. Turning to our quarterly performance. Organic daily sales, which adjust for the divestitures of Fabory and China, finished up 5.6% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. Underpinned by growth in our U.S. segment and continued impressive performance in our endless assortment businesses.  In the U.S., we realized strong outgrowth to the broader MRO market which contracted about 1.5% to 2% versus prior year. Our gains were driven by pandemic-related demand, which remains at elevated levels, sales to new customers and growth with midsized customers. The endless assortment model continues to deliver with 20% growth in daily sales again in the fourth quarter, while also generating improved operating margins. We remain very excited about the future of this business, and we'll discuss our plans to provide further transparency as we introduce our new GAAP reportable segments for 2021.  At the total company level, margin pressure continues to be driven by pandemic-related headwinds, primarily in the U.S. segment. I will detail the pandemic mix more in a few slides. In addition, we continue to see business unit mix impact as we experienced significant growth from our endless assortment businesses.  SG&A costs were favorable by $42 million year-over-year as we captured 235 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period through prudent cost controls in the U.S. and Canada, and we gained strong expense leverage in our endless assortment businesses. This resulted in Q4 operating margin at 10%, down 75 basis points from the fourth quarter last year.  From a cash flow perspective, the business continues to produce robust cash flow, with operating cash flow of $336 million at 170% of net adjusted earnings, and free cash flow of $291 million. We restarted our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter and completed $500 million of repurchases in the period. Finally, we delivered strong return on invested capital at over 28% for the full year.  Turning to our U.S. segment. Daily sales increased 3.7% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. On the product side, sales of pandemic-related products remains elevated, up 49% in the quarter, but have tapered off in the peak in the second quarter. We continue to see meaningful improvement in our non-pandemic products trends, which has improved to down 7% in the quarter, exiting the year with December at lowest decline, down 5%.  We've also seen a significant uptick in new customer acquisitions month-over-month with encouraging signs of repeat buying. From a customer perspective, we see improved growth with both large and midsized customers, with the latter growing about 6% in the quarter, continuing to show signs of improvement from earlier in the year. Gross margin of 35.7% was down 290 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The unfavorable variance in gross margin was driven most notably by pandemic-related headwinds, which accounted for nearly 90% of the GP decline. The pandemic impact was driven by continued product and customer mix and mark-to-market inventory adjustments, which D.G. outlined earlier, as well as freight-related surcharges, net of pass-through shipping charges to customers.  In the second half of 2020, we started getting solid traction on price realization, which nearly offset continued cost headwinds as we exited the year. From an SG&A perspective, we gained 155 basis points of leverage with cost decreasing approximately $14 million year-over-year. The reduction was driven primarily by decreased travel expenses, lower depreciation and general operating efficiencies.  Operating margin declined to 12.8% in the fourth quarter as the pandemic impact of gross margin weighted more heavily than the SG&A leverage gained. Adjusted return on invested capital was a very healthy 36.5% for the full year of 2020.  Now looking at pandemic product trends. While sales of pandemic-related products decreased from the second quarter through October, continued demand for key products, including masks, gloves and cleaning supply has kept pandemic sales elevated year-over-year, and we saw this pick up again in the last few months of the year as cases spiked headed into the winter.  We've also seen customers across industries prepare for the vaccine distribution maybe related but slightly different products like those required to work in refrigerated storage units. January sales remain elevated and have tapered off from Q4.  On the non-pandemic side, things continue to get better. We exited the year with December down 5% and have continued to see improvement with January, roughly flat year-over-year. Looking at share gain on Slide 10. We estimate the U.S. MRO market decline between 1.5% to 2% in the fourth quarter, showing strong improvement from the mid-teens decline we saw in the second quarter. Grainger was able to capture roughly 550 basis points of outgrowth, fueled by pandemic-related sales and our growth initiatives.  On a full-year basis, we estimate that we have outgrown the broader MRO market by roughly 800 basis points. This outgrowth was aided by significant pandemic-related volume, some of which, particularly in the second and third quarters, was related to large onetime orders that are unlikely to reoccur. We estimate that approximately 250 basis points of the market growth in 2020 was a result of these non-repeating pandemic transactions.  Accordingly, as we move into 2021 and lap these pandemic sales spikes, we expect to see some volatility in our year-over-year share gain metric. That being said, we are confident in our ability to serve new and existing customers during these challenging times. We believe we are doing the right things in merchandising, marketing and sales effectiveness to drive repeat purchases and produce 300 to 400 basis points of sustainable outgrowth in our U.S. high-touch business.  Moving to our other businesses. Organic daily sales increased 14.6% or 13% on a constant currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at an approximately 20%, with strong results in both MonotaRO and Zoro during the quarter. For our international high-touch business in both Mexico and Cromwell, we saw continued sequential improvement. However, both businesses remain impacted by pandemic-related shutdown.  Overall, operating margins for other businesses were up 210 basis points. The favorability was driven by significant SG&A leverage and endless assortment, notably at Zoro, which lapped heavy investment spend in the prior year period. Zoro continues to execute the MonotaRO playbook and deliver low single-digit results for the year.  Turning to Slide 12. The Canadian market has seen an overall economic slowdown during the pandemic, which has notably impacted our natural resource and export customers. Throughout the pandemic, our team in Canada has remained focused on serving new and existing customers well while also accelerating our customer diversification efforts.  In Canada, daily sales decreased 3.2%, or 4.4% on a constant currency basis. Volumes in Canada reflect the pandemic-driven slowdown. However, the business continued to improve sequentially. We have positive sales growth in the month of December, and we believe the business is well suited for post-pandemic growth. Gross margin at Grainger Canada declined 1,040 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by lapping significant onetime supply chain efficiencies, and to a lesser extent, the impact of pandemic-related headwinds. Cost management and the benefit of pandemic-related subsidies resulted in 315 basis points of SG&A leverage.  Given the continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the subsequent path of economic recovery, we will not be providing formal guidance at this time. This picture remains fluid, as does the shape of the pandemic and the customer demand for pandemic products. Similar to the last few quarters, we want to continue providing some insights into how we're thinking about the current quarter's performance. From a sales perspective, our preliminary results for January show year-over-year sales of about 9% at the total company level on a daily organic constant currency basis. While this is a strong start to the quarter, we faced more difficult comps in February and March when pandemic sales started to spike. With this, we expect daily sales to moderate and end the first quarter up between 3% and 5% organically. Note, we'll also have 1 less selling day this quarter.  From a gross margin perspective, we expect GP improvement of around 50 to 100 basis points sequentially versus Q4 2020. This anticipated lift is underpinned by a slowdown in pandemic product demand, continued price cost recovery and the lapping of freight headwinds experienced in Q4 2020.  On a year-over-year basis, this would imply GP will be down between 150 to 200 basis points in the quarter.  With respect to SG&A, we expect costs will inch up sequentially as business activity progresses and if things like variable comp reset with the start of the new year. With this, we anticipate SG&A of between $730 million to $750 million for the first quarter of 2021. While this is up slightly versus Q4 2020, we will still be down meaningfully year-over-year. As always, we remain focused on managing near-term headwinds while continuing to invest in the business for the long term.  From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to our balanced framework. For 2021, we anticipate investing between $225 million and $275 million back into the business. These CapEx investments include DC expansion in Japan, continued IT and KeepStock investments in the U.S., and normal levels of maintenance capital. Beyond that, we anticipate executing a similar dividend and share repurchase strategy, putting between $600 million to $700 million to work on repurchases in 2021.  Although we are not providing 2021 guidance, I thought it might be helpful to provide some insights as to how a post-pandemic recovery could play out through the year. As it's the largest portion of our business and one of the most impacted by the pandemic, we have charted our U.S. segment on Slide 14 and 15, to give you some context. As we have seen continued progress on vaccine distribution and a return to near full economic activity as we enter into the second half of 2021, we would expect our results to trend back towards more normalized levels.  On Slide 14, we map out year-over-year sales growth in dollars. Similar to our pandemic/non-pandemic sales chart, you can see the quarter-to-quarter sales spikes from pandemic-related products, most pronounced in the second quarter, which remained elevated through the year, and finished up $835 million or 54% in 2020. This drove pandemic product mix as a percent of total sales to 28%, a large increase compared to 19% in 2019. Conversely, non-pandemic sales were down dramatically in the second quarter and remains depressed through the balance of the year, finishing down $540 million or 8% in 2020. These trends did improve sequentially.  In 2021, we expect to face lapping headwinds as pandemic sales continue to moderate from the spikes we saw last year. That being said, I think it's important to remember that more than 70% of our sales comes from non-pandemic products, and as the economy recovers and these sales rebound, it should more than offset the lapping headwinds from pandemic-related products. This will also help to normalize our product mix back towards pre-COVID levels. Accordingly, we would expect to see year-over-year growth in 2021, but the magnitude will be determined by the pace of the economic recovery.  Related to gross profit margin, as product mix trends towards pre-pandemic levels, we would expect to see improved GP rates throughout the year. This includes sequential improvement from Q4 2020, beginning in Q1 2021. We expect to exit the year with U.S. GP rates as high or higher than Q1 2020 levels.  I want to reiterate, while this commentary relates to the U.S. business, we showcased it because it represents more than 70% of the total company results and was the most heavily impacted by the pandemic.  With that, I will turn it back over to D.G.\nDonald Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Turning to Slide 17. I am excited to announce changes to our GAAP reporting structure, which will better align our financial disclosure to the way we manage the company, while also providing increased transparency for the investment community. Beginning in 2021, we will shift our segments to high-touch North America and endless assortment. Thinking about these businesses under two new segments is consistent with our strategic priorities for each segment and how our teams are organized internally.  Our new high-touch North America segment is comprised of our Grainger-branded businesses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. This further solidifies the work we have done over the last couple of years to create a consistent go-to-market approach across the region while also merging the commercial functions of these businesses into a single organization. It also reflects the fact that we run the supply chain as 1 entity across the region. We feel confident that these businesses are well situated to support our customers with quicker more coordinated decisions to drive profitable share gain and exceptional customer solutions across North America. Given the growing size and importance of our endless assortment model, the timing is right to begin providing stand-alone disclosures for this important business.  Our endless assortment segment will consist of our MonotaRO and Zoro businesses, which operate primarily in Japan, Korea, the U.S. and the U.K. We continue to more closely align the operations of these businesses, taking a lead from the success we've had at MonotaRO. Alongside these changes, we will also take the opportunity to simplify our corporate cost allocation and intercompany sales methodologies to better align with industry best practices.  Given the amount of change, we wanted to preview the resegmentation this morning in preparation of shifting to the new structure, starting with our first quarter 2021 results. Between now and our Q1 earnings call, the team will be working to file our 2020 10-K in normal course under our historical presentation. And then shortly thereafter, we expect to file an 8-K with 3-year recast and summary financials reflecting the new segmentation. Including quarterly information for the 2020 period.  On March 9, we then plan to host a modeling call to help you fully understand the change and to answer any additional questions that you may have. This should position us well for our Q1 call on April 30, which I would point out is a week later or so than normal. Going forward, given our new endless assortment reportable segment, we will be pushing back our earnings call calendar to align with MonotaRO's schedule.  Shifting gears, we continue to execute against our business priorities. In our high-touch solutions model, we remain focused on remerchandising our product line to ensure customers and team members can find the right solutions quickly. We know that remerchandise categories see increased sell-through rates while also significantly improving the user experience, so this work is an important pillar in our share gain efforts. We expect to remerchandise an additional $1.5 billion of product in 2021. This process has become embedded in the way we work and will be a constant moving forward.  We will continue to invest in and improve our marketing efforts, which supports all customers and has delivered proven share gain over the past few years. We'll continue to deepen customer relationship with KeepStock and further strengthen our KeepStock offer to create more value for customers and ensure we have a competitive advantage. We will continue to improve our offer and sales strategy with both large, multisite customers, as well as midsized customers. And lastly, we will continue to improve the path that we are on with our Canada operations as part of the North America Grainger business unit. Our improved cost position, exceptional service, and early success in expanding into new customer segments gives us confidence that we are on the right path in Canada. We will update you on Canada's performance as part of the high-touch North America segment.  In our endless assortment model, we expect to add over 2 million items to Zoro in the U.S. in 2021, pushing us to over 8 million SKUs on the site. We will work to continue improving profitability through enhanced marketing efforts, we will further leverage analytics to refine our customer acquisition funnel and to improve customer repeat rates at Zoro. MonotaRO flexed its resilience in 2020, and we'll look to continue momentum in 2021. The business expects to launch new product and order management systems in the first half of the year to further improve internal processing and shorten lead times. Additionally, work continues on 2 new fulfillment centers, with the Ibaraki facility expected to be completed in mid-2021. There's a lot of great work being done across the organization, and I am excited about the opportunities in front of us in 2021 and beyond.  On Slide '19, I just wanted to reiterate our earnings growth algorithm. As we have shed non-core businesses over the last few years and moved forward with more streamlined reportable segments, the path to long-term growth comes into clearer focus. On the operational side, we feel we are well situated to gain share profitably in our North America high-touch business. This includes 300 to 400 basis points of sustainable annual outgrowth in the U.S., improving top line performance in Canada and operating margin expansion as GP rates recover, and we continue to gain SG&A leverage. In the endless assortment, we expect to continue to produce 20% annual top line growth, while also ramping margins at Zoro U.S. into the mid -- into the high single digits over the next 3 to 5 years. These strong growth drivers, alongside a business that generates consistent free cash flow and has significant capital allocation flexibility, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.  I'm proud of our results for the quarter and the full year and want to thank our team members for their commitment to safety and customer service. I also want to thank our customers and suppliers who have been great partners throughout this challenging time. We have needed to work together more than ever over the past year, and those relationships have been crucial. We have gained share, improved our merchandising and marketing capabilities, deepened our customer relationships, and expanded our assortment while improving margins at Zoro. We are in a strong financial position to grow the business profitably moving forward. We remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of keeping the world working throughout this pandemic as well as continuing to execute our strategy, so we can achieve this purpose for years to come.  And with that, we will open the lineup for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.\nRyan Merkel: So first off, can you explain Slide 14 in the deck a little bit more? How much are you assuming pandemic sales to be down in '21? And I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of what the safety surge headwind could be for 2021?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes, sure. So the headwind will largely depend on how long the pandemic goes. If you think about sort of 10 months of -- over 10 months of pandemic sales, we sold about $100 million incremental pandemic product. We feel like -- well, we know that the pandemic sales are very strong right now and will continue to be so. In the year, we would expect several hundred million, something like that, to be a headwind. We also expect to more than recover that in non-pandemic.  And Ryan, I would also comment that given the relationships we have with government and health care customers and the way pandemic sales were throughout the year, our incremental margins on pandemic sales were a lot lower than what we lost. On the smaller loss of revenue for non-pandemic. So we do expect profitability to improve, and we expect to have growth as non-pandemic recovers.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. That's helpful. And then the next slide, the gross margin framework, is really helpful. I guess my question is on 250 basis points of ramp from 4Q '20, do you expect it to be gradual like you're showing? Because I would think in 2Q, you could see a bigger jump based on the comps. And then as part of the answer, can you just tell us how to think about freight and inventory adjustments? Because I would think those impacts would be falling off?\nDonald Macpherson: So we expect the freight impacts to fall off in the first quarter in some way and certainly the second quarter as well. Although the freight environment remains tight. I mean, the reality is that more people are shipping product to their homes than ever, as you're probably aware of, and that has driven a fairly tight freight market, but we don't expect to be impacted all that much by that.  In terms of inventory adjustments, just to be clear, in the second quarter of 2020, we took a number of actions to try to get product for our customers to protect service. Many of those worked out; some did not work out as we expected. And we received that product in mostly Q3, I'd say. And so every week that goes by, we learn more. We expect it to match anything we take in inventory to the actual pandemic sales as we learn more, so we would expect that to be -- there's still to be some of those inventory adjustments in the first half of the year, but too slowly -- to fall off after that, basically. So yes, the ramp we show is more like what we'd expect to see, Ryan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: So in the fourth quarter, you reported 70 basis points of sequential degradation in gross margin. I think your outlook was more for a flat outcome. Can you quantify approximately the material factors that affected the fourth quarter gross margin working from the third quarter levels?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes, sure. I'll turn it over to Dee. Roughly, the surge in pandemic had a modest impact. The inventory adjustments had a bigger impact, and was a large part of that. So Dee, do you want to provide a little bit of color?\nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. Thanks, D.G. So yes, I would say, if you look at the U.S. segment, which I think if you're talking about Slide 15, that over 90% of the impact, the sequential impact from Q3 to Q4 was all pandemic-related headwinds. And D.G talked about -- and I spoke a little bit about our mark-to-market adjustments. I would say, if you look at the full year -- I know you asked a sequential question, but if you look at the full year for the U.S., I will say about half of our full pandemic impact was related to our inventory adjustments.\nDavid Manthey: With a bigger portion in the fourth quarter?\nDeidra Merriwether: Correct.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And then second, as the fourth quarter gross margin didn't play out exactly as you expected relative to your outlook last quarter, when you look at the gross margin outlook here, what factors could prevent you from achieving the anticipated levels that you have outlined here for 2021?\nDonald Macpherson: Well, I mean, I think that most of what we have is pretty well understood and known at this point. So if we get to a point where the vaccinations work and the third quarter starts to look better economically and there's less pandemic product, that's generally the shape of how it will play out. Obviously, if the pandemic doesn't get better and we're still in a really elevated pandemic state, and pandemic is still a huge portion of our business, it would be somewhat less. It'd still improve over the year, but they'll be somewhat less as we exit the year than is shown in that slide.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Welcome, Dee. Congrats on the new role.\nDeidra Merriwether: Thank you.\nChristopher Glynn: I was curious, Dee, you kind of left off with the -- affirming the 3% to 4% outgrowth as your long-term algorithm. For '21, is it reasonable to net the kind of 2.5% of, call it, large pandemic orders against that as a thought as we kind of model out the year?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. In the U.S., I think the way to think about it is we gained 800 basis points of share in 2020. 250 of that, we think, is non-repeating. So you'd say 550 is what we think is real share gain. If we gained 400 basis points of real share gain ex those orders, you'd subtract 250 from that, and we'd be at 150 in the year, and across the 2 years, we'd be 950.  I think the two year story, I think the main point here is that, and I hear it from customers every time I talk to them, and I talk to customers every week at a minimum, we are viewed very favorably in terms of how we've handled this. And certainly, we took extra risk with inventory, and it certainly had an impact on our GP. But we are in a great position from a relationship perspective. And we will have a very strong two year share gain period, and we will exit those 2 years with very strong economics. And so for us, that's really the main point. And that's what we've always been trying to do. And so yes, you do have to subtract the 250. But in any case, it's going to be a very strong share gain over those 2 years.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. That makes sense. And then on the -- again, to kind of affirming exit pitch there. The high single-digit margin at Zoro, if you said it, I missed it. But where was that in 2020? And directionally, does Zoro scale profitability a bit in '21?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes, we expect it to go. It was low single digits, so we expect closer to mid-single digits in2021 and high single digits in 3 to 4 years -- 3 to 5 years. That time range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Add my congrats to Dee in her new role.\nDeidra Merriwether: Thank you.\nDeane Dray: D.G., I don't mean to put you on the spot, but just the -- I'd be interested in hearing maybe just a description of the product category, of what product purchase did not work out or categories that did not work out. Those were just, to replay, that was really a scary time, and I know you were scrambling to get PPE. So I'm kind of anticipating that's going to be an example. But just what didn't go right there just from like a history lesson?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I mean -- so I mean, a lot did go right? But there are certain categories where supply-demand has changed dramatically since that point, when if you wanted to buy product for your customers, you had to pay -- you had to buy in very large quantities at inflated cost. I would say there's a very narrow range of SKUs that fall into that category. They're all PPE, Deane, that fall into that category that have become the reason for the inventory restatement. It's not like it's hundreds of SKUs. It's a very narrow set of SKUs. And if you ask me, would I do it again? I'd say, yes. I think it was the right decision. A lot of those products are sold to customers and kept them safe. But certainly, you're seeing the impact in terms of the inventory adjustments at this point.\nDeane Dray: Good. I fully appreciate that. And that was the answer I was expecting. That was PPE-related. So -- and then second question is maybe we're getting a little better feel for post-pandemic and how the sales will ramp back up. And what I'm trying to do is get a sense of how will the recovery have a different look and feel versus previous recoveries from recessions where you typically get this big restock phenomenon, where customers had run down their own inventory. And now, as they restart, there's a big burst of restocking that goes on. It just doesn't feel that's the way it is going to happen this time. But any color, just to give us a sense of what you're expecting that ramp looks like?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I think it's not going to happen that way, primarily because it's not a broad-based sort of all segment impact. So I think what you're going to see is certain segments turn on. We've already seen manufacturing come back relatively strongly as the year progressed and into 2021. So we've certainly seen some restock. We don't get a lot of restock given what we sell, but we certainly have seen volumes pick up with manufacturing. We still are in a very challenged state with hospitality, airlines, cruise lines, those types of things. And so I think what's going to happen is certain segments seem to turn on as we recover here and they don't all turn up once. So you probably don't see a huge sort of restock, you see more of a phased restock as we go. That would be my expectation. Although if you ask the next person, they may have a different answer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research.\nChristopher Dankert: And congratulations again, Dee. I guess, D.G., I know we've gone over this territory before. But I guess with the resegmentation happening now, just again, can we come back to Canada? It's been about 5 years since it's really been a positive contributor here. What's the logic in keeping it around? What's the long-term prospect for getting the thing back to a real contributor to growth and profitability for Grainger here?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I mean, I think it's a great question. So first of all, let me be clear, we expect to provide as much transparency into Canada as we did before the resegmentation. It's quite easy to provide you with the numbers you need to understand what's going on in Canada.  Secondly, though, I would say the performance in Canada last year was pretty good. We've seen growth now in December, and January was good for Canada, which is the first time we've seen that in 4 or 5 years. We have very good customer feedback when I talk to customers there. The feedback is very, very good. Our cost structure is in the right place. We have stabilization in gross profit ex some of the inventory efficiency issues we talked about this quarter, which are not operational. So we feel like the business was roughly breakeven last year in the midst of a pandemic. We actually think it's on a very good path. And we think in the next several years, it's going to be profitable, growing part of the portfolio. We've taken all the hard action now, and we are grinding out customers, and we aren't losing contracts anymore. I mean, it just feels very, very different. And I think we've also built some deep customer relationships through the pandemic. So it's going to be a profitable part of the North America portfolio, albeit not as big as it once was, but it will start growing now, is our expectation.\nChristopher Dankert: Got it. Got it. And then again, just thinking about price mix in the U.S. specifically, pretty nice results in the fourth quarter. I know we're not guiding, but just how do you think about pricing into the new year as we started to see a good number of vendors really come out with pretty significant increase. Just any commentary on the pricing environment as we move into '21?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. Well, so -- and I think this is 1 where you really need to segment. There have been a few categories that have been -- where supply-demand has been impacted by the pandemic that have had very large cost increases and everybody's taking price increases on those categories. And we are no different.  In general, inflation is still fairly modest, and we think that price cost mix will be neutral over time and maybe a little better given our starting position. So we aren't seeing -- we're seeing, in some categories, huge cost increases and everybody is adjusting prices on those. And then for the rest, we're seeing modest price inflation, and we are seeing some early signs of pretty decent price cost mix.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: So we've been talking about the inventory mark-to-market a fair bit. I'm just wondering if there's any way you could quantify, in dollar terms, how much inventory still kind of being held, just to try and help us think about the divestment. I think my real question is more on the growth algorithm for non-pandemic sales in '21, and you obviously provided some detail on Slides 14, 15. But if we think about it as a proxy for MRO, let's call it, 4% to 5% recovery in '21, you expect to grow 300 basis points over that number. Is that the right framework?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. That is generally the right framework. Again, we would, year-over-year, be hampered a little bit because of some of the outgrowth. We said 250 basis point outgrowth that was really onetime orders. But yes, that's generally the long-term framework. And then -- sorry, you asked a question at the beginning there. The short answer is that the curve that we showed on I think on Slide 15 takes the account sort of what we think the risks are with any inventory. So that is already embedded in that curve.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then just on Zoro operating margin improvements and the remerchandising. Just so I understand this kind of model. Do you basically earn a commission on the remerchandising sales? So essentially, the more volumes you're remerchandising, the better your kind of fixed cost absorption, SG&A absorption, and that's what drives the margin expansion?\nDonald Macpherson: Well, let me clarify a few things there, and I think I can answer the question in the process. So when we've talked about remerchandising as a priority, that is mostly in the Grainger brand. So that is mostly making sure that we have very highly curated product data so it is easier for our customers and team members to find product than anybody else on the roughly 2 million items we would have in the U.S.  With Zoro, we are expanding the offer. You don't have as much curation with that model. You couldn't possibly, given the number of SKUs we have. What happens when you add SKUs is you get growth. And you get customer acquisition first, and then you're able to get repeat buy. And that does not add much expense to the business. So you do, as you grow, get fixed cost leverage with that investment in product SKUs. That isn't the full story. Part of the full story is we're also growing with existing customers and getting repeat buy, and that adds to some of the fixed cost leverage as well. Hopefully, that answers the question, Nigel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. .\nAdam Uhlman: Congrats Dee. I wanted to start on SG&A expense, and thanks for providing all the detail on the first quarter. That's very helpful. I guess, we're still going to be -- you're expecting to be down meaningfully in the first quarter. But then we start to cycle some pretty easy comps from the temporary savings.  I guess, could you help us dimension how we should be thinking about the rest of the year? How big is the reset of incentive comp. And then presumably, we'll be traveling at some point in the second half of the year, should we expect a big step-up in Grainger's expenses related to that, maybe just flesh out the SG&A outlook.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I think I'll turn it over to Dee in a minute. I think in general, we don't expect to have sort of a big step-up through the year. The comps may look unfavorable. As a reminder, we went into this with the opinion that the virus was going to be a little longer-lived than we wanted, for sure, but that we would come out of it and need to operate. So we did not take a whole bunch of draconian actions. We prioritized what we did. We -- I think we will continue to prioritize more tightly what we're working on, which has taken some cost out. Obviously, travel -- some of the travel budget will come back maybe the second half, maybe not. Hard to really tell given where we're at right now. But not all of it. And so we feel like we're still going to have very tight cost control and be able to achieve leverage. But Dee, do you want to provide any color on that?\nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. I think you said most of it there, but I would just say, generally, I think our long-term view to have SG&A be at half the rate of sales will be the continued focus. But this year is going to be kind of wait and see. And as D.G. noted, we're very focused on being very prudent with our costs. And I think it's all going to really depend upon how this pandemic progresses. But I think we would slowly start to see expenses tick up as we get closer to normal levels. But -- of activity in the overall market with our customers. But if we don't see us getting back to normal, we will still be very prudent with our expenses.\nAdam Uhlman: Okay. Got you. And then, I guess, D.G., you were mentioning the like kind of new customer wins, it sounds like a lot of more sticky relationships. Is there any way that you can dimension retention of new customers that you've got, like repeat buyers, folks you haven't done business with? Or any data you could share on like active account growth that could help us better understand kind of this -- the market outgrowth that you delivered this past year?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I mean, so just to -- in terms of contribution to revenue, I would say new customers, repeat rates were good. They're still a fairly small portion of the outgrowth, but we think it gives us a chance to -- we certainly grew the customer file. We don't -- we typically provide that information with Zoro. With Grainger, we don't often provide too many details on that. I will say the customer file is bigger and we have more repeat buy customers that were new in 2020 than we've had in years. So -- and I'd also say, to be honest, we're getting a handle on what that means and how to make -- convert them to be consistently buying customers. So it's a little early to understand sort of the long-term impacts of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS.\nChristopher Snyder: So just following up on safety or pandemic. This was a very sizable $1.6 billion business prior to the pandemic. So I guess my question is, how did this legacy business trend in 2020? Just so we can try to separate out the underlying business from the surge or new business that came online over the last year, just to help model out the trajectory. Because I would assume that the underlying business carries more leverage to the industrial economy than the surge business that came on.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So that's a great question and mostly unanswerable, I would say. So let me give you some customer examples to give you a sense. So when the pandemic hit in Q2 of 2020, we are the largest industrial safety supplier. We are used to selling things like N95. We are not used to selling N95 to hospitals, just to be clear. Hospitals haven't historically been big users of N95. N95s typically go into places like grain elevators and dirty manufacturing processes. So all of a sudden, all of our product was being shifted to hospitals and governments.  We have gotten back to a more normal mix across what we call pandemic product than we did before, but I think there's still a lot of messiness. There's still a lot of customers in the industrial economy that haven't come back and aren't using safety products maybe like they did before if they don't have the activity. So I think it's a really interesting question and one that is super hard to get at.  And I would also point out that there's a lot of safety products, even in hospital systems. Hospital systems, this year, have done incredible things to protect people, to save people. They have been unable to do a lot of the historical safety maintenance things that they might have done. They just have been full out -- many of them have been full out on COVID. And there's a backlog of things that they will need to do, fundings available, that they just haven't done.  So I think it's a really interesting question and one that is really hard. And I'm sorry to give you some anecdotes. But certainly, I have a lot of them, where I think there is some pent-up demand for normal pandemic product.\nChristopher Snyder: No. I appreciate all of that. And then just kind of following up, could you provide some color or numbers around the margin difference between pandemic and the non-pandemic revenues? Just as we try to model out this margin trajectory into 2021 as that shift normalizes?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I mean, if -- and we haven't provided that. I will say that the $0.5 billion in non-pandemic that we were short in 2020, that probably has normal increment/decrement numbers that you've seen from us. The $800 million in pandemic that we sold above normal would have a lot lower incremental margins; quite a bit lower, maybe less than half, as you think about it, which sort of gets you to what happened to our overall slight decline in operating earnings for the full year. So that may be a way to sort of to allow you to sort of hunt and think about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. .\nPatrick Baumann: You covered a lot of ground on the short term. I just wanted to move on to the long-term growth and algorithm for a second, where you're targeting, I think, low double-digit earnings growth and high single-digit revenue growth. Can you give us a high-level view on the moving parts margins within this, particularly how we should think about gross margins over the medium-term once this mix dynamic from pandemic normalizes? And then just kind of the puts and takes within that?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. For the company -- and you can keep me honest if I say anything that doesn't make any sense. For the company, we expect the U.S. business, the high-touch model, to have fairly consistent, if not, consistent margins, gross margins over time. We expect to have SG&A growing at half the rate of growth. And that's kind of the earnings algorithm for that model. We expect the -- our model to continue to grow much faster than the rest at something like 20%.  If you just include the fact that those gross profits are lower than the average, that has a roughly 20-basis-point impact on the overall. So you might see a slight decline in overall GP and a slight decline in overall s G&A, given that, that business also has lower SG&A, but it should be fairly stable once we get through this.\nPatrick Baumann: And then as a follow-up to that. Go ahead, Dee. I'm sorry.\nDeidra Merriwether: No. Again, I was just going to add to D.G. that I would agree with that. And that coming out of the pandemic, I think we would look for a much more stable and potentially more accretive margins on the high-touch than what we've seen over the pandemic.\nPatrick Baumann: And just as a follow-up to that, I guess I'm a little surprised that you would expect the high-touch to have, just given some of the growth initiatives relative to maybe KeepStock and on-site and stuff like that where margins tend to be lower. Maybe just talk about how you're positioned competitively to expand those parts of the business and kind of hold your margins -- gross margins.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So I would point out that we continue to see -- and even the last quarter, we continue to see very strong results from our midsized customers. So even if there's some pressure with large customers, we expect growth of midsized customers to continue to exceed that. And so that should help us there too.\nDeidra Merriwether: And they use less services like -- something like KeepStock, those types of services.\nDonald Macpherson: Higher GP, less services, and so, higher margins.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Just sticking with the medium customer initiative, D.G., maybe you could talk about sort of what kind of growth to expect in 2021? I know I guess it was 6% in Q4. And whether that's sort of baked into your gross margin assumption of exiting sort of at pre-pandemic levels in Q4 2021. I guess just what's baked into your assumption on medium customer growth within that gross margin sort of trajectory?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. Yes. I think there's a few dynamics. One is that in 2020, I think it's important to recognize that, particularly in the second quarter. We -- because of how we prioritize supporting health care systems and governments, we had less product for a while there with midsized customers. So our midsized customer business took a bit of a dip. There were also more closed midsized businesses during that period. We've seen that slowly come back, not fully back yet, but we do expect normalcy with midsized customers, and we have baked in significant share gain with that group. We don't have huge outgrowth in 2021. The pandemic, we think, is going to be a factor in the first half of the year, but we think we will exit the year with the midsized customers growing faster than March, which does -- which is baked into our gross profit assumption.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question, and congrats, Dee, again on the new role. Just on Zoro U.K., is that a business that can scale up? I know we talk a lot about Zoro U.S., but just any thoughts there.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I mean, I'd say, yes, is the answer. We -- the business has done well in terms of customer acquisition, revenue path. It's got a healthy gross profit for a business that's relatively new. And Masaya and the team are working hard to make that a scalable business, and we still have some positive expectation there that, that is going to be a success story. As you know, the U.K. market was probably more impacted this year than some others. But certainly, we've seen continued growth through this cycle with our U.K. business and a lot of good signs.  So good. Well, thanks. I really appreciate everybody's questions. I'll just close by reiterating: We're viewing the pandemic is a likely two year events, and we expect to gain a lot of share during those two years, and we expect to have very strong economics exiting out of that. And I want to thank our team members and our customers for all we've worked together on to really put ourselves in a good position to have great relationships. Moving forward, and it's been an all hands on deck effort. So thanks to everybody. And I hope you stay safe, and I hope to see you, at some point, in person. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Donald Macpherson",
            "content": "Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm excited that our new CFO, Dee Merriwether is here with me. Dee brings a wealth of financial and operational expertise and a deep understanding of Grainger's business that will serve us well. She has been with Grainger for 8 years in finance, pricing and sales leadership roles. It's great to have her as our new CFO. For the call today, I'd like to provide an overview of 2020, highlighting accomplishments and challenges. Clearly, much of the year has been shaped by the pandemic, but I'll also highlight our progress on key strategic initiatives. Then I'll turn it over to Dee to review the details of our fourth quarter results. I'll close by discussing how we will resegment the business to more closely reflect how we think about the company, and we'll also touch on our high level opportunities and priorities for both the high-touch and endless assortment businesses.  2020 was obviously one of the most challenging and intense years in history. Through it all, we demonstrated agility, resilience and a steadfast focus on supporting our customers and team members. At the start of the pandemic, we laid out 3 basic priorities: to serve our customers well, support our team members and ensure we remain strong financially. I can confidently say we've been able to accomplish all 3, and I'm proud of how the team has continued to execute on our purpose to keep the world working by living our principles every day.  Over the last year, we persevered through the pandemic while continuing to deliver an exceptional customer experience. We've deepened relationships with existing customers and developed new relationships, many of which have returned from multiple purchases. We helped our customers secure product, manage their inventory and solve their problems as we further embed KeepStock and our other solutions in their facilities. Grainger was sometimes the only vendor our customers allowed on their sites to support their operations; a testament to our deep customer relationships.  Another priority was to support our team members. We operated with the perspective that the pandemic would be challenging and longer in duration than we wanted, but that it would eventually end. As such, we maintained a stable workforce, deployed personnel to safely and effectively serve customers and supported team members to ensure their safety and well-being. The pandemic is, first and foremost, a humanitarian crisis, and supporting our team members has remained a huge priority. Finally, we have remained very strong financially, generating over $1.1 billion in operating cash flow in this difficult year. As it became clear that our business model will be resilient throughout the pandemic, we reverted from a temporary focus on cash preservation to our longer-term strategic priority of growing the business profitably.  The Grainger team has been active in serving our communities through this time of need. We have great team members who value giving back to others. As a company, we provided monetary and product donations to organizations like the Red Cross and the Children's First Fund to support the pandemic response.  Key leadership challenge this year was balancing our pandemic response while continuing to build the company for the future. Throughout, we remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives.  Within our high-touch solutions model, we improve the way customers find the products they need. We know this is core to our growth. In 2020, we launched our product information management system, which provides the foundation for our merchandising efforts. We now have over $2.8 billion of our product assortment remerchandised, $1.6 billion completed in 2020 alone. We also made enhancements to our search functionality and mobile app, resulting in a better user experience. We added features like search by image, where you can take a picture of the product you're looking for and get accurate matches to relevant items quickly and easily.  We took a significant step forward with our marketing capabilities in 2020. We brought more capabilities in-house to develop the competitive advantage of industry-specific knowledge. These efforts helped us gain share and increase customer acquisition with the Grainger brand. We developed new capabilities to support on-site inventory management, including vending solutions and technology, allowing us to remotely upgrade or alter installations to better serve customers during the pandemic.  We also opened a new distribution center in Louisville earlier this year, now our largest facility, with the capacity to stock 700,000 products in a strategic geographic location. We leveraged the building to test product expansion on a set of new categories with very strong results.  We also made strong progress with our endless assortment businesses. Zoro continued to expand its product portfolio, adding 2.5 million items in 2020 to bring the total SKUs to over 6 million. Zoro also improved its marketing capabilities, resulting in improved ROI and higher customer repeat rates. They are leveraging the MonotaRO playbook to improve the fundamental growth and profitability of the business. MonotaRO continued its exceptional growth and profitability performance. All in all, a great year for the endless assortment team.  Now before I review our 2020 results, I think it's helpful to step back and take a look at the impact the pandemic has had on our operating performance. From a revenue perspective, we started to see a shift to pandemic-related products starting in mid-February of last year. In late March, as pandemic product demand surged, we saw a significant decline in other non-pandemic product as lockdowns took hold. Since that point, we have seen continued strong sales of pandemic products, which has ebbed and flowed based on the virus, including another surge in the fourth quarter, which mirrored the increase in case counts.  Non-pandemic products are slowly coming back, and while not yet at pre-pandemic levels, they have improved quite a bit from April lows. We expect the pandemic to continue to impact revenue through at least the first half of 2021 and then start to moderate as vaccinations take hold. Steve will detail our forward-looking thoughts in a bit.  The pandemic has also had a big impact on gross profit, driven by 2 main factors: First, we were impacted by product and customer mix. Pandemic products are generally lower-margin, and we sold large quantities to health care and government customers, which typically receive more favorable pricing. This was exasperated early on as we initially prioritized product allocation to those most in need like health systems and those in the front lines. So sell-through margins have been negatively affected by these mix impacts.  The second driver is that we have been aggressive in supporting our customers by trying to anticipate the needs they might have. As a result, we placed large orders for certain products in Q2 of last year. As we have gone through the pandemic surges, the supply-demand picture has changed rapidly for some products and we had to revalue our inventory to reflect this reality. The vast majority of our purchases have worked well, a few have not. We have reverted to our normal purchasing processes, and we'll continue to monitor market dynamics as the situation unfolds.  The impact on GP is easier to understand sequentially. Our GP dropped significantly in Q2 and has been impacted the remainder of the year. Moving forward, we expect U.S. GP to improve sequentially and to exit 2021 as high or higher than we started in Q1 2020. Finally, as we look at SG&A, overall net costs were lower despite some increased costs for enhanced safety including protocols and workforce disruptions. The team was able to tightly control costs while also continuing to invest for the long term. Despite these unique and challenging circumstances, we were still able to deliver strong overall performance in 2020. A few of the highlights: We delivered organic constant currency daily sales growth of 3.5% at the total company level, driven by our above-market growth of 800 basis points in the U.S. due in part to pandemic-related sales. Also, we achieved over 18% daily sales growth in the endless assortment businesses. We delivered operating margin of 11.2%, reflecting strong SG&A leverage, which helped to offset the previously mentioned pandemic fuel GP headwinds. We generated over $1.1 billion in operating cash flow while returning $939 million to shareholders to dividends and buybacks. And we remain disciplined in our capital deployment, maintaining strong adjusted ROIC of over 28% for the company. In order to focus on our core high-touch and endless assortment businesses, we divested Fabory and China, 2 non-core businesses abroad.  Overall, I am confident in the direction we are heading and very excited about the future. We have gained significant share and strong capabilities. We are in a very good position to deliver strong performance this year and for years to come as the pandemic loses its grip. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through the fourth quarter results. Dee? Thank you, Dee. Turning to Slide 17. I am excited to announce changes to our GAAP reporting structure, which will better align our financial disclosure to the way we manage the company, while also providing increased transparency for the investment community. Beginning in 2021, we will shift our segments to high-touch North America and endless assortment. Thinking about these businesses under two new segments is consistent with our strategic priorities for each segment and how our teams are organized internally.  Our new high-touch North America segment is comprised of our Grainger-branded businesses in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. This further solidifies the work we have done over the last couple of years to create a consistent go-to-market approach across the region while also merging the commercial functions of these businesses into a single organization. It also reflects the fact that we run the supply chain as 1 entity across the region. We feel confident that these businesses are well situated to support our customers with quicker more coordinated decisions to drive profitable share gain and exceptional customer solutions across North America. Given the growing size and importance of our endless assortment model, the timing is right to begin providing stand-alone disclosures for this important business.  Our endless assortment segment will consist of our MonotaRO and Zoro businesses, which operate primarily in Japan, Korea, the U.S. and the U.K. We continue to more closely align the operations of these businesses, taking a lead from the success we've had at MonotaRO. Alongside these changes, we will also take the opportunity to simplify our corporate cost allocation and intercompany sales methodologies to better align with industry best practices.  Given the amount of change, we wanted to preview the resegmentation this morning in preparation of shifting to the new structure, starting with our first quarter 2021 results. Between now and our Q1 earnings call, the team will be working to file our 2020 10-K in normal course under our historical presentation. And then shortly thereafter, we expect to file an 8-K with 3-year recast and summary financials reflecting the new segmentation. Including quarterly information for the 2020 period.  On March 9, we then plan to host a modeling call to help you fully understand the change and to answer any additional questions that you may have. This should position us well for our Q1 call on April 30, which I would point out is a week later or so than normal. Going forward, given our new endless assortment reportable segment, we will be pushing back our earnings call calendar to align with MonotaRO's schedule.  Shifting gears, we continue to execute against our business priorities. In our high-touch solutions model, we remain focused on remerchandising our product line to ensure customers and team members can find the right solutions quickly. We know that remerchandise categories see increased sell-through rates while also significantly improving the user experience, so this work is an important pillar in our share gain efforts. We expect to remerchandise an additional $1.5 billion of product in 2021. This process has become embedded in the way we work and will be a constant moving forward.  We will continue to invest in and improve our marketing efforts, which supports all customers and has delivered proven share gain over the past few years. We'll continue to deepen customer relationship with KeepStock and further strengthen our KeepStock offer to create more value for customers and ensure we have a competitive advantage. We will continue to improve our offer and sales strategy with both large, multisite customers, as well as midsized customers. And lastly, we will continue to improve the path that we are on with our Canada operations as part of the North America Grainger business unit. Our improved cost position, exceptional service, and early success in expanding into new customer segments gives us confidence that we are on the right path in Canada. We will update you on Canada's performance as part of the high-touch North America segment.  In our endless assortment model, we expect to add over 2 million items to Zoro in the U.S. in 2021, pushing us to over 8 million SKUs on the site. We will work to continue improving profitability through enhanced marketing efforts, we will further leverage analytics to refine our customer acquisition funnel and to improve customer repeat rates at Zoro. MonotaRO flexed its resilience in 2020, and we'll look to continue momentum in 2021. The business expects to launch new product and order management systems in the first half of the year to further improve internal processing and shorten lead times. Additionally, work continues on 2 new fulfillment centers, with the Ibaraki facility expected to be completed in mid-2021. There's a lot of great work being done across the organization, and I am excited about the opportunities in front of us in 2021 and beyond.  On Slide '19, I just wanted to reiterate our earnings growth algorithm. As we have shed non-core businesses over the last few years and moved forward with more streamlined reportable segments, the path to long-term growth comes into clearer focus. On the operational side, we feel we are well situated to gain share profitably in our North America high-touch business. This includes 300 to 400 basis points of sustainable annual outgrowth in the U.S., improving top line performance in Canada and operating margin expansion as GP rates recover, and we continue to gain SG&A leverage. In the endless assortment, we expect to continue to produce 20% annual top line growth, while also ramping margins at Zoro U.S. into the mid -- into the high single digits over the next 3 to 5 years. These strong growth drivers, alongside a business that generates consistent free cash flow and has significant capital allocation flexibility, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong returns for our shareholders.  I'm proud of our results for the quarter and the full year and want to thank our team members for their commitment to safety and customer service. I also want to thank our customers and suppliers who have been great partners throughout this challenging time. We have needed to work together more than ever over the past year, and those relationships have been crucial. We have gained share, improved our merchandising and marketing capabilities, deepened our customer relationships, and expanded our assortment while improving margins at Zoro. We are in a strong financial position to grow the business profitably moving forward. We remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of keeping the world working throughout this pandemic as well as continuing to execute our strategy, so we can achieve this purpose for years to come.  And with that, we will open the lineup for questions. Yes, sure. So the headwind will largely depend on how long the pandemic goes. If you think about sort of 10 months of -- over 10 months of pandemic sales, we sold about $100 million incremental pandemic product. We feel like -- well, we know that the pandemic sales are very strong right now and will continue to be so. In the year, we would expect several hundred million, something like that, to be a headwind. We also expect to more than recover that in non-pandemic.  And Ryan, I would also comment that given the relationships we have with government and health care customers and the way pandemic sales were throughout the year, our incremental margins on pandemic sales were a lot lower than what we lost. On the smaller loss of revenue for non-pandemic. So we do expect profitability to improve, and we expect to have growth as non-pandemic recovers. So we expect the freight impacts to fall off in the first quarter in some way and certainly the second quarter as well. Although the freight environment remains tight. I mean, the reality is that more people are shipping product to their homes than ever, as you're probably aware of, and that has driven a fairly tight freight market, but we don't expect to be impacted all that much by that.  In terms of inventory adjustments, just to be clear, in the second quarter of 2020, we took a number of actions to try to get product for our customers to protect service. Many of those worked out; some did not work out as we expected. And we received that product in mostly Q3, I'd say. And so every week that goes by, we learn more. We expect it to match anything we take in inventory to the actual pandemic sales as we learn more, so we would expect that to be -- there's still to be some of those inventory adjustments in the first half of the year, but too slowly -- to fall off after that, basically. So yes, the ramp we show is more like what we'd expect to see, Ryan. Yes, sure. I'll turn it over to Dee. Roughly, the surge in pandemic had a modest impact. The inventory adjustments had a bigger impact, and was a large part of that. So Dee, do you want to provide a little bit of color? Well, I mean, I think that most of what we have is pretty well understood and known at this point. So if we get to a point where the vaccinations work and the third quarter starts to look better economically and there's less pandemic product, that's generally the shape of how it will play out. Obviously, if the pandemic doesn't get better and we're still in a really elevated pandemic state, and pandemic is still a huge portion of our business, it would be somewhat less. It'd still improve over the year, but they'll be somewhat less as we exit the year than is shown in that slide. Yes. In the U.S., I think the way to think about it is we gained 800 basis points of share in 2020. 250 of that, we think, is non-repeating. So you'd say 550 is what we think is real share gain. If we gained 400 basis points of real share gain ex those orders, you'd subtract 250 from that, and we'd be at 150 in the year, and across the 2 years, we'd be 950.  I think the two year story, I think the main point here is that, and I hear it from customers every time I talk to them, and I talk to customers every week at a minimum, we are viewed very favorably in terms of how we've handled this. And certainly, we took extra risk with inventory, and it certainly had an impact on our GP. But we are in a great position from a relationship perspective. And we will have a very strong two year share gain period, and we will exit those 2 years with very strong economics. And so for us, that's really the main point. And that's what we've always been trying to do. And so yes, you do have to subtract the 250. But in any case, it's going to be a very strong share gain over those 2 years. Yes, we expect it to go. It was low single digits, so we expect closer to mid-single digits in2021 and high single digits in 3 to 4 years -- 3 to 5 years. That time range. Yes. I mean -- so I mean, a lot did go right? But there are certain categories where supply-demand has changed dramatically since that point, when if you wanted to buy product for your customers, you had to pay -- you had to buy in very large quantities at inflated cost. I would say there's a very narrow range of SKUs that fall into that category. They're all PPE, Deane, that fall into that category that have become the reason for the inventory restatement. It's not like it's hundreds of SKUs. It's a very narrow set of SKUs. And if you ask me, would I do it again? I'd say, yes. I think it was the right decision. A lot of those products are sold to customers and kept them safe. But certainly, you're seeing the impact in terms of the inventory adjustments at this point. Yes. I think it's not going to happen that way, primarily because it's not a broad-based sort of all segment impact. So I think what you're going to see is certain segments turn on. We've already seen manufacturing come back relatively strongly as the year progressed and into 2021. So we've certainly seen some restock. We don't get a lot of restock given what we sell, but we certainly have seen volumes pick up with manufacturing. We still are in a very challenged state with hospitality, airlines, cruise lines, those types of things. And so I think what's going to happen is certain segments seem to turn on as we recover here and they don't all turn up once. So you probably don't see a huge sort of restock, you see more of a phased restock as we go. That would be my expectation. Although if you ask the next person, they may have a different answer. Yes. I mean, I think it's a great question. So first of all, let me be clear, we expect to provide as much transparency into Canada as we did before the resegmentation. It's quite easy to provide you with the numbers you need to understand what's going on in Canada.  Secondly, though, I would say the performance in Canada last year was pretty good. We've seen growth now in December, and January was good for Canada, which is the first time we've seen that in 4 or 5 years. We have very good customer feedback when I talk to customers there. The feedback is very, very good. Our cost structure is in the right place. We have stabilization in gross profit ex some of the inventory efficiency issues we talked about this quarter, which are not operational. So we feel like the business was roughly breakeven last year in the midst of a pandemic. We actually think it's on a very good path. And we think in the next several years, it's going to be profitable, growing part of the portfolio. We've taken all the hard action now, and we are grinding out customers, and we aren't losing contracts anymore. I mean, it just feels very, very different. And I think we've also built some deep customer relationships through the pandemic. So it's going to be a profitable part of the North America portfolio, albeit not as big as it once was, but it will start growing now, is our expectation. Yes. Well, so -- and I think this is 1 where you really need to segment. There have been a few categories that have been -- where supply-demand has been impacted by the pandemic that have had very large cost increases and everybody's taking price increases on those categories. And we are no different.  In general, inflation is still fairly modest, and we think that price cost mix will be neutral over time and maybe a little better given our starting position. So we aren't seeing -- we're seeing, in some categories, huge cost increases and everybody is adjusting prices on those. And then for the rest, we're seeing modest price inflation, and we are seeing some early signs of pretty decent price cost mix. Yes. That is generally the right framework. Again, we would, year-over-year, be hampered a little bit because of some of the outgrowth. We said 250 basis point outgrowth that was really onetime orders. But yes, that's generally the long-term framework. And then -- sorry, you asked a question at the beginning there. The short answer is that the curve that we showed on I think on Slide 15 takes the account sort of what we think the risks are with any inventory. So that is already embedded in that curve. Well, let me clarify a few things there, and I think I can answer the question in the process. So when we've talked about remerchandising as a priority, that is mostly in the Grainger brand. So that is mostly making sure that we have very highly curated product data so it is easier for our customers and team members to find product than anybody else on the roughly 2 million items we would have in the U.S.  With Zoro, we are expanding the offer. You don't have as much curation with that model. You couldn't possibly, given the number of SKUs we have. What happens when you add SKUs is you get growth. And you get customer acquisition first, and then you're able to get repeat buy. And that does not add much expense to the business. So you do, as you grow, get fixed cost leverage with that investment in product SKUs. That isn't the full story. Part of the full story is we're also growing with existing customers and getting repeat buy, and that adds to some of the fixed cost leverage as well. Hopefully, that answers the question, Nigel. Yes. I think I'll turn it over to Dee in a minute. I think in general, we don't expect to have sort of a big step-up through the year. The comps may look unfavorable. As a reminder, we went into this with the opinion that the virus was going to be a little longer-lived than we wanted, for sure, but that we would come out of it and need to operate. So we did not take a whole bunch of draconian actions. We prioritized what we did. We -- I think we will continue to prioritize more tightly what we're working on, which has taken some cost out. Obviously, travel -- some of the travel budget will come back maybe the second half, maybe not. Hard to really tell given where we're at right now. But not all of it. And so we feel like we're still going to have very tight cost control and be able to achieve leverage. But Dee, do you want to provide any color on that? Yes. I mean, so just to -- in terms of contribution to revenue, I would say new customers, repeat rates were good. They're still a fairly small portion of the outgrowth, but we think it gives us a chance to -- we certainly grew the customer file. We don't -- we typically provide that information with Zoro. With Grainger, we don't often provide too many details on that. I will say the customer file is bigger and we have more repeat buy customers that were new in 2020 than we've had in years. So -- and I'd also say, to be honest, we're getting a handle on what that means and how to make -- convert them to be consistently buying customers. So it's a little early to understand sort of the long-term impacts of that. Yes. So that's a great question and mostly unanswerable, I would say. So let me give you some customer examples to give you a sense. So when the pandemic hit in Q2 of 2020, we are the largest industrial safety supplier. We are used to selling things like N95. We are not used to selling N95 to hospitals, just to be clear. Hospitals haven't historically been big users of N95. N95s typically go into places like grain elevators and dirty manufacturing processes. So all of a sudden, all of our product was being shifted to hospitals and governments.  We have gotten back to a more normal mix across what we call pandemic product than we did before, but I think there's still a lot of messiness. There's still a lot of customers in the industrial economy that haven't come back and aren't using safety products maybe like they did before if they don't have the activity. So I think it's a really interesting question and one that is super hard to get at.  And I would also point out that there's a lot of safety products, even in hospital systems. Hospital systems, this year, have done incredible things to protect people, to save people. They have been unable to do a lot of the historical safety maintenance things that they might have done. They just have been full out -- many of them have been full out on COVID. And there's a backlog of things that they will need to do, fundings available, that they just haven't done.  So I think it's a really interesting question and one that is really hard. And I'm sorry to give you some anecdotes. But certainly, I have a lot of them, where I think there is some pent-up demand for normal pandemic product. Yes. I mean, if -- and we haven't provided that. I will say that the $0.5 billion in non-pandemic that we were short in 2020, that probably has normal increment/decrement numbers that you've seen from us. The $800 million in pandemic that we sold above normal would have a lot lower incremental margins; quite a bit lower, maybe less than half, as you think about it, which sort of gets you to what happened to our overall slight decline in operating earnings for the full year. So that may be a way to sort of to allow you to sort of hunt and think about it. Yes. For the company -- and you can keep me honest if I say anything that doesn't make any sense. For the company, we expect the U.S. business, the high-touch model, to have fairly consistent, if not, consistent margins, gross margins over time. We expect to have SG&A growing at half the rate of growth. And that's kind of the earnings algorithm for that model. We expect the -- our model to continue to grow much faster than the rest at something like 20%.  If you just include the fact that those gross profits are lower than the average, that has a roughly 20-basis-point impact on the overall. So you might see a slight decline in overall GP and a slight decline in overall s G&A, given that, that business also has lower SG&A, but it should be fairly stable once we get through this. Yes. So I would point out that we continue to see -- and even the last quarter, we continue to see very strong results from our midsized customers. So even if there's some pressure with large customers, we expect growth of midsized customers to continue to exceed that. And so that should help us there too. Higher GP, less services, and so, higher margins. Yes. Yes. I think there's a few dynamics. One is that in 2020, I think it's important to recognize that, particularly in the second quarter. We -- because of how we prioritize supporting health care systems and governments, we had less product for a while there with midsized customers. So our midsized customer business took a bit of a dip. There were also more closed midsized businesses during that period. We've seen that slowly come back, not fully back yet, but we do expect normalcy with midsized customers, and we have baked in significant share gain with that group. We don't have huge outgrowth in 2021. The pandemic, we think, is going to be a factor in the first half of the year, but we think we will exit the year with the midsized customers growing faster than March, which does -- which is baked into our gross profit assumption. Yes. I mean, I'd say, yes, is the answer. We -- the business has done well in terms of customer acquisition, revenue path. It's got a healthy gross profit for a business that's relatively new. And Masaya and the team are working hard to make that a scalable business, and we still have some positive expectation there that, that is going to be a success story. As you know, the U.K. market was probably more impacted this year than some others. But certainly, we've seen continued growth through this cycle with our U.K. business and a lot of good signs.  So good. Well, thanks. I really appreciate everybody's questions. I'll just close by reiterating: We're viewing the pandemic is a likely two year events, and we expect to gain a lot of share during those two years, and we expect to have very strong economics exiting out of that. And I want to thank our team members and our customers for all we've worked together on to really put ourselves in a good position to have great relationships. Moving forward, and it's been an all hands on deck effort. So thanks to everybody. And I hope you stay safe, and I hope to see you, at some point, in person. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, D.G. Turning to our quarterly performance. Organic daily sales, which adjust for the divestitures of Fabory and China, finished up 5.6% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. Underpinned by growth in our U.S. segment and continued impressive performance in our endless assortment businesses.  In the U.S., we realized strong outgrowth to the broader MRO market which contracted about 1.5% to 2% versus prior year. Our gains were driven by pandemic-related demand, which remains at elevated levels, sales to new customers and growth with midsized customers. The endless assortment model continues to deliver with 20% growth in daily sales again in the fourth quarter, while also generating improved operating margins. We remain very excited about the future of this business, and we'll discuss our plans to provide further transparency as we introduce our new GAAP reportable segments for 2021.  At the total company level, margin pressure continues to be driven by pandemic-related headwinds, primarily in the U.S. segment. I will detail the pandemic mix more in a few slides. In addition, we continue to see business unit mix impact as we experienced significant growth from our endless assortment businesses.  SG&A costs were favorable by $42 million year-over-year as we captured 235 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period through prudent cost controls in the U.S. and Canada, and we gained strong expense leverage in our endless assortment businesses. This resulted in Q4 operating margin at 10%, down 75 basis points from the fourth quarter last year.  From a cash flow perspective, the business continues to produce robust cash flow, with operating cash flow of $336 million at 170% of net adjusted earnings, and free cash flow of $291 million. We restarted our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter and completed $500 million of repurchases in the period. Finally, we delivered strong return on invested capital at over 28% for the full year.  Turning to our U.S. segment. Daily sales increased 3.7% in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. On the product side, sales of pandemic-related products remains elevated, up 49% in the quarter, but have tapered off in the peak in the second quarter. We continue to see meaningful improvement in our non-pandemic products trends, which has improved to down 7% in the quarter, exiting the year with December at lowest decline, down 5%.  We've also seen a significant uptick in new customer acquisitions month-over-month with encouraging signs of repeat buying. From a customer perspective, we see improved growth with both large and midsized customers, with the latter growing about 6% in the quarter, continuing to show signs of improvement from earlier in the year. Gross margin of 35.7% was down 290 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The unfavorable variance in gross margin was driven most notably by pandemic-related headwinds, which accounted for nearly 90% of the GP decline. The pandemic impact was driven by continued product and customer mix and mark-to-market inventory adjustments, which D.G. outlined earlier, as well as freight-related surcharges, net of pass-through shipping charges to customers.  In the second half of 2020, we started getting solid traction on price realization, which nearly offset continued cost headwinds as we exited the year. From an SG&A perspective, we gained 155 basis points of leverage with cost decreasing approximately $14 million year-over-year. The reduction was driven primarily by decreased travel expenses, lower depreciation and general operating efficiencies.  Operating margin declined to 12.8% in the fourth quarter as the pandemic impact of gross margin weighted more heavily than the SG&A leverage gained. Adjusted return on invested capital was a very healthy 36.5% for the full year of 2020.  Now looking at pandemic product trends. While sales of pandemic-related products decreased from the second quarter through October, continued demand for key products, including masks, gloves and cleaning supply has kept pandemic sales elevated year-over-year, and we saw this pick up again in the last few months of the year as cases spiked headed into the winter.  We've also seen customers across industries prepare for the vaccine distribution maybe related but slightly different products like those required to work in refrigerated storage units. January sales remain elevated and have tapered off from Q4.  On the non-pandemic side, things continue to get better. We exited the year with December down 5% and have continued to see improvement with January, roughly flat year-over-year. Looking at share gain on Slide 10. We estimate the U.S. MRO market decline between 1.5% to 2% in the fourth quarter, showing strong improvement from the mid-teens decline we saw in the second quarter. Grainger was able to capture roughly 550 basis points of outgrowth, fueled by pandemic-related sales and our growth initiatives.  On a full-year basis, we estimate that we have outgrown the broader MRO market by roughly 800 basis points. This outgrowth was aided by significant pandemic-related volume, some of which, particularly in the second and third quarters, was related to large onetime orders that are unlikely to reoccur. We estimate that approximately 250 basis points of the market growth in 2020 was a result of these non-repeating pandemic transactions.  Accordingly, as we move into 2021 and lap these pandemic sales spikes, we expect to see some volatility in our year-over-year share gain metric. That being said, we are confident in our ability to serve new and existing customers during these challenging times. We believe we are doing the right things in merchandising, marketing and sales effectiveness to drive repeat purchases and produce 300 to 400 basis points of sustainable outgrowth in our U.S. high-touch business.  Moving to our other businesses. Organic daily sales increased 14.6% or 13% on a constant currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at an approximately 20%, with strong results in both MonotaRO and Zoro during the quarter. For our international high-touch business in both Mexico and Cromwell, we saw continued sequential improvement. However, both businesses remain impacted by pandemic-related shutdown.  Overall, operating margins for other businesses were up 210 basis points. The favorability was driven by significant SG&A leverage and endless assortment, notably at Zoro, which lapped heavy investment spend in the prior year period. Zoro continues to execute the MonotaRO playbook and deliver low single-digit results for the year.  Turning to Slide 12. The Canadian market has seen an overall economic slowdown during the pandemic, which has notably impacted our natural resource and export customers. Throughout the pandemic, our team in Canada has remained focused on serving new and existing customers well while also accelerating our customer diversification efforts.  In Canada, daily sales decreased 3.2%, or 4.4% on a constant currency basis. Volumes in Canada reflect the pandemic-driven slowdown. However, the business continued to improve sequentially. We have positive sales growth in the month of December, and we believe the business is well suited for post-pandemic growth. Gross margin at Grainger Canada declined 1,040 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by lapping significant onetime supply chain efficiencies, and to a lesser extent, the impact of pandemic-related headwinds. Cost management and the benefit of pandemic-related subsidies resulted in 315 basis points of SG&A leverage.  Given the continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the subsequent path of economic recovery, we will not be providing formal guidance at this time. This picture remains fluid, as does the shape of the pandemic and the customer demand for pandemic products. Similar to the last few quarters, we want to continue providing some insights into how we're thinking about the current quarter's performance. From a sales perspective, our preliminary results for January show year-over-year sales of about 9% at the total company level on a daily organic constant currency basis. While this is a strong start to the quarter, we faced more difficult comps in February and March when pandemic sales started to spike. With this, we expect daily sales to moderate and end the first quarter up between 3% and 5% organically. Note, we'll also have 1 less selling day this quarter.  From a gross margin perspective, we expect GP improvement of around 50 to 100 basis points sequentially versus Q4 2020. This anticipated lift is underpinned by a slowdown in pandemic product demand, continued price cost recovery and the lapping of freight headwinds experienced in Q4 2020.  On a year-over-year basis, this would imply GP will be down between 150 to 200 basis points in the quarter.  With respect to SG&A, we expect costs will inch up sequentially as business activity progresses and if things like variable comp reset with the start of the new year. With this, we anticipate SG&A of between $730 million to $750 million for the first quarter of 2021. While this is up slightly versus Q4 2020, we will still be down meaningfully year-over-year. As always, we remain focused on managing near-term headwinds while continuing to invest in the business for the long term.  From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to our balanced framework. For 2021, we anticipate investing between $225 million and $275 million back into the business. These CapEx investments include DC expansion in Japan, continued IT and KeepStock investments in the U.S., and normal levels of maintenance capital. Beyond that, we anticipate executing a similar dividend and share repurchase strategy, putting between $600 million to $700 million to work on repurchases in 2021.  Although we are not providing 2021 guidance, I thought it might be helpful to provide some insights as to how a post-pandemic recovery could play out through the year. As it's the largest portion of our business and one of the most impacted by the pandemic, we have charted our U.S. segment on Slide 14 and 15, to give you some context. As we have seen continued progress on vaccine distribution and a return to near full economic activity as we enter into the second half of 2021, we would expect our results to trend back towards more normalized levels.  On Slide 14, we map out year-over-year sales growth in dollars. Similar to our pandemic/non-pandemic sales chart, you can see the quarter-to-quarter sales spikes from pandemic-related products, most pronounced in the second quarter, which remained elevated through the year, and finished up $835 million or 54% in 2020. This drove pandemic product mix as a percent of total sales to 28%, a large increase compared to 19% in 2019. Conversely, non-pandemic sales were down dramatically in the second quarter and remains depressed through the balance of the year, finishing down $540 million or 8% in 2020. These trends did improve sequentially.  In 2021, we expect to face lapping headwinds as pandemic sales continue to moderate from the spikes we saw last year. That being said, I think it's important to remember that more than 70% of our sales comes from non-pandemic products, and as the economy recovers and these sales rebound, it should more than offset the lapping headwinds from pandemic-related products. This will also help to normalize our product mix back towards pre-COVID levels. Accordingly, we would expect to see year-over-year growth in 2021, but the magnitude will be determined by the pace of the economic recovery.  Related to gross profit margin, as product mix trends towards pre-pandemic levels, we would expect to see improved GP rates throughout the year. This includes sequential improvement from Q4 2020, beginning in Q1 2021. We expect to exit the year with U.S. GP rates as high or higher than Q1 2020 levels.  I want to reiterate, while this commentary relates to the U.S. business, we showcased it because it represents more than 70% of the total company results and was the most heavily impacted by the pandemic.  With that, I will turn it back over to D.G. Yes. Thanks, D.G. So yes, I would say, if you look at the U.S. segment, which I think if you're talking about Slide 15, that over 90% of the impact, the sequential impact from Q3 to Q4 was all pandemic-related headwinds. And D.G talked about -- and I spoke a little bit about our mark-to-market adjustments. I would say, if you look at the full year -- I know you asked a sequential question, but if you look at the full year for the U.S., I will say about half of our full pandemic impact was related to our inventory adjustments. Correct. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. I think you said most of it there, but I would just say, generally, I think our long-term view to have SG&A be at half the rate of sales will be the continued focus. But this year is going to be kind of wait and see. And as D.G. noted, we're very focused on being very prudent with our costs. And I think it's all going to really depend upon how this pandemic progresses. But I think we would slowly start to see expenses tick up as we get closer to normal levels. But -- of activity in the overall market with our customers. But if we don't see us getting back to normal, we will still be very prudent with our expenses. No. Again, I was just going to add to D.G. that I would agree with that. And that coming out of the pandemic, I think we would look for a much more stable and potentially more accretive margins on the high-touch than what we've seen over the pandemic. And they use less services like -- something like KeepStock, those types of services."

It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Irene Holman, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nIrene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, SVP and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q3 press release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results for the third quarter of 2020, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings release.  Now I'll turn it over to D.G.\nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Market conditions remained challenging in the third quarter as the pandemic conditions improved but continued to weigh on many of our customers. Amidst these challenges, Grainger performed well, continuing to demonstrate our resilience and strength. I'm so proud of how Grainger team members have responded to the challenges of 2020, staying relentlessly focused on further deepening relationships with our customers and supporting each other.  I've shared with you our Grainger edge framework, which includes our purpose, aspiration, strategy and the principles that define the behaviors we expect from all team members. These principles, including starting with the customer, acting with intent and competing with urgency, provide clarity and focus as we continue to execute on our purpose to keep the world working. And we'll continue to leverage the Grainger edge in all that we do throughout this pandemic and beyond.  So let me start off with a brief business update and an overview of our third quarter performance before turning it over to Tom to dive into the details. On the business side, we continue to serve our customers well to support the needs and safety of our team members and ensure we remain in a strong financial position. A quick update on each point. Grainger has operated effectively throughout the pandemic, first in support of essential businesses and now in serving all businesses. Each of our customers has a unique story on how they have been impacted by and managed through the pandemic. We have been there for all of them. Sales to health care, government and e-commerce businesses remained strong in the quarter, and we saw improving trends with manufacturing and commercial customers. I'll address the pattern of revenue in a moment.  Our world-class integrated supply chain organization, which supports both our North American high-touch businesses and our Zoro endless assortment platform, has helped find and secure products to meet customer demand. We have successfully worked down our backlog of orders for most pandemic-related products, including masks, and continue to work with suppliers to catch up on a few categories that remain scarce, including some gloves and hand sanitizers. The team remains laser-focused on maintaining our high level of customer service. Customer feedback has been strong and improving throughout the pandemic.  For our team members, we continue to take steps to support not only their safety but their overall well-being during this uncertain time. To date, we have managed the challenges of 2020 without major layoffs and currently have roughly 1% of our workforce still on furlough. Importantly, we've maintained a strong financial position. We've been diligent in controlling costs while balancing the need to continue to serve our customers, support our team members and invest where it matters most. Our strong performance over the last 2 quarters, together with our solid cost containment, have enabled us to relax a number of our short-term cash preservation actions. We exited the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in available liquidity.  We continue to make strong progress on our strategic growth priorities during the short-term uncertainty. We have continued to execute our transform merchandising process to drive significant user experience improvements to grainger.com, including our search and visualization capabilities and enriched product descriptions and content. By the end of 2020, we expect to have remerchandised $2.8 billion in product through this new process, including $1.6 billion in the year alone. We intend to further accelerate these efforts moving forward as a result of our new product information management system that launched in the third quarter. Customer feedback on our website has improved significantly over the past 6 quarters.  Marketing has been a large contributor of our U.S. share gain over the last few years. We have improved effectiveness in both media advertising and paid search and plan to further invest in marketing given these strong returns. We continue to deepen relationships with our customers to our large customer multisite growth initiative, enhancements to our KeepStock offering and improvements to our sales strategy and effectiveness. We know that when we embed one or more of our service offerings with our customers, we foster deeper and longer-lasting relationships. Over 60% of our U.S. revenue is generated from customers with one or more embedded solution.  And lastly, within our endless assortment model, we are executing the successful MonatoRO playbook at Zoro here in the U.S. and are making strides in marketing effectiveness, customer analytics and SKU additions. This year alone, we have added 1.5 million SKUs to Zoro, pushing its assortment to roughly 5 million products.  Turning to our quarterly performance. We produced strong operating results in the third quarter. Organic daily sales finished up 4.6% in the quarter, underpinned by growth in our U.S. high-touch business and continued impressive performance of our endless assortment model. In the U.S., we realized strong outgrowth to the broader MRO market as a whole, which was down 5% to 6% in the quarter. Our gains were supported by pandemic-related demand, sales to new customers and improved sales of nonpandemic product as we started to see some stabilizing trends in underlying business activity. Overall business activity still trails pre-pandemic levels as some customers remain disrupted by COVID.  The endless assortment model continues to deliver with 20% growth in the third quarter, while also generating meaningfully improved margins. We remain very excited about the future of this business as we continue to adopt learnings from MonatoRO to drive growth and profitability. At the total company level, we expanded adjusted operating margins by 90 basis points as gross margin stabilized sequentially and we demonstrated strong cost control. Tom will detail this in a bit. The business continues to produce a durable cash flow stream with operating cash flow of $311 million and free cash flow of $252 million.  Looking at Slide 6, I thought it would be important to again show this chart to highlight the underlying trends with pandemic and nonpandemic products based on our current categorization of SKUs. Our characterization goes beyond traditional safety products to include product categories with substantial volume increases during the pandemic. Flexiglass barriers will be an example. As you can see, while sales of pandemic-related products have decreased since May, continued demand for key products, including masks, gloves and cleaning supplies, has kept pandemic sales elevated year-over-year. This heightened demand has continued to come from a multitude of new and existing customers across numerous industries as businesses reopen and adjust to the new operating protocols.  On the nonpandemic side, sales have improved since bottoming out in April, with nonpandemic sales now down about 7% year-over-year. This improvement has been seen across most industries with some of the obvious industries remaining the furthest below their pre-pandemic levels. These include airlines, hotels and cruise lines. Based on month-to-date performance, we forecast October sales to finish up around 2% for the U.S. segment on continued trends in pandemic and nonpandemic performance.  Predicting the recovery over the next few quarters is very challenging. The path of the virus will have a big impact on whether the recent improvements continue, level off or reverse, but we feel well positioned to compete in any environment that comes our way.  With that, I will turn it over to Tom to talk us through the quarter's results in detail. Tom?\nThomas Okray: Thanks, D.G. Starting on Slide 8, you can see we delivered strong results in the quarter. Organic daily sales, which adjust for the divestitures of Fabory in China, were up 4.6% on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by share gains in our U.S. segment and continued impressive growth in our endless assortment business, which was up over 20% in the quarter. These gains more than offset pandemic-related softness in our Canada and Cromwell businesses, where we saw meaningfully higher sales sequentially but still remain well below pre-pandemic levels.  Gross margin for the total company was down 170 basis points versus the prior year quarter, but represented a 120 basis point improvement from the second quarter year-over-year decline. Margin pressure continues to be driven by pandemic-related headwinds, primarily in our U.S. segment as well as continued unit -- business unit mix impact as we experienced significant growth in our endless assortment business.  Our SG&A came in at $700 million in the third quarter, better than our communicated range of $715 million to $730 million. SG&A cost was down $60 million year-over-year, and we captured 260 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period. This result stems from prudent cost reduction actions across our high-touch solutions model, including cost -- lower costs as a result of our Fabory divestiture and leverage gains with our endless assortment business. This SG&A performance more than overcame GP headwinds to drive a 90 basis point improvement in total company operating margins for the quarter, a tremendous result in this environment. Incremental margins were up 50% in the quarter. As mentioned last quarter, the utility of the incremental and decremental margin calculation is diminished in this uncertain environment as the metric can vary significantly given the magnitude of top line swings from quarter-to-quarter.  We generated operating cash flow of $311 million, which we used to continue to invest in the business, build appropriate inventory to support our customers and return capital to shareholders. Operating cash flow was 126% of net adjusted earnings, and year-to-date adjusted return on invested capital is over 29%. Given our solid results of the last couple of quarters, combined with stabilizing trends in underlying business activity, we fully repaid our revolving credit facility, increased our dividend payment and are announcing today our intent to restart our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. While we anticipate putting several hundred million dollars to work on repurchases in Q4, we will monitor market conditions and optimize the amount accordingly. The favorable trends over the last several months give us confidence that this is the right time to move forward with these actions.  Turning to our U.S. segment. Daily sales increased 3.1% in the quarter, driven primarily by volume, which is net of unfavorable product mix. On the product side, sales of pandemic-related products remained elevated, up 53% in the quarter, but as shown earlier, have tapered off from the peak in March. Nonpandemic products were down around 8% in the quarter, but continued to show meaningful improvement from April lows. We've also seen a significant uptick in new customer acquisitions with some really encouraging signs of repeat buying. From a customer perspective, we saw improved growth with both large and midsized customers, with the latter growing 6% in the quarter, an improvement from the 6% decline year-over-year we saw in Q2 2020.  Gross margins of 36.4% was down 160 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019, but improved sequentially from the 310 basis point year-over-year decline we saw in the second quarter of 2020. The unfavorable variance in gross margin was driven by -- mainly by 2 factors that were similar to the second quarter, pandemic-related product headwinds and tariff-fueled cost inflation. Pandemic-related headwinds contributed about 140 basis points of the gross margin decline as we continue to see unfavorable product and customer mix due to elevated sales of lower-margin pandemic product.  Beyond the pandemic impact, we continue to face pressure in the quarter due to the lapping of year-over-year cost inflation, which was driven partially by tariffs that went into effect in 2019. This drove approximately 80 basis points of year-over-year margin decline. Based on what we know now, we expect that both of these gross margin headwinds will continue into the fourth quarter. It should be noted that we anticipate the tariff headwinds will fully subside as we move into 2021. Offsetting these two factors in the quarter was a 60 basis points tailwind related to favorable freight costs driven by nonrecurring shipping efficiencies and timing. We do not expect these freight dynamics to continue in the fourth quarter.  From an SG&A perspective, we gained 160 basis points of leverage with cost decreasing approximately $22 million year-over-year. The reduction was driven primarily by decreased travel expenses, lower labor-related costs and general operating efficiencies. Operating margin remained flat to the prior year quarter at 15.1% as SG&A leverage offset gross margin headwinds. Return on invested capital was a very healthy 38%.  Drilling into our U.S. sales performance on Slide 10. While we estimate the U.S. MRO market declined between 5% and 6% in the third quarter, Grainger was able to capture roughly 850 basis points of outgrowth, fueled by pandemic-related sales, selling to new customers and improving sales of nonpandemic product. Despite the challenges of 2020, U.S. segment daily sales are up 2.1% year-to-date, and we have outgained the broader MRO market by over 900 basis points through the first 9 months of 2020.  Moving to our Other Businesses. Organic daily sales increased 12.5% or 12.3% on a constant currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at approximately 20%, fueled by strong results at both MonatoRO and Zoro during the quarter. Zoro continues to execute the MonatoRO playbook with improvements to marketing effectiveness, discounting strategies and better cost leverage, all helping to drive improved performance. Although we saw significant sequential improvement compared to the second quarter, our international high-touch businesses continue to be impacted by pandemic-related shutdowns with both Mexico and Cromwell seeing year-over-year declines.  Operating margins for Other Businesses are up 190 basis points, 35 basis points which is due to the divestiture of our Fabory and China businesses, which produced below system average profitability in the prior year. The remaining operating margin favorability was driven by significant SG&A leverage across the portfolio, most notably within our endless assortment business, which continues to do a nice job levering its cost base. This leverage was only partially offset by gross profit headwinds from incremental freight costs at MonatoRO  Turning to Slide 12. In Canada, daily sales decreased 9.9% or 9.1% in constant currency. The decline is comprised of roughly 8% decline in volume and price headwinds, including customer mix of approximately 1%. While volumes in Canada continued to be impacted by the pandemic-driven economic slowdown, the business did improve sequentially and is gaining traction with hospitals, manufacturing and higher-education customers. As the Canadian business continues to integrate and leverage our U.S. resources, we are making progress with our customer diversification efforts and are pleased with the trajectory of this business going forward.  Gross profit margin at Grainger Canada declined 35 basis points year-over-year, driven by pandemic-related mix headwinds, which were offset partially by lower freight costs in the quarter. Cost management remains strong with savings of $5 million year-over-year, resulting in 110 basis points of SG&A leverage. Total operating margins were up 75 basis points versus prior year despite the top line challenges.  Before I turn it back to D.G., similar to the last couple of quarters, I want to give you a sense of how we're thinking about things in the fourth quarter. From a sales perspective, month-to-date trends support our estimate for October year-over-year sales growth to be up over 4% at the total company level on an organic constant currency basis. This October month end estimate is reflective of continued solid growth in our U.S. segment, coupled with strong performance in endless assortment.  From a gross margin perspective, as I previously mentioned, we anticipate gross margin pressure will continue as the pandemic-related impacts and tariff-fueled cost inflation headwinds will persist into the fourth quarter. The onetime freight tailwind we realized in the third quarter will fall off. Further, we anticipate year-over-year cost headwinds in the fourth quarter as the already stretched global shipping providers pass through freight surcharges during the busy holiday season. Given these factors and based on what we are currently seeing, we anticipate gross margins will be down over 200 basis points year-over-year.  With respect to SG&A, we expect to see sequential increases in a couple of areas, primarily related to some incremental technology investments to support growth in the U.S. and at MonatoRO, which will push our estimated SG&A to between $725 million to $740 million for the fourth quarter. As always, we remain focused on managing near-term headwinds while continuing to invest in long-term growth, particularly in people, processes and technology where and when it makes sense.  With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some final thoughts.\nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, Tom. So I'm proud of our results for the quarter, and I want to thank our team members for their commitment to safety and customer service.  We have gained share, improved our merchandising and marketing capabilities, deepened our customer relationships, expanded our assortment while improving margins at Zoro and have significant financial flexibility to support the business moving forward. We remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of keeping the world working throughout this pandemic as well as continuing to execute our strategy, so we can achieve this purpose for years to come.  And with that, we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Chris Glynn from Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: I was curious, you mentioned the customer acquisition trend still going strong and conversions to some regular customer dynamics are going well. Just wondering if you could further dive into that topic and how it informs early view of share outperformance for '21?\nDonald Macpherson: Great. Thanks, Chris. So yes, so we've had -- as you might guess, given inventory positions, we have had a whole bunch of new customers sample Grainger and Zoro and MonatoRO, frankly, as we've had elevated customer acquisitions through this period. The good news is that those who have repeated, the number is much higher than in the past. The repeat rates are similar to the past, but we have a much bigger funnel, and we're starting to get those customers to be regular purchasing customers. So we've seen really nice, attractive customer acquisition through this period, and we think that really helps bode well for the future. We feel very confident in our 300 to 400 basis point outgrowth in the U.S. business and the 20% growth expectations for the endless assortment, and we have no reason to change those right now. This year, we've obviously been higher than that number in the U.S. We would expect to be in that range and shoot for higher, but be in that range moving forward.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And then for follow-up. I think the -- would you anticipate that 3Q pandemic sales using October as a proxy might approximate the sustainable run rates as long as workplaces are very germaphobic? Or is that still way too in flux?\nDonald Macpherson: I think that's a very interesting question, and I don't think anybody has the answer. What we're seeing right now is elevated pandemic sales. We expect that to continue. And certainly, as case rates rise, which we've seen recently, we would expect that to continue through the fall. What happens when we have better treatments and a vaccine is probably a question that is all in our minds, and it's probably impossible to answer. We would expect some of that to moderate, but we do think people are going to be more conscious of safety and cleanliness for some period after that as well. But for now, we're seeing similar trends to what we've seen in the past. We would expect that to continue in the fall, given the rate of transmission.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Chris Dankert from Longbow Research.\nChristopher Dankert: I guess, first off, what's the status of investment in Zoro? I mean in the past, we'd mentioned you had $50 million of investment in '19. It largely rolls off this year, I guess. Are we still on pace to get to mid-single-digit EBIT margin plus in the Other Business in '21? Just thoughts on investment there would be really helpful, I think.\nDonald Macpherson: Sure. So we had a very heavy investment period in the back half of '18 and '19 with Zoro. Many of those -- those investments took several forms. One was technology. Another was people in getting the talent to be able to have their own destiny in terms of product adds and the like. And so we made those investments. Those investments are behind us. We start to see those -- starting to see those leverage themselves now. This year, we're getting improved operating margins in Zoro. We think the long-term path for Zoro from a margin perspective is as we've discussed. We'll talk about next year in January, but we have no reason to believe the positivity that we've seen won't continue, and we still think that is going to be a high single-digit operating margin business in the next several years. And so that's the path for that business.\nChristopher Dankert: Got it. Got it. And then thinking about SG&A, I mean, compared to what the guidance was, again, coming in below that range. My apologies if I missed it, but just what were the key moving parts on what helps you kind of cut that SG&A number even lower in the third quarter here?\nThomas Okray: Yes. Thanks.\nDonald Macpherson: Tom, do you want to take that?\nThomas Okray: Yes, sure. Thanks, Chris. First of all, there was a little bit that was win dated just with the Fabory divestiture, and that takes the $60 million down to about $40 million. But then we just had real good efficiency across the board. Everything from travel and entertainment, professional services, cleaning supply, security, just a real good focus by the team in terms of efficiency and cost control. And one of the great things with the pandemic is we've always been cost conscious, but I think we've really upped our game. And I think it's going to continue going forward where we're really in this mode of operating this way. So just to summarize, really good cost control across the board while continuing to spend in advertising and technology, which are important for us.\nChristopher Dankert: Got it. Glad to hear it that it's a broad-based savings, certainly. So congrats again on the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.\nAdam Uhlman: Sticking with the SG&A question, I guess the freight dynamics that you pointed out for the third quarter and the fourth quarter are pretty interesting. As the surcharge rate kind of transition into base rate increases, I'm wondering if you could help us ballpark just how meaningful of a headwind that could be for 2021? Or perhaps it's not a headwind, and you have some other levers to pull to offset that? And maybe you could just remind us about how you charge customers for freight. I believe most customers don't pay, but maybe discuss that as well.\nDonald Macpherson: So I would say that it's a great question. Most customers -- our largest customers and contract customers often don't pay for parcel. They often pay for LTL or large shipments. The surcharge that Tom was referring to is really around large packages during the peak season, and we will charge for some of that. We expect to recoup some of that. We don't expect to recoup all of that. And that doesn't have much to do with what happens into next year. So we'll talk about next year, obviously, after this quarter. I would say, certainly, the freight business, given the number of shipments going to people's houses, has become strained, and we've seen some pressure. That does not mean though that the surcharges that happened in the fall necessarily translate going forward, and so we'll talk about that. And we think we've got initiatives and actions to help mitigate that moving forward, but we'll talk about that at the end of the year.\nAdam Uhlman: Okay. Great. That's good to hear. And then secondly, the company has been building up inventory. And I was curious, one, if you could talk about your inventory and working capital assumptions here in the medium term? And then secondly, if you are concerned at all of absorbing losses on any pandemic inventory that you might be taking if we have some good luck and the pandemic starts to roll off and market pricing deteriorates further?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So let me take those. And Tom, you can add to them if you think I miss anything. So in terms of inventory, there's really 2 areas where we've built inventory, and we'll continue to do so through the latter part of the year. The first one is sort of normal, which is we are starting the Louisville DC full up in 2021. And so as that comes on, we obviously stock that building. That's partially stocked now, but becomes more fully stocked as we go through, and that's a part of what you've seen. The other part is pre-buys for pandemic-related product. I would say to your question about do we have risk on excess obsolescence with that product, part of what you see in terms of -- with us in terms of pandemic GP already embeds some write-downs.  We obviously, to make sure we could serve our customers, took positions at a whole bunch of products in the height of the pandemic. And some of those, the price/cost has changed. Some of those, we haven't seen movement. In a lot of those, we've seen movement, and it's gone very well. But in that messiness to serve customers, which we think has been really, really important, you're already seeing that in some of the GP rates that you're seeing is us take that. We think that we're in good position. Most of the inventory build, to be clear, has been pre-buys on product that has very low risk. We know suppliers, we know product, we know product that will sell in any case, but trying to get out ahead of that in case the fall and the winter is really, really bad. And so most of that is not higher risk than normal. But certainly, in some of the speculative buys and things we took in the heart of the pandemic, you've already seen some of that come through in terms of GP.\nThomas Okray: Yes. And just to add a little bit more color on inventory and cash. One of the things that we've been very efficient on is our management of cash, and you've seen that in this quarter. More specifically, our cash conversion cycle, our DSO is actually down year-over-year a couple of days. And our DPO is actually favorable by more than a few days, which has allowed us to keep an overall cash conversion cycle that is very healthy versus last year and invest in the inventory. So we can play our role as an essential business and support the customers the way we need to. So you're right. Inventory is up since the beginning of the year, 8% at $1.78 billion. We've invested in working capital. It's up $220 million. And we did put pandemic inventory spend in the quarter of approximately $300 million. And as D.G. said, I mean, you're not going to bat 1,000 on all of that. So we go through the normal E&O process. And I guess the way I would describe it is we're very aggressive operationally, but very conservative financially. So doing the right thing to reserve. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Chris Snyder from UBS.\nChristopher Snyder: I just wanted to follow-up on endless assortment margins. I understand there's like a longer-term kind of high single-digit target out there for Zoro. But with the back-office investment slowing, what kind of incremental margins could we expect for this business as the top line continues to ramp?\nThomas Okray: Yes. It's a good question. We really don't look at incremental margins specifically on the endless assortment business just because the supply chain is so intertwined in the synergies with the broader business. So we really look at the business as the incremental margin for the overall entity.\nDonald Macpherson: I mean, Tom, I would just add. I mean, if you look at incremental margins with MonatoRO, typically, you're talking about a 15% to 20%, which is just GP minus the variable marketing cost. And so I would expect us to get to something like that over time at Zoro. But that's typically what we see in MonatoRO, I think.\nChristopher Snyder: Appreciate that. And then just following up on MonatoRO. So like the stock is like 100% year-to-date in Tokyo last I checked. Can you just talk about how you kind of view that business strategically at Grainger?\nDonald Macpherson: So we view both the endless assortment and the high-touch solutions model as absolutely core to what we do. Masaya Suzuki, who's the leader of that business now, also leads Zoro. We are sharing best practices and analytics and working together to ensure that we're actually making progress across those 2 businesses and our Zoro business in the U.K. as well. So we view it as absolutely core to what we do right now. And we're getting a whole lot of leverage from that MonatoRO team in terms of learnings and building the business in Zoro for the future. So we are running those very, very tightly together at this point.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: I was hoping we get some color on the -- additional color on the gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter down 200 bps. Is there any way you can parse out what the pandemic sales would be versus non pandemic sales? We're just trying to get a sense of what the core gross margin trajectory might be.\nThomas Okray: Yes. I think the way to look at it, Deane, is we said the pandemic impact is 140 basis points for this quarter, and the cost other is 80 basis point unfavorable bad guy, and we had the onetime freight of 60. So if you remove the 60 from the 140 and the 80, you get to 220. Now we think that the pandemic will likely improve. Obviously, it's very volatile. Say you get roughly a 20% improvement on your cost inflation as well as your pandemic, that gets you to around 200-ish. And then you throw in the freight headwinds that we think we might experience at the end of the year, as D.G. discussed, with the surcharges, and that gets you above 200.\nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. And then I was hoping to get some additional color on the October sales. Just to the extent that you can, anything that you think would be helpful regarding geographic, customer sizes, anything else about the mix, that would be a big help here.\nDonald Macpherson: I think, Deane, if you looked at sales revenue performance July, August, September, October, you'd be hard pressed to see much of a difference across those months. We've seen a little tail off in pandemic and a little improvement in nonpandemic. But pretty much, the trend has been very, very similar across all of those months. So the trends we've seen and the performance we saw in the second quarter really just appears to be -- in the third quarter appears to be continuing in October at this point.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And just lastly, an observation. I've certainly heard the Grainger spot adds on business radio pretty frequently in the brand building. So I guess pretty effective.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: I want to pick up on that 4Q gross margin guidance. So roughly 200 basis points down from 38% last quarter gets it to about 36%, which would be up from this quarter. So I just wanted to make sure that, that math kind of still holds that we're looking for what would be a fairly normal sequential pickup in gross margin percentage from 3Q.\nDonald Macpherson: Tom, do you want to take that one?\nThomas Okray: I think another way to look at it is our absolute gross margin should be very similar to Q3. And then when you just look at the comparison to prior year, it's going to bump it over 200. So that's the other way I would look at it.\nNigel Coe: Okay. No, that's fair. And then the midsize customer growth was pretty impressive and a nice swing from what we saw last quarter. And I'm just curious, are we seeing -- obviously, a lot of your competitors, especially the small competitors and 1 of 2 larger ones, employ a very high-touch distribution model. And I'm wondering if we're seeing a switch towards perhaps more low-touch, direct ship e-commerce type sales and maybe some supply consolidation? I mean anything you see in there in the market?\nDonald Macpherson: Well, yes, I would say we've certainly seen more digital sales through the pandemic. I think we've seen that in almost every industry and ours has been no different. What I would say is that we are seeing improvements in midsize customer growth from digital actions but also from inside sales actions. So that is more of a touch, but we're seeing nice growth across both of those contact points. And so yes, I would say it's fair to characterize as more digital, but not all digital. We're also seeing some nice growth through some of our other actions that are more high touch.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Just a couple of questions. I was -- covered a lot of ground already, but one thing I want to be sure on, if you don't mind. Tom, on endless assortment, clearly some good leverage happening there. But just wondering if anything is happening inside of Zoro or MonatoRO, for that matter, with mix. Obviously, in the middle of pandemic, we can talk about like pandemic mix and safety products. But I guess, just more broadly, are people buying different stuff than that is normally tuned up for? And does that have some benefit, positive or negative, that may not look like the ongoing model?\nThomas Okray: Yes. I think the only thing that I would say, and then, D.G., please add, is we're probably seeing more B2C customers than B2B customers in the pandemic. But other than that, nothing out of the ordinary.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So one of the things that I would say that's muddled the pandemic a little bit in terms of results has been with so many people working from home, sometimes, the business and the consumer tends to blur. I've listened to a bunch of contact center calls. And it's fascinating that there's a lot of people at home may be buying things for businesses, but also sometimes delivering to their home. And so we think we've had more consumer acquisition than normal. We don't remarket to consumers, whether in Zoro or Grainger. And what we do know is that the business customer acquisition has been very solid, very strong. And the attractiveness of those customers has been every bit as strong as we've seen in the past. So we're happy with -- besides having to sort of sift through consumer business, the business, the [indiscernible] business has been very strong, and that's been that sort of key for us.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then it sounds like Deane is going to be a future customer here based on the effect of this marketing, so maybe you can close that lead.\nDonald Macpherson: He's not the target segment, I can assure you that.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Understood. And then just on the inventory question. I know someone asked earlier about the inventory build there. Anything on kind of seasonally uncommon liquidation in the fourth quarter that you're planning that may be dragging that down or impacting that at all? Just thinking about historically, usually, you build a little inventory in the fourth quarter sequentially. Is that something that happened earlier? And is that playing into the -- that dynamic at all on the gross margin?\nThomas Okray: It's playing into it a little bit. As we said on the previous question, we've been very aggressively operationally from an inventory perspective because it's the right thing to do, and we want to have the product available for our customers. But on the other hand, we've been conservative financially. So part of the gross margin deterioration that you've seen in Q3 is an E&O headwind, cleaning up some of the buys that didn't exactly thread the needle. So we've tried to do most of that in Q3. We'll see a little bit in Q4 as well. And then we believe that that's going to be behind us going into 2021, we'll have the right product to serve our customer. And then if anything, we'll have a tailwind as we unwind some of those reserves when the products that we have reserved potentially will be available for sale.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from John Inch from Gordon Haskett.\nJohn Inch: Assuming that PPE sales which you would assume, right, to happen as the market has been saturated naturally continued to trend lower, as we roll into 2021, what kind of a kind of an absolute sales headwind could this prospectively represent? And you guys have had very strong OpEx control. Kind of -- I don't think I've heard this in the discussion thus far. I mean, what kind of costs are you thinking about are going to have to come back next year as you sort of flip from PPE to kind of a more normalized volume trajectory for other products?\nDonald Macpherson: Well, I think there's a lot in that question, John. I would say that we -- it's hard -- it's really difficult to project the PPE trend. What we've seen since April, in April, we saw PPE up almost 100% pandemic product, what we call pandemic that includes more than PPE. We saw sort of normal volumes down 20% in April. And what we've seen is those 2 sort of just come together consistently since that time. And there's lots of puts and takes to that. So if PPE comes down and we get a little bit better nonpandemic product, it helps GP, probably doesn't have any impact on SG&A, frankly. We think we can control SG&A in any environment. And one of the good things about the pandemic, and there haven't been many, is it really forces a business to focus, and I think we've really been focused on what matters. And I think that's something that we definitely need to take forward is how do we continue to focus on a few things that really matter, which helps drive results, but also helps you manage your SG&A. So we think we're going to be able to do that going forward. I can't give you a crystal ball answer as to what's going to happen with PPE because it just all depends on the timing of the virus and people's behavior, and we've never seen anything like this before.\nJohn Inch: Right. But do you have any sense, D.G., of what maybe the SG&A -- I'm sorry, Tom, what sort of SG&A headwinds you're facing kind of on a quantifiable basis? Because you do have the 1% people that are furloughed, presumably going to have to bleed back a little bit of travel and some merit increases and stuff like that. Is it too early to tell at this point? Or how are you thinking about it?\nDonald Macpherson: No. I mean we'll talk about that certainly at year-end as we talk about forward looking. We took -- we had merit increases this year. So that's not -- yes, clearly, we have costs that will come back into the business. Travel will be modest, we think, for the next 6 months, given what we're seeing with the virus. At some point, that can come back. But I think the headline for me would be, we've seen nice growth. GP has been depressed given pandemic sales has been so elevated. SG&A has been down. I think, over time, as that moderates, you get better GP and a little bit of cost back added into the business. And there's just a dynamic there that we can talk about later.\nJohn Inch: I understand.\nThomas Okray: Yes. I'm sorry, the only thing that I would reinforce is, as D.G. said, we're always going to be about SG&A efficiency and control, and we'll handle that. The upside that I see which D.G. mentioned is we're going to see the gross margin pop from as the pandemic goes down. And also, I think on the sales front, as the broader economy opens up, we're going to be well positioned to ride that wave as well. And I would have to imagine, obviously it's speculation, that there's going to be a lot of PP&E product that's going to come into those businesses opening up as well. So I see it more as a tailwind than any sort of a headwind.\nJohn Inch: D.G., just lastly, implicit in your answer on MonatoRO and monetizing MonatoRO, you indicated that Zoro is still pretty important to the Zoro business. It's intertwined and so forth. At what point can Zoro do you think stands on its own where you might strategically be in a position to say, hey, we don't need to own half of MonatoRO, the stock has done fantastic, let's take our position down to 20%, 30%, something like that or even to 0%?\nDonald Macpherson: Well, I'd say a couple of things to that. One is it's probably timing, you probably need 3 more years, given what we're projecting to get Zoro to where we would like to get it. So it's really got the connected tissue to be a really strong performer for a long time. And so that's what we're shooting for. At that point, obviously, we could do things. There's all kinds of tax implications of that, John. And so we need to think through all that at that point. For now, for the next 3 years, we're thinking of it as we need to get Zoro business performing well. We're really excited about the MonatoRO path, and we think that's the right focus for us.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from David Manthey from Baird.\nDavid Manthey: Tom, I'll have to go back and review your commentary. But when you were talking about gross margin and you said above 200, I'm confused, was that a fourth quarter statement? Or were you walking into 2021?\nThomas Okray: Fourth quarter, Dave. The way I'm looking at it is just simple math. If you look at Q3, 160 bad guy on gross margin with a 60 bps of onetime freight. So if you just take the 60 bps up, that gets you to 220. Now we assume the pandemic is going to get better as is cost inflation, so bring that down to 200 or a little bit below. But then going back to the freight surcharges we see during the holiday season, that will get us back above 200, which is the framework that we talked about in the prepared remarks for Q4. Now having said that, I mean, it's very fluid. It's hard to predict. But we're just trying to give you guys some framework for your model.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Yes. That's very helpful. And so I'll ask the question. Gross margin is obviously extremely hard to model these days. And if we're just thinking big picture moving parts from where we're lined up in 2020, which looks like, I don't know, 30 -- low 36s. If you just were thinking big picture, what are the main moving parts as we go from 2020 to 2021 that could move that up or down?\nThomas Okray: Yes. We'll have a lot more to say about that going forward. I think, though, just to give you a couple of things to think about. One would be how long is the pandemic going to last? Because obviously, the longer the pandemic lasts, the more we're going to be depressed with pandemic-related mix and the type of customers we're selling to. So that's number one. Number two, we should see a natural tailwind in terms of we will have fully lapped the tariff-related cost inflation as well as we'll probably see less spikes in terms of cost inflation related to the pandemic product. So those are the 2 big ones to think about, and both of them should be tailwinds for 2021. But again, it's premature to talk in detail. We'll have plenty of time for that later.\nDavid Manthey: Got it. That's great color. And then second, on KeepStock and these embedded solutions that you talk about making up 60% of revenues. Just to put that in context, what percentage of customers would that represent? And then recognizing that those customers obviously buy from -- via several mechanisms that you provide, could you talk about what percentage of sales are directly via the embedded solutions today?\nDonald Macpherson: Well, so let me try to take that. So most of our largest complex customers will have embedded solutions. And typically, they'll have both a KeepStock inventory management solution and EDI Pro sort of connected digital solution as well. And so the EDI Pro and KeepStock would make up over 30% of our direct revenue, I believe. Don't quote me on it, something like that. I don't have that in the numbers right in front of me, it's something like that. In terms of number of customers, obviously, our midsized customers have fewer of those solutions. They're more to buying on grainger.com. And by the way, that can be pseudo embedded, although I call it embedded because they can have -- their own they have their own pricing, they may have their own workflow on grainger.com. But typically, they wouldn't have inventory management. And so from a customer count, the number of customers will be much fewer in that 60% than those in there, but the largest complex customers will all have an embedded solution in general.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Michael McGinn from Wells Fargo.\nMichael McGinn: If I could just move to the low-touch segment. Can you talk about the sell-through rate of per site visit or any other tangible improvement for SKU recommendations, substitute or frequently packaged products and SKU count and what that's -- what's been the most impactful so far and what will be going forward?\nDonald Macpherson: Are you talking about the endless assortment business, the Zoro business?\nMichael McGinn: Yes. Yes, the endless assortment.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. Yes. So I mean, I'd say there's three things that have been really impactful. One is SKU count. So we look at the productivity of every SKU add, and we look over kind of the last 6, 7 years as we've added SKUs. We're now -- we've now hit the 5 million points. The adds we've made in the last 6 months are as productive and it looks like maybe even more productive than those that we've made in the past. So that bodes pretty well for future growth. So that's probably the most important piece of the growth. The other one is customer analytics and marketing.  So getting customers, customer acquisition. The funnel is pretty big, but then getting customers to repeat is really the key. And we're doing all kinds of things there with analytics and marketing to get that second, third, fourth order and starting to get real traction there. So those are far and away the two most important things with the endless assortment business that we track, and we're seeing progress on both of those.\nMichael McGinn: And how does it correlate to sales per site visit and what's kind of been the trend there?\nDonald Macpherson: Sales per site visit. You mean customers coming on to the website and what's the revenue per site visit?\nMichael McGinn: Yes. I guess what industry metrics are you benchmarking to within that and this assortment model? And what's been the improvement with this level of investment?\nDonald Macpherson: So we look at things at other businesses would look at. The return on ad spend, that is interesting, but not sufficient. The most important thing is looking at customer value. And so looking at customer acquisition and the customer lifetime value. And so we look at new customer acquisition rates, repeat rates, and we link all that to a customer value model to understand the NPV of each customer ad. And so that's what we track all the time.\nMichael McGinn: Got it. All right. On my second question, CapEx. Is there a normalized level of CapEx that you would be targeting in the out years as you transition less from branches more to endless assortment? Is there -- I mean, it looks like you're trending pretty well this year. Just wondering if there's -- if you underspent this year and there's a catch-up into next year or beyond?\nThomas Okray: Yes. I don't...\nDonald Macpherson: Go ahead, Tom.\nThomas Okray: Yes. I don't think there's going to be any big catch-up. I mean, if you -- even if you look at, we spent roughly $60 million in the quarter, which was similar to last year. When the pandemic first hit, we tightened our belts a little bit and deferred some things. But given the confidence that we've had in the cash generation, we're back to normal spend levels. So I don't see any big wave coming in future years that would be anything out of the ordinary.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: My question was just in the other segment, if you take out the endless assortment business, are those other businesses losing money today? Or are they profitable? And then is the endless assortment business now over 10% of revenue, where you have to sort of resegment that? Or is that not the right way to look at that?\nDonald Macpherson: So on your second question, we are evaluating the need to think about any segmentation, and we'll talk about that and our position on that at the end of the year -- or with next year. So we are evaluating that, and we work with our auditors to make sure we understand requirements. So that's still to come. So there's different types of businesses that are in other when you take out endless assortment, but there's not a lot of them. So there's Mexico, that's profitable. There's Puerto Rico, that's profitable. And there's Cromwell, Cromwell is unprofitable now, but having a pretty good year in terms of customer service and experience, and they're losing less money this year than last. So in total, I believe those would be slightly unprofitable, but 2 of them are profitable and 1 is not and working on that one.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Justin Bergner from G. Research.\nJustin Bergner: Quick clarification question, then a more open-ended question. The medium-sized customer growth going from negative 6% to 6%, how much of that related to those businesses sort of being closed in the second quarter or being unable to get pandemic-related product and then sort of catching up in the third quarter?\nDonald Macpherson: So there are two things going on. One is some of those businesses were more impacted and may have been closed. I think the bigger issue was in the heat of the pandemic in April, May, in particular, given the way product supply happened for pandemic products and the customers we needed to funnel that product to, we didn't have product available for those customers. And in the summer, we relaxed that constraint as pandemic products became more available and we were able to open that up to that customer base. And so we've seen very strong growth since that happened. And I think that's probably the bigger issue is just being able to release the product for midsized customers, and we've seen nice growth as result.\nJustin Bergner: Great. And then the open-ended question. Looking at it from a sort of customer grouping point of view, Grainger showed nice acceleration in the government and the retail channels. Maybe you could just sort of talk about anything unusual or potentially recurring that is going to sustain that trend and maybe in the context of just general outgrowth levers that may be materializing anew as you look towards the end of this year and into 2021?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I think it's important to understand what retail is. Retail is mostly distribution centers that go direct to customer. We don't do a lot of sort of walk-in retail business. We're more sort of the distribution centers that obviously have more safety needs and other needs. So that has obviously been growing as an industry as the pandemic has happened. And so we've been there supporting our customers through that. So that is a trend that we believe will continue as we move forward. What was the other -- I'm sorry, what was the other segment you mentioned?\nJustin Bergner: Government accelerating, which would sort of be surprising in light of pandemic sales being decelerating.\nDonald Macpherson: Well, yes, the government sales have been strong, and a lot of that has been pandemic as governments try to find product to support their communities during this time. And so that's a lot of state government business. Military has been okay as well for federal. But certainly, state governments have been very, very busy as each of them has tried to fight the pandemic, and we've been there trying to help as much as possible.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Patrick Baumann from JPMorgan.\nPatrick Baumann: I just have a couple of quick ones here. [Technical Difficulty] just wondering if there's a way for you to quantify the amount of revenue from pandemic that could be a headwind to next year. It sounds like you still expect pretty good share gains and you said 300 to 400 basis points. But I just wanted to check to see if there's any major issues on that front in terms of the pandemic sales into next year.\nDonald Macpherson: Well, I think we're definitely going to talk about that in January with our results, like I said before. Right now, and as we head into the winter, given what we're seeing with case counts, we expect pandemic sales to be elevated through the fall and into the winter. That would be our expectation. We will reevaluate as we go forward to really understand what the puts and takes are. But if pandemic sales go down, we think nonpandemic sales will go up because that would mean the pandemic isn't as much of a problem. And again, that helps our gross profit when that happens and probably overall profitability rates. So we don't really know. I think it's impossible to tell what's going to happen with pandemic products. At some point, it will be a headwind, but other things then won't be a headwind, and that's our expectation.\nPatrick Baumann: Yes. Makes sense. And then last one real quick on Zoro. Are the added SKUs year-to-date, is that all third-party related? And since you're skewing mix more in that direction, I just want to check and see if there are any big differences in how you report the revenue or the margin or the type of margin you get when you ship third-party versus Grainger owned inventory.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So a lot of the new product adds are third party, some are through the Grainger supply chain. Third-party items tend to be lower SG&A and slightly lower margin -- gross margin. But most of the time, we're working with high-quality companies that have very good fulfillment capabilities. And so that's one of our important sorts as we develop partners that actually add to our assortment. So it's really no difference in how we report it, but it is going to be a bigger factor for us going forward. We're going to continue to add third-party shippers, and that's a big part of what we're doing.\nThomas Okray: Yes. The only thing I would add, Patrick, is the accounting difference is whether you're an agent or not when you're doing third party, but that's a minor nuance. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.\nDonald Macpherson: All right. So this is D.G. So thanks, everyone, for joining us. Really appreciate it. We feel good about our results in the quarter. We feel really good about our forward prospects. Obviously, there's a ton of uncertainty in terms of how the market is going to evolve. And probably more than anybody, we'd like for the pandemic to be behind us, but we know it's not. And so we're going to make sure we continue to support our customers through this. That's the first and most important thing we're going to do. And we're going to make sure we take care of our team members, and we're going to make sure we do things that are prudent, both for the current performance of the business but for long term. And we feel like we're taking the right actions and in really good position to succeed both during the pandemic and beyond. So thanks for joining us today, and hope you all stay safe.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Donald Macpherson",
            "content": "Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Market conditions remained challenging in the third quarter as the pandemic conditions improved but continued to weigh on many of our customers. Amidst these challenges, Grainger performed well, continuing to demonstrate our resilience and strength. I'm so proud of how Grainger team members have responded to the challenges of 2020, staying relentlessly focused on further deepening relationships with our customers and supporting each other.  I've shared with you our Grainger edge framework, which includes our purpose, aspiration, strategy and the principles that define the behaviors we expect from all team members. These principles, including starting with the customer, acting with intent and competing with urgency, provide clarity and focus as we continue to execute on our purpose to keep the world working. And we'll continue to leverage the Grainger edge in all that we do throughout this pandemic and beyond.  So let me start off with a brief business update and an overview of our third quarter performance before turning it over to Tom to dive into the details. On the business side, we continue to serve our customers well to support the needs and safety of our team members and ensure we remain in a strong financial position. A quick update on each point. Grainger has operated effectively throughout the pandemic, first in support of essential businesses and now in serving all businesses. Each of our customers has a unique story on how they have been impacted by and managed through the pandemic. We have been there for all of them. Sales to health care, government and e-commerce businesses remained strong in the quarter, and we saw improving trends with manufacturing and commercial customers. I'll address the pattern of revenue in a moment.  Our world-class integrated supply chain organization, which supports both our North American high-touch businesses and our Zoro endless assortment platform, has helped find and secure products to meet customer demand. We have successfully worked down our backlog of orders for most pandemic-related products, including masks, and continue to work with suppliers to catch up on a few categories that remain scarce, including some gloves and hand sanitizers. The team remains laser-focused on maintaining our high level of customer service. Customer feedback has been strong and improving throughout the pandemic.  For our team members, we continue to take steps to support not only their safety but their overall well-being during this uncertain time. To date, we have managed the challenges of 2020 without major layoffs and currently have roughly 1% of our workforce still on furlough. Importantly, we've maintained a strong financial position. We've been diligent in controlling costs while balancing the need to continue to serve our customers, support our team members and invest where it matters most. Our strong performance over the last 2 quarters, together with our solid cost containment, have enabled us to relax a number of our short-term cash preservation actions. We exited the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in available liquidity.  We continue to make strong progress on our strategic growth priorities during the short-term uncertainty. We have continued to execute our transform merchandising process to drive significant user experience improvements to grainger.com, including our search and visualization capabilities and enriched product descriptions and content. By the end of 2020, we expect to have remerchandised $2.8 billion in product through this new process, including $1.6 billion in the year alone. We intend to further accelerate these efforts moving forward as a result of our new product information management system that launched in the third quarter. Customer feedback on our website has improved significantly over the past 6 quarters.  Marketing has been a large contributor of our U.S. share gain over the last few years. We have improved effectiveness in both media advertising and paid search and plan to further invest in marketing given these strong returns. We continue to deepen relationships with our customers to our large customer multisite growth initiative, enhancements to our KeepStock offering and improvements to our sales strategy and effectiveness. We know that when we embed one or more of our service offerings with our customers, we foster deeper and longer-lasting relationships. Over 60% of our U.S. revenue is generated from customers with one or more embedded solution.  And lastly, within our endless assortment model, we are executing the successful MonatoRO playbook at Zoro here in the U.S. and are making strides in marketing effectiveness, customer analytics and SKU additions. This year alone, we have added 1.5 million SKUs to Zoro, pushing its assortment to roughly 5 million products.  Turning to our quarterly performance. We produced strong operating results in the third quarter. Organic daily sales finished up 4.6% in the quarter, underpinned by growth in our U.S. high-touch business and continued impressive performance of our endless assortment model. In the U.S., we realized strong outgrowth to the broader MRO market as a whole, which was down 5% to 6% in the quarter. Our gains were supported by pandemic-related demand, sales to new customers and improved sales of nonpandemic product as we started to see some stabilizing trends in underlying business activity. Overall business activity still trails pre-pandemic levels as some customers remain disrupted by COVID.  The endless assortment model continues to deliver with 20% growth in the third quarter, while also generating meaningfully improved margins. We remain very excited about the future of this business as we continue to adopt learnings from MonatoRO to drive growth and profitability. At the total company level, we expanded adjusted operating margins by 90 basis points as gross margin stabilized sequentially and we demonstrated strong cost control. Tom will detail this in a bit. The business continues to produce a durable cash flow stream with operating cash flow of $311 million and free cash flow of $252 million.  Looking at Slide 6, I thought it would be important to again show this chart to highlight the underlying trends with pandemic and nonpandemic products based on our current categorization of SKUs. Our characterization goes beyond traditional safety products to include product categories with substantial volume increases during the pandemic. Flexiglass barriers will be an example. As you can see, while sales of pandemic-related products have decreased since May, continued demand for key products, including masks, gloves and cleaning supplies, has kept pandemic sales elevated year-over-year. This heightened demand has continued to come from a multitude of new and existing customers across numerous industries as businesses reopen and adjust to the new operating protocols.  On the nonpandemic side, sales have improved since bottoming out in April, with nonpandemic sales now down about 7% year-over-year. This improvement has been seen across most industries with some of the obvious industries remaining the furthest below their pre-pandemic levels. These include airlines, hotels and cruise lines. Based on month-to-date performance, we forecast October sales to finish up around 2% for the U.S. segment on continued trends in pandemic and nonpandemic performance.  Predicting the recovery over the next few quarters is very challenging. The path of the virus will have a big impact on whether the recent improvements continue, level off or reverse, but we feel well positioned to compete in any environment that comes our way.  With that, I will turn it over to Tom to talk us through the quarter's results in detail. Tom? Thanks, Tom. So I'm proud of our results for the quarter, and I want to thank our team members for their commitment to safety and customer service.  We have gained share, improved our merchandising and marketing capabilities, deepened our customer relationships, expanded our assortment while improving margins at Zoro and have significant financial flexibility to support the business moving forward. We remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of keeping the world working throughout this pandemic as well as continuing to execute our strategy, so we can achieve this purpose for years to come.  And with that, we will open up the line for questions. Great. Thanks, Chris. So yes, so we've had -- as you might guess, given inventory positions, we have had a whole bunch of new customers sample Grainger and Zoro and MonatoRO, frankly, as we've had elevated customer acquisitions through this period. The good news is that those who have repeated, the number is much higher than in the past. The repeat rates are similar to the past, but we have a much bigger funnel, and we're starting to get those customers to be regular purchasing customers. So we've seen really nice, attractive customer acquisition through this period, and we think that really helps bode well for the future. We feel very confident in our 300 to 400 basis point outgrowth in the U.S. business and the 20% growth expectations for the endless assortment, and we have no reason to change those right now. This year, we've obviously been higher than that number in the U.S. We would expect to be in that range and shoot for higher, but be in that range moving forward. I think that's a very interesting question, and I don't think anybody has the answer. What we're seeing right now is elevated pandemic sales. We expect that to continue. And certainly, as case rates rise, which we've seen recently, we would expect that to continue through the fall. What happens when we have better treatments and a vaccine is probably a question that is all in our minds, and it's probably impossible to answer. We would expect some of that to moderate, but we do think people are going to be more conscious of safety and cleanliness for some period after that as well. But for now, we're seeing similar trends to what we've seen in the past. We would expect that to continue in the fall, given the rate of transmission. Sure. So we had a very heavy investment period in the back half of '18 and '19 with Zoro. Many of those -- those investments took several forms. One was technology. Another was people in getting the talent to be able to have their own destiny in terms of product adds and the like. And so we made those investments. Those investments are behind us. We start to see those -- starting to see those leverage themselves now. This year, we're getting improved operating margins in Zoro. We think the long-term path for Zoro from a margin perspective is as we've discussed. We'll talk about next year in January, but we have no reason to believe the positivity that we've seen won't continue, and we still think that is going to be a high single-digit operating margin business in the next several years. And so that's the path for that business. Tom, do you want to take that? So I would say that it's a great question. Most customers -- our largest customers and contract customers often don't pay for parcel. They often pay for LTL or large shipments. The surcharge that Tom was referring to is really around large packages during the peak season, and we will charge for some of that. We expect to recoup some of that. We don't expect to recoup all of that. And that doesn't have much to do with what happens into next year. So we'll talk about next year, obviously, after this quarter. I would say, certainly, the freight business, given the number of shipments going to people's houses, has become strained, and we've seen some pressure. That does not mean though that the surcharges that happened in the fall necessarily translate going forward, and so we'll talk about that. And we think we've got initiatives and actions to help mitigate that moving forward, but we'll talk about that at the end of the year. Yes. So let me take those. And Tom, you can add to them if you think I miss anything. So in terms of inventory, there's really 2 areas where we've built inventory, and we'll continue to do so through the latter part of the year. The first one is sort of normal, which is we are starting the Louisville DC full up in 2021. And so as that comes on, we obviously stock that building. That's partially stocked now, but becomes more fully stocked as we go through, and that's a part of what you've seen. The other part is pre-buys for pandemic-related product. I would say to your question about do we have risk on excess obsolescence with that product, part of what you see in terms of -- with us in terms of pandemic GP already embeds some write-downs.  We obviously, to make sure we could serve our customers, took positions at a whole bunch of products in the height of the pandemic. And some of those, the price/cost has changed. Some of those, we haven't seen movement. In a lot of those, we've seen movement, and it's gone very well. But in that messiness to serve customers, which we think has been really, really important, you're already seeing that in some of the GP rates that you're seeing is us take that. We think that we're in good position. Most of the inventory build, to be clear, has been pre-buys on product that has very low risk. We know suppliers, we know product, we know product that will sell in any case, but trying to get out ahead of that in case the fall and the winter is really, really bad. And so most of that is not higher risk than normal. But certainly, in some of the speculative buys and things we took in the heart of the pandemic, you've already seen some of that come through in terms of GP. I mean, Tom, I would just add. I mean, if you look at incremental margins with MonatoRO, typically, you're talking about a 15% to 20%, which is just GP minus the variable marketing cost. And so I would expect us to get to something like that over time at Zoro. But that's typically what we see in MonatoRO, I think. So we view both the endless assortment and the high-touch solutions model as absolutely core to what we do. Masaya Suzuki, who's the leader of that business now, also leads Zoro. We are sharing best practices and analytics and working together to ensure that we're actually making progress across those 2 businesses and our Zoro business in the U.K. as well. So we view it as absolutely core to what we do right now. And we're getting a whole lot of leverage from that MonatoRO team in terms of learnings and building the business in Zoro for the future. So we are running those very, very tightly together at this point. I think, Deane, if you looked at sales revenue performance July, August, September, October, you'd be hard pressed to see much of a difference across those months. We've seen a little tail off in pandemic and a little improvement in nonpandemic. But pretty much, the trend has been very, very similar across all of those months. So the trends we've seen and the performance we saw in the second quarter really just appears to be -- in the third quarter appears to be continuing in October at this point. Tom, do you want to take that one? Well, yes, I would say we've certainly seen more digital sales through the pandemic. I think we've seen that in almost every industry and ours has been no different. What I would say is that we are seeing improvements in midsize customer growth from digital actions but also from inside sales actions. So that is more of a touch, but we're seeing nice growth across both of those contact points. And so yes, I would say it's fair to characterize as more digital, but not all digital. We're also seeing some nice growth through some of our other actions that are more high touch. Yes. So one of the things that I would say that's muddled the pandemic a little bit in terms of results has been with so many people working from home, sometimes, the business and the consumer tends to blur. I've listened to a bunch of contact center calls. And it's fascinating that there's a lot of people at home may be buying things for businesses, but also sometimes delivering to their home. And so we think we've had more consumer acquisition than normal. We don't remarket to consumers, whether in Zoro or Grainger. And what we do know is that the business customer acquisition has been very solid, very strong. And the attractiveness of those customers has been every bit as strong as we've seen in the past. So we're happy with -- besides having to sort of sift through consumer business, the business, the [indiscernible] business has been very strong, and that's been that sort of key for us. He's not the target segment, I can assure you that. Well, I think there's a lot in that question, John. I would say that we -- it's hard -- it's really difficult to project the PPE trend. What we've seen since April, in April, we saw PPE up almost 100% pandemic product, what we call pandemic that includes more than PPE. We saw sort of normal volumes down 20% in April. And what we've seen is those 2 sort of just come together consistently since that time. And there's lots of puts and takes to that. So if PPE comes down and we get a little bit better nonpandemic product, it helps GP, probably doesn't have any impact on SG&A, frankly. We think we can control SG&A in any environment. And one of the good things about the pandemic, and there haven't been many, is it really forces a business to focus, and I think we've really been focused on what matters. And I think that's something that we definitely need to take forward is how do we continue to focus on a few things that really matter, which helps drive results, but also helps you manage your SG&A. So we think we're going to be able to do that going forward. I can't give you a crystal ball answer as to what's going to happen with PPE because it just all depends on the timing of the virus and people's behavior, and we've never seen anything like this before. No. I mean we'll talk about that certainly at year-end as we talk about forward looking. We took -- we had merit increases this year. So that's not -- yes, clearly, we have costs that will come back into the business. Travel will be modest, we think, for the next 6 months, given what we're seeing with the virus. At some point, that can come back. But I think the headline for me would be, we've seen nice growth. GP has been depressed given pandemic sales has been so elevated. SG&A has been down. I think, over time, as that moderates, you get better GP and a little bit of cost back added into the business. And there's just a dynamic there that we can talk about later. Well, I'd say a couple of things to that. One is it's probably timing, you probably need 3 more years, given what we're projecting to get Zoro to where we would like to get it. So it's really got the connected tissue to be a really strong performer for a long time. And so that's what we're shooting for. At that point, obviously, we could do things. There's all kinds of tax implications of that, John. And so we need to think through all that at that point. For now, for the next 3 years, we're thinking of it as we need to get Zoro business performing well. We're really excited about the MonatoRO path, and we think that's the right focus for us. Well, so let me try to take that. So most of our largest complex customers will have embedded solutions. And typically, they'll have both a KeepStock inventory management solution and EDI Pro sort of connected digital solution as well. And so the EDI Pro and KeepStock would make up over 30% of our direct revenue, I believe. Don't quote me on it, something like that. I don't have that in the numbers right in front of me, it's something like that. In terms of number of customers, obviously, our midsized customers have fewer of those solutions. They're more to buying on grainger.com. And by the way, that can be pseudo embedded, although I call it embedded because they can have -- their own they have their own pricing, they may have their own workflow on grainger.com. But typically, they wouldn't have inventory management. And so from a customer count, the number of customers will be much fewer in that 60% than those in there, but the largest complex customers will all have an embedded solution in general. Are you talking about the endless assortment business, the Zoro business? Yes. Yes. So I mean, I'd say there's three things that have been really impactful. One is SKU count. So we look at the productivity of every SKU add, and we look over kind of the last 6, 7 years as we've added SKUs. We're now -- we've now hit the 5 million points. The adds we've made in the last 6 months are as productive and it looks like maybe even more productive than those that we've made in the past. So that bodes pretty well for future growth. So that's probably the most important piece of the growth. The other one is customer analytics and marketing.  So getting customers, customer acquisition. The funnel is pretty big, but then getting customers to repeat is really the key. And we're doing all kinds of things there with analytics and marketing to get that second, third, fourth order and starting to get real traction there. So those are far and away the two most important things with the endless assortment business that we track, and we're seeing progress on both of those. Sales per site visit. You mean customers coming on to the website and what's the revenue per site visit? So we look at things at other businesses would look at. The return on ad spend, that is interesting, but not sufficient. The most important thing is looking at customer value. And so looking at customer acquisition and the customer lifetime value. And so we look at new customer acquisition rates, repeat rates, and we link all that to a customer value model to understand the NPV of each customer ad. And so that's what we track all the time. Go ahead, Tom. So on your second question, we are evaluating the need to think about any segmentation, and we'll talk about that and our position on that at the end of the year -- or with next year. So we are evaluating that, and we work with our auditors to make sure we understand requirements. So that's still to come. So there's different types of businesses that are in other when you take out endless assortment, but there's not a lot of them. So there's Mexico, that's profitable. There's Puerto Rico, that's profitable. And there's Cromwell, Cromwell is unprofitable now, but having a pretty good year in terms of customer service and experience, and they're losing less money this year than last. So in total, I believe those would be slightly unprofitable, but 2 of them are profitable and 1 is not and working on that one. So there are two things going on. One is some of those businesses were more impacted and may have been closed. I think the bigger issue was in the heat of the pandemic in April, May, in particular, given the way product supply happened for pandemic products and the customers we needed to funnel that product to, we didn't have product available for those customers. And in the summer, we relaxed that constraint as pandemic products became more available and we were able to open that up to that customer base. And so we've seen very strong growth since that happened. And I think that's probably the bigger issue is just being able to release the product for midsized customers, and we've seen nice growth as result. Yes. I think it's important to understand what retail is. Retail is mostly distribution centers that go direct to customer. We don't do a lot of sort of walk-in retail business. We're more sort of the distribution centers that obviously have more safety needs and other needs. So that has obviously been growing as an industry as the pandemic has happened. And so we've been there supporting our customers through that. So that is a trend that we believe will continue as we move forward. What was the other -- I'm sorry, what was the other segment you mentioned? Well, yes, the government sales have been strong, and a lot of that has been pandemic as governments try to find product to support their communities during this time. And so that's a lot of state government business. Military has been okay as well for federal. But certainly, state governments have been very, very busy as each of them has tried to fight the pandemic, and we've been there trying to help as much as possible. Well, I think we're definitely going to talk about that in January with our results, like I said before. Right now, and as we head into the winter, given what we're seeing with case counts, we expect pandemic sales to be elevated through the fall and into the winter. That would be our expectation. We will reevaluate as we go forward to really understand what the puts and takes are. But if pandemic sales go down, we think nonpandemic sales will go up because that would mean the pandemic isn't as much of a problem. And again, that helps our gross profit when that happens and probably overall profitability rates. So we don't really know. I think it's impossible to tell what's going to happen with pandemic products. At some point, it will be a headwind, but other things then won't be a headwind, and that's our expectation. Yes. So a lot of the new product adds are third party, some are through the Grainger supply chain. Third-party items tend to be lower SG&A and slightly lower margin -- gross margin. But most of the time, we're working with high-quality companies that have very good fulfillment capabilities. And so that's one of our important sorts as we develop partners that actually add to our assortment. So it's really no difference in how we report it, but it is going to be a bigger factor for us going forward. We're going to continue to add third-party shippers, and that's a big part of what we're doing. All right. So this is D.G. So thanks, everyone, for joining us. Really appreciate it. We feel good about our results in the quarter. We feel really good about our forward prospects. Obviously, there's a ton of uncertainty in terms of how the market is going to evolve. And probably more than anybody, we'd like for the pandemic to be behind us, but we know it's not. And so we're going to make sure we continue to support our customers through this. That's the first and most important thing we're going to do. And we're going to make sure we take care of our team members, and we're going to make sure we do things that are prudent, both for the current performance of the business but for long term. And we feel like we're taking the right actions and in really good position to succeed both during the pandemic and beyond. So thanks for joining us today, and hope you all stay safe."

            "content": "Thanks, D.G. Starting on Slide 8, you can see we delivered strong results in the quarter. Organic daily sales, which adjust for the divestitures of Fabory in China, were up 4.6% on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by share gains in our U.S. segment and continued impressive growth in our endless assortment business, which was up over 20% in the quarter. These gains more than offset pandemic-related softness in our Canada and Cromwell businesses, where we saw meaningfully higher sales sequentially but still remain well below pre-pandemic levels.  Gross margin for the total company was down 170 basis points versus the prior year quarter, but represented a 120 basis point improvement from the second quarter year-over-year decline. Margin pressure continues to be driven by pandemic-related headwinds, primarily in our U.S. segment as well as continued unit -- business unit mix impact as we experienced significant growth in our endless assortment business.  Our SG&A came in at $700 million in the third quarter, better than our communicated range of $715 million to $730 million. SG&A cost was down $60 million year-over-year, and we captured 260 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period. This result stems from prudent cost reduction actions across our high-touch solutions model, including cost -- lower costs as a result of our Fabory divestiture and leverage gains with our endless assortment business. This SG&A performance more than overcame GP headwinds to drive a 90 basis point improvement in total company operating margins for the quarter, a tremendous result in this environment. Incremental margins were up 50% in the quarter. As mentioned last quarter, the utility of the incremental and decremental margin calculation is diminished in this uncertain environment as the metric can vary significantly given the magnitude of top line swings from quarter-to-quarter.  We generated operating cash flow of $311 million, which we used to continue to invest in the business, build appropriate inventory to support our customers and return capital to shareholders. Operating cash flow was 126% of net adjusted earnings, and year-to-date adjusted return on invested capital is over 29%. Given our solid results of the last couple of quarters, combined with stabilizing trends in underlying business activity, we fully repaid our revolving credit facility, increased our dividend payment and are announcing today our intent to restart our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. While we anticipate putting several hundred million dollars to work on repurchases in Q4, we will monitor market conditions and optimize the amount accordingly. The favorable trends over the last several months give us confidence that this is the right time to move forward with these actions.  Turning to our U.S. segment. Daily sales increased 3.1% in the quarter, driven primarily by volume, which is net of unfavorable product mix. On the product side, sales of pandemic-related products remained elevated, up 53% in the quarter, but as shown earlier, have tapered off from the peak in March. Nonpandemic products were down around 8% in the quarter, but continued to show meaningful improvement from April lows. We've also seen a significant uptick in new customer acquisitions with some really encouraging signs of repeat buying. From a customer perspective, we saw improved growth with both large and midsized customers, with the latter growing 6% in the quarter, an improvement from the 6% decline year-over-year we saw in Q2 2020.  Gross margins of 36.4% was down 160 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019, but improved sequentially from the 310 basis point year-over-year decline we saw in the second quarter of 2020. The unfavorable variance in gross margin was driven by -- mainly by 2 factors that were similar to the second quarter, pandemic-related product headwinds and tariff-fueled cost inflation. Pandemic-related headwinds contributed about 140 basis points of the gross margin decline as we continue to see unfavorable product and customer mix due to elevated sales of lower-margin pandemic product.  Beyond the pandemic impact, we continue to face pressure in the quarter due to the lapping of year-over-year cost inflation, which was driven partially by tariffs that went into effect in 2019. This drove approximately 80 basis points of year-over-year margin decline. Based on what we know now, we expect that both of these gross margin headwinds will continue into the fourth quarter. It should be noted that we anticipate the tariff headwinds will fully subside as we move into 2021. Offsetting these two factors in the quarter was a 60 basis points tailwind related to favorable freight costs driven by nonrecurring shipping efficiencies and timing. We do not expect these freight dynamics to continue in the fourth quarter.  From an SG&A perspective, we gained 160 basis points of leverage with cost decreasing approximately $22 million year-over-year. The reduction was driven primarily by decreased travel expenses, lower labor-related costs and general operating efficiencies. Operating margin remained flat to the prior year quarter at 15.1% as SG&A leverage offset gross margin headwinds. Return on invested capital was a very healthy 38%.  Drilling into our U.S. sales performance on Slide 10. While we estimate the U.S. MRO market declined between 5% and 6% in the third quarter, Grainger was able to capture roughly 850 basis points of outgrowth, fueled by pandemic-related sales, selling to new customers and improving sales of nonpandemic product. Despite the challenges of 2020, U.S. segment daily sales are up 2.1% year-to-date, and we have outgained the broader MRO market by over 900 basis points through the first 9 months of 2020.  Moving to our Other Businesses. Organic daily sales increased 12.5% or 12.3% on a constant currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at approximately 20%, fueled by strong results at both MonatoRO and Zoro during the quarter. Zoro continues to execute the MonatoRO playbook with improvements to marketing effectiveness, discounting strategies and better cost leverage, all helping to drive improved performance. Although we saw significant sequential improvement compared to the second quarter, our international high-touch businesses continue to be impacted by pandemic-related shutdowns with both Mexico and Cromwell seeing year-over-year declines.  Operating margins for Other Businesses are up 190 basis points, 35 basis points which is due to the divestiture of our Fabory and China businesses, which produced below system average profitability in the prior year. The remaining operating margin favorability was driven by significant SG&A leverage across the portfolio, most notably within our endless assortment business, which continues to do a nice job levering its cost base. This leverage was only partially offset by gross profit headwinds from incremental freight costs at MonatoRO  Turning to Slide 12. In Canada, daily sales decreased 9.9% or 9.1% in constant currency. The decline is comprised of roughly 8% decline in volume and price headwinds, including customer mix of approximately 1%. While volumes in Canada continued to be impacted by the pandemic-driven economic slowdown, the business did improve sequentially and is gaining traction with hospitals, manufacturing and higher-education customers. As the Canadian business continues to integrate and leverage our U.S. resources, we are making progress with our customer diversification efforts and are pleased with the trajectory of this business going forward.  Gross profit margin at Grainger Canada declined 35 basis points year-over-year, driven by pandemic-related mix headwinds, which were offset partially by lower freight costs in the quarter. Cost management remains strong with savings of $5 million year-over-year, resulting in 110 basis points of SG&A leverage. Total operating margins were up 75 basis points versus prior year despite the top line challenges.  Before I turn it back to D.G., similar to the last couple of quarters, I want to give you a sense of how we're thinking about things in the fourth quarter. From a sales perspective, month-to-date trends support our estimate for October year-over-year sales growth to be up over 4% at the total company level on an organic constant currency basis. This October month end estimate is reflective of continued solid growth in our U.S. segment, coupled with strong performance in endless assortment.  From a gross margin perspective, as I previously mentioned, we anticipate gross margin pressure will continue as the pandemic-related impacts and tariff-fueled cost inflation headwinds will persist into the fourth quarter. The onetime freight tailwind we realized in the third quarter will fall off. Further, we anticipate year-over-year cost headwinds in the fourth quarter as the already stretched global shipping providers pass through freight surcharges during the busy holiday season. Given these factors and based on what we are currently seeing, we anticipate gross margins will be down over 200 basis points year-over-year.  With respect to SG&A, we expect to see sequential increases in a couple of areas, primarily related to some incremental technology investments to support growth in the U.S. and at MonatoRO, which will push our estimated SG&A to between $725 million to $740 million for the fourth quarter. As always, we remain focused on managing near-term headwinds while continuing to invest in long-term growth, particularly in people, processes and technology where and when it makes sense.  With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some final thoughts. Yes. Thanks. Yes, sure. Thanks, Chris. First of all, there was a little bit that was win dated just with the Fabory divestiture, and that takes the $60 million down to about $40 million. But then we just had real good efficiency across the board. Everything from travel and entertainment, professional services, cleaning supply, security, just a real good focus by the team in terms of efficiency and cost control. And one of the great things with the pandemic is we've always been cost conscious, but I think we've really upped our game. And I think it's going to continue going forward where we're really in this mode of operating this way. So just to summarize, really good cost control across the board while continuing to spend in advertising and technology, which are important for us. Yes. And just to add a little bit more color on inventory and cash. One of the things that we've been very efficient on is our management of cash, and you've seen that in this quarter. More specifically, our cash conversion cycle, our DSO is actually down year-over-year a couple of days. And our DPO is actually favorable by more than a few days, which has allowed us to keep an overall cash conversion cycle that is very healthy versus last year and invest in the inventory. So we can play our role as an essential business and support the customers the way we need to. So you're right. Inventory is up since the beginning of the year, 8% at $1.78 billion. We've invested in working capital. It's up $220 million. And we did put pandemic inventory spend in the quarter of approximately $300 million. And as D.G. said, I mean, you're not going to bat 1,000 on all of that. So we go through the normal E&O process. And I guess the way I would describe it is we're very aggressive operationally, but very conservative financially. So doing the right thing to reserve. So thanks for the question. Yes. It's a good question. We really don't look at incremental margins specifically on the endless assortment business just because the supply chain is so intertwined in the synergies with the broader business. So we really look at the business as the incremental margin for the overall entity. Yes. I think the way to look at it, Deane, is we said the pandemic impact is 140 basis points for this quarter, and the cost other is 80 basis point unfavorable bad guy, and we had the onetime freight of 60. So if you remove the 60 from the 140 and the 80, you get to 220. Now we think that the pandemic will likely improve. Obviously, it's very volatile. Say you get roughly a 20% improvement on your cost inflation as well as your pandemic, that gets you to around 200-ish. And then you throw in the freight headwinds that we think we might experience at the end of the year, as D.G. discussed, with the surcharges, and that gets you above 200. I think another way to look at it is our absolute gross margin should be very similar to Q3. And then when you just look at the comparison to prior year, it's going to bump it over 200. So that's the other way I would look at it. Yes. I think the only thing that I would say, and then, D.G., please add, is we're probably seeing more B2C customers than B2B customers in the pandemic. But other than that, nothing out of the ordinary. It's playing into it a little bit. As we said on the previous question, we've been very aggressively operationally from an inventory perspective because it's the right thing to do, and we want to have the product available for our customers. But on the other hand, we've been conservative financially. So part of the gross margin deterioration that you've seen in Q3 is an E&O headwind, cleaning up some of the buys that didn't exactly thread the needle. So we've tried to do most of that in Q3. We'll see a little bit in Q4 as well. And then we believe that that's going to be behind us going into 2021, we'll have the right product to serve our customer. And then if anything, we'll have a tailwind as we unwind some of those reserves when the products that we have reserved potentially will be available for sale. Yes. I'm sorry, the only thing that I would reinforce is, as D.G. said, we're always going to be about SG&A efficiency and control, and we'll handle that. The upside that I see which D.G. mentioned is we're going to see the gross margin pop from as the pandemic goes down. And also, I think on the sales front, as the broader economy opens up, we're going to be well positioned to ride that wave as well. And I would have to imagine, obviously it's speculation, that there's going to be a lot of PP&E product that's going to come into those businesses opening up as well. So I see it more as a tailwind than any sort of a headwind. Fourth quarter, Dave. The way I'm looking at it is just simple math. If you look at Q3, 160 bad guy on gross margin with a 60 bps of onetime freight. So if you just take the 60 bps up, that gets you to 220. Now we assume the pandemic is going to get better as is cost inflation, so bring that down to 200 or a little bit below. But then going back to the freight surcharges we see during the holiday season, that will get us back above 200, which is the framework that we talked about in the prepared remarks for Q4. Now having said that, I mean, it's very fluid. It's hard to predict. But we're just trying to give you guys some framework for your model. Yes. We'll have a lot more to say about that going forward. I think, though, just to give you a couple of things to think about. One would be how long is the pandemic going to last? Because obviously, the longer the pandemic lasts, the more we're going to be depressed with pandemic-related mix and the type of customers we're selling to. So that's number one. Number two, we should see a natural tailwind in terms of we will have fully lapped the tariff-related cost inflation as well as we'll probably see less spikes in terms of cost inflation related to the pandemic product. So those are the 2 big ones to think about, and both of them should be tailwinds for 2021. But again, it's premature to talk in detail. We'll have plenty of time for that later. Yes. I don't... Yes. I don't think there's going to be any big catch-up. I mean, if you -- even if you look at, we spent roughly $60 million in the quarter, which was similar to last year. When the pandemic first hit, we tightened our belts a little bit and deferred some things. But given the confidence that we've had in the cash generation, we're back to normal spend levels. So I don't see any big wave coming in future years that would be anything out of the ordinary. Yes. The only thing I would add, Patrick, is the accounting difference is whether you're an agent or not when you're doing third party, but that's a minor nuance. So thanks for the question."

Welcome to Grainger\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, SVP and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures and their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q2 press release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning\u2019s call will focus on adjusted results for the second quarter of 2020, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings press release. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to D.G.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. To say that this quarter was different and challenging would be an understatement. I am very proud of how our leadership and team members have stepped up to the challenge. Whether dealing with the pandemic or with social injustice issues, our team has been fantastic throughout this uncertain time. Let me start off by providing you with an update on our pandemic response and a brief overview of the quarter before turning it over to Tom to dive into the details. So starting with an update on the pandemic, the Grainger team continues to work tirelessly to keep the world working during this challenging time. As I outlined on our first quarter call, Grainger is an essential business, and our customers count on us to keep their businesses up and running. Our pandemic response is wrapped in three broad priorities: First, serve our customers well through this challenging time; second, support the needs and safety of our team members; and third, ensure we remain in a strong financial position. I\u2019ll provide a quick update on each point. First, our businesses remained open every day to serve our customers. I visited one of our DCs last week, and we have implemented several measures to protect the safety of team members and to ensure the continuity of our operations. We also recently reopened our branch showrooms to add to the curbside pickup service we have been operating throughout the pandemic. Our KeepStock team members continue to serve the vast majority of our customers. The exception would be some disruptive businesses where we\u2019ve had to flip to alternate solutions. Throughout, our team is focused on customer and team member safety, including new protocols, temperature checks, space covering mandates and social distancing guidelines. This has certainly made operating more difficult, but we believe we have done very well with these changes. On the customer front, business reopenings and related activity continue to vary greatly based on industry and geography. Sales to health care, government and other essential businesses remained strong throughout the quarter. Sales to non-essential and disruptive businesses bottomed in April, and they\u2019ve rebounded in May and again in June, although they still remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels. I\u2019ll talk about the pattern of revenue in a minute. Our supply chain has operated well throughout the pandemic although we have seen some lumpiness as we work to match supply with tremendous demand for some pandemic-related items. For most product categories, things have improved. But for some categories, global shortages will make supply a challenge throughout the balance of the year. Our team is working tirelessly to ensure supply for customers as the pandemic ebbs and flows. As we mentioned before, supporting the needs of our team members is a critical importance, especially during this period of uncertainty. Our team members are essential to serving our customers, and team member health and safety remains a priority. We have been fortunate to have absorbed the pandemic without major layoffs and currently have less than 3% of our workforce still on furlough. We have more team members who will return to work in the next few weeks. Having an experienced cohesive team will help us accelerate growth through the recovery. In addition, we remain vigilant around safety. Our team members give us great marks for making safety a priority as they support our customers. Finally, we have maintained a tight focus on our financial position throughout this period. On our Q1 call, I discussed our priority to preserve cash, including deferring action on certain capital projects, pausing our share repurchase program and drawing on our revolving credit facility. We continue to focus on cash preservation and have reduced non-essential SG&A spend by over $75 million sequentially in the quarter. That more than exceeds our $40 million to $55 million target set on the previous call. These actions helped us to finish the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity. Since the business performed well in the quarter, we have begun to evaluate repaying part of the revolver and are assessing a potential dividend increase. Depending on the shape of the pandemic, we will see some sequential cost increases related to things like advertising, some travel and the reinstitution of merit increases. But we remain committed to managing expenses very closely given the uncertain path ahead. To be clear, we are managing costs well, but also investing for the future success of the business. We continue focusing balancing the long-term health of the company alongside our short-term operational needs. Turning to our quarterly results. The business remained resilient despite this unprecedented period. Our daily sales finished down 1.8% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, underpinned by heightened sales of pandemic-related items that nearly offset a mid-teen decline of non-pandemic-related sales. With the MRO market down 14% to 15% in the quarter, we gained a lot of share fueled by pandemic-related sales, selling to new customers and improving non-pandemic sales as the quarter progressed. Gross margins were pressured primarily due to pandemic impacts, which Tom will detail in a bit. A meaningful portion of this margin pressure is temporary in nature, what we don\u2019t know is how long the pandemic will last. Despite great SG&A performance, we have taken action to keep team members and customers safe that have added some short-term costs. Obviously, we\u2019re incurring expense to ensure we create safe work spaces and interact, but also doing things like expediting shipping and allocating product to lower-margin health care and government customers. To state the obvious, we have been focused on helping customers and communities as much as possible, which sometimes means we have added cost. We\u2019ve produced $230 million of operating cash flow and $189 million of free cash flow. That\u2019s a solid result in this environment. Balancing the short-term with progress in strategic initiatives has been key. We continue to make progress on our key priorities. We are on plan to remerchandise an incremental $1.6 billion of our assortment this year. To support further acceleration of these activities, we plan to launch our new product information management system over the next month. We have made great strides in analytics and marketing capabilities, including upgrading internal talent to own more of the marketing activities. Our new customer information tools have enabled us to better match marketing and sales activities with new customers. We launched a new visual search application that is based on machine learning. We are getting great reviews on this solution. We are seeing continued traction with our KeepStock and other embedded customer solutions. We know that customers who have at least one embedded solution, including KeepStock and EDI Pro account for roughly 60% of our revenue. So this is an important customer segment. Here, we have upgraded our systems and processes to accelerate new installations and improve service on existing solutions. With our endless assortment model, MonotaRO continued to invest in technology and capacity to fuel their growth, while we have started to see the benefits of last year\u2019s investments at Zoro in the U.S. And lastly, we further refined our international high-touch footprint with the completed divestiture of Fabory, and we announced an agreement to divest Grainger China. This helps us simplify our footprint and focus our efforts on our core markets. Looking at Slide 6, I thought it would be important this quarter to show the underlying trends with pandemic and non-pandemic products based on our current categorization of SKUs. Over the last several weeks, I\u2019ve been participating in virtual market visits with customers that were originally scheduled to be in person. I have talked with dozens of customers in several different industries to get a sense for how things are progressing. It\u2019s important to note that even for customers with strong revenue performance, there has been a disruption in normal activities. For example, our hospital system has been heroic in dealing with the pandemic and saving lives, and their pandemic product demand has been enormous. But many of their normal facilities maintenance projects have been put on hold through this time to focus on COVID, which means that even hospitals had lower non-pandemic sales through the last four months. There\u2019s a backlog of work that will need to be done in the future. But for now, customers in all industries are focusing on keeping people safe and recovery. In the U.S., we started to see increased pandemic sales in February, and they really picked up in March, where we quickly moved in-stock inventory. This trend continued with pandemic-related sales up around 70% in the second quarter. And while the environment remains fluid, this has continued at an accelerated rate into July. The heightened demand came from a multitude of customers across numerous industries with most of the pandemic products going to health care, government and essential businesses. Through most of March, non-pandemic sales were pretty stable. With the stay-at-home orders, we saw non-pandemic sales fall off significantly in late March, but they have gotten better each month since modeled out in April. We\u2019ve seen further improvement in July. The good news is that we have seen a steady improvement in non-pandemic revenue across all customer types. It\u2019s still below pre-pandemic levels, but it has improved. While we don\u2019t know how this will progress, we do feel good about our ability to help customers weather the storm regardless of how the pandemic evolves. So with that, I will turn it over to Tom to take us through the quarter\u2019s results in detail. Tom?\nTom Okray: Thanks, D.G. Starting with our total company results. As noted on Slide 8, daily sales were down 1.8% on a constant-currency basis. This decline was primarily driven by volume decreases, reflecting lower sales of non-pandemic products as well as significant headwinds from unfavorable product mix due to heightened sales of pandemic-related products. It should be noted that our endless assortment business grew approximately 16% in the quarter, showing tremendous resiliency despite the challenging market conditions. Combined, the U.S. segment and endless assortment business representing the majority of our revenue grew daily sales about 1% in the quarter and roughly 4% year-to-date. Gross margin for the total company was down 290 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. This decline continues to be driven mostly by pandemic-related impacts, particularly noticeable in our U.S. segment, as well as continued business unit mix impact as we experienced faster growth in our lower-margin endless assortment business. We gained 100 basis points of SG&A leverage with a total year-over-year cost decrease of $43 million. This leverage stemmed from prudent cost reductions across all business units, partially offset by increased pandemic-related costs to keep our people and facilities safe. Sequentially, total SG&A spend decreased over $75 million, exceeding our previously communicated goal of $40 million to $55 million, a great result as we were able to deliver better-than-expected savings in many areas of the business. We generated operating cash flow of $232 million, which we used to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and maintain a robust financial position. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $86 million to shareholders, had total capital expenditures of $43 million and significantly invested in inventory to ensure we can satisfy our customers\u2019 needs going forward. Operating cash flow was 114% of net adjusted earnings and return on invested capital was over 28% year-to-date. As expected, our liquidity has remained strong, and we are evaluating increasing our dividend and beginning to repay our revolver draw. I would note, our calculated decremental margins are a bit skewed given the modest level of sales decline. While the decremental margin calculation is useful, it has limitations with relatively small sales declines. For example, if our sales would have declined 10% in the quarter with the same gross margin and SG&A spending, our business results would, in fact, be worse, but our decremental margins would have improved from down 111% to down 50%. Overall, U.S. segment daily sales decreased 2.4% in the quarter as compared to a decline of an estimated 14% to 15% for the broader MRO market. The decline was primarily driven by volume decreases, including unfavorable product mix from heightened levels of pandemic-related sales as well as decreased volume of non-pandemic products. In the U.S. segment, we estimate that pandemic-related product sales were up over 70% in the quarter, peaking in May but elevated throughout the quarter. Non-pandemic products were down in the mid-teens but saw sequential improvements from April lows. Gross margin was 310 basis points unfavorable to the prior year. The variance was driven primarily by three factors: pandemic-related headwinds, tariff fuel cost inflation and the impact of our rescheduled national sales meeting. First, while difficult to pinpoint, we estimate that pandemic-related headwinds accounted for approximately 60% of the gross margin decline in the quarter. These headwinds are multifaceted and include product mix impacts as well as we continued to sell significantly increased levels of lower-margin safety and cleaning products skewed more toward larger health care and government customers. Additionally, as we work to support our customers during this challenging time, we saw further margin pressure as we sourced high-demand products from non-traditional suppliers. This included increased freight and handling costs to ensure expedient delivery of these much-needed and critical supplies. These dramatic but temporary pandemic-related impacts are not expected to continue once we return to more normal course operation. The remaining gross margin decline was primarily driven by the lapping of year-over-year cost inflation, which was largely driven by tariffs that went into effect in 2019 Finally, our national sales meeting represents a roughly 30-basis-point headwind related to the reformatting and retiming of the meeting. From an SG&A perspective, we gained 60 basis points of leverage with costs decreasing approximately $25 million year-over-year. The decrease was driven primarily by lower travel expenses as well as reductions in marketing, labor-related costs, professional services and general frugality. These decreases more than offset temporary pandemic pay increases for hourly branch and DC team members, and enhanced safety measures in our facilities. Operating margin remained strong at 14.7%, but declined 250 basis points in the quarter on lower gross profit margins that were only slightly offset by the achieved SG&A leverage. Return on invested capital was a very healthy 38%. Looking at the U.S. MRO market, while extremely difficult to predict in this environment, we estimate the U.S. MRO market declined between 14% and 15% in the second quarter. Ranger was able to capture roughly 1,200 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, a 70% increase compared to the first quarter share increase. It should be noted that despite the pandemic, year-to-date daily sales are up 1.6%, and we have gained over 900 basis points of share. Moving on to the other businesses. Daily sales in our other businesses increased 2.7% or 2.5% on a constant-currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at \u2013 grew combined at 16% year-over-year, driven by strong customer acquisition at MonotaRO and low single-digit growth at Zoro. MonotaRO continues to perform at an impressive rate despite the Japanese recession and amidst the pandemic backdrop. Sales at Zoro accelerated throughout the quarter, with June up near 10% and July growing at an even faster rate. The international high-touch businesses have been severely impacted by pandemic-related shutdowns, with each geography experiencing meaningful year-over-year declines. Gross profit margin declined 140 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by declining margins at Fabory and MonotaRO. MonotaRO\u2019s result is driven in part by freight increases from the acquisition of new B2C customers. We achieved significant SG&A leverage in the second quarter, resulting in operating margin expansion of 65 basis points. The SG&A favorability stems largely from decreased expenses across our international high-touch businesses, most notably at Cromwell, and expanded leverage in endless assortment. It is notable that despite some gross margin headwinds at MonotaRO, the endless assortment business grew operating margin in the second quarter. It is encouraging to see the 2019 investments in Zoro paying off. Further, despite significant top line challenges in 2020, Cromwell has meaningfully reduced its operating loss year-to-date. On June 30, we completed the sale of the Fabory business, the full operating results of this business are included in our second quarter results. Given the immateriality of the business, we will not be recasting our prior-year financials to reflect this transaction. So we will face revenue headwinds, but we\u2019ll have a modest tailwind to operating margin rate comparisons over the next four quarters. Starting in the third quarter, we will provide organic daily revenue comparisons to strip out the top line impact of the divestiture. Turning to Slide 12. In Canada, daily sales decreased 21.7% or 19% in constant currency. The decline is comprised of roughly 17.5% in volume and price headwinds, including customer mix of approximately 1.5%. Volumes at the Grainger Canada business continued to be impacted by the economic slowdown and lower oil prices stemming from the pandemic. Gross profit margin at Grainger Canada declined 145 basis points year-over-year, driven by the combination of aggressive pricing actions aimed at reinvigorating our customer base, pandemic-related mix impacts and lower vendor rebates. These impacts were partially offset by lower freight costs. Our cost management actions drove SG&A savings of $12 million year-over-year, resulting in 60 basis points of leverage. Operating margin was unfavorable 85 basis points versus prior year. Before I turn it back to D.G., given the unpredictability of the virus, it remains nearly impossible to predict how customers \u2013 how our customers will be impacted, but wanted to give you a sense for how July is unfolding and what it might mean for the third quarter. From a sales perspective, trends in early July are showing sales up mid-single digits on an organic total company basis, which strips out sales from our Fabory business. July-to-date trends show continued momentum with non-pandemic sales gaining steam from April lows and with pandemic-related sales remaining at elevated levels. Further, every business unit is showing improved performance in July when compared to June results. The situation clearly remains volatile. And as we saw in Q1, these month-to-date metrics may not be good predictors of our full quarter results. As we move into the second half of 2020, we anticipate gross margins will remain depressed as we expect pandemic-related impacts will continue. While we don\u2019t know how the situation will evolve as the year goes on, given what we know now, we anticipate improvement from the 290 basis point year-over-year headwind we saw in Q2, but to what extent will be largely dependent on the pandemic-related actions of our customers. With respect to SG&A, as business unit activity ramps up, we expect to see some natural increases in spend related to marketing and travel, and we also reinstituted our annual merit increase, which was pushed from April to July. With this, we anticipate total company SG&A cost to range from $715 million to $730 million in the third quarter. Importantly, we remain focused on long-term growth, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in people, process and technology to ensure we remain the industry leader. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to D.G. for some final thoughts.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Tom. Before we wrap up the call and go to questions, I want to touch on an important topic. The recent events of hatred and racism stand as reminders of the injustice in our world, and particularly for the African-American community. At Grainger, one of our core principles is to do the right thing. The right thing here seems fundamental: respect each other, embrace our differences and stand out for what is right. Remaining silent is not an option. Collectively, we need to be better. As a company, we know that diversity, inclusion and acceptance of our differences makes us stronger. This is central to our Grainger Edge principles and vital to our commitment to keep the world working. We have been encouraging our team members to have real conversations with each other about their background and identity, including the tough topics of race, gender, age and sexual orientation so that we can better know and understand each other. We know these conversations alone are not sufficient to solving the problem, and we need to collectively take action to ensure that economic opportunities are more plentiful for all. While we have work to do, we are committed to improving our talent and recruiting processes to root out bias, and we\u2019re committed to promoting diverse hiring opportunities. This includes giving clear metrics and visibility, ensuring equitable pay and helping team members address unconscious bias. We\u2019ll also continue to direct an arm of our charitable efforts to promote the educational advancement of those without privilege or access. I want to thank our team and our customers for performing so well through the pandemic. We are pleased with how we performed, and we remain committed to gaining share profitably and delivering strong results moving forward. Now with that, I\u2019ll open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Manthey: All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. First off, thanks for Slide 6. That\u2019s very helpful to give us a picture of what\u2019s going on under the surface here. But my question is, could you give us an update on your efforts in high touch? What initiatives are you driving on most right now to accelerate growth in that core business?\nD.G. Macpherson: Sure. Thanks, David. I think they are the same things we\u2019ve talked about in terms of being critical, and they really fall into two groups. One is improving our offer, our product assortment, our product information, our customer information. So we\u2019re rolling out a new product information management system. We are remerchandising a bunch of the assortment to make the experience better for our customers. We continue to invest in digital technology for our website. So that\u2019s kind of the first set of things we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve also increased our marketing effectiveness and reimproved our digital marketing, which is both \u2013 which really hits all customers within the Grainger model, the high-touch model, and that has been very effective. And we\u2019ve reinvigorated our KeepStock and on-site solutions for customers. We have a good traction going into the fourth quarter of last year and the beginning of this year. Some of that\u2019s slowed down, but we still have new installs. We still have changed some installs for customers to help serve them during this time. And really we think that almost every large complex customer has either a digital solution that works for them or we help to manage inventory. And so we\u2019re pushing on those basics of on-site service to make sure we do that right. And all that is leading to a strong share gain within the U.S. business.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thanks for that. And second, on the Zoro U.S. growth initiatives that you laid out last year, is it correct to think that the costs are behind you now and you\u2019re in the harvesting stage? And obviously, great timing on those. As we look to the future, will those kind of investments be less chunky ahead? Or will you periodically step those spending initiatives up and then followed by a period of harvesting the benefits?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. We would expect that to be less chunky. And the reason is a lot of the investments we made over the last 15 months or so, mostly in 2019, were really about a fairly significant strategic change to expand the assortment in the millions of products. We passed the 4.4 million products available to customers online Mazuro recently, and we\u2019ve got a great pipeline. That required us to do it very, very differently than we\u2019ve done historically. And so those investments are behind us. And I would expect them to be less chunky. We have \u2013 for the next three to five years, we will continue to expand margins with that business as we grow, given where we positioned ourselves right now.\nDavid Manthey: That\u2019s great, D.G. Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nRyan Merkel: So first off, pandemic growth is holding up fairly well in July, as you cited. I realize this is hard to answer, but what is your outlook for pandemic sales going forward? Is there any visibility there?\nD.G. Macpherson: Well, so it\u2019s a great question, Ryan. Yes, there is \u2013 I mean, well, visibility in the traditional sense, I\u2019m not sure. But certainly, if you look at our customer base, there are customers now who have planned, particularly PPE, into their process like they\u2019ve never done it before. So you talk with customers. One customer told me they used to use 700 per day of a PPE item. Now they\u2019re going to use 40,000 per day, as an example. So given the awareness of the virus, we would expect elevated levels of pandemic product for the foreseeable future. Will it be as much as we\u2019ve had? Probably not, although as we see cases rise, my guess is there will be pretty significant elevated levels of pandemic product moving forward. But I do think this has forced people to change the way they think about personal protection and think about some of these products and keeping team members safe. So we expect to see elevated product levels for at least the next 1.5 years and probably beyond.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. It\u2019s helpful. And then second question on non-pandemic sales. So I guess two-part question. Were the share gains there as strong? It looks like maybe not. Maybe clarify that. And then how did margins perform in non-pandemic sales year-over-year? Any surprises there?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. First, and I can turn it over to Tom. Margins were not surprising for us there, and they performed, clearly, better than the pandemic sales, because a lot of the pandemic sales are very large orders to large contract customers. So the margins were certainly better with non-pandemic. I would say that it\u2019s challenging. Our market assumption of down 14, 15 in the U.S. would assume that non-pandemic sales were down quite a bit more than that. And so we do believe we gain significant share in non-pandemic product as well. Getting that level of detail, looking at that \u2013 our model is almost impossible to do. And so I would say, don\u2019t really know. We think we gained share throughout all product categories. Whether we gained more or less share with non-pandemic is really, really hard to do. My guess is it\u2019s less, but still very strong.\nRyan Merkel: Okay, perfect. Thanks. Pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Inch: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just as a thought. Your concern for social issues is laudable. You guys might want to even think of expanding your presence in the Chicago area, maybe even the south side of Chicago. Just as a thought.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes, yes.\nJohn Inch: No, it\u2019s [indiscernible] like, why not? Consider it. So my question is, D.G., on Canada. Canada\u2019s results have been pretty bad for a while. But in some respect, they\u2019re down 19% or whatever core. They held up the profits pretty well. How did they do that exactly? Like, why was there not more decremental drag? Is that just because it\u2019s been bad for so long that it\u2019s been able to sort of move and adjust the costs? And would you expect that kind of performance going forward in terms of Canada\u2019s cost preservation?\nD.G. Macpherson: The answer is, yes, we expect it going forward. I think the thing that\u2019s probably not easy to understand is \u2013 I spent some time with our customers recently in Canada, and our services improved dramatically there over the last couple of years. And coming off of the SAP installation and some other things, we had real challenging period there with service. And so I think a lot of this is just customers coming to realize that we\u2019re providing strong service, building better relationships, and we\u2019ve taken the cost actions we have. So we feel like that business is poised to do much, much better. Obviously, they\u2019re going to be faced with some market challenges, but we feel like they\u2019re positioned to do better. And we\u2019ve taken a lot of cost out, but we also continue to invest in pockets for growth. And we feel like from a share perspective, we can gain share and gain share profitably given our current position.\nJohn Inch: Well, I was going to ask you about Canada strategically. It has been \u2013 I appreciate the investment posture. Like, is there a way to maybe even step that up over time? I guess the question is, so at some point after what\u2019s been like three years or whatever, pretty tough results there, I\u2019m assuming, number one, you\u2019re not able to actually sell the business. Because I think years ago, you guys implemented initiatives to integrate it more with the U.S., so selling it would actually be challenging. You\u2019d have to untangle it. So if you can\u2019t really do that, is the plan to just get it profitable over time to a certain threshold and it sort of sits as a cash cow? Or you really think it can sort of do what some of the \u2013 some of what you\u2019ve been able to accomplish in the U.S. in terms of share gains, can it do that in Canada, perhaps by shifting away from oil and gas more to other pockets of their economy or whatever?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes, we believe we can do that. And actually, we\u2019re starting to see that. So with government, health care, manufacturing, we\u2019re starting to get some traction there. And as that happens, we believe it can be a growth engine. We\u2019re obviously going to be very, very focused on profitability. But we do think there\u2019s going to be nice growth coming out, particularly the eastern part of Canada, and we\u2019ve already started to see some of that underneath the numbers. And so we feel like \u2013 and you\u2019re right, it is running \u2013 we\u2019re running it more like the U.S., and that\u2019s helped our cost position. But the team up there is very focused on profitable growth. I think we\u2019ve got a really strong leadership team up there and the sales organization now, and we\u2019re pretty excited about the path and the ability to grow consistently and grow profitably.\nJohn Inch: So it sounds like 2021 could actually be a significant inflection year, without putting words in your mouth. Is that reasonable as a thought process?\nD.G. Macpherson: It\u2019s a reasonable assumption. I think pandemic aside, how it evolves. But yes, we feel like \u2013 we felt like this year was going to be significant improvement. We started to see that in the first couple of months and then, of course, the world stopped. So we feel like we\u2019re well positioned when things do come back for it to be an inflection.\nJohn Inch: Got it. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to stick with Canada for a second. And I think I saw aggressive pricing there. Wondering what enabled that. Was that kind of catch-up on \u2013 now that service levels are more enabling? Or is there lack of elasticity?\nD.G. Macpherson: No. Most of that is what we saw in the U.S. with pandemic. So large sales of pandemic items to government customers, some health care customers. That is \u2013 the majority of the aggressive pricing would have been to serve the pandemic.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And on the share gain, I think Tom mentioned 900 basis points. Just curious, again, another crack at trying to filter that with the pandemic demand. It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019d be a sticky type of share gain that you have, the way you normally accrue shares. So wondering about how you\u2019re viewing retention of that.\nD.G. Macpherson: Well , the way I\u2019m viewing it personally is, we \u2013 the world is a little unusual right now, right? So to say that you gained 1,200 basis points when you were down 2%, it seems like a strange thing to say. We think it\u2019s accurate analytically, but it\u2019s a little messy, right? Because we \u2013 it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going on underneath that. We feel like we are gaining share. We feel like we\u2019re doing the right things. And we feel like our normal share gains, we\u2019ll be able to retain. There may be some of that that\u2019s hard to retain, of course, depending on sort of pandemic sales. But certainly, we feel good about it, but we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not taking it literally, if that\u2019s your question.\nChristopher Glynn: Yes. I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Uhlman: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a follow-up on that question. In the past, you used to talk about the medium-sized customer recovery from lapsed customers or folks who used to do business with. Could you remind us of what your headroom is of gaining share with those folks?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So we saw an interesting dynamic with midsized customers during the quarter that has since reversed. And so let me talk about that for just a second. So with large customers, we ended up prioritizing a lot of pandemic efforts for large customers, hospitals and government customers, in particular, and essential manufacturing businesses and others distribution businesses. As a result of that, we held pandemic product from the website, in some cases, and you\u2019re seeing all the competitors do that. And we did see the midsized customers get hit harder during the initial shelter-in-place orders. What we\u2019ve seen though is they\u2019ve actually come back stronger. And so we\u2019re seeing very strong growth with midsized customers in the last six weeks, which is encouraging. We\u2019ve acquired more new customers than we really ever had during this period because we\u2019ve had product and many others haven\u2019t. And so we think we\u2019ve got a very strong \u2013 a lot of headroom with midsized customers, we were, at one point, $1.8 billion, and we think we can get back to there and beyond over time. So we think we\u2019ve got a long way to grow to have outgrowth with midsized customers. And the pandemic has been a strange period for everything, but we\u2019re now starting to see that growth come back in again.\nAdam Uhlman: Okay, got you. Thanks. And then how should we think about inventories, specifically for the rest of the year? And maybe just some thoughts on working capital for the second half, would be great. Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: So I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom here in just a second. I would say we have made significant inventory investments to be able to get continuity of supply for our customers. So more than we obviously typically would, given some of the supply challenges that existed in the world, and that has been a working capital build. We would expect that build to stay throughout the remainder of this year and into next year before it starts to bleed off, but I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.\nTom Okray: Yes. Thanks, D.G. Yes, what was part of our operating cash flow bridge was a significant investment into working capital and, specifically, inventory. When it became clear, coming through the first quarter and into the second quarter, that we were in a cash generation position, then we felt it was right to invest in working capital, use our strong balance sheet so that we would be able to take care of the needs of our customers. So we have done prebuys. We\u2019ve done prepayments. And we think we\u2019re well-suited to take care of the needs going forward to help out those key customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. Just going back to the pandemic. Actually, no, let me skip that. Let\u2019s go to single channel. I mean, the growth at Zoro was actually pretty impressive. As was \u2013 I\u2019m not sure, but we get the daily sales monthly from their website. I mean, I think the factors are pretty clear. But is there any way to think about the SKU expansion year-over-year? And how much of that is contributing to the growth versus just demand? And I\u2019m curious, given the nature of the shutdowns and the pandemic, is there any cannibalization happening between single channel endless assortment and your traditional business during this period of time?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So great question. So I think I mentioned, we have a very strong pipeline, millions of products in the pipeline to add to Zoro. If you look over the last three or four years, you look at curves of new product adds and their productivity, remains a big part of the growth of Zoro. And in, let\u2019s call it, normal times, we would expect product adds over the next three to five years to be as much as half of the growth of the business. And so that\u2019s obviously an important growth driver. We have not seen any further cannibalization during this period than we\u2019ve seen at other times between Zoro and Grainger. In fact, Zoro\u2019s growth has been \u2013 a lot of it\u2019s been very, very focused on very small customers during this time and getting them product they can\u2019t get elsewhere. So we\u2019re pretty excited about the pattern. I will say that both MonotaRO and Zoro have had higher acquisition than normal, and some of that acquisition has been consumers. We don\u2019t remarket to consumers. They do find as some \u2013 as people have been trying to find pandemic-related or really any product during this time. But the business acquisition has been stronger than normal, too, and that\u2019s really the important number to look at. So that\u2019s strong business acquisition, driven in part by product adds.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thanks, D.G. And then, obviously, the way you\u2019ve broken out, say, the mix and the price/mix this quarter, I think, is really helpful. The 30 bps of headwind from price and customer mix, would you be prepared to talk about price in isolation? How is pricing tracking right now? And how do you feel customer pricing is in terms of the go-forward? Are customers receptive of inflation right now? Or any change on pricing power?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. We haven\u2019t really seen any change in pricing power. Our pricing \u2013 and Tom, I\u2019ll let you answer this. I will say our pricing, in normal years, we see GP trail off as the year goes along. This year is going to be not as much of that as we do see price get better, and we\u2019ve seen it get better through the second quarter. And so we feel like we\u2019re going to get more price going forward. But Tom, do you want to answer?\nTom Okray: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Nigel, and I read your note before the call. And I think it\u2019s important to note that we really haven\u2019t done anything new in terms of calculation. We\u2019ve just broken out product mix with volume. Product mix had always been in volume. But just historically, it hadn\u2019t been so relevant. It was fairly static. Obviously, with the pandemic, it\u2019s a much, much bigger story, so that\u2019s why we broke it out. And as it relates to our revenue bridge, it represents over 90% of the variance. The remainder, as you note, is some customer mix and price. And as D.G. said, we\u2019ve seen strengthening over the quarter, and we expect that into the future in terms of price inflation, albeit we\u2019ve seen a little bit of softness as it compares to prior year.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, Tom. Thanks, D.G.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Dankert: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just to carry that a bit further. Tom, in the past, you\u2019ve mentioned that some introductory pricing was certainly an onboarding engine for large customer acquisition. I guess, is that still a part of the strategy? You highlighted some of the other pieces there, but should we still expect prices, from a strategic standpoint, to be a bit lower in that large customer piece of the business going forward?\nTom Okray: Yes. I would say that\u2019s probably paused a little bit with the pandemic, just with the focus with the PPE, but it\u2019s certainly still part of the acquisition strategy. And maybe since you brought up gross margin related, let me try to unpack it even a little bit further than we did in the prepared remarks. As we\u2019re not giving guidance, want to be as helpful as we can to everybody putting their models together. So as we\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got 60%, which is COVID-related. So on 310 bps, that\u2019s roughly 180 bps unfavorable versus prior year. You\u2019ve got NSSM, it\u2019s 30 bps. So there, it\u2019s 210 in total. And the remainder is cost/other and as D.G. mentioned, historically, going from Q2 to Q3, we would see a meaningful decline in terms of gross margin rate. This year, going \u2013 as it relates to Q3, we expect that to be mitigated somewhat for the following reasons. NSSM will no longer be a headwind, so we will gain that back. We also see the tariff cadence improving. So tariff-related cost inflation will improve a little bit. And then we see price inflation strengthening as well, and we expect that to continue into Q3. Now the big wildcard, of course, is the pandemic impact as it relates to gross margin. So that is really the wildcard in terms of what the actual gross margin rate will be for Q3. What we do expect, though, as we compare the gross margin rate to the prior year, we don\u2019t expect to be down 310 bps in the U.S. segment and 290 bps overall. We do expect improvement from that. So just wanted to give you that color to help you all with your modeling. Thanks.\nChris Dankert: No, that\u2019s extremely helpful. Thank you for the clarity there. And then just to follow-up. I guess, we\u2019ve seen China and Fabory go away here. I guess, just any quick thoughts on Cromwell. How it\u2019s executing? Does it still make sense in the portfolio? Just your high-level thoughts would be great.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I guess, I\u2019ll give some thoughts. So Cromwell is \u2013 it is a business that is very much in our high-touch solutions model. It looks a lot like Grainger. They have executed, I think, while the last year, to put themselves in a position where they can grow and improve profitability dramatically. So the pandemic doesn\u2019t change our thoughts on the business. We\u2019ve talked about sort of making sure we have a fast recovery of that business. We should be able to get very clear signs on the pace of that recovery coming out of this. So I\u2019d say, happy with the team, happy with what they\u2019re doing. Service is really, really good there now and starting to win back some business, and they\u2019re starting to improve profitability, they\u2019ve improved their cost position. I want to give that a chance to run out a little bit more. Obviously, the pandemic may slow that a little bit. But certainly, we still have high expectations for how they can turn it around there.\nChris Dankert: Understood. Thank you so much, guys and better luck on forward here.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thank you.\nTom Okray: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nTom Okray: Hi, Deane.\nDeane Dray: Maybe a couple of questions on capital allocation. When do you think you might be resuming buybacks? And then any other color on a potential dividend increase, either the timing, magnitude? Are you tying it to a payout ratio? This is \u2013 D.G., as you said, these are not normal times, but how does that \u2013 how do you \u2013 how are you looking at the dividend increase?\nTom Okray: We\u2019d expect that dividend increase would be similar to what it has been in prior years, Deane. With respect to timing, we\u2019ve been talking about it. And if something happens, it would probably happen in the third quarter. With respect to repurchasing shares, right now, with the spike and are we going to have a shutdown to with an abundance of caution, we really haven\u2019t resumed the buybacks, even though we are obviously generating robust cash flow. That, we would probably start to think a little bit harder at the end of Q3. And if we were going to do something, it would likely be in Q4, I would think.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s helpful. And considering the divestitures of Fabory and Grainger China, are you contemplating any other portfolio moves over the near term? Any divestitures?\nD.G. Macpherson: Not at this point, we are not.\nDeane Dray: Good. And then just last one from me. Could you expand on, in the context of having to source some high demand products from \u2013 I think you described them as nonstandard suppliers. What the challenges are. I think you touched on freight, but did you have to qualify the suppliers? And how do you think this issue, this headwind abates?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So it\u2019s been a very unusual time for supply. I think the things that we\u2019ve been really focused on are making sure we can get supply of high-quality products. So we do have to qualify suppliers. We have to decide whether or not the product meets our quality standards and actually does what it says it\u2019s going to do. And then we have to, in some cases, as Tom mentioned, yet you have to pay some upfront money, which typically would not happen, and we\u2019ve done that in a number of cases. So it\u2019s a \u2013 and as this thing unfolded, it was a little bit like the Wild West in the sense that everybody claimed they had a solution, and oftentimes those solutions weren\u2019t real. And so we\u2019ve had to work with our team in China and to work with our team in the U.S. to really understand the quality, the availability, the integrity of the supply, and that\u2019s been really important. I think we\u2019ve done a nice job navigating that. But I expect that to weigh now in some categories that may remain. But generally, it\u2019s gotten a little bit easier lately.\nDeane Dray: That\u2019s good to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning and thank you. D.G., you touched on the top line growth for Zoro and MonotaRO. I was hoping maybe you could just touch on how to think about profitability of Zoro versus MonotaRO. Are there any structural differences, whereby Zoro shouldn\u2019t look like MonotaRO longer term? Just any thoughts there.\nD.G. Macpherson: We have looked at that. And as you know, Masaya Suzuki is running that business at this point, the Zoro business, and he\u2019s been the CEO of \u2013 and still is the CEO of MonotaRO. The differences, if they exist, are relatively minor. We think that the Zoro business should be able to get to certainly high single-digit operating margins, which is very profitable from return on invested capital. And we\u2019ve got our plans to go ahead and make that happen over the next several years. And so we feel really good about the profitability path of Zoro.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And just a follow-up question, I\u2019ll turn it over. Tom, you gave some incremental color on gross margin. So it\u2019s more of a clarification question. If pandemic sales continue sort of at the same pace as July, is Q3 gross margin just down sequentially, assuming pandemic sales kind of continue at the pace they are?\nTom Okray: Well, just to reiterate, Hamzah, there\u2019s going to be some tailwinds, for sure, and that\u2019s the NSSM meeting, that\u2019s the cost tariffs and that\u2019s the strengthening pricing. We would also expect, as D.G. said, some of the money we paid to, let\u2019s say, air freight supply, we would expect that to likely go down as well. The bottom line is it\u2019s just so hard to predict something that\u2019s never happened before in terms of the pandemic. So I\u2019ll just reiterate. Historically, Q3 gross margin is less than Q2. Would not expect it to be that dramatic of a falloff in \u2013 as it has been historically. So I\u2019ll leave it at that. But we do expect that it will be significantly, from a bps perspective compared to prior year, not as down as 310 or 290 for the overall company.\nHamzah Mazari: Great. Thank you so much.\nTom Okray: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael McGinn: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for sneaking me in here. If I could go to the U.S. segment, just thinking a little outside the box. Can you kind of frame for us what the opening of branches means from a sequential sales uptick if we were thinking of that as like a noncore add back, what that means in terms of sales and maybe margin mix?\nD.G. Macpherson: So you\u2019re talking about opening our showrooms where we were only doing curbside for a while?\nMichael McGinn: Correct.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So I would say that just rough math, walk-in traffic is about 10% of our volume or revenue, at least at this point. And what we see is we see a modest increase when we open the showrooms. It is \u2013 it should help margins because, typically, the profile of those customers are not generally contract customers, and it\u2019s usually higher-margin sales. So it will be modest for the overall growth profile, but it will help. And we\u2019ve seen that already happen as we\u2019ve opened those up.\nMichael McGinn: Okay. And then second one for me. I think Nigel was mentioning the SKU count additions on Zoro. You have a fellow, I guess, B2C company out there with similar ambitions to rapidly increase SKU count. Can you give us a framework for how many resellers you have added and how much it would take to get to that $10 million, and whether you view that $10 million as a high hurdle, low bar? Any commentary there would be great.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. Given \u2013 I would say that given the \u2013 we\u2019re talking about every quarter, adding tens of suppliers. So it\u2019s not thousands of suppliers before, but it\u2019s tens of suppliers. But we have a line of sight into getting to 6 million or 7million SKUs at this point, and we feel like getting to $10 million is not all that difficult to do given the new processes we have in place. I will say that the MonotaRO business in Japan is about 20 million, roughly 20 million items. So we\u2019ve done this before. We understand the process. And I think the team has done a great job of configuring to be able to step on the accelerator, and we have a very nice pipeline at this point.\nMichael McGinn: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick Baumann: Hey, D.G. Hey, Tom. Thanks for sneaking me in here. Just a quick one on \u2013 so you talked a lot about gross margin expectations for third quarter. Just if you could provide any framework. Maybe I missed this earlier, but any framework around how to think about SG&A or incremental margins in the third quarter if sales continue to grow in that mid-single-digit range?\nTom Okray: Yes. I mean, related to SG&A, I\u2019ll refer you back to the prepared remarks where we think, on a total company basis, SG&A will be between $715 million and $730 million. And that is a decrease, obviously, from prior year, but an increase from Q2 as the country starts to open up and we\u2019re spending more on travel, we\u2019re spending more on advertising. Those types of things. As it relates to decremental margin, if we were to see a volume decline from 5% to 10%, which is inconsistent with what we\u2019ve seen so far, July to date, we would expect decremental margins to be in the 35% to 45% range, consistent with what we said last quarter. Obviously, if we continue at a mid-single-digit growth, then we would flip from decremental margins to incremental margins. And there, I think, depending on, again, and I have to keep \u2013 I apologize, I have to keep giving the qualifier of what the pandemic looks like. But depending on how the gross margin behaves, we could be around 20% plus/minus gross margins as long as the pandemic does not take a really harder hit on gross margin.\nPatrick Baumann: What \u2013 go ahead. Go ahead, D.G.\nD.G. Macpherson: [Indiscernible] to Tom is we talked about adding travel costs back. That may sound a little odd in today\u2019s world. What we really mean there is we are now able to visit most of our customers. So we\u2019re talking about mileage reimbursement for our sales team, which will increase. It\u2019s not a huge number, but that\u2019s the type of cost add-back we would be having, is being able to engage with our customers, again, which we started to do.\nPatrick Baumann: Yes. I assume \u2013 great clarification. I assume that $715 million to $730 million is embedding sales growth since you\u2019re growing 5% to date? Or is the range there because you don\u2019t know. How do I think about that?\nD.G. Macpherson: I think our assumptions change frequently now as the world changes. But certainly, right now, we would envision \u2013 all we really know is through the first three weeks, we\u2019re up about mid-single digits.\nTom Okray: And I\u2019ll just reiterate, it is lower than prior year, which was in the $760 million range.\nPatrick Baumann: Yes. And then last one for me. Did you mention the year-over-year benefit from tax in the second quarter to free cash flow? I might have missed that, too. Sorry about that.\nTom Okray: Can you repeat the question, please, Patrick?\nPatrick Baumann: I thought I read in the slides or somewhere that there was a benefit from timing of tax payments and free cash flow in the second quarter.\nTom Okray: Yes, yes. Thank you. Yes, there was $115 million benefit deferral of federal income taxes, instead of paying our federal payments in April and June, like we did in the prior year, we pay them in July.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay, thank you so much for clarifying.\nTom Okray: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Macpherson for any closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Great. I\u2019ll keep this very short. Thanks for joining us today. Certainly, I think we\u2019d all agree that there\u2019s probably more market uncertainty at any time in our careers. But hopefully, you see from our results that we think we\u2019re prepared to perform through whatever comes. We\u2019re excited to see some of the non-pandemic volume come back, and we\u2019re excited by the trends. And we\u2019re going to stay completely focused on our core business models and driving profitable share gain through our high-touch solutions model in North America and our analyst assortment business. So we\u2019re proud of where we are, what we\u2019ve accomplished, and we\u2019re ready for the future. So thanks for joining us today, and I wish you all will stay safe.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Okray",
            "content": "Thanks, D.G. Starting with our total company results. As noted on Slide 8, daily sales were down 1.8% on a constant-currency basis. This decline was primarily driven by volume decreases, reflecting lower sales of non-pandemic products as well as significant headwinds from unfavorable product mix due to heightened sales of pandemic-related products. It should be noted that our endless assortment business grew approximately 16% in the quarter, showing tremendous resiliency despite the challenging market conditions. Combined, the U.S. segment and endless assortment business representing the majority of our revenue grew daily sales about 1% in the quarter and roughly 4% year-to-date. Gross margin for the total company was down 290 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. This decline continues to be driven mostly by pandemic-related impacts, particularly noticeable in our U.S. segment, as well as continued business unit mix impact as we experienced faster growth in our lower-margin endless assortment business. We gained 100 basis points of SG&A leverage with a total year-over-year cost decrease of $43 million. This leverage stemmed from prudent cost reductions across all business units, partially offset by increased pandemic-related costs to keep our people and facilities safe. Sequentially, total SG&A spend decreased over $75 million, exceeding our previously communicated goal of $40 million to $55 million, a great result as we were able to deliver better-than-expected savings in many areas of the business. We generated operating cash flow of $232 million, which we used to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and maintain a robust financial position. During the quarter, we paid dividends of $86 million to shareholders, had total capital expenditures of $43 million and significantly invested in inventory to ensure we can satisfy our customers' needs going forward. Operating cash flow was 114% of net adjusted earnings and return on invested capital was over 28% year-to-date. As expected, our liquidity has remained strong, and we are evaluating increasing our dividend and beginning to repay our revolver draw. I would note, our calculated decremental margins are a bit skewed given the modest level of sales decline. While the decremental margin calculation is useful, it has limitations with relatively small sales declines. For example, if our sales would have declined 10% in the quarter with the same gross margin and SG&A spending, our business results would, in fact, be worse, but our decremental margins would have improved from down 111% to down 50%. Overall, U.S. segment daily sales decreased 2.4% in the quarter as compared to a decline of an estimated 14% to 15% for the broader MRO market. The decline was primarily driven by volume decreases, including unfavorable product mix from heightened levels of pandemic-related sales as well as decreased volume of non-pandemic products. In the U.S. segment, we estimate that pandemic-related product sales were up over 70% in the quarter, peaking in May but elevated throughout the quarter. Non-pandemic products were down in the mid-teens but saw sequential improvements from April lows. Gross margin was 310 basis points unfavorable to the prior year. The variance was driven primarily by three factors: pandemic-related headwinds, tariff fuel cost inflation and the impact of our rescheduled national sales meeting. First, while difficult to pinpoint, we estimate that pandemic-related headwinds accounted for approximately 60% of the gross margin decline in the quarter. These headwinds are multifaceted and include product mix impacts as well as we continued to sell significantly increased levels of lower-margin safety and cleaning products skewed more toward larger health care and government customers. Additionally, as we work to support our customers during this challenging time, we saw further margin pressure as we sourced high-demand products from non-traditional suppliers. This included increased freight and handling costs to ensure expedient delivery of these much-needed and critical supplies. These dramatic but temporary pandemic-related impacts are not expected to continue once we return to more normal course operation. The remaining gross margin decline was primarily driven by the lapping of year-over-year cost inflation, which was largely driven by tariffs that went into effect in 2019 Finally, our national sales meeting represents a roughly 30-basis-point headwind related to the reformatting and retiming of the meeting. From an SG&A perspective, we gained 60 basis points of leverage with costs decreasing approximately $25 million year-over-year. The decrease was driven primarily by lower travel expenses as well as reductions in marketing, labor-related costs, professional services and general frugality. These decreases more than offset temporary pandemic pay increases for hourly branch and DC team members, and enhanced safety measures in our facilities. Operating margin remained strong at 14.7%, but declined 250 basis points in the quarter on lower gross profit margins that were only slightly offset by the achieved SG&A leverage. Return on invested capital was a very healthy 38%. Looking at the U.S. MRO market, while extremely difficult to predict in this environment, we estimate the U.S. MRO market declined between 14% and 15% in the second quarter. Ranger was able to capture roughly 1,200 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter, a 70% increase compared to the first quarter share increase. It should be noted that despite the pandemic, year-to-date daily sales are up 1.6%, and we have gained over 900 basis points of share. Moving on to the other businesses. Daily sales in our other businesses increased 2.7% or 2.5% on a constant-currency basis. The endless assortment business grew at \u2013 grew combined at 16% year-over-year, driven by strong customer acquisition at MonotaRO and low single-digit growth at Zoro. MonotaRO continues to perform at an impressive rate despite the Japanese recession and amidst the pandemic backdrop. Sales at Zoro accelerated throughout the quarter, with June up near 10% and July growing at an even faster rate. The international high-touch businesses have been severely impacted by pandemic-related shutdowns, with each geography experiencing meaningful year-over-year declines. Gross profit margin declined 140 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by declining margins at Fabory and MonotaRO. MonotaRO's result is driven in part by freight increases from the acquisition of new B2C customers. We achieved significant SG&A leverage in the second quarter, resulting in operating margin expansion of 65 basis points. The SG&A favorability stems largely from decreased expenses across our international high-touch businesses, most notably at Cromwell, and expanded leverage in endless assortment. It is notable that despite some gross margin headwinds at MonotaRO, the endless assortment business grew operating margin in the second quarter. It is encouraging to see the 2019 investments in Zoro paying off. Further, despite significant top line challenges in 2020, Cromwell has meaningfully reduced its operating loss year-to-date. On June 30, we completed the sale of the Fabory business, the full operating results of this business are included in our second quarter results. Given the immateriality of the business, we will not be recasting our prior-year financials to reflect this transaction. So we will face revenue headwinds, but we'll have a modest tailwind to operating margin rate comparisons over the next four quarters. Starting in the third quarter, we will provide organic daily revenue comparisons to strip out the top line impact of the divestiture. Turning to Slide 12. In Canada, daily sales decreased 21.7% or 19% in constant currency. The decline is comprised of roughly 17.5% in volume and price headwinds, including customer mix of approximately 1.5%. Volumes at the Grainger Canada business continued to be impacted by the economic slowdown and lower oil prices stemming from the pandemic. Gross profit margin at Grainger Canada declined 145 basis points year-over-year, driven by the combination of aggressive pricing actions aimed at reinvigorating our customer base, pandemic-related mix impacts and lower vendor rebates. These impacts were partially offset by lower freight costs. Our cost management actions drove SG&A savings of $12 million year-over-year, resulting in 60 basis points of leverage. Operating margin was unfavorable 85 basis points versus prior year. Before I turn it back to D.G., given the unpredictability of the virus, it remains nearly impossible to predict how customers \u2013 how our customers will be impacted, but wanted to give you a sense for how July is unfolding and what it might mean for the third quarter. From a sales perspective, trends in early July are showing sales up mid-single digits on an organic total company basis, which strips out sales from our Fabory business. July-to-date trends show continued momentum with non-pandemic sales gaining steam from April lows and with pandemic-related sales remaining at elevated levels. Further, every business unit is showing improved performance in July when compared to June results. The situation clearly remains volatile. And as we saw in Q1, these month-to-date metrics may not be good predictors of our full quarter results. As we move into the second half of 2020, we anticipate gross margins will remain depressed as we expect pandemic-related impacts will continue. While we don't know how the situation will evolve as the year goes on, given what we know now, we anticipate improvement from the 290 basis point year-over-year headwind we saw in Q2, but to what extent will be largely dependent on the pandemic-related actions of our customers. With respect to SG&A, as business unit activity ramps up, we expect to see some natural increases in spend related to marketing and travel, and we also reinstituted our annual merit increase, which was pushed from April to July. With this, we anticipate total company SG&A cost to range from $715 million to $730 million in the third quarter. Importantly, we remain focused on long-term growth, and we'll continue to invest in people, process and technology to ensure we remain the industry leader. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some final thoughts. Yes. Thanks, D.G. Yes, what was part of our operating cash flow bridge was a significant investment into working capital and, specifically, inventory. When it became clear, coming through the first quarter and into the second quarter, that we were in a cash generation position, then we felt it was right to invest in working capital, use our strong balance sheet so that we would be able to take care of the needs of our customers. So we have done prebuys. We've done prepayments. And we think we're well-suited to take care of the needs going forward to help out those key customers. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Nigel, and I read your note before the call. And I think it's important to note that we really haven't done anything new in terms of calculation. We've just broken out product mix with volume. Product mix had always been in volume. But just historically, it hadn't been so relevant. It was fairly static. Obviously, with the pandemic, it's a much, much bigger story, so that's why we broke it out. And as it relates to our revenue bridge, it represents over 90% of the variance. The remainder, as you note, is some customer mix and price. And as D.G. said, we've seen strengthening over the quarter, and we expect that into the future in terms of price inflation, albeit we've seen a little bit of softness as it compares to prior year. Yes. I would say that's probably paused a little bit with the pandemic, just with the focus with the PPE, but it's certainly still part of the acquisition strategy. And maybe since you brought up gross margin related, let me try to unpack it even a little bit further than we did in the prepared remarks. As we're not giving guidance, want to be as helpful as we can to everybody putting their models together. So as we've said in the prepared remarks, we've got 60%, which is COVID-related. So on 310 bps, that's roughly 180 bps unfavorable versus prior year. You've got NSSM, it's 30 bps. So there, it's 210 in total. And the remainder is cost/other and as D.G. mentioned, historically, going from Q2 to Q3, we would see a meaningful decline in terms of gross margin rate. This year, going \u2013 as it relates to Q3, we expect that to be mitigated somewhat for the following reasons. NSSM will no longer be a headwind, so we will gain that back. We also see the tariff cadence improving. So tariff-related cost inflation will improve a little bit. And then we see price inflation strengthening as well, and we expect that to continue into Q3. Now the big wildcard, of course, is the pandemic impact as it relates to gross margin. So that is really the wildcard in terms of what the actual gross margin rate will be for Q3. What we do expect, though, as we compare the gross margin rate to the prior year, we don't expect to be down 310 bps in the U.S. segment and 290 bps overall. We do expect improvement from that. So just wanted to give you that color to help you all with your modeling. Thanks. Thank you. Hi, Deane. We'd expect that dividend increase would be similar to what it has been in prior years, Deane. With respect to timing, we've been talking about it. And if something happens, it would probably happen in the third quarter. With respect to repurchasing shares, right now, with the spike and are we going to have a shutdown to with an abundance of caution, we really haven't resumed the buybacks, even though we are obviously generating robust cash flow. That, we would probably start to think a little bit harder at the end of Q3. And if we were going to do something, it would likely be in Q4, I would think. Well, just to reiterate, Hamzah, there's going to be some tailwinds, for sure, and that's the NSSM meeting, that's the cost tariffs and that's the strengthening pricing. We would also expect, as D.G. said, some of the money we paid to, let's say, air freight supply, we would expect that to likely go down as well. The bottom line is it's just so hard to predict something that's never happened before in terms of the pandemic. So I'll just reiterate. Historically, Q3 gross margin is less than Q2. Would not expect it to be that dramatic of a falloff in \u2013 as it has been historically. So I'll leave it at that. But we do expect that it will be significantly, from a bps perspective compared to prior year, not as down as 310 or 290 for the overall company. You're welcome. Yes. I mean, related to SG&A, I'll refer you back to the prepared remarks where we think, on a total company basis, SG&A will be between $715 million and $730 million. And that is a decrease, obviously, from prior year, but an increase from Q2 as the country starts to open up and we're spending more on travel, we're spending more on advertising. Those types of things. As it relates to decremental margin, if we were to see a volume decline from 5% to 10%, which is inconsistent with what we've seen so far, July to date, we would expect decremental margins to be in the 35% to 45% range, consistent with what we said last quarter. Obviously, if we continue at a mid-single-digit growth, then we would flip from decremental margins to incremental margins. And there, I think, depending on, again, and I have to keep \u2013 I apologize, I have to keep giving the qualifier of what the pandemic looks like. But depending on how the gross margin behaves, we could be around 20% plus/minus gross margins as long as the pandemic does not take a really harder hit on gross margin. And I'll just reiterate, it is lower than prior year, which was in the $760 million range. Can you repeat the question, please, Patrick? Yes, yes. Thank you. Yes, there was $115 million benefit deferral of federal income taxes, instead of paying our federal payments in April and June, like we did in the prior year, we pay them in July. You're welcome."

            "name": "D.G. Macpherson",
            "content": "Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. To say that this quarter was different and challenging would be an understatement. I am very proud of how our leadership and team members have stepped up to the challenge. Whether dealing with the pandemic or with social injustice issues, our team has been fantastic throughout this uncertain time. Let me start off by providing you with an update on our pandemic response and a brief overview of the quarter before turning it over to Tom to dive into the details. So starting with an update on the pandemic, the Grainger team continues to work tirelessly to keep the world working during this challenging time. As I outlined on our first quarter call, Grainger is an essential business, and our customers count on us to keep their businesses up and running. Our pandemic response is wrapped in three broad priorities: First, serve our customers well through this challenging time; second, support the needs and safety of our team members; and third, ensure we remain in a strong financial position. I'll provide a quick update on each point. First, our businesses remained open every day to serve our customers. I visited one of our DCs last week, and we have implemented several measures to protect the safety of team members and to ensure the continuity of our operations. We also recently reopened our branch showrooms to add to the curbside pickup service we have been operating throughout the pandemic. Our KeepStock team members continue to serve the vast majority of our customers. The exception would be some disruptive businesses where we've had to flip to alternate solutions. Throughout, our team is focused on customer and team member safety, including new protocols, temperature checks, space covering mandates and social distancing guidelines. This has certainly made operating more difficult, but we believe we have done very well with these changes. On the customer front, business reopenings and related activity continue to vary greatly based on industry and geography. Sales to health care, government and other essential businesses remained strong throughout the quarter. Sales to non-essential and disruptive businesses bottomed in April, and they've rebounded in May and again in June, although they still remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels. I'll talk about the pattern of revenue in a minute. Our supply chain has operated well throughout the pandemic although we have seen some lumpiness as we work to match supply with tremendous demand for some pandemic-related items. For most product categories, things have improved. But for some categories, global shortages will make supply a challenge throughout the balance of the year. Our team is working tirelessly to ensure supply for customers as the pandemic ebbs and flows. As we mentioned before, supporting the needs of our team members is a critical importance, especially during this period of uncertainty. Our team members are essential to serving our customers, and team member health and safety remains a priority. We have been fortunate to have absorbed the pandemic without major layoffs and currently have less than 3% of our workforce still on furlough. We have more team members who will return to work in the next few weeks. Having an experienced cohesive team will help us accelerate growth through the recovery. In addition, we remain vigilant around safety. Our team members give us great marks for making safety a priority as they support our customers. Finally, we have maintained a tight focus on our financial position throughout this period. On our Q1 call, I discussed our priority to preserve cash, including deferring action on certain capital projects, pausing our share repurchase program and drawing on our revolving credit facility. We continue to focus on cash preservation and have reduced non-essential SG&A spend by over $75 million sequentially in the quarter. That more than exceeds our $40 million to $55 million target set on the previous call. These actions helped us to finish the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in available liquidity. Since the business performed well in the quarter, we have begun to evaluate repaying part of the revolver and are assessing a potential dividend increase. Depending on the shape of the pandemic, we will see some sequential cost increases related to things like advertising, some travel and the reinstitution of merit increases. But we remain committed to managing expenses very closely given the uncertain path ahead. To be clear, we are managing costs well, but also investing for the future success of the business. We continue focusing balancing the long-term health of the company alongside our short-term operational needs. Turning to our quarterly results. The business remained resilient despite this unprecedented period. Our daily sales finished down 1.8% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, underpinned by heightened sales of pandemic-related items that nearly offset a mid-teen decline of non-pandemic-related sales. With the MRO market down 14% to 15% in the quarter, we gained a lot of share fueled by pandemic-related sales, selling to new customers and improving non-pandemic sales as the quarter progressed. Gross margins were pressured primarily due to pandemic impacts, which Tom will detail in a bit. A meaningful portion of this margin pressure is temporary in nature, what we don't know is how long the pandemic will last. Despite great SG&A performance, we have taken action to keep team members and customers safe that have added some short-term costs. Obviously, we're incurring expense to ensure we create safe work spaces and interact, but also doing things like expediting shipping and allocating product to lower-margin health care and government customers. To state the obvious, we have been focused on helping customers and communities as much as possible, which sometimes means we have added cost. We've produced $230 million of operating cash flow and $189 million of free cash flow. That's a solid result in this environment. Balancing the short-term with progress in strategic initiatives has been key. We continue to make progress on our key priorities. We are on plan to remerchandise an incremental $1.6 billion of our assortment this year. To support further acceleration of these activities, we plan to launch our new product information management system over the next month. We have made great strides in analytics and marketing capabilities, including upgrading internal talent to own more of the marketing activities. Our new customer information tools have enabled us to better match marketing and sales activities with new customers. We launched a new visual search application that is based on machine learning. We are getting great reviews on this solution. We are seeing continued traction with our KeepStock and other embedded customer solutions. We know that customers who have at least one embedded solution, including KeepStock and EDI Pro account for roughly 60% of our revenue. So this is an important customer segment. Here, we have upgraded our systems and processes to accelerate new installations and improve service on existing solutions. With our endless assortment model, MonotaRO continued to invest in technology and capacity to fuel their growth, while we have started to see the benefits of last year's investments at Zoro in the U.S. And lastly, we further refined our international high-touch footprint with the completed divestiture of Fabory, and we announced an agreement to divest Grainger China. This helps us simplify our footprint and focus our efforts on our core markets. Looking at Slide 6, I thought it would be important this quarter to show the underlying trends with pandemic and non-pandemic products based on our current categorization of SKUs. Over the last several weeks, I've been participating in virtual market visits with customers that were originally scheduled to be in person. I have talked with dozens of customers in several different industries to get a sense for how things are progressing. It's important to note that even for customers with strong revenue performance, there has been a disruption in normal activities. For example, our hospital system has been heroic in dealing with the pandemic and saving lives, and their pandemic product demand has been enormous. But many of their normal facilities maintenance projects have been put on hold through this time to focus on COVID, which means that even hospitals had lower non-pandemic sales through the last four months. There's a backlog of work that will need to be done in the future. But for now, customers in all industries are focusing on keeping people safe and recovery. In the U.S., we started to see increased pandemic sales in February, and they really picked up in March, where we quickly moved in-stock inventory. This trend continued with pandemic-related sales up around 70% in the second quarter. And while the environment remains fluid, this has continued at an accelerated rate into July. The heightened demand came from a multitude of customers across numerous industries with most of the pandemic products going to health care, government and essential businesses. Through most of March, non-pandemic sales were pretty stable. With the stay-at-home orders, we saw non-pandemic sales fall off significantly in late March, but they have gotten better each month since modeled out in April. We've seen further improvement in July. The good news is that we have seen a steady improvement in non-pandemic revenue across all customer types. It's still below pre-pandemic levels, but it has improved. While we don't know how this will progress, we do feel good about our ability to help customers weather the storm regardless of how the pandemic evolves. So with that, I will turn it over to Tom to take us through the quarter's results in detail. Tom? Thanks, Tom. Before we wrap up the call and go to questions, I want to touch on an important topic. The recent events of hatred and racism stand as reminders of the injustice in our world, and particularly for the African-American community. At Grainger, one of our core principles is to do the right thing. The right thing here seems fundamental: respect each other, embrace our differences and stand out for what is right. Remaining silent is not an option. Collectively, we need to be better. As a company, we know that diversity, inclusion and acceptance of our differences makes us stronger. This is central to our Grainger Edge principles and vital to our commitment to keep the world working. We have been encouraging our team members to have real conversations with each other about their background and identity, including the tough topics of race, gender, age and sexual orientation so that we can better know and understand each other. We know these conversations alone are not sufficient to solving the problem, and we need to collectively take action to ensure that economic opportunities are more plentiful for all. While we have work to do, we are committed to improving our talent and recruiting processes to root out bias, and we're committed to promoting diverse hiring opportunities. This includes giving clear metrics and visibility, ensuring equitable pay and helping team members address unconscious bias. We'll also continue to direct an arm of our charitable efforts to promote the educational advancement of those without privilege or access. I want to thank our team and our customers for performing so well through the pandemic. We are pleased with how we performed, and we remain committed to gaining share profitably and delivering strong results moving forward. Now with that, I'll open it up for questions. Sure. Thanks, David. I think they are the same things we've talked about in terms of being critical, and they really fall into two groups. One is improving our offer, our product assortment, our product information, our customer information. So we're rolling out a new product information management system. We are remerchandising a bunch of the assortment to make the experience better for our customers. We continue to invest in digital technology for our website. So that's kind of the first set of things we're doing. We've also increased our marketing effectiveness and reimproved our digital marketing, which is both \u2013 which really hits all customers within the Grainger model, the high-touch model, and that has been very effective. And we've reinvigorated our KeepStock and on-site solutions for customers. We have a good traction going into the fourth quarter of last year and the beginning of this year. Some of that's slowed down, but we still have new installs. We still have changed some installs for customers to help serve them during this time. And really we think that almost every large complex customer has either a digital solution that works for them or we help to manage inventory. And so we're pushing on those basics of on-site service to make sure we do that right. And all that is leading to a strong share gain within the U.S. business. Yes. We would expect that to be less chunky. And the reason is a lot of the investments we made over the last 15 months or so, mostly in 2019, were really about a fairly significant strategic change to expand the assortment in the millions of products. We passed the 4.4 million products available to customers online Mazuro recently, and we've got a great pipeline. That required us to do it very, very differently than we've done historically. And so those investments are behind us. And I would expect them to be less chunky. We have \u2013 for the next three to five years, we will continue to expand margins with that business as we grow, given where we positioned ourselves right now. Thanks. Appreciate it. Good morning. Well, so it's a great question, Ryan. Yes, there is \u2013 I mean, well, visibility in the traditional sense, I'm not sure. But certainly, if you look at our customer base, there are customers now who have planned, particularly PPE, into their process like they've never done it before. So you talk with customers. One customer told me they used to use 700 per day of a PPE item. Now they're going to use 40,000 per day, as an example. So given the awareness of the virus, we would expect elevated levels of pandemic product for the foreseeable future. Will it be as much as we've had? Probably not, although as we see cases rise, my guess is there will be pretty significant elevated levels of pandemic product moving forward. But I do think this has forced people to change the way they think about personal protection and think about some of these products and keeping team members safe. So we expect to see elevated product levels for at least the next 1.5 years and probably beyond. Yes. First, and I can turn it over to Tom. Margins were not surprising for us there, and they performed, clearly, better than the pandemic sales, because a lot of the pandemic sales are very large orders to large contract customers. So the margins were certainly better with non-pandemic. I would say that it's challenging. Our market assumption of down 14, 15 in the U.S. would assume that non-pandemic sales were down quite a bit more than that. And so we do believe we gain significant share in non-pandemic product as well. Getting that level of detail, looking at that \u2013 our model is almost impossible to do. And so I would say, don't really know. We think we gained share throughout all product categories. Whether we gained more or less share with non-pandemic is really, really hard to do. My guess is it's less, but still very strong. Yes, yes. The answer is, yes, we expect it going forward. I think the thing that's probably not easy to understand is \u2013 I spent some time with our customers recently in Canada, and our services improved dramatically there over the last couple of years. And coming off of the SAP installation and some other things, we had real challenging period there with service. And so I think a lot of this is just customers coming to realize that we're providing strong service, building better relationships, and we've taken the cost actions we have. So we feel like that business is poised to do much, much better. Obviously, they're going to be faced with some market challenges, but we feel like they're positioned to do better. And we've taken a lot of cost out, but we also continue to invest in pockets for growth. And we feel like from a share perspective, we can gain share and gain share profitably given our current position. Yes, we believe we can do that. And actually, we're starting to see that. So with government, health care, manufacturing, we're starting to get some traction there. And as that happens, we believe it can be a growth engine. We're obviously going to be very, very focused on profitability. But we do think there's going to be nice growth coming out, particularly the eastern part of Canada, and we've already started to see some of that underneath the numbers. And so we feel like \u2013 and you're right, it is running \u2013 we're running it more like the U.S., and that's helped our cost position. But the team up there is very focused on profitable growth. I think we've got a really strong leadership team up there and the sales organization now, and we're pretty excited about the path and the ability to grow consistently and grow profitably. It's a reasonable assumption. I think pandemic aside, how it evolves. But yes, we feel like \u2013 we felt like this year was going to be significant improvement. We started to see that in the first couple of months and then, of course, the world stopped. So we feel like we're well positioned when things do come back for it to be an inflection. No. Most of that is what we saw in the U.S. with pandemic. So large sales of pandemic items to government customers, some health care customers. That is \u2013 the majority of the aggressive pricing would have been to serve the pandemic. Well , the way I'm viewing it personally is, we \u2013 the world is a little unusual right now, right? So to say that you gained 1,200 basis points when you were down 2%, it seems like a strange thing to say. We think it's accurate analytically, but it's a little messy, right? Because we \u2013 it's hard to tell what's going on underneath that. We feel like we are gaining share. We feel like we're doing the right things. And we feel like our normal share gains, we'll be able to retain. There may be some of that that's hard to retain, of course, depending on sort of pandemic sales. But certainly, we feel good about it, but we don't \u2013 we're not taking it literally, if that's your question. Yes. So we saw an interesting dynamic with midsized customers during the quarter that has since reversed. And so let me talk about that for just a second. So with large customers, we ended up prioritizing a lot of pandemic efforts for large customers, hospitals and government customers, in particular, and essential manufacturing businesses and others distribution businesses. As a result of that, we held pandemic product from the website, in some cases, and you're seeing all the competitors do that. And we did see the midsized customers get hit harder during the initial shelter-in-place orders. What we've seen though is they've actually come back stronger. And so we're seeing very strong growth with midsized customers in the last six weeks, which is encouraging. We've acquired more new customers than we really ever had during this period because we've had product and many others haven't. And so we think we've got a very strong \u2013 a lot of headroom with midsized customers, we were, at one point, $1.8 billion, and we think we can get back to there and beyond over time. So we think we've got a long way to grow to have outgrowth with midsized customers. And the pandemic has been a strange period for everything, but we're now starting to see that growth come back in again. So I'll turn it over to Tom here in just a second. I would say we have made significant inventory investments to be able to get continuity of supply for our customers. So more than we obviously typically would, given some of the supply challenges that existed in the world, and that has been a working capital build. We would expect that build to stay throughout the remainder of this year and into next year before it starts to bleed off, but I'll turn it over to Tom. Yes. So great question. So I think I mentioned, we have a very strong pipeline, millions of products in the pipeline to add to Zoro. If you look over the last three or four years, you look at curves of new product adds and their productivity, remains a big part of the growth of Zoro. And in, let's call it, normal times, we would expect product adds over the next three to five years to be as much as half of the growth of the business. And so that's obviously an important growth driver. We have not seen any further cannibalization during this period than we've seen at other times between Zoro and Grainger. In fact, Zoro's growth has been \u2013 a lot of it's been very, very focused on very small customers during this time and getting them product they can't get elsewhere. So we're pretty excited about the pattern. I will say that both MonotaRO and Zoro have had higher acquisition than normal, and some of that acquisition has been consumers. We don't remarket to consumers. They do find as some \u2013 as people have been trying to find pandemic-related or really any product during this time. But the business acquisition has been stronger than normal, too, and that's really the important number to look at. So that's strong business acquisition, driven in part by product adds. Yes. We haven't really seen any change in pricing power. Our pricing \u2013 and Tom, I'll let you answer this. I will say our pricing, in normal years, we see GP trail off as the year goes along. This year is going to be not as much of that as we do see price get better, and we've seen it get better through the second quarter. And so we feel like we're going to get more price going forward. But Tom, do you want to answer? Yes. I guess, I'll give some thoughts. So Cromwell is \u2013 it is a business that is very much in our high-touch solutions model. It looks a lot like Grainger. They have executed, I think, while the last year, to put themselves in a position where they can grow and improve profitability dramatically. So the pandemic doesn't change our thoughts on the business. We've talked about sort of making sure we have a fast recovery of that business. We should be able to get very clear signs on the pace of that recovery coming out of this. So I'd say, happy with the team, happy with what they're doing. Service is really, really good there now and starting to win back some business, and they're starting to improve profitability, they've improved their cost position. I want to give that a chance to run out a little bit more. Obviously, the pandemic may slow that a little bit. But certainly, we still have high expectations for how they can turn it around there. Thank you. Good morning. Not at this point, we are not. Yes. So it's been a very unusual time for supply. I think the things that we've been really focused on are making sure we can get supply of high-quality products. So we do have to qualify suppliers. We have to decide whether or not the product meets our quality standards and actually does what it says it's going to do. And then we have to, in some cases, as Tom mentioned, yet you have to pay some upfront money, which typically would not happen, and we've done that in a number of cases. So it's a \u2013 and as this thing unfolded, it was a little bit like the Wild West in the sense that everybody claimed they had a solution, and oftentimes those solutions weren't real. And so we've had to work with our team in China and to work with our team in the U.S. to really understand the quality, the availability, the integrity of the supply, and that's been really important. I think we've done a nice job navigating that. But I expect that to weigh now in some categories that may remain. But generally, it's gotten a little bit easier lately. We have looked at that. And as you know, Masaya Suzuki is running that business at this point, the Zoro business, and he's been the CEO of \u2013 and still is the CEO of MonotaRO. The differences, if they exist, are relatively minor. We think that the Zoro business should be able to get to certainly high single-digit operating margins, which is very profitable from return on invested capital. And we've got our plans to go ahead and make that happen over the next several years. And so we feel really good about the profitability path of Zoro. So you're talking about opening our showrooms where we were only doing curbside for a while? Yes. So I would say that just rough math, walk-in traffic is about 10% of our volume or revenue, at least at this point. And what we see is we see a modest increase when we open the showrooms. It is \u2013 it should help margins because, typically, the profile of those customers are not generally contract customers, and it's usually higher-margin sales. So it will be modest for the overall growth profile, but it will help. And we've seen that already happen as we've opened those up. Yes. Given \u2013 I would say that given the \u2013 we're talking about every quarter, adding tens of suppliers. So it's not thousands of suppliers before, but it's tens of suppliers. But we have a line of sight into getting to 6 million or 7million SKUs at this point, and we feel like getting to $10 million is not all that difficult to do given the new processes we have in place. I will say that the MonotaRO business in Japan is about 20 million, roughly 20 million items. So we've done this before. We understand the process. And I think the team has done a great job of configuring to be able to step on the accelerator, and we have a very nice pipeline at this point. [Indiscernible] to Tom is we talked about adding travel costs back. That may sound a little odd in today's world. What we really mean there is we are now able to visit most of our customers. So we're talking about mileage reimbursement for our sales team, which will increase. It's not a huge number, but that's the type of cost add-back we would be having, is being able to engage with our customers, again, which we started to do. I think our assumptions change frequently now as the world changes. But certainly, right now, we would envision \u2013 all we really know is through the first three weeks, we're up about mid-single digits. Great. I'll keep this very short. Thanks for joining us today. Certainly, I think we'd all agree that there's probably more market uncertainty at any time in our careers. But hopefully, you see from our results that we think we're prepared to perform through whatever comes. We're excited to see some of the non-pandemic volume come back, and we're excited by the trends. And we're going to stay completely focused on our core business models and driving profitable share gain through our high-touch solutions model in North America and our analyst assortment business. So we're proud of where we are, what we've accomplished, and we're ready for the future. So thanks for joining us today, and I wish you all will stay safe."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, ma\u2019am. You may begin.\nIrene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's first quarter 2020 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, SVP and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q1 press release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results for the first quarter of 2020, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our press release. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.\nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin with an overview of our actions and experiences in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an overview of the quarter. Then Tom will get into more specifics about our financial response to the pandemic, as well as detailed information on our Q1 results. Before we start, I want to thank our 25,000 team members across the globe, who continue to live our principles and are working hard to achieve our purpose to keep the world working. We are an essential business supporting hospitals, governments, first responders, food manufacturers, distribution companies and many others that are fighting this fight on the frontlines. These are incredibly stressful times for all. From our team members who are onsite with our customers helping them work through day-to-day challenges, to those ensuring orders are picked, packed and shipped properly, I am proud of the work we are doing to keep our team members, customers and communities safe. I am also thankful for our supplier and logistics partners\u2019 efforts to help us provide much needed products to our customers in this desperate time of need. To make this come to life, I thought I would share a photo I received from one of our leaders at a branch located in Brooklyn, New York. This particular branch and its cross-borough partner in Maspeth, they are both situated in between a number of hospitals that are the epicenter of the pandemic fight. Each day, the teams at both locations dutifully come to work, hang the American flag and roll up their sleeves, and in their words, they do this to keep America running. It's this spirit that inspires me, makes me truly proud to lead this company and gives all of us hope in our ability to get through this crisis. Turning to Slide 5. Let me provide you with some color on the actions we have and continue to take in response to the pandemic. The biggest concern right now is our collective health and wellbeing. As a business, this is our absolute number one priority. When we look back on this crisis, it is how we will all be judged. With health as a primary focus, we have established three priorities during this challenge. First, we must continue to service our customers well. These are the customers that have so much to do with supporting the healthcare system and other critical industries in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Second, we must support team members by providing a safe environment and as much job continuity as possible. During this period, everyone is scared and we are trying to provide team members stability and safety. And third, we must ensure that we remain in a strong financial position in order to execute on our first two priorities and remain positioned to thrive when we move beyond this pandemic. We have and will continue to ground our decision-making process, with these three objectives in mind. Starting with the first, Grainger has been designated an essential business for all our locations around the globe, allowing us to continue to serve our customers and live out our purpose. In many cases, we are working side-by-side with hospitals, state and local governments and critical manufacturing businesses to ensure that they can keep doing their critical work. This has been a challenging period. The virus has created significant supply demand imbalances for PPE and other products, creating substantial challenges for our customers. We've had to make some tough choices about prioritization and the challenge will continue into the near future. But our team is working very hard to find solutions to help our customers. In some cases, this has meant being creative with product solutions in the short-term. We continue to be a valued partner to all our customers even as we prioritize the healthcare system. We started planning and responding to the pandemic in late January and established an emergency preparedness task force shortly thereafter. In the early days, our focus was on product supply. We executed large pre-buys of non-pandemic product, leveraging our extra capacity in Louisville to ensure we could supply our customers through this period. Our service levels of non-pandemic supplies continue to be strong. As it became clear that the pandemic would have a significant impact on all developed markets, we developed business continuity plans following guidance from the CDC, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the World Health Organization and federal and state governments. In many cases, we are going beyond that guidance, including temperature screening of all individuals prior to entering Grainger facilities. We have taken a number of preventative steps to protect our team members and customers, including minimizing exposure of affected team members to other team members and customers, augmenting the cleaning procedures at our facilities, introducing mandatory curbside service at all our branches, providing personal protective equipment for team members working onsite with customers, and mandating work-from-home for all our team members who are able, including our phone service and technical support agents. We were able to pivot quickly to work-from-home for team members who are able to do that and we have not missed a beat. In addition, we moved our National Sales Meeting to a virtual meeting after canceling the conference in Florida. We appreciate the flexibility our team members have demonstrated as we implement these solutions. Throughout this, I continue to receive many letters and calls of thanks from customers and I am inspired with how the Grainger team is taking care of our customers and each other during this challenging time. I have also received many calls from customers who need solutions that we and no one else can fulfill right now. Stress in the system is extremely high, as you might imagine. On the supply chain front, our world-class supply chain has remained resilient. As I mentioned, we have had minimal disruptions to date on non-pandemic related items. We continue to maintain high levels of inventory and are leveraging our strong relationships with our suppliers and transportation partners to secure products and ensure we meet our same-day ship complete delivery promise as regularly as possible. Like others around the globe, we continue to see shortages and stock-outs of critical pandemic-related items, including N95 masks, sanitizers and other PPE. We are working diligently with our suppliers, alongside our government and healthcare customers to secure as much product as possible, as well as trying to identify and source suitable alternatives. To give you a sense of the magnitude of the problem, in several weeks time, we received orders for the same quantity of safety masks that we usually receive over several years, and in some cases, even decades. This is truly an unprecedented challenge and getting America back to work is essential. Let me assure you that Grainger is holding true to our values. We will continue to work with customers and supplier partners to find the best solutions on all pandemic products, we are honoring our contracts and did not raise prices, unless necessary, to recover our increased costs. Moving to our second priority, we are committed to making decisions with team members' best interest in mind. Grainger is a sound business with a longstanding belief in the need to have a stable workforce to serve customers and keep the world working. When we emerge from the pandemic, we want to ensure that we are well positioned with an experienced team to accelerate growth through the recovery. While we don't yet know the full financial impact of COVID-19, we have contingency plans in place for any eventuality. In the short term, we have furloughed a small portion of our workforce and reduced hours for others. In both cases, with the enhanced CARES Act, we are focused on keeping our team members as close to hold as possible. Beyond this, we have delayed merit increases for salaried employees and have instituted short-term pay cuts for executives. Our incentive plans will adjust based on market conditions. Our goal is to keep our team members employed over the long haul, treated fairly and working during this time. Our third priority, which Tom will cover in detail is around maintaining our financial strength. In short, we are well positioned with an exceptionally strong balance sheet and a robust liquidity position. We are prepared for a multitude of scenarios and have already implemented changes focused on cash flow in the near-term. Our strong financial position should enable us to withstand even the most challenging economic and market environments, while allowing continued investment through the cycle. Stepping back, these three objectives do naturally create some tension. As you can imagine, given the size of our workforce, we have had cases of COVID-19 within our facilities. In each case, team members' safety is our top priority. That means we have had to shift volumes across our network as we temporarily closed buildings to deep clean the facility and quarantine any exposed team members. We are also paying DC branch and KeepStock team members a ship premium, recognizing their great work and commitment during this challenging time. As a result, we are running at higher unit cost than normal in our DCs and elsewhere to ensure we serve our customers to our high standards and help get America and the world back on its feet. Lastly, and before we move on, given the uncertainty around the depth and duration of this pandemic and the related economic response, we are suspending guidance for 2020. As you might imagine, we have customers that are completely closed. We have customers who are operating under reduced volumes. We have customers operating normally. And we have customers who are running 24/7. With all these moving pieces, it doesn't make sense to forecast in this environment. While we can't guarantee the future, we've weathered storms in our long history before and have already started planning for the recovery whenever it may come. This will require us all to think differently as we and our customers are changed by this pandemic. There is a lot to learn and I believe much opportunity ahead. As we move forward, we will continue to evaluate all actions to ensure we are meeting our priorities to serve our customers, support our team members and ensure we remain in a strong financial place. Turning to our quarterly results. We delivered strong topline growth in the quarter, while navigating through this period of uncertainty. We achieved daily sales growth of 5.7% underpinned by traction on our growth priorities and heightened sales of pandemic related items. In the U.S. segment, we outgrew the MRO market by approximately 700 basis points. Excluding estimated pandemic-related sales, which is inherently messy calculation, we were in line with our goal of 300 basis points to 400 basis points of outgrowth versus the market. So we had a strong topline outcome. Operating margins were pressured by factors including the timing of certain SG&A investments, pandemic-related mix impacts, business unit mix impacts as well as the timing of year-over-year pricing and cost actions. Tom will cover the details in a bit. We produced strong cash flow in the first quarter, including $244 million of operating cash flow and $194 million of free cash flow and finally, we continue to make progress on our 2020 priorities. Our remerchandising efforts continued in the quarter as we work to further improve product and search information. We continue to improve the efficacy of our marketing initiatives Our endless assortment business grew 17% underpinned by resilient performance at MonotaRO and SKU additions at Zoro. Masaya Suzuki our new leader of the endless assortment portfolio and his team are implementing the MonotaRO playbook across Zoro and are closely looking at a number of areas for improvement, most notably, around discounting strategy and other opportunities to improve profitability. Our turnaround efforts in both Canada and Cromwell performed in line with our expectations despite turbulent market conditions. And while we have curtailed non-essential spending in certain areas, we will continue to invest where it matters most. Most importantly, we continue to improve the user experience in our core businesses with customer feedback coming in extremely strong. As we look forward, we will focus on what we can control and make decisions based on facts. The business is well positioned to sustain through this pandemic and I am confident we will come out stronger on the other side. With that, I will turn it over to Tom.\nThomas Okray: Thanks, D.G. As D.G. mentioned, we have established three broad priorities that are serving as the backbone as we work through this unprecedented challenge. Our third decision-making tenet is to ensure we remain on a strong financial footing. In this regard, we have taken several actions to bolster an already strong financial position. From a balance sheet perspective, in the quarter, we increased the size of our revolver to $1.25 billion and executed a large scale refinancing. Combined, these initiatives increased our available liquidity by roughly $625 million and eliminated all material near-term maturities. At the end of March, we proactively tapped $1 billion of the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. As noted by our strong balance sheet and operating cash flow results, this was done solely out of an abundance of caution. In this low rate environment, it's an inexpensive insurance policy. Further, with the refinancing, we consolidated a majority of our foreign currency denominated debt, which pushed out any material maturities until 2025. Our revolver does not contain any financial covenants and we continue to have strong A category ratings from both S&P and Moody's. All in, we exited the quarter with over $1.7 billion in available liquidity, including $1.5 billion in cash and only a 1.2x net debt leverage ratio. When it became clear that we might be facing a serious economic downturn, we proactively began implementing initiatives that conserve cash and optimize profitability. To be clear, the initiative strike a balance between short-term cost and cash savings and ensuring we come out of the gates strong when the crisis ends. Example of these baseline initiatives, include temporarily furloughing team members to align with reduced volumes, short-term pay cuts for executives, delaying merit increases for our salaried workforce in North America, reducing outside professional service spend, scaling back advertising spend, eliminating non-essential travel and delaying hiring decisions. We expect these baseline initiatives and the lapping of certain Q1 items will create $40 million to $55 million of sequential cost savings in the second quarter of 2020 even one accounting for an increased level of cost to support our pandemic response. We have also identified several additional initiatives that can be implemented depending on volume levels. We are staying nimble and monitoring sales trends, cash position, and working capital closely. Additionally, we are deferring certain discretionary capital expenditures and now expect our full-year 2020 CapEx spend to be between $150 million and $175 million. This is down from our previous expectation of $250 million. With respect to working capital, we are working closely with our customers and suppliers to maintain our strong relationships, while ensuring a manageable cash conversion cycle. To date, we haven't seen a material change in delinquencies or bad debt. Further, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. However, to preserve financial flexibility, we have paused our share repurchase program. As for the dividend, we remain committed to the program and do not currently foresee where we would reduce or suspend its payment. We understand the importance of achieving our 49th consecutive year of dividend increases. While it's difficult in this environment to forecast the future, from a cash perspective, we have modeled multiple scenarios that reflect varying depth and duration cases of volume loss. Given what we are able to see now, we are confident that we will have adequate liquidity to support our business operations through this pandemic. We have a strong reputation of managing well through difficult times and we expect this crisis will be no different. Based on what we know today, we are confident that we will emerge from this pandemic as a trusted partner to our customers and suppliers and are well-suited for the recovery.  As we turn to our detailed quarterly results and think about the financial impact that COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business, it's very challenging to specifically quantify. There are numerous moving pieces, including sales of pandemic-related SKUs, determining substitute products, impact of customer capacity cuts or closures and identification of customer pre-buying. All of these combined makes it challenging to pinpoint the specific impact of the pandemic on our financials. Therefore, as I go through our financial results, I will share estimated directional commentary on the impact. As noted on Slide 9. For the total company, daily sales were up 5.5% in the quarter, 5.7% on a constant currency basis. This was driven by around 7% increase in volume offset by an approximately 2% headwind from price. Roughly half of the price headwind is due to product and customer mix with the other half related to lapping of the 2019 price increase. For the total company, we estimate the pandemic-related product sales represented roughly half of our sales growth. Additionally, for perspective, it should be noted, our core U.S. and endless assortment businesses combined grew at 7.3% on a daily basis during the quarter. Gross profit margin for the total company was down 180 basis points versus the prior year quarter. This decline is driven by customer and product mix headwinds and our U.S. segment largely related to sales of pandemic-related items as well as business unit mix from higher growth in our lower margin endless assortment business. Gross margin rates are much more stable when we are looking sequentially. We gained 20 basis points of SG&A leverage with cost up $47 million versus prior year as we continue to make investments to support our strategic priorities. As previously communicated, we generally expect SG&A spend to grow at approximately half the sales rate. For the quarter, our SG&A growth was higher than this annual target by approximately $20 million. This $20 million is driven by additional headcount that was added in the back half of 2019 incremental marketing investments, which will be reduced going forward and heightened spend to support our pandemic response efforts. Additionally, we were impacted by non-recurring and timing items, including an extra payroll day and one-time costs for certain legal matters. These impacts more than offset lower travel and variable compensation costs as well as favorable depreciation and amortization in the current year period. Excluding these non-recurring and unusual items, we were directionally in line with our plan from a cost perspective, which assumed elevated SG&A costs in the first quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $244 million, which we use to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we used $178 million on share repurchases and dividends and had total capital expenditures of $50 million. Even in our current difficult economic times, we continue to invest prudently in our business, all while maintaining a healthy 1.2x net debt leverage ratio. Operating cash flow was 106% of net adjusted earnings and return on invested capital was over 29%. Overall, U.S. segments daily sales grew 5.7% in the quarter or about 700 basis points faster than the broader MRO market. Sales growth in the quarter included approximately 8% volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable price of around 2%. Roughly half of the price headwind is due to customer and product mix with the other half related to the lapping of 2019 price increase. In the U.S. segment, we estimate that pandemic-related product sales represented roughly half of our sales growth. Gross margin was 230 basis points unfavorable to the prior year. The variance was driven largely by two primary factors. About half is related to lapping of 2019 pricing and cost actions and the other half is related to unfavorable product and customer mix. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter 2019 earnings call, we expected our Q1 2020 number to face difficult comparisons to the prior year period as we aggressively raised prices to combat expected tariff inflation increases in the first quarter of 2019. We acknowledged that we overshot the mark and rolled back prices throughout 2019. Additionally, tariff cost-related increases didn't actually take effect until later in 2019 and thus created a second half headwind in Q1 2020. Looking sequentially, we did see positive price inflation in this quarter compared to Q4 2019. Going forward, we expect this tough year-over-year comparison will lessen in the back half of 2020. The remaining portion of the year-over-year gross margin decline resulted from customer and product mix headwinds, which were exacerbated by sales of lower margin pandemic-related items to larger low margin customers. We expect these mix-related headwinds to continue during the pandemic as we sell increased levels of safety and cleaning products to our large healthcare, government and critical manufacturing customers. This FX will become even more pronounced in the second quarter as we expect the more dramatic mix impact that we saw in the March to continue through Q2. In the quarter, we also had unfavorable mix related to our multi-site customer growth strategy. As we discussed on the Q4 call, this impact will be temporary and will continue throughout fiscal year 2020. From an SG&A perspective, we gained 30 basis points of leverage with costs increasing $30 million in the quarter. This level of increase was caused by many of the factors I outlined earlier, including incremental headcount added in the second quarter of 2019 as well as marketing investments, cost to support our pandemic response and an extra payroll day. Operating margin was strong at 15%, but declined 200 basis points in the quarter on the declining gross profit margin, which was offset by slight increase in SG&A leverage experienced in the quarter. Turning specifically to the U.S. MRO market, while extremely difficult to project in this environment, we estimate the U.S. MRO market declined between 1% and 1.5% in the first quarter. Grainger was able to capture approximately 700 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter well above our objective to consistently grow 300 basis points to 400 basis points above market, aided by sales of pandemic-related items. Even when excluding the pandemic sales contribution, we were still well within our targeted range demonstrating consistent traction of our growth initiatives. Moving on to the other businesses. Daily sales increased 8.5% or 8.8% on a constant currency basis. Growth was driven by continued expansion of our endless assortment business, which was up a combined 17% on a daily basis between both Zoro and MonotaRO. Both businesses continue to grow rapidly and benefited from an uptick in pandemic-related sales albeit a much smaller impact than we saw with our U.S. business. Gross profit margin declined 60 basis points in the quarter driven by business unit mix from the faster growing endless assortment businesses as well as deeper discounting in a higher mix of drop-ship activity at Zoro U.S. We continue to achieve SG&A leverage in the first quarter, resulting in operating margin increase of 80 basis points. This stems largely from decreased expenses at Cromwell and leveraged an endless assortment. Cromwell performed unplanned in Q1 and was able to half its losses from the first quarter of 2019. These results were largely before the pandemic shutdown activity across Europe. We took an impairment charge on our Fabory business, reflecting continued gross profit and a flat to declining EBITDA against the backdrop of industrial sector declines across Europe. This was further amplified by the long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic among other factors. Turning to Slide 13. Daily sales decreased 6.1% or 5% on a constant currency basis, comprised of roughly 4% decline in volume and price headwind, which includes customer mix of approximately 1%. Foreign exchange created 110 basis point headwind. Overall operating margins were up 110 basis points as gross profit margin was roughly flat to the prior year period, and SG&A was favorable 110 basis points as cost management drove significant leverage. Looking forward, in addition to the pandemic, Grainger Canada is also combating extremely low oil prices given its more concentrated natural resource customer base, which will drive further headwinds into the second quarter. Before I turn it back to D.G., I want to provide you with some insights into what we are seeing through the first few weeks of April. From a sales perspective, as of April 21, we are seeing year-over-year declines of approximately 10% on a constant currency total company basis with dramatic differences by end-market, product categories and customer size. Not surprisingly, our healthcare essential manufacturing and pockets of government are growing significantly faster year-over-year and we are seeing rapid declines elsewhere in areas such as hospitality and heavy manufacturing. On the product side, safety and cleaning supplies are significantly up year-over-year with most other categories down some dramatically. To be clear, this is what we are seeing through the first 15 business days of the month and not meant to be construed as guidance for the quarter. As in Q1, these customer and product mix items will continue to impact our GP margins. Further, Q2 will be impacted by the change in format of our National Sales Meeting, which will create a year-over-year headwind to gross profit margin of approximately 40 basis points to 50 basis points for the U.S. segment in the second quarter. For the year, the national meeting impact will be a drag on gross profit margin, but will be roughly flat for the year on an operating margin basis given travel and event-related cost savings. With that, I will turn it back to D.G. for some final thoughts.\nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, Tom. We have a strong business and balance sheet as well as access to capital and we are taking proactive steps to keep the company healthy and our workforce stable, while continuing to serve our customers well. We take being an essential business very seriously and we are committed to living our purpose and being that critical partner for our customers throughout this pandemic and beyond. While this crisis is certainly different from any that we've experienced, I am confident that Grainger will come away from the stronger than before, and we\u2019ll be positioned to lead this industry for years to come. Now we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Hope everyone is well.\nDonald Macpherson: Good morning.\nThomas Okray: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Merkel: So first off, thanks for the color on April. But I guess high level, and I realize that visibility is low in April guidance. But anything you can help us with in terms of the outlook, maybe thoughts on a range of industry declines this year? Or maybe comment on if 2019 is a good framework in your mind for 2020 or if there is major differences?\nDonald Macpherson: Well, I think it's \u2013 as Tom said, forecasting right now is very difficult. I think we can say what we are seeing. And as I mentioned, we have some customers that are mostly shutdown. We do, do a lot of work with airlines, which obviously, aren't as busy, cruise lines, as you might guess. As you get into some of the sub-industries, you see very big differences. Obviously there's a bunch of customers that are very, very busy. I think one thing I would say is that the world is not shutdown necessarily and you can see it in our daily volumes. We've been very consistent in the last few weeks and we've been fairly resilient. But it does take on different numbers by different sub-segments. I think the question for us is how long it's going to take to get back and depending on who you talk to, whether it's an epidemiologists or an economists, that could be relatively short or really long. And so there's just uncertainty around that. So Ryan, I would not even try to forecast that. We feel like we are taking the right actions to make sure that we maintain profitability throughout any scenario and we are confident in our ability to gain share. One thing that we didn't talk about, that's kind of interesting is we are seeing a very healthy flow of new customers, given the pandemic requests and we feel like we are going to come out of this with a nice customer file increase as well. But right now, it's really difficult to forecast beyond sort of this month and next month, and it will just be how fast back to work that's going to determine.\nRyan Merkel: Yes. That's fair. I thought I'd ask. All right. And then second, I was hoping SG&A was going to offset the decline in gross margins quarter a little bit better. I know you talked about it a little bit, but just pinpoint for us what exactly happened? It seems to me like you're not making much profit on these pandemic sales, so maybe talk about that. And then, is most of this a timing issue with the price cost and the higher SG&A? And then these trends should start to get a little bit better in 2Q? Just help us with that.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So let me take \u2013 I mean, so there's a gross profit and SG&A component to your question. And I'll turn it over to Tom in a minute. From a gross profit perspective, on the pandemic items, we made a decision, which is we're going to help the healthcare infrastructure and help government customers. That decision means, in a scarce supply world, we're basically providing product to contract customers and those products generally are lower margin to begin with. So that does have an impact on gross profit and a fairly significant one in the quarter. It\u2019s the right thing to do. It's absolutely the right thing to do. That's going to relieve over time a little bit because there's going to be more product and there's going to be more customers hopefully that open up and that we can serve. So on the gross profit side, that certainly was an impact, which we'll see in the second quarter. But I think over time that will relieve some. SG&A is a little bit simpler. Over half of our SG&A increase was basically one-time or unusual items. And we feel like growing SG&A half the rate of sales growth is a very comfortable place for us to be going forward given what we know other than the one timers. I'll turn it over to Tom to provide a few details on that one.\nThomas Okray: Yes. So let me add just a little bit more color, Ryan. So let's first of all start with gross profit margin. As we said in our prepared remarks, we went heavy on pricing in Q1 of fiscal year 2019 and then we rolled that back throughout the year. So to your point, that pricing compare will get better throughout the year. Also from a cost perspective, if you just look at how the tariffs behave on a year-over-year basis, the two big tariffs for us are Part 3 and Part 4A. And from a year-over-year impact for Part 3, in fiscal year 2019, the tariff was 10% in Q1, it's 25% in Q1 this year. If we look at 4A, there was no tariff and there's 15% or 7.5%. So that is the tariff impact that we saw on Q1. That also will get better throughout the year as we fully realize the lapping of our tariffs. It will also get better from the realization of our non-tariff cost increases. Let me move to SG&A and unpack it a little bit better than we did in the prepared remarks. We were up $47 million on a total company basis, which is a 6.4% increase. If you do look at the one-time items and that includes, one-time legal matters, the extra payroll day. We also had some benefits issue where we were lapping prior year adjustments and some other one-time costs. D.G. said over 50%, it was actually closer to 60% of the $47 million. So if you adjust that out, we really grew 2.7%, which gets into about half of the sales growth. The increase of the 2.7% is on items where we have said that we are investing related to advertising, technology and adding headcount in the back half. Now having said that, we noted in the prepared remarks that we are scaling back on advertising, we are taking a stronger look on costs in terms of taking $40 million to $55 million out sequentially versus Q1. And then the final thing I'll say is I want to be clear that we did also have additional cost to serve the pandemic in terms of over time pandemic pay, cleaning supplies, and those types of items. But the big story in SG&A is the one-time as well as the investment cost, which we will roll back in the second quarter. Sorry for the long winded answer, but it was a broad question. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Manthey of Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Grainger used to give us growth ranges across customer end markets on a monthly basis. And just given the circumstances, is there any chance that we could get general growth rates for March across the end markets on Slide 17? \nDonald Macpherson: We'll get back to you on that. It might be more valuable to give you ranges on April frankly than March.\nDavid Manthey: Yes. Okay.\nDonald Macpherson: We'll get back to you on that and decide whether or not we're going to do any of that. I would say it's \u2013 if you saw it, it would not be all that surprising. As I mentioned before, there are certain segments, sub-segments that are down tremendously and almost 90%, 70%. And there are certain that are up significantly, and they would be exactly the ones you think. So I don't think you'd be surprised by any of it, but we'll talk about whether or not we're going to provide that as we go through the pandemics.\nDavid Manthey: I appreciate it. And second, you saw really nice growth in endless assortment, which was also an area of recent investment. Did you say that half of the 17% growth rate was COVID related?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. That's the U.S. That's the Zoro. Yes. Now let me just give a little bit of caveat to that. If you do it on a product basis, that's true. But even customers that are heavy COVID product buyers, spent less on other things as the month went on. And so it's a bit of a rough estimate. So I don't want to over index on that. We feel like we want to be very careful about saying how much was COVID. But certainly from a product perspective, that's true.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks guys. Good morning. Really appreciate the detail. I just wanted to just pick up on the SG&A. Obviously, you've provided a lot of good detail on that already. But as we go into 2Q and if sales continue to trend down 10%. I mean, who knows, but we expect that 50% of sales growth or sales declines to hold, D.G. or Tom? Do the impacts of some of these sequential improvements in cost such as the \u2013 I think you mentioned $40 million, $50 million of sequential declines in costs. Does that mean that SG&A could be down a bit more than that? Just wondering how we should think about SG&A going forward for the rest of the year?\nDonald Macpherson: Tom, do you want to take that one?\nThomas Okray: Sure. Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Nigel. I think it depends Nigel on how much we see the volume going down quite frankly. If volume is going to stay where it's at in terms of 10%, we're probably not going to pull the more draconian levers in terms of cost reduction. It goes deeper than that. Then we've got a number of initiatives in the playbook ready to pull it. If you look at the high side of the range we gave Nigel, that $55 million sequentially would translate to year-over-year, almost 3% reduction. We'd also get some volume variable cost reduction in addition to that. So I think it's going to be a meaningful SG&A reduction for Q2. But we're watching this on a daily basis and trying to really thread the needle in terms of which levers we pull related to the volume reduction.\nNigel Coe: Got it. That's helpful. And threading the needle is what we're trying to do so. I understand that. And then just on the mix factor, again, you spent a lot of time talk about mix, but the one point of mix pressure you saw in 1Q, we all get it, we understand what's driving that. What would that normally be? Because obviously, the national accounts outgrowth, normally, we're facing some mix pressures. What would that normally be? Where does that reside? Does it normally reside within the price buckets or the volume buckets? And then how does mix \u2013 how do you think mix will trends to \u2013 again, I hate to be so short-term here, but do you think mix pressures accelerates into 2Q or remained pretty steady?\nThomas Okray: Yes. I mean, you're talking specifically Nigel about gross profit or you're talking about sales revenue.\nNigel Coe: Talking here about \u2013 well, I guess both, I mean, mix impacts, mainly gross margin, but whatever is the better answer.\nThomas Okray: Yes. If you look at it from a revenue perspective, we've actually got some customer mix component, which is in volume, but the majority of it is going to fall into price. We mentioned in our prepared remarks, the multi-site customers, but that was a much smaller part of the mix component. The primary part of it was our lower margin healthcare and government customers. That was the big driver of the customer mix.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I would just add to that, Nigel that we very recently, like the last few days, we started to get inquiries from midsized customers thinking about restarting. They've been on fairly hard shutdown. So that has been a negative mix depending on how fast some of those midsized customers come back. The mix issues could be alleviated a bit. We would expect though for the next \u2013 certainly for April, and probably for a lot of May, we would expect some of those mixed pressures, and then hopefully as everybody gets back to work, we would see those does alleviate.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Glynn: Thank you. Good morning. Just if we look at Zoro and/or Zoro and MonotaRO, I\u2019m curious about the possibility of a net benefit this year with the online effect actually benefiting from distancing? Or otherwise, if there's maybe a divergent experience of the COVID recession for the endless assortment versus the U.S. segment?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So I can take that one. So Japan has not had yet a hard shutdown like some of the other markets we've seen. Certainly we've seen the online model there do very, very well. In Zoro, in the U.S., Zoro has done quite well as well. And in particular from a new customer acquisition, as new customers look for different solutions that are digital, we're seeing a very strong new customer pipeline coming into Zoro. We also see a lot of that going on to the Grainger online as well from \u2013 on grainger.com. So there is certainly a shift to digital and we think we're well positioned for that shift, both with assortment model, but also with grainger.com, which is an exceptional solution for industrial businesses. So we feel like we're well positioned for that shift.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And on the U.S. segment, half of the growth was non-pandemic and the absolute gross gotten better as the benchmark slowed down, certainly the spread, curious if you think more of that is for the \u2013 due to the price per share dynamics on the large contracts enacted last year or if it's more broadly the Grainger system and market penetration tail on the heels of the 2017 resets.\nDonald Macpherson: I think it's everything that we're doing. I think it's the growth initiatives we've talked about. We're getting good results out of merchandising, nice results and more efficient marketing. We've added some focus to our KeepStock. So we're providing more inventory management solutions for customers. I think, very little of it is actually the price dynamic and more of it is the actions that we're taking to drive growth.\nThomas Okray: Yes, I guess the one thing that I would add that might be helpful color is when you look at our share gain, we said it was 700 bps outgrowth in Q1, if you look at it in March, it was significantly higher than that, almost double share gain in terms of March, which would lead you to potentially conclude that when times get really tough, the good things that we're doing, the customers are coming to us and allowing us to take share.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Uhlman: Hi guys. Good morning. Hope the whole team is healthy. I had a follow-up question on the gross margin discussion for the second quarter. Understand there are a lot of moving pieces and thanks for the detail on the national sales meeting for the headwind there. But any way that we could frame how much further down we should be bracing for the gross margin to slip in the second quarter? I mean, are we talking about a couple of hundred basis points of this mix headwind we're seeing in April persist?\nThomas Okray: Yes, sure. It's really hard to predict, Adam, because we have good guys happening in terms of the compare of the price inflation going down materially in the second quarter. We've also got better lapping in terms of inflation, non-tariff inflation and tariffs inflation. So those are really good things. It's just so hard to predict the pandemic of how much of an offset. And it really comes back to D.G.'s point is when are the other non-pandemic businesses really going to start to come back to work. So we've got a big chunk of tailwinds. It's just we don't know how big the headwind would be, not trying to be evasive, it's just hard to call the ball right now.\nAdam Uhlman: Okay, got it. And then just on a different topic, any way to frame how much of your customer base is closed right now? And then secondly, there's probably some customers that are restricting access for vending or what have you, any broad sense of how much your sales force is limited right now? Thanks.\nDonald Macpherson: Yeah. So we have a number of customers that we cannot get into refill vending ourselves, but we flipped most of them to customer managed inventory. Most of those customers have people working. I would say it's very difficult to say how many are really closed, but certainly it's \u2013 a portion of the business is really closed. As I said, if we looked in the four groups, the ones that are really busy right now, you kind of say 10-40-40-10, meaning 10% are really busy, 40% are less impacted essential businesses, 40% are non-essential but they're really \u2013 they are working on some sort of reduced schedule, and 10% roughly are what we would call disrupted. And so those are businesses that have a significant disruption right now, that aren't doing a whole lot. They may not be fully closed, but for all intents and purposes, they're closed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. First question is for Tom. And it's the outlook on free cash flow for the year just in terms of the playbook for industrial distributors, typically you'd be selling down from inventory with lower demand that typically gives you a boost on free cash flow conversion, maybe you're also pulling back some CapEx, but just kind of give us the dynamics there from a free cash flow perspective.\nThomas Okray: Yes. Good morning, Deane. Yes, we feel really good about our free cash flow. If you look at our cash conversion cycle, despite us working with customers to be constructive in terms of payment terms, we were actually better by four days versus the prior year quarter. So we feel that we're managing working capital really well. As it relates to the destocking of inventory, frankly, that's not the playbook we're running. We're positioned for the future here. When the recovery starts to happen, and those customers start coming back, we want to make sure that we're able to provide the benefit to them. We feel that we're uniquely positioned with our balance sheet and our liquidity to be able to really come out of the gate strong when the market takes off.\nDeane Dray: That's a helpful ending for that answer because that's what I'd like to ask D.G. about, and not asking about the timing of the recovery, because no one really knows at this stage. But D.G., you suggested there'd be ways that Grainger would come out stronger, you've added customers, but I'm also interested in what you think changes about the business in terms of your customer base, their inventory levels that will carry. I mean, it used to be just in time, now it's more some buffer inventory just in case maybe you have to do more cleaning of your DCs, just the dynamics of what changes on the other side, both from customer behavior, maybe adding more customers and maybe some incremental costs as just standard business going forward. Thanks.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So thanks, Deane. I said you can't predict what's going to happen. My assumption is that, for a while, we're going to be in a situation where we have to be careful around the virus on some level even if businesses are back to work. And so over the short to mid-term, I think there's going to be a lot of questions around, do we have the right stock of cleaning supplies and PPE to make sure we can actually work. And so we're already talking to customers, talking with customers about how to come back to work and how can we help them, think about how to come back to work. And so that's going to be a big, big topic. Whether or not we turn to more buffer inventories or not is debatable. We've had shocks in the past and it hasn't changed behavior. This one feels like it could. So I'm guessing that we are going to be in a position where we're helping customers think more about inventory stocks than we have in the past for certain products. I still think that, us managing inventory and keeping inventory levels down is going to be an important topic for most customers going forward. But certainly there is going to be some industries that are very, very different and there's going to be some that are new, and we're going to have to navigate through that and we've already started talking about that. In terms of our own business, I think we're all going to have to be more careful. We're thinking differently about how our buildings are configured. Most of our distribution centers have been designed to bring people into lunch rooms, for example, for camaraderie. Well, right now, that doesn't make as much sense. And so we're talking about, well, how do we view \u2013 how do we have multiple lunch box. There's just all kinds of details that we're working through that are going to change. And I think it's \u2013 we're just going to have the same priorities, keep our team members safe, serve our customers well, do it responsibly and that's going to be the focus. And we have a team of pandemic team that's working on all those operational issues right now and how to get back to work and how we operate in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.\nJohn Inch: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. D.G., I'm wondering, given the new Fabory write-downs, if you could update us on your strategic thoughts on retaining or divesting either Cromwell or Fabory. How are you thinking about that framework, particularly against what's happening in the economy?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes, I mean, we're always evaluating the portfolio and looking at whether or not we should be investing or not in businesses. Now is no different. We continue to look at all of our businesses and we can't comment obviously on specific actions that we plan to take. But certainly, we are looking at businesses. Those two businesses are important ones to look at. One thing I would point out is, it's kind of interesting, Cromwell and Canada both, before the pandemic, in the quarter, actually were on expectations, which was good to see. So we actually were getting a little bit of traction with both of those businesses, which was great. And then of course, the world changed. And for Cromwell, we're excited to see if we can continue on a strong path and Canada as well. So I would say, we continue to look at those portfolio, we'll continue to do that consistently.\nJohn Inch: Yes. That's fine. I appreciate the answer, I had thought perhaps you had put them on kind of a timeline, if my memory serves, you're going to sort of wait for the trend to profit or whatever. Just as a follow-up, I'm wondering if you could also comment on Zoro. Obviously it's done really well and, period, could take a lot of virtual share coming out of this. I'm just wondering like how you're thinking about the pandemic in the context of possibly maybe monetizing that business down the road, maybe along with just like the whole endless assortment. Does this, in theory, push that out or does it pull forward, or does it not really have much of any impact thus far?\nDonald Macpherson: It's going to have a \u2013 obviously, who knows, but I don't see in terms of how long this lasts. But I think that it doesn't have a lot of impact to our timing. So Masaya Suzuki is running MonotaRO, he's been the CEO of MonotaRO, he now is in charge of Zoro in both the UK and U.S. They are working very hard to improve the profitability and growth rates of both of those businesses. We're seeing good traction. At some point, that question may become more near-term, but right now, they're really focused on improving the business and working together to make sure we do that. So that's the focus right now.\nJohn Inch: Thank you very much.\nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Patrick Baumann of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Baumann: Thanks. Good morning, D.G. Good morning, Tom. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDonald Macpherson: Hi, Patrick.\nPatrick Baumann: Hi. Just the first one, maybe within the 10% decline in April date. Just curious if you could provide a range of growth you're seeing in safety and cleaning supplies or whatever you consider to be pandemic-related, and then how long a tail you see on that demand, if you look at the backlog of request for those products. And then, it would also be helpful on those lines to understand like what percentage of your business is pandemic-related products or what you consider could be that?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So we haven't released those numbers. Pandemic-related items are, I wouldn't say, way up, silly numbers, in the backlog is even sillier than that, to be frank. So I mentioned it on the call, I mentioned it on the prepared remarks, we literally took orders for decades worth of product in a few days in some cases. And so we continue to get product in. We continue to prioritize. We've had to change our processes for those items and depends how much I guess you feel \u2013 the length of time that we have increased sales of pandemic items depends in large part on whether or not you believe the backlog is real. In many cases it is real, depending on what happens. Some of that might not happen. But certainly we have a big backlog of those products and continue to \u2013 we'll continue to sell those. Pandemic is a minority of the total product, but it's not a small minority. It's a significant portion of what we're selling, normally cleaning and safety and our big product categories for us in general.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay. And then just a follow-up would be on margins. In the first quarter, you had lower margins despite higher sales for all the reasons that you discussed. I'm just wondering if you could give any color on what kind of range we should be thinking about for decremental margins if sales are down, say 10%. I think last downturn, decrementals were only like 20%, but this one seems a little bit different. So just curious how you think about that.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. Tom, you want to take that one?\nThomas Okray: Sure. Decremental margin is an interesting calculation especially in the pandemic, just because there are \u2013 assumptions are so related to volume deterioration and gross margin. You referenced 2008 or 2009, there is a little bit of a nuance there where I don't think it's apples to oranges, as you said, we had big pricing impact back in 2008 and 2009, which, when dated, the decremental margin. If you're looking at 10% down with a range of, I guess, a reasonable gross margin, I could see decremental margins being 45% to maybe 50% down, and that's largely driven by \u2013 if it's only 10% down, we're probably not going to do those draconian cost initiatives. On the other hand, if we start to get for a more severe downturn with a longer duration, then we would go to our cost initiative playbook that we've got ready and pull more of the SG&A cost initiatives and there I could see the decremental margin being 35% to 40%. So it's really highly sensitive on what you're assuming. Hopefully that's helpful to give you a range.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Dankert of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Dankert: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Positive I missed it. Did you stake out what national account growth was in the quarter? Just any update you can give on kind of the C-suite executive sales growth initiatives. I assume you've had a lot more touch points in the midst of the virus, but maybe to less access, so just any comments on that national accounts growth plan.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes, I think we've seen solid growth. We've had a number of wins. I think any first quarter number is going to be inflated due to the pandemic, because all of our healthcare business is basically on corporate accounts. But we continue to see good traction with our corporate accounts and coming out of this, we think we're going to be in a position to get growth up and share gain up with those national accounts. I would say there's no real change in terms of the strategy. We have had a number of wins and we feel very confident about the path we're on with our corporate accounts.\nChristopher Dankert: Got it. If I could just sneak one last one in here. Circling back to Zoro really quickly, Masaya has been on board for two, three months now. Just any color on sort of the biggest investment opportunities or optimization he may have highlighted. Has anything changed there? Just high level thoughts on where we're going strategically there?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes, I think there is some significant changes. I think the team is thinking hard about discounting strategy, when to run targeted discounts versus big promotions, my guess is we will move to more targeted discounts, lower discount rates for acquisition, spending a lot of time thinking about which customers. We're attracting and getting the attractive business customers and what actually it takes to win those and get those to be consistent purchasers. And so I think the team is really working hard on those things and the size is certainly helping them think through a whole range of issues around how to grow but how to grow with improved thoughts.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. Hope you're all safe and healthy. My first question is just on medium customers. What are you hearing there? I know you referenced most of them are shutdown, but any update on strategy to gain share there and whether in a downturn, you had mentioned you've \u2013 historically you've gained share, does that also apply on the medium customer base or is that sort of different versus large customers?\nDonald Macpherson: No, I think it really applies for mid-sized customers. I think that \u2013 so certainly we've seen more impact in mid-sized customers, more of those customers have been closed. That said, we continued to see nice returns from our marketing activity with mid-sized customers and our inventory position and our ability to provide strong service typically works very, very well in this situation and we would expect these customers to come back on, that we will be able to acquire more which we've been doing and also increase volumes pretty significantly. So we're pretty excited about that path. As I mentioned, we're starting to get, inquiries from mid-sized customers about, can you help us, that are new. And new mid-sized customers, can you help us get back up and running? And that's really exciting to see and so we're going to work very hard to capitalize on that.\nHamzah Mazari: Great. And my follow-up question is on Zoro and you may have touched on this, so I apologize if it's repetition, but how independent is that supply chain today from parent company GWW and any thoughts on re-segmenting that for more visibility? Is it sort of a different tech platform than sort of the parent business? Any thoughts as to independence of that business today versus years ago and then sort of, I know it's buried in other businesses, but any thoughts on re-segmentation? Thank you.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So let me answer both of those. The first one, a lot of the investments we've made in the last year have gotten Zoro a lot more independence and so while they still rely on Grainger supply chain in many cases, they are becoming less and less reliant as they have other partners that provide delivery service for them to their customers. And so a lot of what we're doing is making that business more independent and operating it more similar to what MonotaRO does, which is to leverage multiple third-parties for low volume items to really drive the growth. In terms of segments, we will follow SEC guidelines and we will think through segments during this year and we'll get back to you by the end of the year if there's going to be any difference.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael McGinn of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael McGinn: Thanks, appreciate the time. If I can go back to the margin discussion real quick, the $40 million to $55 million of SG&A savings identified, is that a fixed numbers or does that include also some flex down as a percent of sales?\nThomas Okray: It includes some amount of flex down but not fully all of the flex down. So we would expect that we would get additional volume variable over and above the $40 million to $55 million.\nMichael McGinn: Okay. So assuming the $40 million to $55 million, you're thinking about a 728 base, plus you're saying additional percentage of sales savings. So that would put us somewhere in \u2013 I think my back of the envelope math, in 8% operating margin, which is 200 basis points below the 2009 trough. Is that the way to think about this for just this downturn as it stands without the additional actions faced too?\nThomas Okray: I think the way to think about SG&A, let's just take the $55 million SG&A reduction at the high end. If you compare that, what we did in Q2 for SG&A, that would be roughly a $20 million reduction or about 3%. Now depending on where volume tracks to, you're going to get some additional volume variables. So I would look at it as you're going to get 3-plus percent in terms of SG&A reduction versus the prior year.\nMichael McGinn: Okay. And then just quickly on the PPE, you mentioned large sales, blanket purchase orders, have you collected deposits for those or are those tangible or how do you see those progressing throughout the year?\nDonald Macpherson: Well, it depends. I mean for most orders in the backlog, we would not have deposits collected. For large special orders, we would often have deposits collected. But in terms of the backlog, we don't typically get payment until we actually ship and bill.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question today will be coming from Justin Bergner of G.research. Please go ahead, sir.\nJustin Bergner: Hi, D.G. and Tom, and thanks for fitting me in. Good work on everything the company is doing. I guess what hasn't been covered, which stood out was the retail sales up mid-20s. Are you seeing sort of an acceleration there besides the COVID-19 demand? How large as a percent of your business is that? Again, are the margins there mix dilutive when you normalize for sort of COVID-19 product or they mix similar or mix accretive?\nDonald Macpherson: Well, so retail for us typically is serving distribution centers that serve retail and so we have very large customers that are e-commerce players typically that would fall in there. That is slightly mix dilutive as a customer group, certainly, but it's also a very important customer group. And so what we're talking about there is typically serving the industrial side of retail as opposed to retail stores. And most, right now, what we've seen is almost all e-commerce traffic as you probably realize is way up. And so our business to distribution centers that are serving that e-commerce traffic is way up.\nJustin Bergner: Got it. Good work there. And then just a follow-up question is on the SG&A cost being higher in the quarter. Did some of that flow through corporate unallocated costs? Because that's going to be up materially year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Were there any other dynamics there in the corporate cost market?\nThomas Okray: No, I would \u2013 it was about \u2013 half of that was flowing through the corporate unallocated. And if you adjust for that, we're very comparable to last year in the corporate unallocated. And in terms of looking at it on a full year basis, we should not be materially different in the corporate unallocated. So it's a good question, Justin. Half of that was corporate unallocated.\nOperator: Thank you. This brings us to the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to D.G. for closing comments.\nDonald Macpherson: Great. Well, thanks for joining us today. I really hope all of you are safe and healthy. I just want to reiterate that we are doing everything we can to help. And helping the health crisis first is the most important thing so that we can all get back to work. We've taken a lot of action to ensure that we can continue to operate, serve our customers very well during this time, keep our team members safe and make sure we're in a strong financial position. We view this as, certainly a short term threat, but we view it as a long term opportunity. We think we're going to come out of this stronger, we think we're going to gain customers. We think we're going to find all kinds of new opportunities coming out of this and we are already starting to work those and we already have some get-to-work plans already in place. So we're really excited about the future. Thank you for spending the time with us and really appreciate that and please be safe and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s event.

            "content": "Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin with an overview of our actions and experiences in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an overview of the quarter. Then Tom will get into more specifics about our financial response to the pandemic, as well as detailed information on our Q1 results. Before we start, I want to thank our 25,000 team members across the globe, who continue to live our principles and are working hard to achieve our purpose to keep the world working. We are an essential business supporting hospitals, governments, first responders, food manufacturers, distribution companies and many others that are fighting this fight on the frontlines. These are incredibly stressful times for all. From our team members who are onsite with our customers helping them work through day-to-day challenges, to those ensuring orders are picked, packed and shipped properly, I am proud of the work we are doing to keep our team members, customers and communities safe. I am also thankful for our supplier and logistics partners' efforts to help us provide much needed products to our customers in this desperate time of need. To make this come to life, I thought I would share a photo I received from one of our leaders at a branch located in Brooklyn, New York. This particular branch and its cross-borough partner in Maspeth, they are both situated in between a number of hospitals that are the epicenter of the pandemic fight. Each day, the teams at both locations dutifully come to work, hang the American flag and roll up their sleeves, and in their words, they do this to keep America running. It's this spirit that inspires me, makes me truly proud to lead this company and gives all of us hope in our ability to get through this crisis. Turning to Slide 5. Let me provide you with some color on the actions we have and continue to take in response to the pandemic. The biggest concern right now is our collective health and wellbeing. As a business, this is our absolute number one priority. When we look back on this crisis, it is how we will all be judged. With health as a primary focus, we have established three priorities during this challenge. First, we must continue to service our customers well. These are the customers that have so much to do with supporting the healthcare system and other critical industries in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Second, we must support team members by providing a safe environment and as much job continuity as possible. During this period, everyone is scared and we are trying to provide team members stability and safety. And third, we must ensure that we remain in a strong financial position in order to execute on our first two priorities and remain positioned to thrive when we move beyond this pandemic. We have and will continue to ground our decision-making process, with these three objectives in mind. Starting with the first, Grainger has been designated an essential business for all our locations around the globe, allowing us to continue to serve our customers and live out our purpose. In many cases, we are working side-by-side with hospitals, state and local governments and critical manufacturing businesses to ensure that they can keep doing their critical work. This has been a challenging period. The virus has created significant supply demand imbalances for PPE and other products, creating substantial challenges for our customers. We've had to make some tough choices about prioritization and the challenge will continue into the near future. But our team is working very hard to find solutions to help our customers. In some cases, this has meant being creative with product solutions in the short-term. We continue to be a valued partner to all our customers even as we prioritize the healthcare system. We started planning and responding to the pandemic in late January and established an emergency preparedness task force shortly thereafter. In the early days, our focus was on product supply. We executed large pre-buys of non-pandemic product, leveraging our extra capacity in Louisville to ensure we could supply our customers through this period. Our service levels of non-pandemic supplies continue to be strong. As it became clear that the pandemic would have a significant impact on all developed markets, we developed business continuity plans following guidance from the CDC, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the World Health Organization and federal and state governments. In many cases, we are going beyond that guidance, including temperature screening of all individuals prior to entering Grainger facilities. We have taken a number of preventative steps to protect our team members and customers, including minimizing exposure of affected team members to other team members and customers, augmenting the cleaning procedures at our facilities, introducing mandatory curbside service at all our branches, providing personal protective equipment for team members working onsite with customers, and mandating work-from-home for all our team members who are able, including our phone service and technical support agents. We were able to pivot quickly to work-from-home for team members who are able to do that and we have not missed a beat. In addition, we moved our National Sales Meeting to a virtual meeting after canceling the conference in Florida. We appreciate the flexibility our team members have demonstrated as we implement these solutions. Throughout this, I continue to receive many letters and calls of thanks from customers and I am inspired with how the Grainger team is taking care of our customers and each other during this challenging time. I have also received many calls from customers who need solutions that we and no one else can fulfill right now. Stress in the system is extremely high, as you might imagine. On the supply chain front, our world-class supply chain has remained resilient. As I mentioned, we have had minimal disruptions to date on non-pandemic related items. We continue to maintain high levels of inventory and are leveraging our strong relationships with our suppliers and transportation partners to secure products and ensure we meet our same-day ship complete delivery promise as regularly as possible. Like others around the globe, we continue to see shortages and stock-outs of critical pandemic-related items, including N95 masks, sanitizers and other PPE. We are working diligently with our suppliers, alongside our government and healthcare customers to secure as much product as possible, as well as trying to identify and source suitable alternatives. To give you a sense of the magnitude of the problem, in several weeks time, we received orders for the same quantity of safety masks that we usually receive over several years, and in some cases, even decades. This is truly an unprecedented challenge and getting America back to work is essential. Let me assure you that Grainger is holding true to our values. We will continue to work with customers and supplier partners to find the best solutions on all pandemic products, we are honoring our contracts and did not raise prices, unless necessary, to recover our increased costs. Moving to our second priority, we are committed to making decisions with team members' best interest in mind. Grainger is a sound business with a longstanding belief in the need to have a stable workforce to serve customers and keep the world working. When we emerge from the pandemic, we want to ensure that we are well positioned with an experienced team to accelerate growth through the recovery. While we don't yet know the full financial impact of COVID-19, we have contingency plans in place for any eventuality. In the short term, we have furloughed a small portion of our workforce and reduced hours for others. In both cases, with the enhanced CARES Act, we are focused on keeping our team members as close to hold as possible. Beyond this, we have delayed merit increases for salaried employees and have instituted short-term pay cuts for executives. Our incentive plans will adjust based on market conditions. Our goal is to keep our team members employed over the long haul, treated fairly and working during this time. Our third priority, which Tom will cover in detail is around maintaining our financial strength. In short, we are well positioned with an exceptionally strong balance sheet and a robust liquidity position. We are prepared for a multitude of scenarios and have already implemented changes focused on cash flow in the near-term. Our strong financial position should enable us to withstand even the most challenging economic and market environments, while allowing continued investment through the cycle. Stepping back, these three objectives do naturally create some tension. As you can imagine, given the size of our workforce, we have had cases of COVID-19 within our facilities. In each case, team members' safety is our top priority. That means we have had to shift volumes across our network as we temporarily closed buildings to deep clean the facility and quarantine any exposed team members. We are also paying DC branch and KeepStock team members a ship premium, recognizing their great work and commitment during this challenging time. As a result, we are running at higher unit cost than normal in our DCs and elsewhere to ensure we serve our customers to our high standards and help get America and the world back on its feet. Lastly, and before we move on, given the uncertainty around the depth and duration of this pandemic and the related economic response, we are suspending guidance for 2020. As you might imagine, we have customers that are completely closed. We have customers who are operating under reduced volumes. We have customers operating normally. And we have customers who are running 24/7. With all these moving pieces, it doesn't make sense to forecast in this environment. While we can't guarantee the future, we've weathered storms in our long history before and have already started planning for the recovery whenever it may come. This will require us all to think differently as we and our customers are changed by this pandemic. There is a lot to learn and I believe much opportunity ahead. As we move forward, we will continue to evaluate all actions to ensure we are meeting our priorities to serve our customers, support our team members and ensure we remain in a strong financial place. Turning to our quarterly results. We delivered strong topline growth in the quarter, while navigating through this period of uncertainty. We achieved daily sales growth of 5.7% underpinned by traction on our growth priorities and heightened sales of pandemic related items. In the U.S. segment, we outgrew the MRO market by approximately 700 basis points. Excluding estimated pandemic-related sales, which is inherently messy calculation, we were in line with our goal of 300 basis points to 400 basis points of outgrowth versus the market. So we had a strong topline outcome. Operating margins were pressured by factors including the timing of certain SG&A investments, pandemic-related mix impacts, business unit mix impacts as well as the timing of year-over-year pricing and cost actions. Tom will cover the details in a bit. We produced strong cash flow in the first quarter, including $244 million of operating cash flow and $194 million of free cash flow and finally, we continue to make progress on our 2020 priorities. Our remerchandising efforts continued in the quarter as we work to further improve product and search information. We continue to improve the efficacy of our marketing initiatives Our endless assortment business grew 17% underpinned by resilient performance at MonotaRO and SKU additions at Zoro. Masaya Suzuki our new leader of the endless assortment portfolio and his team are implementing the MonotaRO playbook across Zoro and are closely looking at a number of areas for improvement, most notably, around discounting strategy and other opportunities to improve profitability. Our turnaround efforts in both Canada and Cromwell performed in line with our expectations despite turbulent market conditions. And while we have curtailed non-essential spending in certain areas, we will continue to invest where it matters most. Most importantly, we continue to improve the user experience in our core businesses with customer feedback coming in extremely strong. As we look forward, we will focus on what we can control and make decisions based on facts. The business is well positioned to sustain through this pandemic and I am confident we will come out stronger on the other side. With that, I will turn it over to Tom. Thanks, Tom. We have a strong business and balance sheet as well as access to capital and we are taking proactive steps to keep the company healthy and our workforce stable, while continuing to serve our customers well. We take being an essential business very seriously and we are committed to living our purpose and being that critical partner for our customers throughout this pandemic and beyond. While this crisis is certainly different from any that we've experienced, I am confident that Grainger will come away from the stronger than before, and we'll be positioned to lead this industry for years to come. Now we will open it up for questions. Good morning. Well, I think it's \u2013 as Tom said, forecasting right now is very difficult. I think we can say what we are seeing. And as I mentioned, we have some customers that are mostly shutdown. We do, do a lot of work with airlines, which obviously, aren't as busy, cruise lines, as you might guess. As you get into some of the sub-industries, you see very big differences. Obviously there's a bunch of customers that are very, very busy. I think one thing I would say is that the world is not shutdown necessarily and you can see it in our daily volumes. We've been very consistent in the last few weeks and we've been fairly resilient. But it does take on different numbers by different sub-segments. I think the question for us is how long it's going to take to get back and depending on who you talk to, whether it's an epidemiologists or an economists, that could be relatively short or really long. And so there's just uncertainty around that. So Ryan, I would not even try to forecast that. We feel like we are taking the right actions to make sure that we maintain profitability throughout any scenario and we are confident in our ability to gain share. One thing that we didn't talk about, that's kind of interesting is we are seeing a very healthy flow of new customers, given the pandemic requests and we feel like we are going to come out of this with a nice customer file increase as well. But right now, it's really difficult to forecast beyond sort of this month and next month, and it will just be how fast back to work that's going to determine. Yes. So let me take \u2013 I mean, so there's a gross profit and SG&A component to your question. And I'll turn it over to Tom in a minute. From a gross profit perspective, on the pandemic items, we made a decision, which is we're going to help the healthcare infrastructure and help government customers. That decision means, in a scarce supply world, we're basically providing product to contract customers and those products generally are lower margin to begin with. So that does have an impact on gross profit and a fairly significant one in the quarter. It's the right thing to do. It's absolutely the right thing to do. That's going to relieve over time a little bit because there's going to be more product and there's going to be more customers hopefully that open up and that we can serve. So on the gross profit side, that certainly was an impact, which we'll see in the second quarter. But I think over time that will relieve some. SG&A is a little bit simpler. Over half of our SG&A increase was basically one-time or unusual items. And we feel like growing SG&A half the rate of sales growth is a very comfortable place for us to be going forward given what we know other than the one timers. I'll turn it over to Tom to provide a few details on that one. We'll get back to you on that. It might be more valuable to give you ranges on April frankly than March. We'll get back to you on that and decide whether or not we're going to do any of that. I would say it's \u2013 if you saw it, it would not be all that surprising. As I mentioned before, there are certain segments, sub-segments that are down tremendously and almost 90%, 70%. And there are certain that are up significantly, and they would be exactly the ones you think. So I don't think you'd be surprised by any of it, but we'll talk about whether or not we're going to provide that as we go through the pandemics. Yes. That's the U.S. That's the Zoro. Yes. Now let me just give a little bit of caveat to that. If you do it on a product basis, that's true. But even customers that are heavy COVID product buyers, spent less on other things as the month went on. And so it's a bit of a rough estimate. So I don't want to over index on that. We feel like we want to be very careful about saying how much was COVID. But certainly from a product perspective, that's true. Tom, do you want to take that one? Yes. I would just add to that, Nigel that we very recently, like the last few days, we started to get inquiries from midsized customers thinking about restarting. They've been on fairly hard shutdown. So that has been a negative mix depending on how fast some of those midsized customers come back. The mix issues could be alleviated a bit. We would expect though for the next \u2013 certainly for April, and probably for a lot of May, we would expect some of those mixed pressures, and then hopefully as everybody gets back to work, we would see those does alleviate. Yes. So I can take that one. So Japan has not had yet a hard shutdown like some of the other markets we've seen. Certainly we've seen the online model there do very, very well. In Zoro, in the U.S., Zoro has done quite well as well. And in particular from a new customer acquisition, as new customers look for different solutions that are digital, we're seeing a very strong new customer pipeline coming into Zoro. We also see a lot of that going on to the Grainger online as well from \u2013 on grainger.com. So there is certainly a shift to digital and we think we're well positioned for that shift, both with assortment model, but also with grainger.com, which is an exceptional solution for industrial businesses. So we feel like we're well positioned for that shift. I think it's everything that we're doing. I think it's the growth initiatives we've talked about. We're getting good results out of merchandising, nice results and more efficient marketing. We've added some focus to our KeepStock. So we're providing more inventory management solutions for customers. I think, very little of it is actually the price dynamic and more of it is the actions that we're taking to drive growth. Yeah. So we have a number of customers that we cannot get into refill vending ourselves, but we flipped most of them to customer managed inventory. Most of those customers have people working. I would say it's very difficult to say how many are really closed, but certainly it's \u2013 a portion of the business is really closed. As I said, if we looked in the four groups, the ones that are really busy right now, you kind of say 10-40-40-10, meaning 10% are really busy, 40% are less impacted essential businesses, 40% are non-essential but they're really \u2013 they are working on some sort of reduced schedule, and 10% roughly are what we would call disrupted. And so those are businesses that have a significant disruption right now, that aren't doing a whole lot. They may not be fully closed, but for all intents and purposes, they're closed. Yes. So thanks, Deane. I said you can't predict what's going to happen. My assumption is that, for a while, we're going to be in a situation where we have to be careful around the virus on some level even if businesses are back to work. And so over the short to mid-term, I think there's going to be a lot of questions around, do we have the right stock of cleaning supplies and PPE to make sure we can actually work. And so we're already talking to customers, talking with customers about how to come back to work and how can we help them, think about how to come back to work. And so that's going to be a big, big topic. Whether or not we turn to more buffer inventories or not is debatable. We've had shocks in the past and it hasn't changed behavior. This one feels like it could. So I'm guessing that we are going to be in a position where we're helping customers think more about inventory stocks than we have in the past for certain products. I still think that, us managing inventory and keeping inventory levels down is going to be an important topic for most customers going forward. But certainly there is going to be some industries that are very, very different and there's going to be some that are new, and we're going to have to navigate through that and we've already started talking about that. In terms of our own business, I think we're all going to have to be more careful. We're thinking differently about how our buildings are configured. Most of our distribution centers have been designed to bring people into lunch rooms, for example, for camaraderie. Well, right now, that doesn't make as much sense. And so we're talking about, well, how do we view \u2013 how do we have multiple lunch box. There's just all kinds of details that we're working through that are going to change. And I think it's \u2013 we're just going to have the same priorities, keep our team members safe, serve our customers well, do it responsibly and that's going to be the focus. And we have a team of pandemic team that's working on all those operational issues right now and how to get back to work and how we operate in the future. Yes, I mean, we're always evaluating the portfolio and looking at whether or not we should be investing or not in businesses. Now is no different. We continue to look at all of our businesses and we can't comment obviously on specific actions that we plan to take. But certainly, we are looking at businesses. Those two businesses are important ones to look at. One thing I would point out is, it's kind of interesting, Cromwell and Canada both, before the pandemic, in the quarter, actually were on expectations, which was good to see. So we actually were getting a little bit of traction with both of those businesses, which was great. And then of course, the world changed. And for Cromwell, we're excited to see if we can continue on a strong path and Canada as well. So I would say, we continue to look at those portfolio, we'll continue to do that consistently. It's going to have a \u2013 obviously, who knows, but I don't see in terms of how long this lasts. But I think that it doesn't have a lot of impact to our timing. So Masaya Suzuki is running MonotaRO, he's been the CEO of MonotaRO, he now is in charge of Zoro in both the UK and U.S. They are working very hard to improve the profitability and growth rates of both of those businesses. We're seeing good traction. At some point, that question may become more near-term, but right now, they're really focused on improving the business and working together to make sure we do that. So that's the focus right now. Thanks, John. Hi, Patrick. Yes. So we haven't released those numbers. Pandemic-related items are, I wouldn't say, way up, silly numbers, in the backlog is even sillier than that, to be frank. So I mentioned it on the call, I mentioned it on the prepared remarks, we literally took orders for decades worth of product in a few days in some cases. And so we continue to get product in. We continue to prioritize. We've had to change our processes for those items and depends how much I guess you feel \u2013 the length of time that we have increased sales of pandemic items depends in large part on whether or not you believe the backlog is real. In many cases it is real, depending on what happens. Some of that might not happen. But certainly we have a big backlog of those products and continue to \u2013 we'll continue to sell those. Pandemic is a minority of the total product, but it's not a small minority. It's a significant portion of what we're selling, normally cleaning and safety and our big product categories for us in general. Yes. Tom, you want to take that one? Yes, I think we've seen solid growth. We've had a number of wins. I think any first quarter number is going to be inflated due to the pandemic, because all of our healthcare business is basically on corporate accounts. But we continue to see good traction with our corporate accounts and coming out of this, we think we're going to be in a position to get growth up and share gain up with those national accounts. I would say there's no real change in terms of the strategy. We have had a number of wins and we feel very confident about the path we're on with our corporate accounts. Yes, I think there is some significant changes. I think the team is thinking hard about discounting strategy, when to run targeted discounts versus big promotions, my guess is we will move to more targeted discounts, lower discount rates for acquisition, spending a lot of time thinking about which customers. We're attracting and getting the attractive business customers and what actually it takes to win those and get those to be consistent purchasers. And so I think the team is really working hard on those things and the size is certainly helping them think through a whole range of issues around how to grow but how to grow with improved thoughts. No, I think it really applies for mid-sized customers. I think that \u2013 so certainly we've seen more impact in mid-sized customers, more of those customers have been closed. That said, we continued to see nice returns from our marketing activity with mid-sized customers and our inventory position and our ability to provide strong service typically works very, very well in this situation and we would expect these customers to come back on, that we will be able to acquire more which we've been doing and also increase volumes pretty significantly. So we're pretty excited about that path. As I mentioned, we're starting to get, inquiries from mid-sized customers about, can you help us, that are new. And new mid-sized customers, can you help us get back up and running? And that's really exciting to see and so we're going to work very hard to capitalize on that. Yes. So let me answer both of those. The first one, a lot of the investments we've made in the last year have gotten Zoro a lot more independence and so while they still rely on Grainger supply chain in many cases, they are becoming less and less reliant as they have other partners that provide delivery service for them to their customers. And so a lot of what we're doing is making that business more independent and operating it more similar to what MonotaRO does, which is to leverage multiple third-parties for low volume items to really drive the growth. In terms of segments, we will follow SEC guidelines and we will think through segments during this year and we'll get back to you by the end of the year if there's going to be any difference. Well, it depends. I mean for most orders in the backlog, we would not have deposits collected. For large special orders, we would often have deposits collected. But in terms of the backlog, we don't typically get payment until we actually ship and bill. Well, so retail for us typically is serving distribution centers that serve retail and so we have very large customers that are e-commerce players typically that would fall in there. That is slightly mix dilutive as a customer group, certainly, but it's also a very important customer group. And so what we're talking about there is typically serving the industrial side of retail as opposed to retail stores. And most, right now, what we've seen is almost all e-commerce traffic as you probably realize is way up. And so our business to distribution centers that are serving that e-commerce traffic is way up. Great. Well, thanks for joining us today. I really hope all of you are safe and healthy. I just want to reiterate that we are doing everything we can to help. And helping the health crisis first is the most important thing so that we can all get back to work. We've taken a lot of action to ensure that we can continue to operate, serve our customers very well during this time, keep our team members safe and make sure we're in a strong financial position. We view this as, certainly a short term threat, but we view it as a long term opportunity. We think we're going to come out of this stronger, we think we're going to gain customers. We think we're going to find all kinds of new opportunities coming out of this and we are already starting to work those and we already have some get-to-work plans already in place. So we're really excited about the future. Thank you for spending the time with us and really appreciate that and please be safe and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you."

            "name": "Thomas Okray",
            "content": "Thanks, D.G. As D.G. mentioned, we have established three broad priorities that are serving as the backbone as we work through this unprecedented challenge. Our third decision-making tenet is to ensure we remain on a strong financial footing. In this regard, we have taken several actions to bolster an already strong financial position. From a balance sheet perspective, in the quarter, we increased the size of our revolver to $1.25 billion and executed a large scale refinancing. Combined, these initiatives increased our available liquidity by roughly $625 million and eliminated all material near-term maturities. At the end of March, we proactively tapped $1 billion of the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility. As noted by our strong balance sheet and operating cash flow results, this was done solely out of an abundance of caution. In this low rate environment, it's an inexpensive insurance policy. Further, with the refinancing, we consolidated a majority of our foreign currency denominated debt, which pushed out any material maturities until 2025. Our revolver does not contain any financial covenants and we continue to have strong A category ratings from both S&P and Moody's. All in, we exited the quarter with over $1.7 billion in available liquidity, including $1.5 billion in cash and only a 1.2x net debt leverage ratio. When it became clear that we might be facing a serious economic downturn, we proactively began implementing initiatives that conserve cash and optimize profitability. To be clear, the initiative strike a balance between short-term cost and cash savings and ensuring we come out of the gates strong when the crisis ends. Example of these baseline initiatives, include temporarily furloughing team members to align with reduced volumes, short-term pay cuts for executives, delaying merit increases for our salaried workforce in North America, reducing outside professional service spend, scaling back advertising spend, eliminating non-essential travel and delaying hiring decisions. We expect these baseline initiatives and the lapping of certain Q1 items will create $40 million to $55 million of sequential cost savings in the second quarter of 2020 even one accounting for an increased level of cost to support our pandemic response. We have also identified several additional initiatives that can be implemented depending on volume levels. We are staying nimble and monitoring sales trends, cash position, and working capital closely. Additionally, we are deferring certain discretionary capital expenditures and now expect our full-year 2020 CapEx spend to be between $150 million and $175 million. This is down from our previous expectation of $250 million. With respect to working capital, we are working closely with our customers and suppliers to maintain our strong relationships, while ensuring a manageable cash conversion cycle. To date, we haven't seen a material change in delinquencies or bad debt. Further, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. However, to preserve financial flexibility, we have paused our share repurchase program. As for the dividend, we remain committed to the program and do not currently foresee where we would reduce or suspend its payment. We understand the importance of achieving our 49th consecutive year of dividend increases. While it's difficult in this environment to forecast the future, from a cash perspective, we have modeled multiple scenarios that reflect varying depth and duration cases of volume loss. Given what we are able to see now, we are confident that we will have adequate liquidity to support our business operations through this pandemic. We have a strong reputation of managing well through difficult times and we expect this crisis will be no different. Based on what we know today, we are confident that we will emerge from this pandemic as a trusted partner to our customers and suppliers and are well-suited for the recovery.  As we turn to our detailed quarterly results and think about the financial impact that COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business, it's very challenging to specifically quantify. There are numerous moving pieces, including sales of pandemic-related SKUs, determining substitute products, impact of customer capacity cuts or closures and identification of customer pre-buying. All of these combined makes it challenging to pinpoint the specific impact of the pandemic on our financials. Therefore, as I go through our financial results, I will share estimated directional commentary on the impact. As noted on Slide 9. For the total company, daily sales were up 5.5% in the quarter, 5.7% on a constant currency basis. This was driven by around 7% increase in volume offset by an approximately 2% headwind from price. Roughly half of the price headwind is due to product and customer mix with the other half related to lapping of the 2019 price increase. For the total company, we estimate the pandemic-related product sales represented roughly half of our sales growth. Additionally, for perspective, it should be noted, our core U.S. and endless assortment businesses combined grew at 7.3% on a daily basis during the quarter. Gross profit margin for the total company was down 180 basis points versus the prior year quarter. This decline is driven by customer and product mix headwinds and our U.S. segment largely related to sales of pandemic-related items as well as business unit mix from higher growth in our lower margin endless assortment business. Gross margin rates are much more stable when we are looking sequentially. We gained 20 basis points of SG&A leverage with cost up $47 million versus prior year as we continue to make investments to support our strategic priorities. As previously communicated, we generally expect SG&A spend to grow at approximately half the sales rate. For the quarter, our SG&A growth was higher than this annual target by approximately $20 million. This $20 million is driven by additional headcount that was added in the back half of 2019 incremental marketing investments, which will be reduced going forward and heightened spend to support our pandemic response efforts. Additionally, we were impacted by non-recurring and timing items, including an extra payroll day and one-time costs for certain legal matters. These impacts more than offset lower travel and variable compensation costs as well as favorable depreciation and amortization in the current year period. Excluding these non-recurring and unusual items, we were directionally in line with our plan from a cost perspective, which assumed elevated SG&A costs in the first quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $244 million, which we use to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we used $178 million on share repurchases and dividends and had total capital expenditures of $50 million. Even in our current difficult economic times, we continue to invest prudently in our business, all while maintaining a healthy 1.2x net debt leverage ratio. Operating cash flow was 106% of net adjusted earnings and return on invested capital was over 29%. Overall, U.S. segments daily sales grew 5.7% in the quarter or about 700 basis points faster than the broader MRO market. Sales growth in the quarter included approximately 8% volume growth, partially offset by unfavorable price of around 2%. Roughly half of the price headwind is due to customer and product mix with the other half related to the lapping of 2019 price increase. In the U.S. segment, we estimate that pandemic-related product sales represented roughly half of our sales growth. Gross margin was 230 basis points unfavorable to the prior year. The variance was driven largely by two primary factors. About half is related to lapping of 2019 pricing and cost actions and the other half is related to unfavorable product and customer mix. As we mentioned on the fourth quarter 2019 earnings call, we expected our Q1 2020 number to face difficult comparisons to the prior year period as we aggressively raised prices to combat expected tariff inflation increases in the first quarter of 2019. We acknowledged that we overshot the mark and rolled back prices throughout 2019. Additionally, tariff cost-related increases didn't actually take effect until later in 2019 and thus created a second half headwind in Q1 2020. Looking sequentially, we did see positive price inflation in this quarter compared to Q4 2019. Going forward, we expect this tough year-over-year comparison will lessen in the back half of 2020. The remaining portion of the year-over-year gross margin decline resulted from customer and product mix headwinds, which were exacerbated by sales of lower margin pandemic-related items to larger low margin customers. We expect these mix-related headwinds to continue during the pandemic as we sell increased levels of safety and cleaning products to our large healthcare, government and critical manufacturing customers. This FX will become even more pronounced in the second quarter as we expect the more dramatic mix impact that we saw in the March to continue through Q2. In the quarter, we also had unfavorable mix related to our multi-site customer growth strategy. As we discussed on the Q4 call, this impact will be temporary and will continue throughout fiscal year 2020. From an SG&A perspective, we gained 30 basis points of leverage with costs increasing $30 million in the quarter. This level of increase was caused by many of the factors I outlined earlier, including incremental headcount added in the second quarter of 2019 as well as marketing investments, cost to support our pandemic response and an extra payroll day. Operating margin was strong at 15%, but declined 200 basis points in the quarter on the declining gross profit margin, which was offset by slight increase in SG&A leverage experienced in the quarter. Turning specifically to the U.S. MRO market, while extremely difficult to project in this environment, we estimate the U.S. MRO market declined between 1% and 1.5% in the first quarter. Grainger was able to capture approximately 700 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter well above our objective to consistently grow 300 basis points to 400 basis points above market, aided by sales of pandemic-related items. Even when excluding the pandemic sales contribution, we were still well within our targeted range demonstrating consistent traction of our growth initiatives. Moving on to the other businesses. Daily sales increased 8.5% or 8.8% on a constant currency basis. Growth was driven by continued expansion of our endless assortment business, which was up a combined 17% on a daily basis between both Zoro and MonotaRO. Both businesses continue to grow rapidly and benefited from an uptick in pandemic-related sales albeit a much smaller impact than we saw with our U.S. business. Gross profit margin declined 60 basis points in the quarter driven by business unit mix from the faster growing endless assortment businesses as well as deeper discounting in a higher mix of drop-ship activity at Zoro U.S. We continue to achieve SG&A leverage in the first quarter, resulting in operating margin increase of 80 basis points. This stems largely from decreased expenses at Cromwell and leveraged an endless assortment. Cromwell performed unplanned in Q1 and was able to half its losses from the first quarter of 2019. These results were largely before the pandemic shutdown activity across Europe. We took an impairment charge on our Fabory business, reflecting continued gross profit and a flat to declining EBITDA against the backdrop of industrial sector declines across Europe. This was further amplified by the long-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic among other factors. Turning to Slide 13. Daily sales decreased 6.1% or 5% on a constant currency basis, comprised of roughly 4% decline in volume and price headwind, which includes customer mix of approximately 1%. Foreign exchange created 110 basis point headwind. Overall operating margins were up 110 basis points as gross profit margin was roughly flat to the prior year period, and SG&A was favorable 110 basis points as cost management drove significant leverage. Looking forward, in addition to the pandemic, Grainger Canada is also combating extremely low oil prices given its more concentrated natural resource customer base, which will drive further headwinds into the second quarter. Before I turn it back to D.G., I want to provide you with some insights into what we are seeing through the first few weeks of April. From a sales perspective, as of April 21, we are seeing year-over-year declines of approximately 10% on a constant currency total company basis with dramatic differences by end-market, product categories and customer size. Not surprisingly, our healthcare essential manufacturing and pockets of government are growing significantly faster year-over-year and we are seeing rapid declines elsewhere in areas such as hospitality and heavy manufacturing. On the product side, safety and cleaning supplies are significantly up year-over-year with most other categories down some dramatically. To be clear, this is what we are seeing through the first 15 business days of the month and not meant to be construed as guidance for the quarter. As in Q1, these customer and product mix items will continue to impact our GP margins. Further, Q2 will be impacted by the change in format of our National Sales Meeting, which will create a year-over-year headwind to gross profit margin of approximately 40 basis points to 50 basis points for the U.S. segment in the second quarter. For the year, the national meeting impact will be a drag on gross profit margin, but will be roughly flat for the year on an operating margin basis given travel and event-related cost savings. With that, I will turn it back to D.G. for some final thoughts. Good morning, Ryan. Yes. So let me add just a little bit more color, Ryan. So let's first of all start with gross profit margin. As we said in our prepared remarks, we went heavy on pricing in Q1 of fiscal year 2019 and then we rolled that back throughout the year. So to your point, that pricing compare will get better throughout the year. Also from a cost perspective, if you just look at how the tariffs behave on a year-over-year basis, the two big tariffs for us are Part 3 and Part 4A. And from a year-over-year impact for Part 3, in fiscal year 2019, the tariff was 10% in Q1, it's 25% in Q1 this year. If we look at 4A, there was no tariff and there's 15% or 7.5%. So that is the tariff impact that we saw on Q1. That also will get better throughout the year as we fully realize the lapping of our tariffs. It will also get better from the realization of our non-tariff cost increases. Let me move to SG&A and unpack it a little bit better than we did in the prepared remarks. We were up $47 million on a total company basis, which is a 6.4% increase. If you do look at the one-time items and that includes, one-time legal matters, the extra payroll day. We also had some benefits issue where we were lapping prior year adjustments and some other one-time costs. D.G. said over 50%, it was actually closer to 60% of the $47 million. So if you adjust that out, we really grew 2.7%, which gets into about half of the sales growth. The increase of the 2.7% is on items where we have said that we are investing related to advertising, technology and adding headcount in the back half. Now having said that, we noted in the prepared remarks that we are scaling back on advertising, we are taking a stronger look on costs in terms of taking $40 million to $55 million out sequentially versus Q1. And then the final thing I'll say is I want to be clear that we did also have additional cost to serve the pandemic in terms of over time pandemic pay, cleaning supplies, and those types of items. But the big story in SG&A is the one-time as well as the investment cost, which we will roll back in the second quarter. Sorry for the long winded answer, but it was a broad question. Thank you. Sure. Yes, it's a great question, Nigel. I think it depends Nigel on how much we see the volume going down quite frankly. If volume is going to stay where it's at in terms of 10%, we're probably not going to pull the more draconian levers in terms of cost reduction. It goes deeper than that. Then we've got a number of initiatives in the playbook ready to pull it. If you look at the high side of the range we gave Nigel, that $55 million sequentially would translate to year-over-year, almost 3% reduction. We'd also get some volume variable cost reduction in addition to that. So I think it's going to be a meaningful SG&A reduction for Q2. But we're watching this on a daily basis and trying to really thread the needle in terms of which levers we pull related to the volume reduction. Yes. I mean, you're talking specifically Nigel about gross profit or you're talking about sales revenue. Yes. If you look at it from a revenue perspective, we've actually got some customer mix component, which is in volume, but the majority of it is going to fall into price. We mentioned in our prepared remarks, the multi-site customers, but that was a much smaller part of the mix component. The primary part of it was our lower margin healthcare and government customers. That was the big driver of the customer mix. Yes, I guess the one thing that I would add that might be helpful color is when you look at our share gain, we said it was 700 bps outgrowth in Q1, if you look at it in March, it was significantly higher than that, almost double share gain in terms of March, which would lead you to potentially conclude that when times get really tough, the good things that we're doing, the customers are coming to us and allowing us to take share. Yes, sure. It's really hard to predict, Adam, because we have good guys happening in terms of the compare of the price inflation going down materially in the second quarter. We've also got better lapping in terms of inflation, non-tariff inflation and tariffs inflation. So those are really good things. It's just so hard to predict the pandemic of how much of an offset. And it really comes back to D.G.'s point is when are the other non-pandemic businesses really going to start to come back to work. So we've got a big chunk of tailwinds. It's just we don't know how big the headwind would be, not trying to be evasive, it's just hard to call the ball right now. Yes. Good morning, Deane. Yes, we feel really good about our free cash flow. If you look at our cash conversion cycle, despite us working with customers to be constructive in terms of payment terms, we were actually better by four days versus the prior year quarter. So we feel that we're managing working capital really well. As it relates to the destocking of inventory, frankly, that's not the playbook we're running. We're positioned for the future here. When the recovery starts to happen, and those customers start coming back, we want to make sure that we're able to provide the benefit to them. We feel that we're uniquely positioned with our balance sheet and our liquidity to be able to really come out of the gate strong when the market takes off. Sure. Decremental margin is an interesting calculation especially in the pandemic, just because there are \u2013 assumptions are so related to volume deterioration and gross margin. You referenced 2008 or 2009, there is a little bit of a nuance there where I don't think it's apples to oranges, as you said, we had big pricing impact back in 2008 and 2009, which, when dated, the decremental margin. If you're looking at 10% down with a range of, I guess, a reasonable gross margin, I could see decremental margins being 45% to maybe 50% down, and that's largely driven by \u2013 if it's only 10% down, we're probably not going to do those draconian cost initiatives. On the other hand, if we start to get for a more severe downturn with a longer duration, then we would go to our cost initiative playbook that we've got ready and pull more of the SG&A cost initiatives and there I could see the decremental margin being 35% to 40%. So it's really highly sensitive on what you're assuming. Hopefully that's helpful to give you a range. It includes some amount of flex down but not fully all of the flex down. So we would expect that we would get additional volume variable over and above the $40 million to $55 million. I think the way to think about SG&A, let's just take the $55 million SG&A reduction at the high end. If you compare that, what we did in Q2 for SG&A, that would be roughly a $20 million reduction or about 3%. Now depending on where volume tracks to, you're going to get some additional volume variables. So I would look at it as you're going to get 3-plus percent in terms of SG&A reduction versus the prior year. No, I would \u2013 it was about \u2013 half of that was flowing through the corporate unallocated. And if you adjust for that, we're very comparable to last year in the corporate unallocated. And in terms of looking at it on a full year basis, we should not be materially different in the corporate unallocated. So it's a good question, Justin. Half of that was corporate unallocated."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed.\nIrene Holman: Good morning, and welcome to Grainger\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q4 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning\u2019s call will focus on adjusted results, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our release. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP, and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO\u2019s public statements. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to D.G.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I\u2019m going to provide an overview of our full year highlights and fourth quarter results, and I\u2019ll begin, as we always do, with the Grainger Edge, our strategic framework that defines who we are, why we exist and where we\u2019re going, as well as how we\u2019ll get there using our operating principles. This framework has been foundational for our team to work through another challenging year with resilience and strength. We remain relentlessly focused on our customers and building the company for the future. I am tremendously proud of what we\u2019ve achieved and want to thank our team members for their commitment as well as our suppliers and transportation partners for their shared passion to support our customers throughout the year. It is always a privilege to help customers keep their people safe and their operations running, and even more so over the last two years. While 2021 was our second year navigating the impacts of the pandemic, it certainly brought us some unique challenges. Labor material shortages train supply chains throughout the industry. We demonstrated our agility and leveraged our supply chain scale to deliver strong service. Our customer satisfaction remained high. And in my regular interactions with customers, I continue to hear appreciation for our ability to deliver over the last two years. We invested in inventory, which enabled us to improve our availability and meet growing demand, especially in the back half of the year. We\u2019ve also invested in our team members with increased wages to make sure that our DCs are staffed and able to get orders out the door. I can confidently say that the Grainger team navigated these challenges extremely well and put us in a good position as we enter 2022. While we continue to focus on customers\u2019 needs, I\u2019m pleased with the team\u2019s progress on our strategic initiatives that we know drive short and long-term growth. Our merchandising team reviewed $1.5 billion of the assortment last year, continuing to make it easier for customers to navigate our website and find the products they need quickly. That brings our total re-merchandise assortment to $4.4 billion, which helps our customers choose products with confidence. We\u2019ve also increased our marketing investments, especially in areas like paid search, digital and radio ads, which have driven share gain and improved our brand recognition. We\u2019re excited by these results and the traction we\u2019ve gained with both large and midsized customers. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our KeepStock teams have served customers on site, supporting their inventory management needs and offering valuable insights to help them save time and money. This, in conjunction with our e-procurement services has continued to make it easier for customers to do business with Grainger. Around 60% of U.S. revenue now comes from customers with multiple solutions that embed us in their operations. Our technology investments have been critical in supporting these efforts. Over the last two years, we\u2019ve developed new product information, publishing, customer information and marketing support systems. We continue to improve our technology capabilities to help us win in the market. Our endless assortment segment continues to grow as we made progress on our strategic initiatives. Zoro U.S. achieved its full year SKU count goal, adding over 2.5 million schools this year alone, which brings a total assortment to 8.7 million SKUs. We\u2019ve expanded to new customer segments and new categories driving both new and repeat business. And in 2021, MonotaRO opened the Ibaraki DC in Japan, allowing them to stock high demand items locally with plans for another DC [indiscernible] Japan in 2022. And finally, we are making strong progress on ESG. 2022 will be our 11th year publishing a corporate responsibility report. We\u2019ve elevated its importance in our organization through our ESG leadership council, which I chair. In 2021, we reviewed and updated our materiality metrics to ensure our ESG priorities are in line with customer needs and to those of our stakeholders. And we continue to make progress across our ESG pillars. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and driving diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, improving supplier diversity and helping customers meet their ESG goals. All in all, 2021 was a strong year, which positions us well moving forward. Turning to financial highlights. We achieved the full year expectations that we set earlier in the year. Demand was very strong, enabling us to finish the year at $13 billion in sales at the high end of our guided range. Organic daily sales growth was 12.7% for the year, 12.4% on an organic constant currency basis. Our results were driven by strong performance in both segments. Most notably, high-touch solutions in North America had exceptional growth at 10.8% on a daily constant currency basis. In the U.S., we outgrew the market by 100 basis points for the full year 2021, above where we expected to be and outgrew the market by 450 basis points on a two-year average. We faced our fair share of gross margin challenges throughout the year, primarily tied to inventory. We were able to recover well to end the year at 36.2%, resulting from our ability to manage price/cost spread and improved product mix. We delivered 11.9% operating margin, an increase of 65 basis points over the prior year. And lastly, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and delivered a strong ROIC of 31.9%. We met the challenges of the year head on and delivered on our commitments for the full year. Turning to our quarterly results for the company. The story is similar with strong results to share. Baby sales exceeded our expectations and were up 16%, 16.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by double-digit growth in both segments with robust demand. Gross profit margin was 37.3%, 240 basis points above the prior year and in line with our expectations. Dee will go into more detail, but at a high level, because we follow the LIFO method of accounting, our results include an adjustment to reflect the building of core product inventory at higher costs in the fourth quarter, which allowed us to finish the year with a strong inventory position. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales was 24.9%, flat to prior year. When comparing to 2019, which is a more relevant comparison point, our SG&A leverage improved over 200 basis points in the quarter. SG&A was $836 million, driven by higher variable compensation as a result of our strong top line growth. We also saw elevated hourly wages and increased health care expenses and continue to invest in marketing. We gained operating margin leverage of 240 basis points over prior year result of the gross margin improvement. Finally, our resulting EPS was $5.44 for the quarter, up 48.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. And with that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on the quarter and our expectations for 2022. Dee?\nDee Merriwether: Thank you, D.G. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment. For the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong results with daily sales up 16.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, and up 21.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. In the U.S., we saw continued strong growth of our core non-pandemic category. And as a result of our growth investments, we\u2019re seeing continued growth with both large and midsized customers at 16% and 25%, respectively. The U.S. business also had strong price realization in the quarter. We\u2019re encouraged by how Canada and Mexico finished the year both with positive daily sales growth in the fourth quarter. In Canada, the business saw a year-over-year sales growth with 11 of its 14 industries, most notably in our targeted in segments like manufacturing and higher education. Canadian daily sales were up 12.2% or 6.8% in local days local currency. For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 39.6%, up 250 basis points versus the prior year, a very strong quarter for our High-Touch Solutions segment. We once again achieved price cost spreads slightly above neutral, and our pandemic product mix returned to near pre-pandemic levels, both driving positive improvement in gross profit. At the operating margin line, we saw an improvement of 230 basis points year-over-year, overall, a solid quarter for High-Touch Solutions. I\u2019d like to go into a bit more detail specifically on our U.S. GP run rate. During the quarter, we achieved a gross margin rate of 40%. We\u2019re encouraged by these results and the GP stabilization achieved in the fourth quarter. The pandemic product mix, our pricing actions and our ability to navigate supply chain challenges supported this achievement and will be the foundation for our GP expectations in 2022. As you\u2019re aware, Grainger follows the LIFO accounting method, which requires us to revalue the majority of our mentors sold during the year based upon the most current purchase price. At the end of every year, we calculate our LIFO adjustment based upon our ending inventory balance. This year, we increased our inventory balance significantly in the fourth quarter to set us up for 2022, and our most recent purchases were at higher costs due to inflation. As a result, our LIFO adjustment is larger than we\u2019ve historically seen. You\u2019ll see this adjustment disclosed in our 10-K, and it\u2019s important to remember that is a non-cash LIFO accounting impact and not a reflection of our operational performance. Moving to Slide 11. During the quarter, our core non-pandemic product sales were up 28% over the prior year fourth quarter. Compared to 2019, sales growth was quite strong at approximately 17%. In addition, our pandemic product sales were down year-over-year, remained elevated, up around 41% over 2019. As it relates to mix, our pandemic products totaled 21% of sales in the fourth quarter, very close to our pre-pandemic mix. We're excited that our product mix is stabilizing as customers return to more normal operations. In total, our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business was up 17% versus the fourth quarter 2020 and up 22% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 12. We estimate that the U.S. market grew between 10% and 11%, and we achieved 650 basis points of market share outgrowth in the fourth quarter, largely driven by returns on our key strategic initiatives. For the full year and slightly above our expectations, we achieved approximately 100 basis points of outgrowth. To normalize for volatility over the past two years, we're continuing to calculate and show the two-year average, which was about 600 basis points over the market for the fourth quarter of 2021. We remain committed to our U.S. share gain goal of 300 to 400 basis points of outgrowth on an ongoing basis. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 15.2% or 20.6% on a constant currency basis driven by continued strength in our new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO and continued growth with enterprise customers in Japan. When we account for local days in local currency, MonotaRO daily sales grew 20.2%. GP expand 60 basis points year-over-year. As a result, operating margin for the segment fished up 45 basis points over the prior year, primarily due to improved gross profit margin. Zoro operating margin improved as a result of freight efficiency, specifically from its continued focus on B2B customers. MonotaRO operating margin was down slightly compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower gross margin, a result of their product mix in the quarter. Please note the slide covering both Zoro and MonotaRO financial performance is in the appendix. In addition, we also continue to see positive results in our operating metrics. Registered users are up 16% over the fourth quarter prior year. And on the right, we show the continued growth of the Zoro SKU portfolio with great progress this year. Overall, we continue to be impressed by the results of our Endless Assortment segment as we grow with the right customers. Moving to 2022 guidance. For the total company, we expect revenue between $14.1 billion and $14.5 billion, with daily sales growth between 7.5% and 10.5% driven by strong top line performance in both segments. It's worth noting there is also one more selling day in 2022. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect daily sales growth between 6.5% and 9.5%. For the U.S., we anticipate growth between 7% and 10%, 300 basis points above the estimated MRO market of 4% to 7%. We expect our share gain to be driven primarily by growing volume as a result of our strategic initiatives and that will continue to price to the market. In Canada, we expect to see mid-single-digit top line growth as we continue to diversify our customer base. In the Endless Assortment segment, we anticipate daily sales to grow roughly 14% or 18.5% in local currency and local days. Zoro's growth is anticipated to be in high teens, reflecting further SKU expansion and a continued focus on acquiring and retaining high-value customers. MonotaRO expects local currency growth rates in the high teens as well as they continue to grow with both small and enterprise customers. From a profitability perspective, total company GP is expected to be between 36.8% and 37.3%, up between 50 and 100 basis points in 2022. Consistent with 2021, we expect a similar LIFO accounting adjustment as we continue to see cost inflation and build inventory. We have factored into our guidance this impact. The gross profit margin expansion is driven primarily by the High-Touch Solutions segment as GP stabilizes near pre-pandemic levels and as we continue to target price/cost neutrality. Endless Assortment gross profit is expected to be essentially flat as GP expansion at Zoro is offset by a modest GP decline at MonotaRO. Total company operating margins are expected to be between 12.5% and 13.1%, and expand between 65 and 125 basis points versus 2021. These top line and profitability targets as well as continued execution of our share repurchase program, are expected to produce earnings per share between 23 50 and 25 50, and equated to growth between 18.5% and 28.5%. Both segments are expected to deliver high ROIC. Continuing on Slide 17, in addition to total company guidance, we wanted to provide operating margins by segment, along with our plans for capital allocation. For High-Touch Solutions, we expect operating margins between 14.4% and 15%, up between 130 and 190 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by gross margin expansion. SG&A leverage is expected to be modest, primarily due to continued investment in growth initiatives, anticipated health care expenses and higher wages. Endless Assortment operating margins are expected to be between 7.5% and 8.2%. This is primarily driven by MonotaRO as they continue to invest in DC capacity. Zoro continues to increase operating margins in line with our previous expectations. Cromwell represented and Other is expected to further reduce its operating losses. We anticipate closing the year with operating margin down at negative 6%. Our Cromwell improvement plan is behind our original expectations, driven primarily by business closures in the UK and the slowdown in the aerospace industry, one of their primary end markets. We remain confident in your ability to improve performance as during the pandemic, they have been able to grow with new customers and maintain high levels of service. Their results will primarily be dependent on the speed of recovery across different customer end markets. From a cash flow perspective, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion. Our capital expenditures outlook for the year is between $275 million and $325 million. This includes DC investments in North America and Japan, ESG investments to improve sustainability of our facilities, KeepStock and IT enhancements in the U.S. and a normal level of maintenance capital. We expect the balance of our cash to be used to fund our quarterly dividend and to continue share repurchases. For 2022, we are expecting between $600 million and $800 million of share repurchases, which continues to reflect our confidence in successfully executing our strategy and in our growth initiatives. We're optimistic for a more normal year with reasonable, sequential trends. As a result, we are now resuming more standard guidance practices. Similar to our approach before the pandemic, our guidance will be limited to annual expectations, and we will provide commentary and/or updates to our full year ranges as launch hits. With that, I will turn it back to D.G. for closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I want to really reiterate my appreciation for the Grainger team and our partnership with our customers and suppliers in this challenging year. While we all hope that 2021 will bring more normalcy than it in fact did, the team remained steadfast in our purpose of keeping the world working and in turn achieved outstanding results for the year, both financially and operationally. In the coming year, we will continue to focus on serving our customers better than anyone else, profitably growing market share and making Grainger a great place to work. We have three core priorities: first, execute on our growth drivers that provide customers with a flawless experience and tangible value to help them operate safely and effectively; second, drive operational excellence and productivity in all that we do to support our growth investments; and third, strengthen our culture and focus on talent development at all levels of the organization. We will execute these efforts with our long-term environmental, social and governance objectives in mind. Finally, I'm excited to announce that we'll be hosting an Analyst Day in the fall of this year, where we will be focused on providing more details on our strategic initiatives and longer-term outlook. With that, we will open the line, up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys, this is Sophia [ph] on of for Nigel Coe. Congrats on the blockbuster quarter. It was amazing.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thank you.\nUnidentified Analyst: So, my question was really on like the 2022 guide, you've kind of put forth HTS U.S., you see 300 bps of market outgrowth. How much of that do you really see volume versus the 3% price, I think, you've quoted in that particular segment?\nD.G. Macpherson: So just to be clear, thanks for the question, and that's a good clarification point. And I can turn it over to Dee for specific. But in general, we talk about share gain, we're talking all about volume. So, our philosophy is to price to market, and then we expect to get volume share gain. That's how we think.\nDee Merriwether: Yes. So, as it relates to the components for the U.S. market, we anticipate low single-digit volume growth at about 4% to 5% in price, which results in a market of about 4% to 7%. And there we expect to grow 300 basis points above the market which gets you to high-touch U.S. guide of between 7% to 10% growth.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That\u2019s all for me.\nDee Merriwether: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. So I also want to follow up on the U.S. 2% outgrowth guidance. So certainly a positive level when we compare to the long-term outgrowth that the company has achieved. But it is below, I believe, 2021 came in at 4.5% outlook on the two year. In Q4, you guys add a very strong at over 6%. Is there anything specific that is kind of pushing that guidance down to just 3% in 2022?\nDee Merriwether: Yes. We expect 300. We\u2019re really confident \u2013 at a minimum, we\u2019re really confident in the first half outlook, and we anticipate robust growth and some price inflation there. But the second half remains really harder to predict for us. And so based upon having better visibility, we feel pretty confident in the outlook that we\u2019ve stated right now. And know that as things change, we\u2019ll be more than want to talk about that and talk about the changes in the future how does impact our results.\nChris Snyder: Appreciate that. And for my follow-up, I wanted to talk about Zoro margins. Previously, the company has communicated a pathway to getting sort of to high single-digit margins over three years. But over the last couple of quarters, Zoro gross margin has really surprised and impressed to the upside. Does that change the operating margin outlook for Zoro? And if you could just kind of refresh us on what\u2019s the latest expectations for there? Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I guess I can start with that one. So we have not changed our expectations for Zoro operating margin. We still are on the same path. We talked about. We have gotten strong gross profit improvement in the business. Some of that \u2013 most of that is squarely focused on quality growth, so making sure we are acquiring business customers that have long-term positive value and really focusing our efforts there, which means we\u2019ve gotten out of some lower quality growth avenues that we\u2019ve had in the past. And that has shown a pop. That pop is going to stick, but you\u2019re not going to see similar growth in the gross profit line like we\u2019ve seen. That has been very specifically towards actions to improve the quality of our growth, and we think we\u2019re on a good path now. But we\u2019re still on the same operating margin.\nOperator: Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nDeane Dray: Look, I fully respect that you guys are not a manufacturer, and that\u2019s part \u2013 that\u2019s a big advantage in this environment for sure. But you do have some manufacturing exposure with your private label. Just any update there, how you\u2019ve been holding up in terms of supply chain issues there?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. Yes. It\u2019s a great question. So it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of chaos in the supply chain for sure. It has been very costly to get containers out of Asia. We have been prioritizing what we can get in. I think we\u2019ve done a nice job of navigating the things that we can control. I think the other thing I would point to is we\u2019ve done a really nice job of crossing items to more locally sourced items to help support customers during this time. And I think our ability to improve our product information has helped us navigate this. We are starting to see some loosening coming from Asia now, and we do expect things to get at least modestly better through the next couple of quarters. And so it\u2019s been a challenge. I think it has been a constant seed if you\u2019re working in the supply chain, certainly, the last year, our team has done a great job with navigating it. I think relatively, we\u2019re doing well, but it\u2019s challenging for sure.\nDeane Dray: Yes, it really does look like you\u2019re holding up well, so congrats there. And then second question, maybe some color on the CapEx plans. It\u2019s an uptick from last year pretty noticeably. We\u2019ve heard some companies say, Hey, look, they couldn\u2019t \u2013 because of supply chain issues, they couldn\u2019t do as much in the way of projects. There were delays there. So was this a catch-up and maybe some color on where that money is being spent? Thanks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dee in a second. I mean so it\u2019s not necessarily a catch up. I\u2019d say our CapEx is almost always in supply chain investments and in technology, and that will continue to be the case. I\u2019ll turn it over to Dee to talk about specifics.\nDee Merriwether: Yes. Just a little bit more to add to that, D.G. I agree, really not a catch-up. We\u2019re really focused on maintenance capital in the DC. The DC have been running hard. As you can expect, we\u2019re trying to keep up with demand. And so we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re spending the right amount of capital there. In addition to that, you hear us continue to talk about continued capacity investment in Japan. So that is a portion of that as well. We mentioned our focus on ESG. So that\u2019s about 10% of our capital spend going into next year. So really just getting back to what we would call normal levels of capital as we come out of the recovery.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Manthey with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Could you share with us the amount of the LIFO adjustment? And just to be clear, is that \u2013 is it still in the adjusted results you present here in the slides? Or is that factored out?\nDee Merriwether: So yes, the LIFO adjustment is in the adjusted results. And just want to remind everyone again that this is a noncash accounting entry and really is not reflective of operational performance. And so this year, at the end of the year, because we invested heavily in growing our inventory, so that it set us up well for the start of this year. That, coupled with cost inflation is the result of a larger adjustment than normal. And that adjustment, which you'll see in the 10-K is more than two times what it's historically been. So you'll see the net of tax around $49 million.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And I was under the impression that Grainger historically at least, was something like 30% FIFO in part of your business as well. And I'm just wondering, was there any kind of an offset from FIFO to offset some of that LIFO gain? Not explicitly in that number you just mentioned, Dee, but just operationally if you have some business on pipe when that might have benefited from the inflation.\nDee Merriwether: So you're correct. It's about 25%. That is factored into our numbers. We really didn't get a benefit from that this year. We don't expect to on a go forward basis unless inflation changes materially.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Merkel: Good morning. And thanks for all the details and guidance. My first question was on gross margin for 2022. Could you just unpack it a little bit more 4Q is exiting at 37.3%, but the low end of guidance for 2022 is 36.8%. Is that the LIFO impact? Or just what are the puts and takes?\nDee Merriwether: So if I just start back with the U.S. GP probably be a good place to start there. Our goal was to exit the year in line with pre-pandemic levels for high-touch U.S., and so we achieved that around 40%. We will expect high-touch U.S. GP to stabilize into 2022, but we're also expecting a little bit more normal seasonality for our plan this year. We do expect to continue to manage price cost were added to 2022. And then we'll have a little bit of compression potentially from EA. Even though the high touch business is growing much faster than it has historically been, it is still a little bit lighter than the EA business, so that causes a little bit of compression for us.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then pandemic sales flat in January, it's been negative, so the trend is looking good. I'm just wondering on the outlook there because I think you said it's still 40% above 2019. Just wonder, is there any give back as things sort of normalize? Or what's your feelings there?\nDee Merriwether: No, I don't see that. I think we're about where we expect to be. If you look at our January results sequentially, we're still up a little bit on pandemic sales, but \u2013 so we have a little way to go that we hope will help us in our current outlook. We've embedded that we get back to normal levels in 2022. So we've embedded that in our plan and in our guide.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Looking at the six points compound to your market outperformance in the fourth quarter, as everyone is talking about supplychain has got worse and tighter in the quarter. Are you a net beneficiary of that dynamic that everyone else is more bothered by just strictly from a volume perspective?\nD.G. Macpherson: Well, I think there's a number of factors that go into that. We think we probably had some net benefit in the sense that we have product there, there's probably we don't have. And we've been able to navigate the challenge as well. And I talked about it before, but almost every customer call I have now talks about finding alternates that are in stock as opposed to waiting to get received from Asia, and we are aggressively helping our customers find solutions to keep them up and running. And I think that \u2013 all of that in our scale and the inventory pools we have help. We did build inventory in the back half of the year pretty significantly, and that has been a help as well. So I'd say we're a net beneficiary. And I think it's also helped us develop stronger relationships with our customers because we've been able to serve them during this time.\nChristopher Glynn: That makes sense. And how do you assess the risk, if any, of that 4Q volume strength with being a net beneficiary on how you process the transition to the expected 2022 volume growth?\nD.G. Macpherson: Well, I think Dee talked about this a little bit before. We have a lot more clarity about what we'd expect in the first half of the year. Just on compares, we would expect the first half of the year to be stronger in terms of revenue growth. That said, we look at run rate volumes, and we understand how our initiatives impact volume and we're confident in at this point and what we've talked about from a range and feel pretty good about the year in terms of our ability to grow.\nOperator: Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning, thank you. My first question would just be just coming back medium customer strategy. We saw the growth numbers were pretty good. Could you maybe just remind us where you are in the process of gaining market share with medium customers? And is that number \u2013 could that number be similar to your large customer wallet share over time? Just any thoughts on where that's trending?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So just as a reminder for everybody, I think we've talked about this before. At our peak, we had about $2 billion worth of midsized customer sales. We went down to $800 million. We have recovered a portion of that, but we still have a long ways to go. And our share with midsized customers is still smaller. We are getting smarter in terms of our ability to acquire and develop relationships with midsized customers. It's hard to argue that we'd ever get to the wallet share in any reasonable time horizon that we have with large customers, we do think we can grow it faster than we grow large customers for years to come. So we're pretty confident in the growth path that we expect.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And just my follow-up question, and I'll turn it over, is just \u2013 as you think about MonotaRO, you had strong enterprise customer growth. Is there an opportunity for enterprise customers at Zoro? Or is the market just different where you service that through the high-touch brand? Just any thoughts there would be great, too. Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. And I think it's a really good question. The short answer is the competitive market is very, very different. In Japan, the market typically goes through wholesalers to local distributors to customers versus what we have in the U.S. with the big distributors that serve customers with all kinds of services today. And so we don't see an opportunity for Zoro and our enterprise customer business. We see that squarely on the shoulders the Grainger brand and the high-tech solutions and the competitive environment makes that very different in the U.S. And so that's our growth path there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: So just a follow-up on some of the market share dynamics. Maybe if you could talk about how kind of supply chain inconsistency has helped Grainger. I got to imagine that for maybe your smallest competitors, those guys are still having a hard time getting product and or maybe the most likely to use price as sort of a competitive weapon. How do you think share gains sort of attributable to that have trended here kind of through the second half? And what do you expect as we kind of continue in this tighter supply chain environment at least through the first half of this year?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean, I think through the last two years, we have done well in terms of navigating the supply chain. At first, it was pandemic product. And this past year, it was mostly non-pandemic product, where we have been able to find solutions and work with our customers and our suppliers to figure out how to get the right solutions for our customers. I don't see that changing at all in the first half of the year. I think we're going to be constrained. I know we're constrained now and we'll continue to be constrained as an industry. So I think the things we've been working on figuring out how to help customers find the right solutions in a constrained world will continue to be beneficial. And certainly, we don't really know how every distributor is doing. But having the inventory pools we have, having the information we have, having the data, having the deep customer relationships all helps us help our customers navigate through these really challenging times.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then just from an end market perspective, what percentage of the portfolio, if any, because I know you have some important customer groups and maybe some hospitality, airlines, things like that, is still below pre-pandemic levels.\nD.G. Macpherson: I'm not sure if I've got the exact numbers. It's \u2013 I would say most industries are above pre-pandemic levels for us now. Pretty much all manufacturing would be \u2013 there might be some sub-segments. We mentioned aerospace in the UK, aerospace has been challenged, for sure. And then there are certainly industries that we supported like cruise lines and hotels and airlines that are still below. It's a small portion of our total, and we continue to support those customers well and expect to continue to support those customers. But I think it's sort of we aren't talking as if the large portion of our customer base is challenged right now. We're seeing very strong demand in general, and we know there are sub-segments that are still struggling. We would expect those to recover over the next couple of years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael McGinn: Hey, good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to the cash flow conversation. It seems like it's a little heavy on working capital or at least the conversion is a little bit below historic levels. Any comments on the timing of the MonotaRo DC load-in process, also general inventory, how you're preparing for pre and post Chinese New Year?\nDee Merriwether: Well, you want me to start, D.G. and then maybe you can talk about operations?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes.\nDee Merriwether: So when you look at our operating cash flow for the year, really two components contribute to that. And neither reasons \u2013 neither of them is really a reason for concern for us. And so the major factor was really our decision to invest in inventory later in the year, so we could have a strong start. And the second one was we had a very robust sales growth in the U.S. in December, really exceptionally strong. And so accounts receivable \u2013 our accounts receivable balance increased based upon the number of orders, but most of those payments are going to come due early in the year. So we're already seeing a consistent trend to what we've seen in prior years related to AR developed. However, as long as we continue to drive very strong sales, our AR balance would be higher than what it has traditionally been, and we expect to continue to support growth with inventory investment. I know you have a question specifically about inventory related to Chinese New Year. So I'll turn it back to D.G. for that.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean without going into too many details, we always look at Chinese New Year and try to get out in front of it. Part of the inventory build that we had was being able to pull full containers in earlier, clearly, things are still backed up coming out of China. The Chinese New Year, we're in the midst of it. When it comes out, it typically takes two to four months for things to get totally back to normal. We do expect some ease of supply chain, some more flow to come in. We're starting to see signs that, that is likely to occur. But certainly, this year, we \u2013 it wasn't just Chinese New Year. We're just managing constrained supply chains, and so that was part of it.\nMichael McGinn: Great. And then somewhat more of a longer-term question with Zoro SKUs fast approaching the $10 million benchmark. Can you talk about the addition and curation process? And are you now able to leverage search on the platform to target potentially high-volume value-add SKUs that would benefit or versus using external search dynamics in the past? And then also maybe the general learnings and mix improvement from last quarter, where I think you mentioned some channels were turned off.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes, yes. So we expect to have a strong SKU count addition this year, the team is working on analytics and works with the team in Japan as well to understand which customers and which product pairs we want to go after. So we do most of that analytically. We use some platform, artificial intelligence type tools to help with that. But a lot of it's good old-fashioned analytics and understanding which target segments we want to go after small business segments we want to go after and which products to add. We continue to have a lot of success with getting those products in and having them be a source of growth for those customer segments.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pat Baumann with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nPat Baumann: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go at the share gain thing in the High-Touch business from a little bit different vantage point. Can you talk about the revenue growth you saw for the year in that segment broken down between like the digital piece, whether that's EDI or website? And then how that compares to kind of the growth rates you're seeing in KeepStock and the branches. Just curious where you're seeing the most growth across those different channels and then how you see that playing out into this year?\nD.G. Macpherson: I'm sorry, just to clarify the question. Did you say Endless Assortment or?\nPat Baumann: No, no, no, specifically High-Touch, just thinking about the different channels in High-Touch that you touch the customer with.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. Yes. So we had strong growth through almost all the channels. I would say that KeepStock grew faster than the core business last year, continues to be a really core driver of growth in serving customers on site. As does ePro, which is typically connecting our systems directly to purchasing systems. So we continue to have a lot of large complex customers that have multiple points of stickiness and helps the customer manage their purchasing process and their inventory. We have seen, obviously, strong growth with digital, grainger.com has continued to grow very quickly. I think if you looked at it with midsized customers, you'd see digital as the primary source of growth. And if you look at it with large complex customers, you'd see more balance with strong growth in cube stock and ePro is what you typically see.\nPat Baumann: Understood. So that would mean that if those are all growing faster than branches are growing slower, I guess, than the rest?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I think over the last two years, branches have grown slower than e-commerce. That doesn't mean they aren't growing. They've actually had solid growth. But yes, I think Dee, you correct me, I think I'm pretty sure that branch, if you look over the last few years, walk-in traffic has been down, and the pandemic is probably contributed to that. We saw a nice bounce back this year after a pretty significant down in 2020.\nDee Merriwether: That's correct, D.G. Right.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Newman: Hey, good morning, guys. This is Ken Newman on for Steve. Thanks for taking the question.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nKen Newman: Good morning. I just wanted to circle back on the December ADS number. I think you guys had mentioned. It did see a pretty decent sized jump up from October, November despite it looks like it would be a slightly more difficult comp. Can you just talk through what drove that jump? And where is ADS kind of trending now through January?\nDee Merriwether: So again, you've also Slide 11, you'll see in High-Touch U.S., our January estimate up about 15%, and that's posed by the pandemic and non-pandemic sales at answers your trending for January question.\nKen Newman: Sure. That makes sense. Okay.\nDee Merriwether: And then for December sales, I think I'd go back to like what D.G. has articulated, a lot of customers are finding our product availability to be appealing, and we believe that led to a lot of our growth in the U.S. later in the December time frame driven by core pandemic or non-pandemic products.\nKen Newman: Understood. And then for my follow-up, I'm just curious if you can give a little more color on the capacity investments in Zoro and MonotaRO. Any color on the timing of when you expect the margin trends to kind of return back to normalized levels? Or how do you view the ramp of more normalized ROIC for those investments?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes, that's a good question. So it affects MonotaRO only. Zoro is not having unusual investments at this point, and we expect the operating margin to continue to expand for Zoro the next several years. MonotaRO has \u2013 given the Japanese geographic footprint, it's not as broad or as big as the U.S., obviously. And they have very high-volume DCs but very few of them. And so what you're seeing right now is expansion \u2013 capacity expansion around Tokyo and Osaka, which are the two primary places where you need distribution capacity. And you're going to see a lot of redundant assets this year, which is why costs go up, and you're basically running two buildings and doing the transfer. That falls off in 2023. So in 2023, you'll see more of a normal return to SG&A for the MonotaRO business. It's just the \u2013 I think they're going from a 1.1 million square foot building to 1.7 million or something like that around the socket. These are very large buildings. And when you're running both of them at the same time, you have a lot of redundant costs during the transition.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back over to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: All right. Well, thank you. I appreciate everybody's questions, and thanks for the time today. We obviously feel good about the way the year ended and are excited about 2022. We're going to stay focused on making sure we provide the right solutions to our customers, and investing in things that I think the thing I'm most excited about is we have a lot of things we can still get a lot better at. And so it does feel like we are working on the right things, and we'll stay committed to making sure that we build the right systems and processes to support our customers and win for the future. So I hope you all stay warm and you're not getting hit too hard by the storm and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Dee Merriwether",
            "content": "Thank you, D.G. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment. For the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong results with daily sales up 16.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, and up 21.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. In the U.S., we saw continued strong growth of our core non-pandemic category. And as a result of our growth investments, we're seeing continued growth with both large and midsized customers at 16% and 25%, respectively. The U.S. business also had strong price realization in the quarter. We're encouraged by how Canada and Mexico finished the year both with positive daily sales growth in the fourth quarter. In Canada, the business saw a year-over-year sales growth with 11 of its 14 industries, most notably in our targeted in segments like manufacturing and higher education. Canadian daily sales were up 12.2% or 6.8% in local days local currency. For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 39.6%, up 250 basis points versus the prior year, a very strong quarter for our High-Touch Solutions segment. We once again achieved price cost spreads slightly above neutral, and our pandemic product mix returned to near pre-pandemic levels, both driving positive improvement in gross profit. At the operating margin line, we saw an improvement of 230 basis points year-over-year, overall, a solid quarter for High-Touch Solutions. I'd like to go into a bit more detail specifically on our U.S. GP run rate. During the quarter, we achieved a gross margin rate of 40%. We're encouraged by these results and the GP stabilization achieved in the fourth quarter. The pandemic product mix, our pricing actions and our ability to navigate supply chain challenges supported this achievement and will be the foundation for our GP expectations in 2022. As you're aware, Grainger follows the LIFO accounting method, which requires us to revalue the majority of our mentors sold during the year based upon the most current purchase price. At the end of every year, we calculate our LIFO adjustment based upon our ending inventory balance. This year, we increased our inventory balance significantly in the fourth quarter to set us up for 2022, and our most recent purchases were at higher costs due to inflation. As a result, our LIFO adjustment is larger than we've historically seen. You'll see this adjustment disclosed in our 10-K, and it's important to remember that is a non-cash LIFO accounting impact and not a reflection of our operational performance. Moving to Slide 11. During the quarter, our core non-pandemic product sales were up 28% over the prior year fourth quarter. Compared to 2019, sales growth was quite strong at approximately 17%. In addition, our pandemic product sales were down year-over-year, remained elevated, up around 41% over 2019. As it relates to mix, our pandemic products totaled 21% of sales in the fourth quarter, very close to our pre-pandemic mix. We're excited that our product mix is stabilizing as customers return to more normal operations. In total, our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business was up 17% versus the fourth quarter 2020 and up 22% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 12. We estimate that the U.S. market grew between 10% and 11%, and we achieved 650 basis points of market share outgrowth in the fourth quarter, largely driven by returns on our key strategic initiatives. For the full year and slightly above our expectations, we achieved approximately 100 basis points of outgrowth. To normalize for volatility over the past two years, we're continuing to calculate and show the two-year average, which was about 600 basis points over the market for the fourth quarter of 2021. We remain committed to our U.S. share gain goal of 300 to 400 basis points of outgrowth on an ongoing basis. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 15.2% or 20.6% on a constant currency basis driven by continued strength in our new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO and continued growth with enterprise customers in Japan. When we account for local days in local currency, MonotaRO daily sales grew 20.2%. GP expand 60 basis points year-over-year. As a result, operating margin for the segment fished up 45 basis points over the prior year, primarily due to improved gross profit margin. Zoro operating margin improved as a result of freight efficiency, specifically from its continued focus on B2B customers. MonotaRO operating margin was down slightly compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower gross margin, a result of their product mix in the quarter. Please note the slide covering both Zoro and MonotaRO financial performance is in the appendix. In addition, we also continue to see positive results in our operating metrics. Registered users are up 16% over the fourth quarter prior year. And on the right, we show the continued growth of the Zoro SKU portfolio with great progress this year. Overall, we continue to be impressed by the results of our Endless Assortment segment as we grow with the right customers. Moving to 2022 guidance. For the total company, we expect revenue between $14.1 billion and $14.5 billion, with daily sales growth between 7.5% and 10.5% driven by strong top line performance in both segments. It's worth noting there is also one more selling day in 2022. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect daily sales growth between 6.5% and 9.5%. For the U.S., we anticipate growth between 7% and 10%, 300 basis points above the estimated MRO market of 4% to 7%. We expect our share gain to be driven primarily by growing volume as a result of our strategic initiatives and that will continue to price to the market. In Canada, we expect to see mid-single-digit top line growth as we continue to diversify our customer base. In the Endless Assortment segment, we anticipate daily sales to grow roughly 14% or 18.5% in local currency and local days. Zoro's growth is anticipated to be in high teens, reflecting further SKU expansion and a continued focus on acquiring and retaining high-value customers. MonotaRO expects local currency growth rates in the high teens as well as they continue to grow with both small and enterprise customers. From a profitability perspective, total company GP is expected to be between 36.8% and 37.3%, up between 50 and 100 basis points in 2022. Consistent with 2021, we expect a similar LIFO accounting adjustment as we continue to see cost inflation and build inventory. We have factored into our guidance this impact. The gross profit margin expansion is driven primarily by the High-Touch Solutions segment as GP stabilizes near pre-pandemic levels and as we continue to target price/cost neutrality. Endless Assortment gross profit is expected to be essentially flat as GP expansion at Zoro is offset by a modest GP decline at MonotaRO. Total company operating margins are expected to be between 12.5% and 13.1%, and expand between 65 and 125 basis points versus 2021. These top line and profitability targets as well as continued execution of our share repurchase program, are expected to produce earnings per share between 23 50 and 25 50, and equated to growth between 18.5% and 28.5%. Both segments are expected to deliver high ROIC. Continuing on Slide 17, in addition to total company guidance, we wanted to provide operating margins by segment, along with our plans for capital allocation. For High-Touch Solutions, we expect operating margins between 14.4% and 15%, up between 130 and 190 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by gross margin expansion. SG&A leverage is expected to be modest, primarily due to continued investment in growth initiatives, anticipated health care expenses and higher wages. Endless Assortment operating margins are expected to be between 7.5% and 8.2%. This is primarily driven by MonotaRO as they continue to invest in DC capacity. Zoro continues to increase operating margins in line with our previous expectations. Cromwell represented and Other is expected to further reduce its operating losses. We anticipate closing the year with operating margin down at negative 6%. Our Cromwell improvement plan is behind our original expectations, driven primarily by business closures in the UK and the slowdown in the aerospace industry, one of their primary end markets. We remain confident in your ability to improve performance as during the pandemic, they have been able to grow with new customers and maintain high levels of service. Their results will primarily be dependent on the speed of recovery across different customer end markets. From a cash flow perspective, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion. Our capital expenditures outlook for the year is between $275 million and $325 million. This includes DC investments in North America and Japan, ESG investments to improve sustainability of our facilities, KeepStock and IT enhancements in the U.S. and a normal level of maintenance capital. We expect the balance of our cash to be used to fund our quarterly dividend and to continue share repurchases. For 2022, we are expecting between $600 million and $800 million of share repurchases, which continues to reflect our confidence in successfully executing our strategy and in our growth initiatives. We're optimistic for a more normal year with reasonable, sequential trends. As a result, we are now resuming more standard guidance practices. Similar to our approach before the pandemic, our guidance will be limited to annual expectations, and we will provide commentary and/or updates to our full year ranges as launch hits. With that, I will turn it back to D.G. for closing remarks. Yes. So, as it relates to the components for the U.S. market, we anticipate low single-digit volume growth at about 4% to 5% in price, which results in a market of about 4% to 7%. And there we expect to grow 300 basis points above the market which gets you to high-touch U.S. guide of between 7% to 10% growth. Thank you. Yes. We expect 300. We're really confident \u2013 at a minimum, we're really confident in the first half outlook, and we anticipate robust growth and some price inflation there. But the second half remains really harder to predict for us. And so based upon having better visibility, we feel pretty confident in the outlook that we've stated right now. And know that as things change, we'll be more than want to talk about that and talk about the changes in the future how does impact our results. Yes. Just a little bit more to add to that, D.G. I agree, really not a catch-up. We're really focused on maintenance capital in the DC. The DC have been running hard. As you can expect, we're trying to keep up with demand. And so we're making sure that we're spending the right amount of capital there. In addition to that, you hear us continue to talk about continued capacity investment in Japan. So that is a portion of that as well. We mentioned our focus on ESG. So that's about 10% of our capital spend going into next year. So really just getting back to what we would call normal levels of capital as we come out of the recovery. So yes, the LIFO adjustment is in the adjusted results. And just want to remind everyone again that this is a noncash accounting entry and really is not reflective of operational performance. And so this year, at the end of the year, because we invested heavily in growing our inventory, so that it set us up well for the start of this year. That, coupled with cost inflation is the result of a larger adjustment than normal. And that adjustment, which you'll see in the 10-K is more than two times what it's historically been. So you'll see the net of tax around $49 million. So you're correct. It's about 25%. That is factored into our numbers. We really didn't get a benefit from that this year. We don't expect to on a go forward basis unless inflation changes materially. So if I just start back with the U.S. GP probably be a good place to start there. Our goal was to exit the year in line with pre-pandemic levels for high-touch U.S., and so we achieved that around 40%. We will expect high-touch U.S. GP to stabilize into 2022, but we're also expecting a little bit more normal seasonality for our plan this year. We do expect to continue to manage price cost were added to 2022. And then we'll have a little bit of compression potentially from EA. Even though the high touch business is growing much faster than it has historically been, it is still a little bit lighter than the EA business, so that causes a little bit of compression for us. No, I don't see that. I think we're about where we expect to be. If you look at our January results sequentially, we're still up a little bit on pandemic sales, but \u2013 so we have a little way to go that we hope will help us in our current outlook. We've embedded that we get back to normal levels in 2022. So we've embedded that in our plan and in our guide. Well, you want me to start, D.G. and then maybe you can talk about operations? So when you look at our operating cash flow for the year, really two components contribute to that. And neither reasons \u2013 neither of them is really a reason for concern for us. And so the major factor was really our decision to invest in inventory later in the year, so we could have a strong start. And the second one was we had a very robust sales growth in the U.S. in December, really exceptionally strong. And so accounts receivable \u2013 our accounts receivable balance increased based upon the number of orders, but most of those payments are going to come due early in the year. So we're already seeing a consistent trend to what we've seen in prior years related to AR developed. However, as long as we continue to drive very strong sales, our AR balance would be higher than what it has traditionally been, and we expect to continue to support growth with inventory investment. I know you have a question specifically about inventory related to Chinese New Year. So I'll turn it back to D.G. for that. That's correct, D.G. Right. So again, you've also Slide 11, you'll see in High-Touch U.S., our January estimate up about 15%, and that's posed by the pandemic and non-pandemic sales at answers your trending for January question. And then for December sales, I think I'd go back to like what D.G. has articulated, a lot of customers are finding our product availability to be appealing, and we believe that led to a lot of our growth in the U.S. later in the December time frame driven by core pandemic or non-pandemic products."

            "name": "D.G. Macpherson",
            "content": "Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm going to provide an overview of our full year highlights and fourth quarter results, and I'll begin, as we always do, with the Grainger Edge, our strategic framework that defines who we are, why we exist and where we're going, as well as how we'll get there using our operating principles. This framework has been foundational for our team to work through another challenging year with resilience and strength. We remain relentlessly focused on our customers and building the company for the future. I am tremendously proud of what we've achieved and want to thank our team members for their commitment as well as our suppliers and transportation partners for their shared passion to support our customers throughout the year. It is always a privilege to help customers keep their people safe and their operations running, and even more so over the last two years. While 2021 was our second year navigating the impacts of the pandemic, it certainly brought us some unique challenges. Labor material shortages train supply chains throughout the industry. We demonstrated our agility and leveraged our supply chain scale to deliver strong service. Our customer satisfaction remained high. And in my regular interactions with customers, I continue to hear appreciation for our ability to deliver over the last two years. We invested in inventory, which enabled us to improve our availability and meet growing demand, especially in the back half of the year. We've also invested in our team members with increased wages to make sure that our DCs are staffed and able to get orders out the door. I can confidently say that the Grainger team navigated these challenges extremely well and put us in a good position as we enter 2022. While we continue to focus on customers' needs, I'm pleased with the team's progress on our strategic initiatives that we know drive short and long-term growth. Our merchandising team reviewed $1.5 billion of the assortment last year, continuing to make it easier for customers to navigate our website and find the products they need quickly. That brings our total re-merchandise assortment to $4.4 billion, which helps our customers choose products with confidence. We've also increased our marketing investments, especially in areas like paid search, digital and radio ads, which have driven share gain and improved our brand recognition. We're excited by these results and the traction we've gained with both large and midsized customers. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our KeepStock teams have served customers on site, supporting their inventory management needs and offering valuable insights to help them save time and money. This, in conjunction with our e-procurement services has continued to make it easier for customers to do business with Grainger. Around 60% of U.S. revenue now comes from customers with multiple solutions that embed us in their operations. Our technology investments have been critical in supporting these efforts. Over the last two years, we've developed new product information, publishing, customer information and marketing support systems. We continue to improve our technology capabilities to help us win in the market. Our endless assortment segment continues to grow as we made progress on our strategic initiatives. Zoro U.S. achieved its full year SKU count goal, adding over 2.5 million schools this year alone, which brings a total assortment to 8.7 million SKUs. We've expanded to new customer segments and new categories driving both new and repeat business. And in 2021, MonotaRO opened the Ibaraki DC in Japan, allowing them to stock high demand items locally with plans for another DC [indiscernible] Japan in 2022. And finally, we are making strong progress on ESG. 2022 will be our 11th year publishing a corporate responsibility report. We've elevated its importance in our organization through our ESG leadership council, which I chair. In 2021, we reviewed and updated our materiality metrics to ensure our ESG priorities are in line with customer needs and to those of our stakeholders. And we continue to make progress across our ESG pillars. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and driving diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, improving supplier diversity and helping customers meet their ESG goals. All in all, 2021 was a strong year, which positions us well moving forward. Turning to financial highlights. We achieved the full year expectations that we set earlier in the year. Demand was very strong, enabling us to finish the year at $13 billion in sales at the high end of our guided range. Organic daily sales growth was 12.7% for the year, 12.4% on an organic constant currency basis. Our results were driven by strong performance in both segments. Most notably, high-touch solutions in North America had exceptional growth at 10.8% on a daily constant currency basis. In the U.S., we outgrew the market by 100 basis points for the full year 2021, above where we expected to be and outgrew the market by 450 basis points on a two-year average. We faced our fair share of gross margin challenges throughout the year, primarily tied to inventory. We were able to recover well to end the year at 36.2%, resulting from our ability to manage price/cost spread and improved product mix. We delivered 11.9% operating margin, an increase of 65 basis points over the prior year. And lastly, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and delivered a strong ROIC of 31.9%. We met the challenges of the year head on and delivered on our commitments for the full year. Turning to our quarterly results for the company. The story is similar with strong results to share. Baby sales exceeded our expectations and were up 16%, 16.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by double-digit growth in both segments with robust demand. Gross profit margin was 37.3%, 240 basis points above the prior year and in line with our expectations. Dee will go into more detail, but at a high level, because we follow the LIFO method of accounting, our results include an adjustment to reflect the building of core product inventory at higher costs in the fourth quarter, which allowed us to finish the year with a strong inventory position. Our SG&A as a percentage of sales was 24.9%, flat to prior year. When comparing to 2019, which is a more relevant comparison point, our SG&A leverage improved over 200 basis points in the quarter. SG&A was $836 million, driven by higher variable compensation as a result of our strong top line growth. We also saw elevated hourly wages and increased health care expenses and continue to invest in marketing. We gained operating margin leverage of 240 basis points over prior year result of the gross margin improvement. Finally, our resulting EPS was $5.44 for the quarter, up 48.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. And with that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on the quarter and our expectations for 2022. Dee? Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I want to really reiterate my appreciation for the Grainger team and our partnership with our customers and suppliers in this challenging year. While we all hope that 2021 will bring more normalcy than it in fact did, the team remained steadfast in our purpose of keeping the world working and in turn achieved outstanding results for the year, both financially and operationally. In the coming year, we will continue to focus on serving our customers better than anyone else, profitably growing market share and making Grainger a great place to work. We have three core priorities: first, execute on our growth drivers that provide customers with a flawless experience and tangible value to help them operate safely and effectively; second, drive operational excellence and productivity in all that we do to support our growth investments; and third, strengthen our culture and focus on talent development at all levels of the organization. We will execute these efforts with our long-term environmental, social and governance objectives in mind. Finally, I'm excited to announce that we'll be hosting an Analyst Day in the fall of this year, where we will be focused on providing more details on our strategic initiatives and longer-term outlook. With that, we will open the line, up for questions. Thank you. So just to be clear, thanks for the question, and that's a good clarification point. And I can turn it over to Dee for specific. But in general, we talk about share gain, we're talking all about volume. So, our philosophy is to price to market, and then we expect to get volume share gain. That's how we think. Yes. I guess I can start with that one. So we have not changed our expectations for Zoro operating margin. We still are on the same path. We talked about. We have gotten strong gross profit improvement in the business. Some of that \u2013 most of that is squarely focused on quality growth, so making sure we are acquiring business customers that have long-term positive value and really focusing our efforts there, which means we've gotten out of some lower quality growth avenues that we've had in the past. And that has shown a pop. That pop is going to stick, but you're not going to see similar growth in the gross profit line like we've seen. That has been very specifically towards actions to improve the quality of our growth, and we think we're on a good path now. But we're still on the same operating margin. Good morning. Yes. Yes. It's a great question. So it's \u2013 there's a lot of chaos in the supply chain for sure. It has been very costly to get containers out of Asia. We have been prioritizing what we can get in. I think we've done a nice job of navigating the things that we can control. I think the other thing I would point to is we've done a really nice job of crossing items to more locally sourced items to help support customers during this time. And I think our ability to improve our product information has helped us navigate this. We are starting to see some loosening coming from Asia now, and we do expect things to get at least modestly better through the next couple of quarters. And so it's been a challenge. I think it has been a constant seed if you're working in the supply chain, certainly, the last year, our team has done a great job with navigating it. I think relatively, we're doing well, but it's challenging for sure. Yes, I'll turn it over to Dee in a second. I mean so it's not necessarily a catch up. I'd say our CapEx is almost always in supply chain investments and in technology, and that will continue to be the case. I'll turn it over to Dee to talk about specifics. Well, I think there's a number of factors that go into that. We think we probably had some net benefit in the sense that we have product there, there's probably we don't have. And we've been able to navigate the challenge as well. And I talked about it before, but almost every customer call I have now talks about finding alternates that are in stock as opposed to waiting to get received from Asia, and we are aggressively helping our customers find solutions to keep them up and running. And I think that \u2013 all of that in our scale and the inventory pools we have help. We did build inventory in the back half of the year pretty significantly, and that has been a help as well. So I'd say we're a net beneficiary. And I think it's also helped us develop stronger relationships with our customers because we've been able to serve them during this time. Well, I think Dee talked about this a little bit before. We have a lot more clarity about what we'd expect in the first half of the year. Just on compares, we would expect the first half of the year to be stronger in terms of revenue growth. That said, we look at run rate volumes, and we understand how our initiatives impact volume and we're confident in at this point and what we've talked about from a range and feel pretty good about the year in terms of our ability to grow. Yes. So just as a reminder for everybody, I think we've talked about this before. At our peak, we had about $2 billion worth of midsized customer sales. We went down to $800 million. We have recovered a portion of that, but we still have a long ways to go. And our share with midsized customers is still smaller. We are getting smarter in terms of our ability to acquire and develop relationships with midsized customers. It's hard to argue that we'd ever get to the wallet share in any reasonable time horizon that we have with large customers, we do think we can grow it faster than we grow large customers for years to come. So we're pretty confident in the growth path that we expect. Yes. And I think it's a really good question. The short answer is the competitive market is very, very different. In Japan, the market typically goes through wholesalers to local distributors to customers versus what we have in the U.S. with the big distributors that serve customers with all kinds of services today. And so we don't see an opportunity for Zoro and our enterprise customer business. We see that squarely on the shoulders the Grainger brand and the high-tech solutions and the competitive environment makes that very different in the U.S. And so that's our growth path there. Good morning. Yes. I mean, I think through the last two years, we have done well in terms of navigating the supply chain. At first, it was pandemic product. And this past year, it was mostly non-pandemic product, where we have been able to find solutions and work with our customers and our suppliers to figure out how to get the right solutions for our customers. I don't see that changing at all in the first half of the year. I think we're going to be constrained. I know we're constrained now and we'll continue to be constrained as an industry. So I think the things we've been working on figuring out how to help customers find the right solutions in a constrained world will continue to be beneficial. And certainly, we don't really know how every distributor is doing. But having the inventory pools we have, having the information we have, having the data, having the deep customer relationships all helps us help our customers navigate through these really challenging times. I'm not sure if I've got the exact numbers. It's \u2013 I would say most industries are above pre-pandemic levels for us now. Pretty much all manufacturing would be \u2013 there might be some sub-segments. We mentioned aerospace in the UK, aerospace has been challenged, for sure. And then there are certainly industries that we supported like cruise lines and hotels and airlines that are still below. It's a small portion of our total, and we continue to support those customers well and expect to continue to support those customers. But I think it's sort of we aren't talking as if the large portion of our customer base is challenged right now. We're seeing very strong demand in general, and we know there are sub-segments that are still struggling. We would expect those to recover over the next couple of years. Yes. Yes. I mean without going into too many details, we always look at Chinese New Year and try to get out in front of it. Part of the inventory build that we had was being able to pull full containers in earlier, clearly, things are still backed up coming out of China. The Chinese New Year, we're in the midst of it. When it comes out, it typically takes two to four months for things to get totally back to normal. We do expect some ease of supply chain, some more flow to come in. We're starting to see signs that, that is likely to occur. But certainly, this year, we \u2013 it wasn't just Chinese New Year. We're just managing constrained supply chains, and so that was part of it. Yes, yes. So we expect to have a strong SKU count addition this year, the team is working on analytics and works with the team in Japan as well to understand which customers and which product pairs we want to go after. So we do most of that analytically. We use some platform, artificial intelligence type tools to help with that. But a lot of it's good old-fashioned analytics and understanding which target segments we want to go after small business segments we want to go after and which products to add. We continue to have a lot of success with getting those products in and having them be a source of growth for those customer segments. I'm sorry, just to clarify the question. Did you say Endless Assortment or? Yes. Yes. So we had strong growth through almost all the channels. I would say that KeepStock grew faster than the core business last year, continues to be a really core driver of growth in serving customers on site. As does ePro, which is typically connecting our systems directly to purchasing systems. So we continue to have a lot of large complex customers that have multiple points of stickiness and helps the customer manage their purchasing process and their inventory. We have seen, obviously, strong growth with digital, grainger.com has continued to grow very quickly. I think if you looked at it with midsized customers, you'd see digital as the primary source of growth. And if you look at it with large complex customers, you'd see more balance with strong growth in cube stock and ePro is what you typically see. Yes. I think over the last two years, branches have grown slower than e-commerce. That doesn't mean they aren't growing. They've actually had solid growth. But yes, I think Dee, you correct me, I think I'm pretty sure that branch, if you look over the last few years, walk-in traffic has been down, and the pandemic is probably contributed to that. We saw a nice bounce back this year after a pretty significant down in 2020. Good morning. Yes, that's a good question. So it affects MonotaRO only. Zoro is not having unusual investments at this point, and we expect the operating margin to continue to expand for Zoro the next several years. MonotaRO has \u2013 given the Japanese geographic footprint, it's not as broad or as big as the U.S., obviously. And they have very high-volume DCs but very few of them. And so what you're seeing right now is expansion \u2013 capacity expansion around Tokyo and Osaka, which are the two primary places where you need distribution capacity. And you're going to see a lot of redundant assets this year, which is why costs go up, and you're basically running two buildings and doing the transfer. That falls off in 2023. So in 2023, you'll see more of a normal return to SG&A for the MonotaRO business. It's just the \u2013 I think they're going from a 1.1 million square foot building to 1.7 million or something like that around the socket. These are very large buildings. And when you're running both of them at the same time, you have a lot of redundant costs during the transition. All right. Well, thank you. I appreciate everybody's questions, and thanks for the time today. We obviously feel good about the way the year ended and are excited about 2022. We're going to stay focused on making sure we provide the right solutions to our customers, and investing in things that I think the thing I'm most excited about is we have a lot of things we can still get a lot better at. And so it does feel like we are working on the right things, and we'll stay committed to making sure that we build the right systems and processes to support our customers and win for the future. So I hope you all stay warm and you're not getting hit too hard by the storm and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require Operator assistance during the conference, please press star 0 on your telephone keypad.  Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nIrene Holman: Good morning. Welcoming to Grainger 's third quarter 2021 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially due to various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q3 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website.  This morning's call will focus on adjusted results, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings release. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public Company and follows Japanese GAAP, which just differs from U.S. GAAP, and is reported in our results, one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed today will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. With that, I'll turn it over to D.G.\nD.G. Macpherson : Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The Grainger Edge is a framework that defines who we are, why we exist, and where we're going while establishing a set of operating principles. I'm proud of the ways that we use the principles to guide decisions and deliver results. I want to start this quarter with a big thank you. Things are very challenging on many fronts.  Given the ongoing pandemic in labor and material shortages, nothing in the world seems to be working exactly the way it should. Our manufacturing partners, transportation partners, Grainger team members, and certainly our customers are all finding harder than ever to keep the world working. I want to thank all of them for their tremendous efforts. I also want to offer particular thank you to front line workers who continue to go above and beyond.  Grainger is proud to support the hospital staff, government agencies, teachers, and many others, who continue to do great work in a very challenging environment. I might say that in spite of these challenges, we performed very well, but in reality, it's partly because of how we're wired that Grainger is doing so well. We've seen strong demand this quarter, especially in the U.S.  We have product available in our network and have been able to ship it to customers quickly. Our service to customers has been exceptional given the circumstances. We're leveraging our scale, demonstrating our agility, and gaining share. Our goal is to always be in an advantaged position to help our customers solve their problems. As I've been out with customers this past quarter time and again, I hear that Grainger is executing well. Customers tell me that they are pleased with our performance and you can see this in our revenue growth.  While the current supply chain environment is volatile and uncertain, we are confident in our current plans and our readiness to respond to any evolving dynamics. In the face of labor and material shortages throughout the supply chain, we are providing strong relative service and helping our customers avoid disruptions. We continue to actively leverage our network, even if sometimes we have to get the orders from less optimal locations at a higher cost. We are investing in inventory, while actively monitoring the freight market in the West Coast ports.  And as it relates to labor, we have made great progress, including staffing gaps and training team members, which has resulted in improvements, especially in our DC operations. Our customer research shows that this is driving customer satisfaction. Turning to our financial highlights, demand in the quarter was robust, resulting in strong revenue and gross margin performance, and well-managed SG&A. We achieved organic daily sales growth of 11.9% for the total Company on a constant currency basis.  When compared to Q3, 2019, the quarter was up 17.3% on a daily organic basis, driven primarily by core non-pandemic product sales, which is a positive indicator of our underlying run-rate performance. Our High-Touch Solutions, North America segment grew 11.6% on a daily constant-currency basis. In the U.S., we drove approximately 100 basis points of share outgrowth versus the prior year, and 475 basis points on a two-year average.  We remain confident in our ability to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market on an ongoing basis. Our service to customers, especially the last two years, has contributed to meaningful share gains. Our endless assortment segment finished the quarter with 14.9% daily sales growth on a constant currency basis. I'd like to note two things that temporarily moderated growth in this segment. First, Zoro lapped a very strong third quarter in 2020.  For context, we opened up pandemic product supply to Zoro customers in Q3 2020, that was previously reserved mostly for government and healthcare customers. In the third quarter of 2021, Zoro managed to drive 11.9% revenue growth. And when we compare that to Q3 2019, we're up 30.6%, which is really strong. Also, MonotaRO was impacted by several external factors, including a slow start to vaccinations and a generally slower Japanese economy.  In local days and local currency, sales were up about 17.5% compared to Q3, 2020. And MonotaRO continues to take share, especially as COVID restrictions lift, and we grow with our targeted enterprise customers. And as we look at results versus Q3 2019, MonotaRO 's sales are up over 37%. We feel that the comparison to 2019 for both businesses is more indicative of our underlying business strength.  We still expect the segment to close the year with growth at about 20% above prior year. We saw strong gross margin expansion across all segments even above our expectations that we discussed last quarter. High-Touch Solutions North America was up 140 basis points over Q3 of the prior year, and Endless Assortment was up 115 basis points. Dee will cover the drivers for both segments.  Last year we returned $327 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter, and we maintain strong return on invested capital of 31.4%. Turning to our quarterly results for the Company, I discussed most of what's on this slide, but I wanted to point out a few additional items. First, our SG&A was $812 million, right where we thought it would be. We continue to invest in marketing and labor primarily to increased variable compensation and great wage rates in the DCs.  And like many companies, we're also starting to see increased healthcare costs as team members return to routine medical visits and undergo deferred elective procedures. And while overall spending is up versus the prior year, we're still gaining significant leverage when compared to 2019. Our operating earnings were $438 million, up 17.4%, and our resulting EPS is $5.65 for the quarter, which is growth of 25%. Overall, this was a really strong quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail. Dee?\nDee Merriwether: Thanks, DG. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continued to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and up 14.5% compared to the third quarter of 2019. In the U.S. we saw strong growth, especially in our core non-pandemic product categories. Both large and mid-sized customer saw significant growth at 10% and 19% respectively.  Canada continues to be slow as recurring shutdowns in many of the larger provinces had businesses closed or operating at minimal capacity. As vaccination rates improve and businesses reopen, we expect more typical purchasing behavior to resume and sales to follow. Canadian daily sales were up 11.7% or 5.7% in local days and local currency compared to the third quarter of 2020. For the High-Touch Solutions segment, GP margins finished the quarter at 39.4% up 140 basis points versus the prior year Third Quarter.  Our focus and diligence on managing price cost spread contributed to our GP improvement. In the quarter we saw strong price realization to customers, both on-contract and wet pricing. Our realization was better than anticipated, and as a result, price cost spread was above neutral. In addition, consistent with the Second Quarter, our U.S. pandemic product mix was about 22%, an improvement versus 28% in the Third Quarter of 2020.  We are confident that our run rate GP remains strong and we'll finish in line with the expectations we set forth for the Fourth Quarter. On slide 20, you will find a chart with details on the U.S. and Canadian businesses. This information has been provided to help bridge our prior reportable segments to our new High-Touch Solutions North America segment. I'd like to give you some advanced notice that we will continue to show daily sales and gross margin by business.  However, as our operating expenses across the segment have become more intertwined, our operating margin by geography, will no longer be provided in our 2022 reporting. On slide 9, taking a deeper dive into High-Touch Solutions for the U.S., the Delta variant and the renewed mass mandates in July reversed the declining trend we were seeing in the second quarter for pandemic products.  As the virus surged, we saw pandemic product demand pick back up, especially for mass. However, a particular note, our core non-pandemic sales growth was at or above 20% every month in the third quarter. We are encouraged to see this growth as a sign of more regular business and economic activities. When comparing core non-pandemic sales to Q3 2019, sales were up 12%, which is quite strong. In total, our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business is up 12% for the third quarter 2021, and up 16% as compared to 2019.  Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10, in the third quarter as expected, we saw our share gain grow as we let more reasonable yet still inflated Q3 2020 comparisons. In the quarter, we estimated the U.S. market grew between 10.5% and 11.5% resulting in our estimated outgrowth of approximately 100 basis points versus Q3 2020. To normalize for volatility, we're continuing to show the two-year average share gain, which was about 475 basis points over the market for the third quarter of 2021, a really exceptional result.  Given the noise and fluctuations in the market number across industrials, the 2-year average is a better estimate of our true market outgrowth. We remain focused on our key initiatives, which give us confidence in our ability to achieve our U.S. share gain goal of growing 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market. Now let's cover our U.S. GP rate. We saw a significant lift in the High-Touch U.S. GP performance in the quarter.  Sequentially, we wanted to comment on two of the biggest factors that make up the difference between the Second Quarter and the Third Quarter. First, the biggest contributor, the inventory adjustments are behind us as anticipated. In addition, we're seeing greater price realization than expected. I'll note that while we sold some of the pandemic inventory that was previously written down, the impact of GP was immaterial.  We're encouraged by these results, and are confident in our ability to achieve our expected 40.1% GP rate in Q4 based on continued pandemic mix improvements, our expected price realization in the Fourth Quarter, and our ability to navigate supply chain challenges. Moving to our endless assortment segment, daily sales increased 12.7% or 14.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued strength in our new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO, as well as growth of larger enterprise customers at MonotaRO.  GP expanded 115 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by Zoro U.S. We took a number of pricing actions based on evolving market conditions and we de -emphasize lower margin channels. In addition, we experienced improved rate efficiencies to Zoro primarily as a result of fewer B2C customers who typically place smaller orders that are more expensive to ship. Operating margin for the segment finished up 80 basis points over the prior year third quarter, due primarily to improved gross profit margin.  I'll go into more detail on the next slide as we provide further transparency on the results for both businesses. Moving to Slide 13 in local currency and using Japan's local selling days, which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days, MonotaRO daily sales grew 17.5% compared to the third quarter of 2020. GP margin finished the quarter at 25.8%, 30 basis points below the prior-year third quarter, as we continue to grow with enterprise customers.  As a result, operating margin decreased 65 basis points to 12%. Switching to Zoro U.S., daily sales grew 11.9% as compared to the strongest sales quarter of 2020. Zoro GP grew 375 basis points to 33.9% and achieved 325 basis points of operating margin expansion. In addition to the strong financial performance in this segment, we also continue to execute well on our key initiatives.  First, when it comes to our registered users, we saw continued growth across both businesses, which is an important driver of top-line performance. And on the right, Zoro continues to actively add skews to the portfolio. At the end of the third quarter of 2021, we had a total of 8 million skews available online, achieving our goal for the year a quarter early. Adding nearly 2 million skews in the last 9 months. We remain encouraged by our progress with skew additions.  Once again, I would like to provide some color commentary as it relates to the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter, for revenue, we expect total Company daily sales to be between 11.5% and 12.5%. We anticipate Company gross margin will fall between 37.2% and 37.4%. As discussed before, we expect the U.S. GP rate to exit the year at or above pre -pandemic levels.  And for SG&A, we expect a similar level of spending in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter between 810 million and 815 million, with increased variable compensation, wages, and healthcare expenses. And while it's unclear at this point, we may have some additional risk as it relates to vaccine mandate costs. Given the strong performance in the quarter, we remain confident in our guidance range.  For the full year, we expect revenue to be at or above the midpoint, and all other metrics to be stronger than the low end of the range we discussed at the end of the second quarter, but likely still below the midpoint, given the pandemic inventory adjustments taken in the first half. With that, I'd like to turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks. Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I have just a few points.  First, I am immensely proud of the Grainger team and their commitment. It's been very challenging, but we continue to demonstrate the strength and resilience of our team and our supply chain. Second, it was a very good cut quarter across the board, the results were above our expectations. And finally, despite the current market and supply chain uncertainties, we are confident in our ability to deliver solid performance in the Fourth Quarter and into 2022. And with that, we'll open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, we'll be conducting our question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press one -- >  One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please state your question.\nChris Snyder : Thank you. So, my first question is on North America High-Touch growth relative to Zoro. Is it fair to assume that the Company prioritizes High-Touch volumes over endless assortment during periods of tight supply? just given the better margin and more important customers ally, stickier customers on the high margin side?\nD.G. Macpherson : Thanks for the question, and the answer to that question is no. In terms of inventory position, we've been able to serve both the High-Touch model and Zoro well throughout this period. What I would say is that if you're thinking about Zoro's growth, there's a couple of things that are impacting Zoro 's growth rate in the quarter and they will get better as we move forward.  One was last year we opened up in the third quarter, the safety products to Zoro and as a result, customer acquisitions and revenue were extremely high and a lot of the customer acquisitions were consumers as well as people are just looking and scrambling to find product.  The other thing is we've been very clear and focused on attractive business acquisitions. And as a result, we have shut off some channels for acquisition that weren't as profitable long-term. And that's going away moving forward as well. And so that's been a bit of a drag on Zoro, but it hasn't been because we haven't been shipping product from Zoro. We've been serving customers well across both models.\nChris Snyder : I appreciate that. And then second question, I just want to talk about the mid-sized opportunity. Prior to the 2017 price reset, if I remember correctly, the Company had lost a lot of that mid-sized business prior to the reset, but it's coming back really strong up almost 20% in Q3. Can you just help us frame this opportunity going forward? Is there any risk around Zoro cannibalization? And then what kind of gross margin tailwinds could this bring to the Company?\nD.G. Macpherson : Sure. That was a big part of the reason for resetting prices, was we had gone through a long period of decline with mid-sized customers. And here we're really talking about mid-sized customers that have some sort of mechanical complexity. So, think about mid-sized manufacturers or companies that really value some of the technical products support, search capabilities of the Grainger model.  Obviously, since the price reset, we've captured a lot of that back. We're still fairly significantly below our high point with mid-size customers. We feel like we've got a long runway ahead of us. We're getting smarter all the time. We're not seeing much cannibalization with Zoro. Zoro tends to focus on smaller businesses and businesses that are maybe a little narrower in what their needs are, and so they tend to segment to different types of customers more.  The Grainger midsize customer typically has fairly high mechanical complexity or complexity of some type. And so, we are really pleased with what we're seeing. I would say I think we went from 2 billion to less than 1 billion in that space over a 10-year period, and now we've covered some of that, we haven't covered all that, we think we can get back above 2 billion, so we think we've got a long runway ahead.\nDee Merriwether: And D.G., I would just add as it relates to contribution to gross margin. In the quarter it helped us about 10 basis points. And based upon the difference in the large growth rate versus the medium growth rate, if this around that amount, 10% versus 19%, 10% of gross margin, basis points improvement is reasonable.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your questions.\nChristopher Glynn: Yes. Thanks. Congratulations on a good quarter. From the approximately 20% outlook for Endless Assortment for the year, it does imply pretty decent sequential ramp into the fourth quarter. I'm just curious, you've mentioned the Japanese economy. I don't know if you're seeing a pivot there right now. And you also mentioned the channel emphasis shifts at Zoro. Does that imply they're lapping or something?\nD.G. Macpherson : Yes. Get it. Both of those things are correct. So, in Japan, they got a really slow start to vaccinations and had fairly hard shutdowns over the summer, and they've rectified their problem. They now have pretty high vaccination rates and we're starting to see more activity with larger manufacturing customers, in particular in Japan.  So, we are seeing some improvement there and expect to see that continue. With Zoro, yes, we have effectively lapped some of the actions we took to focus more on profit and customer acquisitions so both of those things should help us moving into the fourth quarter.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. And then the price realization obviously came in better than you expected, as you said. You have a lot of freight contracts that have been good. At some point, those come out and you also at times in the past have had ability to defer costs increases from suppliers at times. So, I'm wondering how those figures in given that you've been really locked down really tightly on the gross margin view here and how it transpired. We in a sweet spot there as you pivot into '22 with some of those things I mentioned come into play?\nD.G. Macpherson : Let me try to answer the question. We generally try to think about managing cost as well as we possibly can. We are obviously working with our suppliers on a constant basis in this environment to make sure that we are taking cost increases that makes sense and pushing back things if they don't make sense. Our spires have been great about working with us to find the right path for cost increases. And then on transportation, sort of the same thing.  We really are focused on understanding what cost increases are reasonable in working with our suppliers and our partners to get the right outcome. We priced the market. I think in general when you have inflationary periods, not this type of inflationary period but normal inflationary periods, we've historically probably been able to take market price increases and not have as much cost increase or have it delayed.  And so, we will sometimes have a period of advantage. I think right now given the pace of cost increases, I think we're pretty well matched and we'll continue to be pretty well matched. And that's our expectation given there has been a lot of off-cycle cost increases and we've been able to price this through as we go. I would say I don't think there's a big gap right now, or a big benefit right now. We're just -- it's a fairly wild time obviously in the supply chain, and we're -- I think we're navigating through it well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.\nRyan Merkel: Thanks. Good morning. D.G., you mentioned that your navigating supply chain costs will create challenge as well. Can you talk about some of the actions that you took?\nD.G. Macpherson : Well, you know, I guess the probably can't talk about all the details, but there's challenges at every stage of the supply chain at this point. And so, I think the amount of work that's required to navigate here is much more than you would find in a typical setting. One of the things we did do is we saw some challenges coming on the horizon, we actually pretty ordered a bunch of products early in the year, try to get inventory and we have been able to build some inventory throughout the year.  Maybe not as much as we'd like, but we have been able to build some inventory that helped us. Our supplier management team and product teams are working very closely together to find -- make sure we've got the right substitute products so we can serve customers if there's a gap in a particular supplier that can't provide us the product. We are actively prioritizing product coming off of Asia.  We have up-wages and distribution centers and gotten staffing right, so we are basically clean, consistently now, which is good. That was a little bit a bit of a challenge back in May. So basically, if you follow the supply chain view at every single step, we are working it every single step of the way. And there's really no other path right now but just to make sure we are executing as well as possible at using our agility and our scale to try to make sure we can service our customers, and we've done that well.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Makes sense. Okay, and my follow-up is on SG&A leverage. I know in '21 you had costs returning and then of course higher costs from the supply chain issues. My question is, how should we think about SG&A leverage in '22. Are you able to have productivity offset higher costs or do you expect costs to ramp further off of the 4Q baseline?\nDee Merriwether: Well, I can take that D.G. Our focus right now is making sure that we can continue to serve customers well. Some of the rampage you've noted is due to some of the actions we took last year to really have tight cost controls around that time period. So when -- I think a good measure is probably to look at our 2019 costs and look at some of the SG&A leverage we have been able to gain over that time period since we haven't provided maybe real guidance related to 2022 yet.  But that's how we're focusing on it. And we are still looking to continue to gain leverage as we head into 2022. Very similar to what we were doing around 2019-time frame is the best I'd be able to tell you at this point in time. But we are not getting off the fact that we're focused on continuing to gain SG&A leverage over the longer term.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nD.G. Macpherson : Morning.\nDee Merriwether: Good morning.\nDeane Dray: Hey, good morning. I appreciate you gave price costs for the U.S. High-Touch Business. What was price costs for the total Company, if you can be specific or directionally? And then do you have a target for 2021 just given the circumstances in terms of supply chain pressures, inflation, etc.?\nDee Merriwether: Yes. Yeah. We don't measure EA on price, cost basis, so that's why you don't hear us talk about total Company price costs. But the thing I will say is, all of the segments and all of the businesses are very focused on 1, maintaining price competitiveness, and 2, in this inflationary period, being able to pass on cost to customers. So that is a consistent tenant for us, so that is what I can say. And the other thing I would say.\nDeane Dray: Got it.\nD.G. Macpherson : Deane, to your question, clearly Zoro had very high price costs leverage given the GP improvement. Like we said, some of that's just segment-specific, which customers they're acquiring and how they're thinking about acquiring it. But we do expect their most assortment to continue to have strong profitability and profitably improvement in Zoro.\nDeane Dray: Appreciate that. And then as a follow-up just related to price, the 3% points in price and High-Touch this quarter, just what's the expectation for 4Q? Does that carry -- are there other price actions that you've taken? And do you -- was that -- will that all carry into 2022? Is there any sense of some pushback, receptivity issues in terms of pricing? Do we carry that into 2022 or not?\nDee Merriwether: We did take some pricing actions in September. And we saw some good results there, and also through the month of October thus far. So, we expect that momentum to carry us through Q4. And like always, D.G. mentioned our supply management team is continuing to work with our supply base on what increases look like for 2022. And we expect to continue. We do get more costs to pass that through early in Q1.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Good morning. As a percentage of sales gross margin and OpEx, I think will be very different in 2022 versus what they were in 2019. And the reason I mentioned that, Dee, you made a comment about leverage in 2022 being similar to 2019. Were you referring to contribution margins there? Or if you can just help clarify that statement.\nDee Merriwether: Sure. So was trying to get some contact since we are not talking about 2022 at this point, just to help you understand that we're focused on gaining leverage and back in 2019, we had set out a path to say that we were looking to continue to focus on growing expenses less than sales. So that's the tenant that I was trying to articulate since we are not giving guidance on 2022 at this point.\nDavid Manthey: Okay, understood. And then as it relates to your pricing mechanisms, I think you talked before about the open pricing on the website. You can just adjust immediately, but could you talk about contract pricing and what I'm wondering is where are you being most effective in recapturing inflation these days? Is it just the low spot prices or is it surcharges or renegotiating contracts, how are you being so effective at this point?\nDee Merriwether: So, we are capturing price inflation in all areas. I would say with customers that primarily by on web price, and we've contract customers. Earlier in the year, we talked about the fact that it would be a little lumpy because of the timing as it relates to when we could pass on price with customers, but similar to some of the actions that D.G. articulated, that we are executing as it relates to supply chain.  That also goes for the commercial teams, as they are working with customers to pass on price. So, we're close to the end of the year now and a lot of those discussions that both our sales team and then online, we've been able to pass on these costs pretty effectively. So that applies to contract customers, as well as web-based customers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please state your question.\nAdam Uhlman: Hey, guys. Good morning. I guess I was wondering if you could share with us what you're seeing with your Keep Stock business, how sales have been unfolding there. And it would seem like you should be having better access in the customer side. So, I'm wondering if you could share any insights about new customer wins or any new initiatives recently or maybe what you have planned for next year.\nD.G. Macpherson : Sure. We continue to -- the Keep Stock is really a critical portion of our business. It's been -- a portion of our business has been obviously busy throughout the pandemic. We've had access to all of our customer inventory, well, not all but the vast majority of customer inventory locations and have continued to serve customers well through Keep Stock. We have put in a number of improvements to help us be more effective in planning. customers inventory and fulfilling customers inventories to Keep Stock.  We continue to get significant growth out of Keep Stock. Certainly, heavy manufacturing has come back this year. It's been very, very good for our Keep Stock business and that because of the heavy Keep Stock area. I won't talk too much about what we're investing in, other than to say we are investing significantly in improved software capabilities to enable us to provide better service to customers and better analytical insights to customers. And that's going to be a continuous focus for us around the Keep Stock area.\nAdam Uhlman: Okay. Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, Dee, I think you had mentioned vaccine mandate costs, and I believe that there's some element of -- with the G&A contract, there might be a requirement for vaccination. Could you just help me understand what all that might mean for Grainger and the potential cost for the business?\nD.G. Macpherson : Do you want -- I'll take this one. This is a kind of challenging one in many ways, we are certainly a federal contractor. We will comply with G&A order. We have planned in place to comply with that. I would say the OSHA ruling, and how that comes down, is probably more of a question mark in terms of vaccine mandate cost. We are ready to do what we need to do, and prepared to do whatever needs to happen. We are hopeful that the vaccine mandate is done in a way that doesn't hurt the supply chain.  I've been in our transportation depo's and our facilities and our customers' facilities and a vaccine mandate that's not well thought through could cause significant problems to an already challenged supply chain. And so, we are -- we don't know where all that's going to land just to be clear. But we are prepared and we've done some things to prepare for any eventuality there and trying to understand what the best path forward is going to be depending on how  vaccines go.?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacob Levenson with Melius Research. Please state your question.\nJacob Levenson: Good morning, everybody.\nDee Merriwether: Morning.\nJacob Levenson: Just wanted to -- you guys have a pretty clean balance sheet at this point and DG and I are new. When you took the helm a couple of years ago, you flexed up a little bit, and that's more aggressive buybacks. So maybe you can just help us think for higher look in the balance sheet today and maybe secondarily to that, whether M&A could play a role over the next couple of years.\nDee Merriwether: This is Dee, I'll start off. We like our credit rating, of course, and we don't see any big changes related to our capital allocation strategy. We did provide guidance that from a share buyback, we thought we would be somewhere between the 600 to 700 million range for the year. And we think we're going to be at the high end for this year. And so no real, I would say changes to our philosophies that we've had in the past, that's working well for us.\nJacob Levenson: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe this is a bit of a   something that we don't -- doesn't get a lot of airtime is maybe you can help us understand that are how the -- how that business is doing and how the turnarounds were going on the update there.\nD.G. Macpherson : Maybe --\nDee Merriwether: D.G. you want to start?\nD.G. Macpherson : I'll just get past it. Cromwell is a relatively -- it's obviously not a huge business for us, but it's an important one in terms of understanding whether we can get the growth we need to get in the U.K. I said, UK market has been challenged. Team's done a nice job of improving service and serving customers through this time. They have over the last few years, they will consistently lower the loss.  And we feel like it's a business that has a potential to be a strong contributor from a profit perspective over time. But we still have some work to do. But I would say that they've reset their cost structure, they're providing great service to customers, and they have lowered their losses over the last few years. And we would expect them to show profitability coming out of 2022.\nDee Merriwether: The only thing I'd add there is that on the quarter, Clan well was able to cut their losses year-over-year, and we expect them to come close to cutting them in half, which is what the focus has been, year-over-year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please state your question.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. My question was just around Zoro U.S. Maybe just talk about the competitive dynamic in that market. I know its smaller customers online-only et - cetera. But just maybe talk about who you're competing with there. And then I guess you have 8 million skews. Where could that skew count goes eventually?\nD.G. Macpherson : Well, so on the second half of that question, we have 8 million skews today, we would expect to get to 10 million in the next couple of years at a minimum. And whether or not it goes to 15 or more is probably still open for debate, but we know we've got a long way to go to get the skew count t right. In terms of the competitive market, it's really very, very broad online. It's big Internet players. It's certain marketplaces.  Customers sometimes buy through smaller local retailers as well. And so, there's a very broad competitive set when you look at small businesses and how they buy, sometimes they buy through hardware stores.  And it's pretty fragmented today and there's a lot of different options for small businesses to buy MRO products. And so that market in particular super fragmented. And so, we feel like we're growing and gaining share from a number of different sources, but it's not like there's one or two players that are dominating that space, it is very, very broad in terms of competitive set.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And my follow-up question, I'll turn it over just on achieving pre -pandemic gross margin s in the U.S. business exiting this year. I know you've talked about price realization, you talked about inventory adjustments, etc. But maybe just talk about the confidence level there and what could go wrong for you not to achieve that? I know we are already in the fourth quarter, so there's two months left or whatever, so any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson : Go ahead, Dee.\nDee Merriwether: Yeah. What I would say is, we're pretty confident, and that's why we continue to focus on showing you where we've come from and where we're going in the decks, and continue to talk about it.  But the two biggest factors that really give us confidence is the product mix. Where we are versus last year, we were at -- in the U.S., we were at 28% on pandemic, and now we're at 22% and trending as we would expect. And then price, which we've talked quite a bit about here today. So, I noted earlier that we implemented some price increases in September, and the realization in September and October is looking good.  We expect that to continue through the fourth quarter, and we expect it to cover costs that we have visibility to. And as it relates to anything else related to supply chain challenges, D.G. talked a lot about that. We are very focused on it and we believe our scale puts us in a unique position to deal with some of those challenges today. We have good availability and we're managing the cost process well, so I think we're pretty confident.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Luke Capital. Please go ahead with your question.\nChris Dankert: Hey, morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just thinking about the Endless Assortment business here. Again, 20% growth over the medium-term, aggressive -- very impressive growth, but I guess, strategically what's the biggest bottleneck to growth in that business? When given the scalability of digital, if it is simply customer awareness and engagement, which obviously takes time, but what -- why couldn't that be 30% or something even higher at this point?\nD.G. Macpherson : Yeah, I think if you look at the long history of MonotaRO you start to understand the limits. Obviously that business has gone from nothing to over $2 billion and has a very long history of growing very, very quickly. But 20% has been a number that they've been at for a long time.  Most of that has to be -- is really about making sure that you have the process' systems in place to acquire attractive small business customers or business customers. And then you have to work very hard to get them to repeat and to become regular purchasing customers. And that is not something that throwing a whole bunch of money at necessarily helps.  You've got to be very targeted in how you're acquiring customers and you have to be targeted about how you're working in identifying what segment they're in and what matters to them so that you can actually get the growth that you want to get. So, it isn't an easy thing. It is a scalable business for sure, but our experience has been that the team's ability to build the capabilities, learn, and have high-quality growth, limits you at about 20% in many cases. And we've seen that through \nDavid Manthey: That's very, very helpful. Thank you. I guess, again, fairly sizable investment in that business this year. As we go forward, just how do we think about SG&A growth in that business. At this point, is it principally advertising analytics spend, or is there -- do we need any additional, kind of physical assets there? Just how we think about SG&A growth in Endless Assortment?\nD.G. Macpherson : Yeah. I would say -- I would have different answers to MonotaRO and Zoro. Zoro, it's mostly around marketing data analytics systems. They've built much of their own system infrastructure now they continue to invest in systems.  The investments aren't huge physical assets in Minoterie, we have that plus you have given their growth and their size, they're going to be investing in the next 3 to 4 years, 5 years in pretty significant distribution center efforts as well. While we don't talk about that much, they have been exceptional actually building physical assets to serve their customers and they have more of those investments that they will make over the next 3 to 4 years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hey, good morning, guys. Well, just a first question on I guess kind of the competitive benefit of just having a better supply chain and some of your smaller competitors. How do you go about ensuring that the share you've picked up on that converts at some reasonable level to something permanent and like?  It just means you can point to in the past, maybe even the pandemic-related stuff in terms of like converting those marginal customers or stop by customers and something more structural like, how is -- what's your approach been like on that?\nD.G. Macpherson : Yeah, it's a great question. I think the reality is that when you are out served customers that becomes a pretty sticky growth. It always has been in our business. And so, when you're able to have better service than the market in general, typically you see a fairly long-time horizon when you can continue to grow.  Right now, I'd say our customers are having all conversations with us about the sustainability of the supply chain, and how we can leverage our capabilities to help them grow into the future. It certainly doesn't feel like this is a one and done advantage. It feels like people are trying to figure out how to make sure that they can function really effectively going forward, or having all conversations about how to help customers lower their processing costs, improve their inventory management, the core things that we typically work on with customers we are really engaged with right now.  So, I would just say that we feel like certainly there'll be some of this -- we talked about that last year, having pandemic products, some of our very outsized share growth last year was not going to repeat. But the 475-basis point per year share growth feels like that's repeating. And it feels like it's sustainable in terms of the volume that we've captured as sustainable.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then I appreciate the color on the inventory repricing and above one-for-one or matching that in real - time, not a lot of temporary benefits. But maybe just looking at the other side of the equation with some bigger customers on contract, how are you keeping up with the price cost equation there? Is it getting a little bit more kind of exotic with things like surcharges? And then what are you anchoring that sort of stuff to? Because inflation feels a little bit more unusual than just like pay steel is higher, everything is higher and not every product category has the same pain points. So how are you managing with that, when customers that are maybe on a bit more long - term contracts or tend to be a little bit more inflexible on price?\nD.G. Macpherson : Dee, do you want to take that or let me --\nDee Merriwether: Yes. I was about to jump in Sorry. I'm not seeing a big difference between customers. I would say at this point, I think especially during this time our product availability is really what is at the forefront of some of our relationships, whether you are midsize, large local or large contracts. In addition to the things that D.G just noted related to the way we serve customers in a multichannel way, right now, I think there's also boarding very well for us.  In addition to how easy it is for them to find the products on our website, which time is money for a lot of these customers. Right now, they are dealing with a lot of challenges, like we are experiencing, and I think that availability is what's really making the big difference. Even for large contract customers, there is some inflexibility in some pricing, but we do have more flexibility right now than I would say we've had of late.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please state your questions.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Wanted to ask a short-term question and then a more strategic question. But last quarter, you were pointing towards the low and the margin range anyway. Now you're pointing towards the low-to-midpoint.  So, I'm just curious. I think I know the answer, but I'd be curious D.G, Dee, what's changed from your perspective from July to now? And I'm specifically interested in whether pricing has been stronger, whether the retention on pricing has been stronger, that surprise is the upload.\nDee Merriwether: You just said it there at the end, Q3 was better than what we expected. We had improved mix and improved price, and that favorability of flooring through the full-year EPS for us. And revenue, that volume coming through with that price was better than what we expected.  And so just to reiterate the total Company expectations, we've  that through to talk to you about where we expect to be on a four-year basis, Revenue being stronger and so then we said that we're going to be at the midpoint of the range there. And then for everything else, I reiterated that at least with these results, that we would be low end up to the midpoint. We've tried to pull in the improvement that we saw in Q3.\nNigel Coe: And the pricing part of that question is that being surprisingly good?\nDee Merriwether: Yes, price realization is better than we would have expected at this point.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that's great. And then the medium-sized customer growth market share gain strategy, the inside sales will be a very important part of that strategy alongside the repriced initiatives. So just curious, maybe just give us an update, DG, on what's happening with the inside sales force and some of the metrics around that and whether you've been investing in that capability.\nD.G. Macpherson : Sure. I would say that inside sales have -- have had a really nice bounce - back this year. They cover ed customers last year, obviously, some of which have been struggling. But we've seen a really nice revenue path with inside sales. One thing I would point out is that during the pandemic, we have been fairly locked in our coverage. And the reason is we wanted the relationships to be stable as customers went through the pandemic.  And so, we haven't invested a lot more, and we haven't invested any less. In inside sales, we consider it to be an important part of our future, and we've liked the results we've had. But given the pandemic, we haven't really changed coverage anywhere during the pandemic. We're talking about adding some coverage, potentially in the future. But we'll talk about that as we head into the future. But so far, it's been a very stable and nice growth path for us this year. The inside sales team.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nPatrick Baumann: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First one is on Zoro gross margin. I thought that the view here was that Zoro was going to face some mix headwinds over time from more third-party products. And I could see the skews have gone up a lot in that area. Is that still the case? Or is this like shifts in customer channel enough to offset that such that gross margin there can actually improve?\nD.G. Macpherson : Well, yeah. I mean, I think what you saw is that the shifts we've made in terms of how we're acquiring customers and focusing on acquiring really strong business customers, has helped gross margin more than the third-party shipping has had it.  Third-party shipping will be a small drag we think over the next several years, as it becomes a bigger portion of the mix, but we still think we've got ways to continue to improve gross margin. We've seen that this year in the hold, whole gross margin closer to steady moving forward.\nPatrick Baumann: How biggest is third-party shipping now as a percentage of mix, or whatever?\nD.G. Macpherson : What's that?\nPatrick Baumann: As a percentage of scales, I guess or wherever you want to talk about?\nD.G. Macpherson : It's a growing portion of sales. I don't think we typically talked about that number. We'll probably talk about that at the end of the year when we talk about the path moving forward.\nPatrick Baumann: And then a quick one on receivables. Can you just talk about the comment in the release about like that $268 million of growth being driven by growth in credit sales? Is that a change in how things are normally done? I just -- I'm asking because I don't recall seeing that language from you before. Maybe I've missed it.\nDee Merriwether: Yeah, it's not a change. It's just in relation to the fact that our sales are up and as a result of that, that's driving accounts receivable up as well.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay, great, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please state your questions.\nMichael Mc Ginn: Hey, just a quick one for me. Do the majority of your contract\u2019s re-price at a certain time like calendar year-end or are they're kind of staggered throughout the year? And what percentage of your contracts have yet to reset at the new pricing?\nD.G. Macpherson : Contracts can be of different durations. They can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years. I'd say 3 years is a more common version. But in general, when we set contracts, we set specific times, multiple times a year, when we can alter price either up or down based on market Conditions. So most of our contracts have the ability to reset price multiple times during the year. 3 times a year is the most common number of times you can reset price.\nMichael Mc Ginn: Thanks.\nEnd Of Q&A :\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to A - D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson : Great. Well, thanks everybody for joining us, we really appreciate it. Hopefully you can tell we feel good about the quarter, but more importantly, I think we feel good about how we're growing, how we're gaining share, our ability to navigate the supply chain issues, and still continue to invest in core initiatives that we think are going to be important to our long-term success. So, we feel really good about the path forward as well. Wish all of you a safe Halloween, and look forward to talking to you soon. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference; all parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",

            "name": "Dee Merriwether",
            "content": "Thanks, DG. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continued to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and up 14.5% compared to the third quarter of 2019. In the U.S. we saw strong growth, especially in our core non-pandemic product categories. Both large and mid-sized customer saw significant growth at 10% and 19% respectively.  Canada continues to be slow as recurring shutdowns in many of the larger provinces had businesses closed or operating at minimal capacity. As vaccination rates improve and businesses reopen, we expect more typical purchasing behavior to resume and sales to follow. Canadian daily sales were up 11.7% or 5.7% in local days and local currency compared to the third quarter of 2020. For the High-Touch Solutions segment, GP margins finished the quarter at 39.4% up 140 basis points versus the prior year Third Quarter.  Our focus and diligence on managing price cost spread contributed to our GP improvement. In the quarter we saw strong price realization to customers, both on-contract and wet pricing. Our realization was better than anticipated, and as a result, price cost spread was above neutral. In addition, consistent with the Second Quarter, our U.S. pandemic product mix was about 22%, an improvement versus 28% in the Third Quarter of 2020.  We are confident that our run rate GP remains strong and we'll finish in line with the expectations we set forth for the Fourth Quarter. On slide 20, you will find a chart with details on the U.S. and Canadian businesses. This information has been provided to help bridge our prior reportable segments to our new High-Touch Solutions North America segment. I'd like to give you some advanced notice that we will continue to show daily sales and gross margin by business.  However, as our operating expenses across the segment have become more intertwined, our operating margin by geography, will no longer be provided in our 2022 reporting. On slide 9, taking a deeper dive into High-Touch Solutions for the U.S., the Delta variant and the renewed mass mandates in July reversed the declining trend we were seeing in the second quarter for pandemic products.  As the virus surged, we saw pandemic product demand pick back up, especially for mass. However, a particular note, our core non-pandemic sales growth was at or above 20% every month in the third quarter. We are encouraged to see this growth as a sign of more regular business and economic activities. When comparing core non-pandemic sales to Q3 2019, sales were up 12%, which is quite strong. In total, our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business is up 12% for the third quarter 2021, and up 16% as compared to 2019.  Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10, in the third quarter as expected, we saw our share gain grow as we let more reasonable yet still inflated Q3 2020 comparisons. In the quarter, we estimated the U.S. market grew between 10.5% and 11.5% resulting in our estimated outgrowth of approximately 100 basis points versus Q3 2020. To normalize for volatility, we're continuing to show the two-year average share gain, which was about 475 basis points over the market for the third quarter of 2021, a really exceptional result.  Given the noise and fluctuations in the market number across industrials, the 2-year average is a better estimate of our true market outgrowth. We remain focused on our key initiatives, which give us confidence in our ability to achieve our U.S. share gain goal of growing 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market. Now let's cover our U.S. GP rate. We saw a significant lift in the High-Touch U.S. GP performance in the quarter.  Sequentially, we wanted to comment on two of the biggest factors that make up the difference between the Second Quarter and the Third Quarter. First, the biggest contributor, the inventory adjustments are behind us as anticipated. In addition, we're seeing greater price realization than expected. I'll note that while we sold some of the pandemic inventory that was previously written down, the impact of GP was immaterial.  We're encouraged by these results, and are confident in our ability to achieve our expected 40.1% GP rate in Q4 based on continued pandemic mix improvements, our expected price realization in the Fourth Quarter, and our ability to navigate supply chain challenges. Moving to our endless assortment segment, daily sales increased 12.7% or 14.9% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued strength in our new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO, as well as growth of larger enterprise customers at MonotaRO.  GP expanded 115 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by Zoro U.S. We took a number of pricing actions based on evolving market conditions and we de -emphasize lower margin channels. In addition, we experienced improved rate efficiencies to Zoro primarily as a result of fewer B2C customers who typically place smaller orders that are more expensive to ship. Operating margin for the segment finished up 80 basis points over the prior year third quarter, due primarily to improved gross profit margin.  I'll go into more detail on the next slide as we provide further transparency on the results for both businesses. Moving to Slide 13 in local currency and using Japan's local selling days, which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days, MonotaRO daily sales grew 17.5% compared to the third quarter of 2020. GP margin finished the quarter at 25.8%, 30 basis points below the prior-year third quarter, as we continue to grow with enterprise customers.  As a result, operating margin decreased 65 basis points to 12%. Switching to Zoro U.S., daily sales grew 11.9% as compared to the strongest sales quarter of 2020. Zoro GP grew 375 basis points to 33.9% and achieved 325 basis points of operating margin expansion. In addition to the strong financial performance in this segment, we also continue to execute well on our key initiatives.  First, when it comes to our registered users, we saw continued growth across both businesses, which is an important driver of top-line performance. And on the right, Zoro continues to actively add skews to the portfolio. At the end of the third quarter of 2021, we had a total of 8 million skews available online, achieving our goal for the year a quarter early. Adding nearly 2 million skews in the last 9 months. We remain encouraged by our progress with skew additions.  Once again, I would like to provide some color commentary as it relates to the fourth quarter and the full year. For the fourth quarter, for revenue, we expect total Company daily sales to be between 11.5% and 12.5%. We anticipate Company gross margin will fall between 37.2% and 37.4%. As discussed before, we expect the U.S. GP rate to exit the year at or above pre -pandemic levels.  And for SG&A, we expect a similar level of spending in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter between 810 million and 815 million, with increased variable compensation, wages, and healthcare expenses. And while it's unclear at this point, we may have some additional risk as it relates to vaccine mandate costs. Given the strong performance in the quarter, we remain confident in our guidance range.  For the full year, we expect revenue to be at or above the midpoint, and all other metrics to be stronger than the low end of the range we discussed at the end of the second quarter, but likely still below the midpoint, given the pandemic inventory adjustments taken in the first half. With that, I'd like to turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks. Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I have just a few points.  First, I am immensely proud of the Grainger team and their commitment. It's been very challenging, but we continue to demonstrate the strength and resilience of our team and our supply chain. Second, it was a very good cut quarter across the board, the results were above our expectations. And finally, despite the current market and supply chain uncertainties, we are confident in our ability to deliver solid performance in the Fourth Quarter and into 2022. And with that, we'll open it up for questions. And D.G., I would just add as it relates to contribution to gross margin. In the quarter it helped us about 10 basis points. And based upon the difference in the large growth rate versus the medium growth rate, if this around that amount, 10% versus 19%, 10% of gross margin, basis points improvement is reasonable. Well, I can take that D.G. Our focus right now is making sure that we can continue to serve customers well. Some of the rampage you've noted is due to some of the actions we took last year to really have tight cost controls around that time period. So when -- I think a good measure is probably to look at our 2019 costs and look at some of the SG&A leverage we have been able to gain over that time period since we haven't provided maybe real guidance related to 2022 yet.  But that's how we're focusing on it. And we are still looking to continue to gain leverage as we head into 2022. Very similar to what we were doing around 2019-time frame is the best I'd be able to tell you at this point in time. But we are not getting off the fact that we're focused on continuing to gain SG&A leverage over the longer term. Good morning. Yes. Yeah. We don't measure EA on price, cost basis, so that's why you don't hear us talk about total Company price costs. But the thing I will say is, all of the segments and all of the businesses are very focused on 1, maintaining price competitiveness, and 2, in this inflationary period, being able to pass on cost to customers. So that is a consistent tenant for us, so that is what I can say. And the other thing I would say. We did take some pricing actions in September. And we saw some good results there, and also through the month of October thus far. So, we expect that momentum to carry us through Q4. And like always, D.G. mentioned our supply management team is continuing to work with our supply base on what increases look like for 2022. And we expect to continue. We do get more costs to pass that through early in Q1. Sure. So was trying to get some contact since we are not talking about 2022 at this point, just to help you understand that we're focused on gaining leverage and back in 2019, we had set out a path to say that we were looking to continue to focus on growing expenses less than sales. So that's the tenant that I was trying to articulate since we are not giving guidance on 2022 at this point. So, we are capturing price inflation in all areas. I would say with customers that primarily by on web price, and we've contract customers. Earlier in the year, we talked about the fact that it would be a little lumpy because of the timing as it relates to when we could pass on price with customers, but similar to some of the actions that D.G. articulated, that we are executing as it relates to supply chain.  That also goes for the commercial teams, as they are working with customers to pass on price. So, we're close to the end of the year now and a lot of those discussions that both our sales team and then online, we've been able to pass on these costs pretty effectively. So that applies to contract customers, as well as web-based customers. Morning. This is Dee, I'll start off. We like our credit rating, of course, and we don't see any big changes related to our capital allocation strategy. We did provide guidance that from a share buyback, we thought we would be somewhere between the 600 to 700 million range for the year. And we think we're going to be at the high end for this year. And so no real, I would say changes to our philosophies that we've had in the past, that's working well for us. D.G. you want to start? The only thing I'd add there is that on the quarter, Clan well was able to cut their losses year-over-year, and we expect them to come close to cutting them in half, which is what the focus has been, year-over-year. Yeah. What I would say is, we're pretty confident, and that's why we continue to focus on showing you where we've come from and where we're going in the decks, and continue to talk about it.  But the two biggest factors that really give us confidence is the product mix. Where we are versus last year, we were at -- in the U.S., we were at 28% on pandemic, and now we're at 22% and trending as we would expect. And then price, which we've talked quite a bit about here today. So, I noted earlier that we implemented some price increases in September, and the realization in September and October is looking good.  We expect that to continue through the fourth quarter, and we expect it to cover costs that we have visibility to. And as it relates to anything else related to supply chain challenges, D.G. talked a lot about that. We are very focused on it and we believe our scale puts us in a unique position to deal with some of those challenges today. We have good availability and we're managing the cost process well, so I think we're pretty confident. Yes. I was about to jump in Sorry. I'm not seeing a big difference between customers. I would say at this point, I think especially during this time our product availability is really what is at the forefront of some of our relationships, whether you are midsize, large local or large contracts. In addition to the things that D.G just noted related to the way we serve customers in a multichannel way, right now, I think there's also boarding very well for us.  In addition to how easy it is for them to find the products on our website, which time is money for a lot of these customers. Right now, they are dealing with a lot of challenges, like we are experiencing, and I think that availability is what's really making the big difference. Even for large contract customers, there is some inflexibility in some pricing, but we do have more flexibility right now than I would say we've had of late. You just said it there at the end, Q3 was better than what we expected. We had improved mix and improved price, and that favorability of flooring through the full-year EPS for us. And revenue, that volume coming through with that price was better than what we expected.  And so just to reiterate the total Company expectations, we've  that through to talk to you about where we expect to be on a four-year basis, Revenue being stronger and so then we said that we're going to be at the midpoint of the range there. And then for everything else, I reiterated that at least with these results, that we would be low end up to the midpoint. We've tried to pull in the improvement that we saw in Q3. Yes, price realization is better than we would have expected at this point. Yeah, it's not a change. It's just in relation to the fact that our sales are up and as a result of that, that's driving accounts receivable up as well."

            "name": "D.G. Macpherson",
            "content": "Thanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. The Grainger Edge is a framework that defines who we are, why we exist, and where we're going while establishing a set of operating principles. I'm proud of the ways that we use the principles to guide decisions and deliver results. I want to start this quarter with a big thank you. Things are very challenging on many fronts.  Given the ongoing pandemic in labor and material shortages, nothing in the world seems to be working exactly the way it should. Our manufacturing partners, transportation partners, Grainger team members, and certainly our customers are all finding harder than ever to keep the world working. I want to thank all of them for their tremendous efforts. I also want to offer particular thank you to front line workers who continue to go above and beyond.  Grainger is proud to support the hospital staff, government agencies, teachers, and many others, who continue to do great work in a very challenging environment. I might say that in spite of these challenges, we performed very well, but in reality, it's partly because of how we're wired that Grainger is doing so well. We've seen strong demand this quarter, especially in the U.S.  We have product available in our network and have been able to ship it to customers quickly. Our service to customers has been exceptional given the circumstances. We're leveraging our scale, demonstrating our agility, and gaining share. Our goal is to always be in an advantaged position to help our customers solve their problems. As I've been out with customers this past quarter time and again, I hear that Grainger is executing well. Customers tell me that they are pleased with our performance and you can see this in our revenue growth.  While the current supply chain environment is volatile and uncertain, we are confident in our current plans and our readiness to respond to any evolving dynamics. In the face of labor and material shortages throughout the supply chain, we are providing strong relative service and helping our customers avoid disruptions. We continue to actively leverage our network, even if sometimes we have to get the orders from less optimal locations at a higher cost. We are investing in inventory, while actively monitoring the freight market in the West Coast ports.  And as it relates to labor, we have made great progress, including staffing gaps and training team members, which has resulted in improvements, especially in our DC operations. Our customer research shows that this is driving customer satisfaction. Turning to our financial highlights, demand in the quarter was robust, resulting in strong revenue and gross margin performance, and well-managed SG&A. We achieved organic daily sales growth of 11.9% for the total Company on a constant currency basis.  When compared to Q3, 2019, the quarter was up 17.3% on a daily organic basis, driven primarily by core non-pandemic product sales, which is a positive indicator of our underlying run-rate performance. Our High-Touch Solutions, North America segment grew 11.6% on a daily constant-currency basis. In the U.S., we drove approximately 100 basis points of share outgrowth versus the prior year, and 475 basis points on a two-year average.  We remain confident in our ability to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market on an ongoing basis. Our service to customers, especially the last two years, has contributed to meaningful share gains. Our endless assortment segment finished the quarter with 14.9% daily sales growth on a constant currency basis. I'd like to note two things that temporarily moderated growth in this segment. First, Zoro lapped a very strong third quarter in 2020.  For context, we opened up pandemic product supply to Zoro customers in Q3 2020, that was previously reserved mostly for government and healthcare customers. In the third quarter of 2021, Zoro managed to drive 11.9% revenue growth. And when we compare that to Q3 2019, we're up 30.6%, which is really strong. Also, MonotaRO was impacted by several external factors, including a slow start to vaccinations and a generally slower Japanese economy.  In local days and local currency, sales were up about 17.5% compared to Q3, 2020. And MonotaRO continues to take share, especially as COVID restrictions lift, and we grow with our targeted enterprise customers. And as we look at results versus Q3 2019, MonotaRO 's sales are up over 37%. We feel that the comparison to 2019 for both businesses is more indicative of our underlying business strength.  We still expect the segment to close the year with growth at about 20% above prior year. We saw strong gross margin expansion across all segments even above our expectations that we discussed last quarter. High-Touch Solutions North America was up 140 basis points over Q3 of the prior year, and Endless Assortment was up 115 basis points. Dee will cover the drivers for both segments.  Last year we returned $327 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the third quarter, and we maintain strong return on invested capital of 31.4%. Turning to our quarterly results for the Company, I discussed most of what's on this slide, but I wanted to point out a few additional items. First, our SG&A was $812 million, right where we thought it would be. We continue to invest in marketing and labor primarily to increased variable compensation and great wage rates in the DCs.  And like many companies, we're also starting to see increased healthcare costs as team members return to routine medical visits and undergo deferred elective procedures. And while overall spending is up versus the prior year, we're still gaining significant leverage when compared to 2019. Our operating earnings were $438 million, up 17.4%, and our resulting EPS is $5.65 for the quarter, which is growth of 25%. Overall, this was a really strong quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail. Dee? Thanks for the question, and the answer to that question is no. In terms of inventory position, we've been able to serve both the High-Touch model and Zoro well throughout this period. What I would say is that if you're thinking about Zoro's growth, there's a couple of things that are impacting Zoro 's growth rate in the quarter and they will get better as we move forward.  One was last year we opened up in the third quarter, the safety products to Zoro and as a result, customer acquisitions and revenue were extremely high and a lot of the customer acquisitions were consumers as well as people are just looking and scrambling to find product.  The other thing is we've been very clear and focused on attractive business acquisitions. And as a result, we have shut off some channels for acquisition that weren't as profitable long-term. And that's going away moving forward as well. And so that's been a bit of a drag on Zoro, but it hasn't been because we haven't been shipping product from Zoro. We've been serving customers well across both models. Sure. That was a big part of the reason for resetting prices, was we had gone through a long period of decline with mid-sized customers. And here we're really talking about mid-sized customers that have some sort of mechanical complexity. So, think about mid-sized manufacturers or companies that really value some of the technical products support, search capabilities of the Grainger model.  Obviously, since the price reset, we've captured a lot of that back. We're still fairly significantly below our high point with mid-size customers. We feel like we've got a long runway ahead of us. We're getting smarter all the time. We're not seeing much cannibalization with Zoro. Zoro tends to focus on smaller businesses and businesses that are maybe a little narrower in what their needs are, and so they tend to segment to different types of customers more.  The Grainger midsize customer typically has fairly high mechanical complexity or complexity of some type. And so, we are really pleased with what we're seeing. I would say I think we went from 2 billion to less than 1 billion in that space over a 10-year period, and now we've covered some of that, we haven't covered all that, we think we can get back above 2 billion, so we think we've got a long runway ahead. Yes. Get it. Both of those things are correct. So, in Japan, they got a really slow start to vaccinations and had fairly hard shutdowns over the summer, and they've rectified their problem. They now have pretty high vaccination rates and we're starting to see more activity with larger manufacturing customers, in particular in Japan.  So, we are seeing some improvement there and expect to see that continue. With Zoro, yes, we have effectively lapped some of the actions we took to focus more on profit and customer acquisitions so both of those things should help us moving into the fourth quarter. Let me try to answer the question. We generally try to think about managing cost as well as we possibly can. We are obviously working with our suppliers on a constant basis in this environment to make sure that we are taking cost increases that makes sense and pushing back things if they don't make sense. Our spires have been great about working with us to find the right path for cost increases. And then on transportation, sort of the same thing.  We really are focused on understanding what cost increases are reasonable in working with our suppliers and our partners to get the right outcome. We priced the market. I think in general when you have inflationary periods, not this type of inflationary period but normal inflationary periods, we've historically probably been able to take market price increases and not have as much cost increase or have it delayed.  And so, we will sometimes have a period of advantage. I think right now given the pace of cost increases, I think we're pretty well matched and we'll continue to be pretty well matched. And that's our expectation given there has been a lot of off-cycle cost increases and we've been able to price this through as we go. I would say I don't think there's a big gap right now, or a big benefit right now. We're just -- it's a fairly wild time obviously in the supply chain, and we're -- I think we're navigating through it well. Well, you know, I guess the probably can't talk about all the details, but there's challenges at every stage of the supply chain at this point. And so, I think the amount of work that's required to navigate here is much more than you would find in a typical setting. One of the things we did do is we saw some challenges coming on the horizon, we actually pretty ordered a bunch of products early in the year, try to get inventory and we have been able to build some inventory throughout the year.  Maybe not as much as we'd like, but we have been able to build some inventory that helped us. Our supplier management team and product teams are working very closely together to find -- make sure we've got the right substitute products so we can serve customers if there's a gap in a particular supplier that can't provide us the product. We are actively prioritizing product coming off of Asia.  We have up-wages and distribution centers and gotten staffing right, so we are basically clean, consistently now, which is good. That was a little bit a bit of a challenge back in May. So basically, if you follow the supply chain view at every single step, we are working it every single step of the way. And there's really no other path right now but just to make sure we are executing as well as possible at using our agility and our scale to try to make sure we can service our customers, and we've done that well. Morning. Deane, to your question, clearly Zoro had very high price costs leverage given the GP improvement. Like we said, some of that's just segment-specific, which customers they're acquiring and how they're thinking about acquiring it. But we do expect their most assortment to continue to have strong profitability and profitably improvement in Zoro. Sure. We continue to -- the Keep Stock is really a critical portion of our business. It's been -- a portion of our business has been obviously busy throughout the pandemic. We've had access to all of our customer inventory, well, not all but the vast majority of customer inventory locations and have continued to serve customers well through Keep Stock. We have put in a number of improvements to help us be more effective in planning. customers inventory and fulfilling customers inventories to Keep Stock.  We continue to get significant growth out of Keep Stock. Certainly, heavy manufacturing has come back this year. It's been very, very good for our Keep Stock business and that because of the heavy Keep Stock area. I won't talk too much about what we're investing in, other than to say we are investing significantly in improved software capabilities to enable us to provide better service to customers and better analytical insights to customers. And that's going to be a continuous focus for us around the Keep Stock area. Do you want -- I'll take this one. This is a kind of challenging one in many ways, we are certainly a federal contractor. We will comply with G&A order. We have planned in place to comply with that. I would say the OSHA ruling, and how that comes down, is probably more of a question mark in terms of vaccine mandate cost. We are ready to do what we need to do, and prepared to do whatever needs to happen. We are hopeful that the vaccine mandate is done in a way that doesn't hurt the supply chain.  I've been in our transportation depo's and our facilities and our customers' facilities and a vaccine mandate that's not well thought through could cause significant problems to an already challenged supply chain. And so, we are -- we don't know where all that's going to land just to be clear. But we are prepared and we've done some things to prepare for any eventuality there and trying to understand what the best path forward is going to be depending on how  vaccines go.? Maybe -- I'll just get past it. Cromwell is a relatively -- it's obviously not a huge business for us, but it's an important one in terms of understanding whether we can get the growth we need to get in the U.K. I said, UK market has been challenged. Team's done a nice job of improving service and serving customers through this time. They have over the last few years, they will consistently lower the loss.  And we feel like it's a business that has a potential to be a strong contributor from a profit perspective over time. But we still have some work to do. But I would say that they've reset their cost structure, they're providing great service to customers, and they have lowered their losses over the last few years. And we would expect them to show profitability coming out of 2022. Well, so on the second half of that question, we have 8 million skews today, we would expect to get to 10 million in the next couple of years at a minimum. And whether or not it goes to 15 or more is probably still open for debate, but we know we've got a long way to go to get the skew count t right. In terms of the competitive market, it's really very, very broad online. It's big Internet players. It's certain marketplaces.  Customers sometimes buy through smaller local retailers as well. And so, there's a very broad competitive set when you look at small businesses and how they buy, sometimes they buy through hardware stores.  And it's pretty fragmented today and there's a lot of different options for small businesses to buy MRO products. And so that market in particular super fragmented. And so, we feel like we're growing and gaining share from a number of different sources, but it's not like there's one or two players that are dominating that space, it is very, very broad in terms of competitive set. Go ahead, Dee. Yeah, I think if you look at the long history of MonotaRO you start to understand the limits. Obviously that business has gone from nothing to over $2 billion and has a very long history of growing very, very quickly. But 20% has been a number that they've been at for a long time.  Most of that has to be -- is really about making sure that you have the process' systems in place to acquire attractive small business customers or business customers. And then you have to work very hard to get them to repeat and to become regular purchasing customers. And that is not something that throwing a whole bunch of money at necessarily helps.  You've got to be very targeted in how you're acquiring customers and you have to be targeted about how you're working in identifying what segment they're in and what matters to them so that you can actually get the growth that you want to get. So, it isn't an easy thing. It is a scalable business for sure, but our experience has been that the team's ability to build the capabilities, learn, and have high-quality growth, limits you at about 20% in many cases. And we've seen that through Yeah. I would say -- I would have different answers to MonotaRO and Zoro. Zoro, it's mostly around marketing data analytics systems. They've built much of their own system infrastructure now they continue to invest in systems.  The investments aren't huge physical assets in Minoterie, we have that plus you have given their growth and their size, they're going to be investing in the next 3 to 4 years, 5 years in pretty significant distribution center efforts as well. While we don't talk about that much, they have been exceptional actually building physical assets to serve their customers and they have more of those investments that they will make over the next 3 to 4 years. Yeah, it's a great question. I think the reality is that when you are out served customers that becomes a pretty sticky growth. It always has been in our business. And so, when you're able to have better service than the market in general, typically you see a fairly long-time horizon when you can continue to grow.  Right now, I'd say our customers are having all conversations with us about the sustainability of the supply chain, and how we can leverage our capabilities to help them grow into the future. It certainly doesn't feel like this is a one and done advantage. It feels like people are trying to figure out how to make sure that they can function really effectively going forward, or having all conversations about how to help customers lower their processing costs, improve their inventory management, the core things that we typically work on with customers we are really engaged with right now.  So, I would just say that we feel like certainly there'll be some of this -- we talked about that last year, having pandemic products, some of our very outsized share growth last year was not going to repeat. But the 475-basis point per year share growth feels like that's repeating. And it feels like it's sustainable in terms of the volume that we've captured as sustainable. Dee, do you want to take that or let me -- Sure. I would say that inside sales have -- have had a really nice bounce - back this year. They cover ed customers last year, obviously, some of which have been struggling. But we've seen a really nice revenue path with inside sales. One thing I would point out is that during the pandemic, we have been fairly locked in our coverage. And the reason is we wanted the relationships to be stable as customers went through the pandemic.  And so, we haven't invested a lot more, and we haven't invested any less. In inside sales, we consider it to be an important part of our future, and we've liked the results we've had. But given the pandemic, we haven't really changed coverage anywhere during the pandemic. We're talking about adding some coverage, potentially in the future. But we'll talk about that as we head into the future. But so far, it's been a very stable and nice growth path for us this year. The inside sales team. Well, yeah. I mean, I think what you saw is that the shifts we've made in terms of how we're acquiring customers and focusing on acquiring really strong business customers, has helped gross margin more than the third-party shipping has had it.  Third-party shipping will be a small drag we think over the next several years, as it becomes a bigger portion of the mix, but we still think we've got ways to continue to improve gross margin. We've seen that this year in the hold, whole gross margin closer to steady moving forward. What's that? It's a growing portion of sales. I don't think we typically talked about that number. We'll probably talk about that at the end of the year when we talk about the path moving forward. Contracts can be of different durations. They can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years. I'd say 3 years is a more common version. But in general, when we set contracts, we set specific times, multiple times a year, when we can alter price either up or down based on market Conditions. So most of our contracts have the ability to reset price multiple times during the year. 3 times a year is the most common number of times you can reset price. Great. Well, thanks everybody for joining us, we really appreciate it. Hopefully you can tell we feel good about the quarter, but more importantly, I think we feel good about how we're growing, how we're gaining share, our ability to navigate the supply chain issues, and still continue to invest in core initiatives that we think are going to be important to our long-term success. So, we feel really good about the path forward as well. Wish all of you a safe Halloween, and look forward to talking to you soon. Thanks so much."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Irene Holman, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nIrene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures and their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q2 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning\u2019s call will focused on adjusted results, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings release. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to D.G.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Irene. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today I\u2019ll provide an overview of our second quarter results and progress toward our goals as the economy recovers. Before we get into details on the quarter, I'd like to spend a moment highlighting our Grainger Edge framework. Two years ago, we launched this framework that defines who we are, why we exist, and where we're going. It covers our purpose, aspiration, strategy and the principles that drive our actions. It all starts with our purpose. We keep the world working. We shared this with all team members across the company in 2019, while the concepts weren\u2019t new and many were already part of our operational DNA, the framework provided clarity on who we are and what we do, as well as a common language for our team members. The Grainger Edge has guided us through the pandemic, and I'm proud of how the Grainger team has continued to embrace it. It's also been a strong foundation for how we serve our customers and helped us through the challenges of the last 18 months. Speaking of challenges, 2021 has provided plenty. The year has been characterized by strong demand, but a very challenging supply chain environment. Raw material shortages, labor shortages and transportation challenges have been the norm particularly in the second quarter. These challenges are industry-wide. And while we're not immune to them, we are uniquely positioned to leverage our scale and navigate through these ongoing difficulties. Importantly, this year, the supply chain has become a competitive sport. And while we've had obstacles and things are messier than normal, our customer research suggests we are navigating the obstacles well and providing very strong relative service during this time. We are actively leveraging our network. For example, for a customer located in New York, we would typically fulfill their entire order from our Northeast DC. Due to supply constraints or product delays, now part of the order may only be available in Louisville. In this case, the order may be fulfilled from Louisville, adding an extra day and incremental cost to the order. But we are able to leverage our network to provide and protect our great service. We are also leveraging our branches for more shipping in this environment. In addition, we have accelerated the ramp of our Louisville DC, which has helped alleviate capacity constraints. This building is a great asset for Grainger, and will continue to ramp capacity through the next 18 months. The good news is that we still have very high availability in our network even if the product comes from an alternate location. I've had the opportunity to be in the field quite a bit this past quarter and have been excited to spend time with the customers and hear their feedback. I'm hearing consistently that while we may be delivering a bit differently than the past, we are serving our customers better than the competition. We have validated this feedback on our recent customer service and a vast majority said we were doing better than distributors right now. We are also investing on non-pandemic inventory and partnering closely with our suppliers to work through any supply constraints, inbound lead time challenges and any potential cost increases. Additionally, shortage in the labor market have had a significant impact for all companies this year. In response, we have increased our wages to attract and retain talent, especially in our distribution centers. We've implemented robust training programs to onboard new team members and train existing team members to work throughout our buildings. We have made great progress in closing staff and gaps and will continue to do so over the third quarter. Finally, transportation has been very challenging. That is clearly linked to the product and labor shortages. While we have always prioritized optimal routes and cost efficiencies, over the last few months, we have partnered with our carriers in new ways to ensure we are meeting customer expectations. We have also added new partners to our carrier mix to handle our volume and provide us flexibility. It's important to note that the overall freight market is volatile and uncertain. While we are confident in our current plans to manage these challenges, there are a lot of moving pieces and constraints across all modes, parcel, LTL and ocean freight. For example, the ocean freight market has been uncertain as the pandemic surges again in Asia and container costs fluctuate. We are ready to respond to any of these dynamics. We expect the supply chain challenges to last through the end of the year and likely well into next year. I have no doubt, as we continue to live the Grainger Edge and follow our principles, we'll not only get through these challenges, but will deliver strong results and take market share. Turning to our financial highlights. The bottom line is that our performance has been in line with our expectations and what we communicated on our last earnings call. The only exception that this has been gross profit impacted primarily by the changes in May to the CDC mask guidelines halfway through the quarter. Heading into the second quarter, all external factors were pointing to a reopening in the U.S. around or sometime after the 4th of July, giving us a full quarter to sell through as much of our remaining pandemic inventory as possible. Based on our internal scenario planning, we thought that potential adjustments in Q2 would fall somewhere between $45 million and $50 million. We shouldn\u2019t predict precisely how the demand curve has fall and when. Then when a CDC mass guidance change in mid-May, we saw demand for pandemic product especially in mask declined rapid. As a result of the sudden weakening in demand, we had more pandemic inventory remaining than expected, and we took a $63 million adjustment, about $15 million more than our internal scenario planning. We believe this completes, any material pandemic related inventory adjustments. Without this incremental changed we would have been roughly flat sequentially. We understand the CDC has just changed guidance again this week. While the situation is fluid, we do not expect any material change in our outlook as a result of this change. Shifting to the other financial results. We achieved strong organic daily sales growth of 15% for the company on a constant currency basis within our guided range. When compared to 2019, Q2 was up about 14% on a daily organic basis, a positive indicator of our strong performance and recovery beyond the pandemic. Our High-Touch Solutions North America segment grew 12.7% on a daily constant currency basis. In the U.S., we lapped the most extreme volatility of 2020. Looking at the 2-year average in the second quarter of 2021, we drove approximately 275 basis points of average market outgrowth. We remain very confident in our ability to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market on an ongoing basis. We expect the volatility of 2020 and 2021 to average out and get back to normal heading into 2022. Our Canadian business drove positive operating earnings growth for the quarter and managed expense as well. We are seeing continued momentum in targeted end markets, especially heavy manufacturing and higher education as schools prepare to reopen in the fall. And we continue to diversify the business beyond natural resources. The Endless Assortment model had another impressive quarter with 23.9% daily sales growth on a constant currency basis, fueled by strong customer acquisition. Lastly, we generated $269 million in operating cash flow and achieved strong ROIC of 29. 2%. Turning to our quarterly results for the company. I've discussed most of what's on this slide, but I wanted to point out two additional items. First, our SG&A was $790 million, in line with the guided range provided on our first quarter call. As expected, we increased SG&A for the quarter as we continue to invest in marketing and in our people through increased variable compensation and wage rates in the DCs. This resulted in total company operating margin of 10.4%, down 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $15 million incremental inventory adjustment, GP would have been roughly flat sequentially and have been roughly flat sequentially and operating margin would have been 10.9%. Resulting EPS would have been around $4.50. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on our two segments. Dee?\nDee Merriwether: Thanks D.G. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continue to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 13.7% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 9.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. In the U.S., we saw strong growth in our non-pandemic product category with product mix returning to more normal levels. For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 36.9%, down 125 basis points versus the prior year. I think it's important to note that without the $63 million of inventory adjustment, GP would have been up 125 basis points year-over-year. This 250 basis point swing demonstrates that our underlying GP rate would have otherwise been a healthy 39.4%. Coupled with our focus on achieving price/cost neutrality, we are confident that our run rate GP remains strong. SG&A in the segment ramped as expected to $640 million, lapping the lowest point of SG&A spend in the second quarter of 2020. Canada continue to make solid progress and expanded operating margins, approximately 315 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with last quarter, we have included a chart with details on the U.S. and the Canadian businesses on the first page of the appendix. On Slide 10 ,looking at pandemic product trends, I want to highlight two things before we dive into the Q2 numbers. First, we left the extreme growth experience last year and saw decreased demand for PPE products. Accordingly, pandemic sales declined approximately 28% versus 2020. However, that's an impressive 27% increase versus 2019. We estimate July 2021 will be down about 28% over July 2020, in line with what we saw in the second quarter of this year. More importantly, we see the trend in our non-pandemic sales as a positive sign of economic recovery. During the quarter, we grew 31% versus 2020 and up 7% versus 2019. We're seeing end markets like commercial, which include our severely disrupted customers in hospitality, along with heavy manufacturing, make a significant comeback. We estimate that for the month of July 2021, non-pandemic sales growth of about 22%. As it relates to pandemic product mix, while we expected it to taper off to near pre-pandemic levels to about 20% by year-end, we're seeing this happen more quickly now at about 22% of sales. In total, our U.S. High Tech Solutions business is up about 12% for the second quarter of 2021 and up 10% over 2019. Looking at market outgrowth on slide 11, we are lapping the highest concentration of large pandemic purchases of the prior year. At this time, the market declined between 14% and 15% and we saw outsized share gains of roughly 1,200 basis points. For Q2 2021, we're seeing the opposite effect. We estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 18.5% and 19.5%. The U.S. High-Touch business grew 12.4%, about 650 basis points lower than the market. To normalize for the volatility, we calculated the two-year average share gain to be 275 basis points over the market. There's some noise in the market number because across industrials, given the dynamics and fluctuations over the last two years. Therefore, the 2-year average is a better estimate of what's really going on. As I previously noted, our U.S. High-Touch business is up 10% over 2019. As the impact of the pandemic subside, coupled with our coupled with our strong progress on key initiatives, and our return on investments like marketing, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our share gain goals. Now let's cover our U.S. GP rate. As previously discussed, our second quarter GP decline resulted from the $63 million inventory adjustment. This adjustment lowered U.S. GP by 270 basis points. Without this, our underlying U.S. GP rate is 39.8% in the second quarter. As we look to the remainder of 2021, it is important to note, we are operating in a very challenging and fluid environment. We're doing everything within our control to exit the year with a Q4 GP rate at/or above the Q1 2020 levels or 40.1%. We remain confident in our ability to achieve this target for a few reasons. First, as noted earlier, we anticipate no further material pandemic related inventory adjustments. Excluding the inventory impact, our GP rate is nearing this level already. As we discussed on slide 10, our pandemic product mix is close to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect this to fully normalize in the second half. And we've seen evidence that we can continue to maintain price/cost neutrality. On the cost side, we have a robust process to partner with our suppliers and understand the specific raw material impacts as well as other conditions that may result in increased costs. As it relates to price, our goal is to continue to maintain competitiveness in the market and pass what is applicable. In the first half, we were slightly above neutrality. And as we expect to take additional price increases in the second half to offset what we're expecting in costs. Even in this inflationary environment, we are confident we will be able to execute and achieve neutrality through the remainder of the year. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 23% or 23.9% on a constant currency basis driven by continued strength in new customer acquisitions at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as growth of larger enterprise customers in MonotaRO. We did had 75 basis points year over year, driven by positive trends and both businesses and operating margins finished up 95 basis points over the prior year. I'll go into more detail on the next slide, as we provide further transparency on the results of both of these businesses  Moving to Slide 14, please remember that MonotaRO is a public company, and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers we disclose will differ somewhat from MonotaRO\u2019s public statements.  In local currency, and using Japan's local selling days which occasionally different from U.S. selling days, MonotaROs daily sales grew 16.7%. of GP finishing the quarter at 26.4%, 25 basis points above the prior year. Operating margin decreased 15 basis points to 12% as they continue to ramp up operations at the Ibaraki DC. Again, another strong quarter for MonotaRO. Switching to Zoro U.S., daily sales grew 32.6% as it laps its softest quarter of 2020. Zoro GP grew 95 basis points to 31.5% and achieved 320 basis points of operating margin expansion through substantial SG&A leverage in the quarter. All in all, very impressive results. Moving to Slide 15. In addition to the strong financial performance, we're seeing positive results with our key operating metrics. As you saw in the first quarter, we've listed total registered users for both businesses, an important driver of top line performance. Both MonotaRO and Zoro have shown progress and are up over 20% over the second quarter last year. On the right, Zoro continues to actively add skews to the portfolio. At the end of the second quarter of 2021, we had a total of 7.5 million skews available online. Closer. Our goal was 8 million for the year. We remain encouraged by our progress with SKU additions beyond traditional MRO. Now I'll provide commentary as it relates to the upcoming quarter and our expectations for the full year. For the third quarter, on a total company level, we expect our revenue growth to be between 10% and 11% on a daily organic basis. We believe any material pandemic-related inventory adjustments are complete, and we expect GP to be up between 100 and 120 basis points year-over-year and to improve sequentially. SG&A is anticipated to fall between $805 million and $815 million as we continue to invest in marketing and wages in the DCs to remain competitive. Transitioning to our total company guidance, I'd like to provide some brief commentary on how we're trending so far. We expect strong sales to continue, while GP operating margin and EPS will face pressure as a result of the incremental inventory adjustments and freight costs, along with increased DC wages and marketing. While we are maintaining our guidance, we expect results to trend towards the low end of our range with the exception of revenue. We expect revenue to be near the midpoint. As it relates to our segment operating margins, we think that some of the supply chain challenges as well as the first half inventory adjustment will weigh more heavily on the High-Touch Solutions segment, and therefore, High-Touch operating margin may trend at the low end of the range. At the same time, we believe Endless Assortment, driven by strong performance and improving margins may end the year at the high end, both helping to support delivery of total company results. We are not adjusting guidance as we are confident in our ability to deliver results within our guidance ranges. As we learn more, we'll continue to keep you apprised of any changes. With that, I'll turn it back over to. D.G. for some closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up questions, I wanted to share two recent company accomplishments. First, I'm proud to announce that earlier this month, Grainger was certified as A Great Place to Work, a true testament to the exceptional team member experience we've built and an important milestone in advancing the Grainger Edge. Second is our 10th year of publicly reporting our ESG efforts. I wanted to share highlights from our new corporate responsibility report. At Grainger, we embrace our obligation to operate sustainably and with a long-term fact based view of critical issues regarding the environment, society at large, and corporate governance. For example, in 2012, we became the first industrial distributed publicly disclose our carbon footprint. In 2013 we became the first in our industry to set a public greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, which we achieved two years early. We just set a new goal last year to reduce the absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. We're also committed to helping our customers achieve their ESG goals through our products and services. We now offer more than 100,000 environmentally-friendly products. Through this portfolio, we're able to help customers maintain sustainable facilities, the efficient energy management, water conservation, waste reduction, and improved indoor air quality. In 2017, Grainger signed the Chicago Network Equity Pledge focused on achieving 50% representation of women in leadership positions by 2030. And this year, we formed the ESG Leadership Council, which I Chair. The council is comprised of Grainger leaders who provide strategic direction and oversight on our ESG efforts. You can find the new report at graingeresg.com. With that, we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nChristopher Glynn: Good morning. Congratulation on no adjustments, rare thing these days. Curious on the large customer contracts, you talked about having good price cost trends overall. Just curious how that works with the large customer contracts.\nD.G. Macpherson: Dee, why don't you take that one?\nDee Merriwether: Sure. So as we've discussed in the past, we have about 70% of our business in the U.S. with large customers, and that business runs through their contracts. We have the right to pass on price increases to those customers at different times in the year. And so as you can imagine, our cost increases coming in from our suppliers and the timing of when we can pass on price increases to those contract customers do not always line up perfectly. So it ends up having some lumpiness as it relates to GP. But overall, those actions that we're taking with those customers are going well. And we have been able to pass on cost increases to those customers. I'd also like to remind you that the rest of the business, about 30% is on a wet price, which we have the ability to change in line with the market. And we do that to remain competitive with others in the market that have visible prices.\nD.G. Macpherson: The only thing I'd add to that, Chris, and thanks for the question, is that we have a very - as Dee said, a very robust process in terms of managing costs. This is an environment right now where everybody is raising price on everything. And we are effectively working with our suppliers to mitigate the cost. And so the conversations with customers are well-understood and expected at this point. So I would say if we continue to do both of those things well, we feel like we can be in good shape.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. Thanks for that. And on the guidance, kind of, separately heard at the low end in the slide, and then towards the low end. I don't know about other people, I read those a little bit differently. Just want to clarify your intent?\nDee Merriwether: So I think if you go back to our prepared remarks, we expect revenue to remain strong and fall within the range. And while GP operating margin and EPS will be pressured primarily due to some of the inventory adjustments that we have taken this year, we're happy to be back past that. But because of that, and some other pressures related to some wage increases and things like that that D.G. noted, we will - we're saying now that GP operating margin and EPS will fall at the lower end of the guidance range that we provided in the first quarter. So we are maintaining our guidance and giving color related to revenue, GP, operating margins and EPS.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please state your question.\nChris Snyder: So the company has demonstrated a pathway to get back to pre-pandemic gross margin, and when we see the inventory adjustments, we're almost already there. But I guess what's the outlook for either 2022, or 2022 and beyond once we get back there? Is the expectation that we can get to pre-pandemic levels and hold it? or should we expect moderation thereafter on competition? Or is there an opportunity to improve it, given what we're seeing with outgrowth from midsized customers?\nD.G. Macpherson: So thanks for the question. I think if you step back, I think we find that comparisons to 2019 or early 2020 are probably better than last year at this point because there's so much messages in the year-over-year numbers. But our general thinking is, we will exit the year with having gained significant share and in a better spot from an economic perspective with similar GP and better SG&A leverage. And that's kind of the model going forward. We feel like we're priced competitively. We feel like we can hold GP in each of our business units fairly consistently over time and get some SG&A leverage. And so our whole model is based on consistent share gain and slightly expanding operating margins. Typically, we would expect GP to hold relatively flat as a percentage moving forward with some SG&A leverage.\nChris Snyder: I appreciate that. And then I wanted to follow up on the U.S. 2-year outgrowth, which fell to 275 bps a bit below the 300 to 400 the company was targeting. Is there anything specific there to call out? Or is that just quarter-to-quarter lumpiness? And then I guess what gives you confidence that we'll get back into that 300, 400 bp range, at least on a multiyear basis into the back half and then thereafter?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. For the year, we're still within our expectation. Now I would say, just to be frank, a lot of the comparisons, we had the market growing 18% to 19% in the second quarter. It's tough to find sort of any peers that have grown that way. Relative to peers, we think we're doing good. And we look at both our own metric, which is based on industrial production, and we look at peers. And so we feel very strong about our performance. We also feel and the returns we're seeing. We're tracking everything, and we feel very good. We think right, what you're seeing for the second quarter is a lot of messiness in metrics and pandemic-driven sort of ups and downs. But through cycle, we're very confident we're going to be able to achieve our target.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nDeane Dray: And I also join Chris in saying it's great to see that you did flow through that inventory write-down through your operating results. So we appreciate the transparency there. And just - and D.G., you did say this is a fluid environment. We recognize that, and there are some regions that are going to return to mask mandates. Would there be any potential scenario where this inventory could eventually be sold? So are you still carrying that inventory? Because I think the way the accounting works, it would be sold at all profits since you've now taken the costs out. Is that the correct understanding?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So to be clear, our accounting for the quarter was what happened at the end of the quarter and through a couple of weeks after that when we actually put the results together, working with our team and our external accountants. And we just follow our process, the mask change that happened in a last couple of days, I will say that every single external announcement in the pandemic has driven behavior. So we are expecting in the short term to get some increased mask sales. We haven't flown that through. You're right, there's a potential, but it's so early, 48 hours' worth of revenue wouldn't give us any indication. And things are so fluid and change so fast, it's really hard to tell. Obviously, if we went into full lockdown with full mask usage, what you described could in fact could in fact be true. But it's just really uncertain right now.\nDeane Dray: Of course, I appreciate that. And then I may have missed the explanation, but MonotaRO, the margin pressure this quarter was the 15 basis points. Is that pandemic related? What's the explanation there?\nD.G. Macpherson: I think Dee talked about it. But basically, starting at the [Rocky] DC, which was an expected cost is a big part of that. So, given their growth, they have put significant investments in the distribution centers and that has added some costs. They're still very, very profitable and still seeing very good growth relative to what has been a pretty challenging market in Japan.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead. David Manthey, your line is open, please unmute yourself.\nDavid Manthey: First off, I'm trying to understand the guidance as you put it to the low end, not the lower end of the range. When I run the numbers here, if I'm doing this right, $15 million is maybe $0.20 after-tax and relative to $1.50 range. I mean, if you're originally at the midpoint, now you're maybe $0.1950 something, I'm just wondering that excluding this write-down, have your expectations for the second half changed in the past 90 days? I know you said it's fluid, but it seems like to immediately go to the low end of the range seems a little bit much relative to the inventory adjustment that was unexpected.\nDee Merriwether: Yes, I'll start and then maybe D.G. can add on if he wants to add any more color. A couple of things have happened since the last time we talked. And we talked about it in our prepared remarks related to the messiness of the market and industry supply chain challenges, being able to make sure that we can hire and retain the right people in our DCs, which is critical to our business. And so we're seeing some labor inflation that wasn't projected at that time. So, that plays into it additional marketing spend to continue to focus on our brand and improve our web conversion with our customers as well. So, we talked about some of those things in our stated remarks as well. And so again, we're guiding to the low end of the range as it relates to that plus the inventory actions we've taken.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: My first question is on freight. How much will freight hurt margins in 2021? And then how are the conversations going with customers where you're asking some of them to pay freight where they have been getting free freight in the past?\nDee Merriwether: So, starting last year, as you can imagine trying to work through somewhere north 2,000 type customers with conversations with large customers. Those conversations have been going well. But there's two things I think you have to take into account. Either there are some freight rate changes that have come from some visible partners that are easier to talk through. And so those things have gone extremely well and continue to go well. So, no problems up to this point with being able to pass on some freight costs to our customers.\nD.G. Macpherson: I would add, Ryan, there's a number of factors. One is freight rates. The other is just the service challenges, and we are - we've certainly added some costs. We are going to recoup certainly some of that, if not all of that. But just to be able to make sure that we have delivery assurance they can actually get product to customers right now is not as trivial as it historically has been. So we're having to prioritize loads more than we've ever prioritized loads, containers coming from Asia or the cost is way, way up. And that, trying to avoid taking too much cost increase while still providing great service. So it's challenging. And certainly, there's some uncertainty. We do think that ultimately, it will balance out. But for right now, it's relatively chaotic in the freight market.\nRyan Merkel: And then for my follow-up, just a question on gross margins. It sounds like you expect neutral price cost in the second half for the High-Touch business, at least. So I'm just curious, how much confidence can we have in that? I mean it's a crazy environment right now. Would you say there's sort of above average risk versus normal that there could be some downside? Or do I have it wrong and you feel pretty confident based on what you know?\nD.G. Macpherson: I would say, and Dee can add to this if she'd like. I would say we're pretty confident in that. We've actually had conversations through the summer with most of our suppliers about cost expectations, and we've already been managing those negotiations and getting to a place that we think makes sense. And we have we have price set for some increases in the back half of the year. So, most of that is already set. There are surprises that happen and are likely to happen this year. But typically, we're able to manage those and either push those out or find ways to mitigate those. So we're pretty confident that we're going to be within that sort of price cost neutrality range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nNigel Coe: Just a bit more detail on the 3Q guide. I think this is for Dee. So I think you said 110 or so basis points of gross margin expansion Q-to-Q, so that gets us flat year-over-year. Number one, is that correct? And I think the comment was 4Q exit rate kind of consistent with 1Q '20. It feels like that's now pushing to the right, just maybe confirm that? And the final comment, the SG&A in 3Q, the 810, it seems like your full year guidance seems that, that committee go it bit higher in 4Q. Is that the right way to read it? Thanks.\nDee Merriwether: Yes. So if you look at - I think I'll start with your question just around the gross profit for our total company, the guide was that we expect that to be up 100 to 120 basis points. And so that's really being driven by a little bit of the conversation we just had. Achieving price/cost neutrality, we're slightly above neutrality through the first half, but we think that we're going to maintain that and be neutral for the full year. And we believe that because of the pricing actions, as D.G. noted, that we expect to continue to take, our cost rigor with our supply base, gives us confidence in what we've been able to do up to this point this year. And as it relates to SG&A, the range of 8.05 to 8.15 is pretty solid in our mind on a go-forward basis, and it looks similar for Q4.\nNigel Coe: And then longer term, the customer base is, for both the MonotaRO and Zoro are now very similar. The ARPU is 2x for MonotaRO versus Zoro. I understand MonotaRO is a much more mature business. Is there any reason why Zoro kind of ARPU can't get closer to MonotaRO overtime?\nD.G. Macpherson: You're talking about operating earnings, Nigel?\nNigel Coe: I'm talking about revenue per customer.\nD.G. Macpherson: Revenue per customer.\nNigel Coe: Right.\nD.G. Macpherson: Got you.\nNigel Coe: Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: So there's a couple of things that will make that be different going forward. And I would expect MonotaRO to have much higher sales per customer. One is, in the Japanese market, there is no industrial distributors - broadline industrial distributors like there are in the U.S. that direct to customer. So, actually, the MonotaRO business is starting to build a pretty strong enterprise customer solution, and they're having some success there. We don't expect Zoro to do that, because the competition in the U.S. is much more stiff on that front. And so, they have some larger customers that Zoro doesn't have. Zoro is focused on that small business more fully and really focused there. So I think that's probably the primary difference, and I would expect that difference to continue. We expect the growth rates to be strong in both businesses, and we expect the margins to improve to high single digits in Zoro over the next couple of years. And so, we feel like it's a great story. But I would expect that metric to be slightly different.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please, go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Just wanted to follow up on the point you just made about the continued margin progression for Zoro. Your leverage at the operating income line in the second quarter was impressive. Can you take us through some of the drivers there? And then looking forward, how sustainable some of those might be?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. We think they're very sustainable. So just as a sort of reminder, we made - a couple of years back, we made pretty significant investments to give that business more independence. And there were really two types of investments being made. One was in systems to allow them to have their own - for example, their own product management system. So they're pretty much clean now, in terms of their own systems infrastructure. And the second one is, building teams that could do things like add millions and millions of products a year, improving their marketing and data analytics capabilities, improving their IT team. A lot of those were one-time investments. And now, as we grow, we're starting to see the leverage and we expect to see that leverage moving forward. We feel like the GP is in a good place, and we think that price points are in a good place. So we don't see concerns there. And we just see a role where we can continue to grow the business fairly quickly and leverage the investments that we've made.\nTommy Moll: Following up on your High-Touch business for the gross margin trajectory versus what you talked about a quarter ago. It sounds like there's some incremental marketing spend that's in the budget now. What were the factors that changed over the last 90 days where you decided to go ahead and lean in heavier there? And as you look forward to Q4, does it feel like - or I should say, to just the rest of the year? Does it feel like you've now got pretty good grip on what the budget looks like? Or could it shift higher again potentially?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. We've got a really good handle on what the budget is going to look like on marketing. We just look at returns on a periodic basis, and the returns we're getting were really strong, And we had some - we've been running a number of tests and those tests came back positive. Some did not. But the ones that came back positive, we decided to push on. And so that's what drove that incremental money.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: So, D.G., just on kind of your own kind of commercial initiatives getting out in front of customers, things like that with the markets being little bit more open to receptive, how do you expect some of those outgrowth metrics to sort of snap back from here? I know that there's some - a bit of a contortion in the metric right now because of the pandemic sales stuff. But are you able to kind of commercialize or get out in the field more than you were 90 days ago? And is that kind of bearing any fruit here in the medium term?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So, it's a great question. The answer is yes, we're getting out to our customers more. If our customers are accepting visits from us, we are going would be the answer to that question. I would say that the vast majority are. And as you know, our service team members have been there every day of the pandemic, basically. We've been able to visit customers to fill inventory bins and do the things that we do on from a servicing side. But in terms of customer discussions, we are pretty much running like normal. There's some customers that don't allow visits, but I've been in front of probably 10 to 15 customers in the last six, seven weeks. And those conversations feel very normal, and we're talking about how to expand the business, really leveraging the work we've done to help them stay up and running in the pandemic and keep their people safe to try to improve the relationship and grow. And I think that's going to be a positive story moving forward.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: And then I guess sort of related to that, I think there's a whole litany of end markets and business activities that are sort of post-COVID change. Is it - whether it's a customer group or end market, where do you see sort of the biggest difference in that interaction, someone buying differently, wanting you to handle a bigger scope of what they're doing? Because I would imagine that we go through 2020 and even early 2021 and the recovery, everyone is just sort of too busy to make big sleeping structural changes, but maybe now with maybe the smoke clearing a bit more. Anything you've seen out there where someone used to said, here's how we're running this process differently. Again, it could be an end market, could be kind of a customer practice, but just curious high level where you guys have seen the biggest change.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes, I think the customer changes or trend changes, there are two I would point to. One is the pandemic did teach a lot of our customers that having a digital solution is pretty important. And the other is having an inventory solution is pretty important. And so almost every conversation you have with customers now centers on how can we install processes so that it's really easy to order and that we can help them manage inventory and keep inventory levels where they need to be. Those are the two biggest changes. Those are really across all customers. Obviously, there's differences by segment. There are still some segments that are pretty significantly disrupted and some that are ranging. But I think from a customer interest standpoint, helping them manage their inventory and getting on the right digital solution are the two things that are even more intense even though they've always been important, they're really intent right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael McGinn: Thank you. I just wanted to go back to the SG&A and digital marketing that you were discussing earlier. If I'm looking at the Q3 guidance, SG&A is going to take a 15% up-tick year-over-year here, and that is about 500 bps greater than the sales growth you're guiding to. Can you just give us an update on what the structural SG&A savings that were discussed last quarter? And how much of that is going to roll into 2022 and what those initiatives look like?\nD.G. Macpherson: Well, first, and I'll turn it over to Dee. I think that we expect to have better SG&A leverage in the third quarter than we do in the second quarter, but I'll turn it over to Dee to talk about the details.\nDee Merriwether: Yes, I'd agree. So when we talked about, at the highest level, daily revenue expectation of 10 to 11 in Q3 that implies SG&A leverage will improve and so we expect that. But again, we just talked about the fact that we are going to continue to invest in marketing spend as well as continue to see some uptick in the full quarter's worth of the - some of the DC labor changes and transportation changes that have happened. We are working on a number of mitigating factors to continue to see how much we can offset that over time. But we have laid into Q3 as far as providing color and expectations that that's where we're going to get to when you take into account those increases.\nMichael McGinn: And on the freight conversation, I guess my assumption is that anything small standard would go on the contract rate. You guys are probably using your legacy relationships in the new carriers. Are you pushing the nonstandard product to those new channels, because there are more market spot-based freight costs? And is this something that you're going to lean into long-term? Or how should we think about that non-standard product shipments?\nD.G. Macpherson: Well, the vast majority of our shipments do go parcel. And for those, we have obviously very big contracts and contract rates. And so that is correct. In terms of alternatives right now, the LTL market is probably the most challenged from a service perspective, from a driver shortage perspective, and as a result, from a cost perspective. And so there, we've developed new solutions. We're working with some new carriers, working with some existing carriers in trying to find the right solution. That would be where it is most messy right now, I would say. The other place would be on ocean freight, which is mostly a container cost issue and a capacity issue right now, where we're prioritizing more than we ever had to make sure that we get our contracted rates and don't have to get outside those, because if you get outside of this right now, that's very expensive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.\nJustin Bergner: My first question was on the outgrowth. I realize there's some squishiness to the market growth rate upon, which your outgrowth statistic was calculated. But just generally speaking, as we think about the 300 to 400 basis point sort of outgrowth target, everything else being equal, should the supply chain challenges favor Grainger being on the high end of that range simply because you have more capabilities to meet customer demand in a supply chain-challenged environment than some of your competitive set?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I think that's absolutely right. And I think that if we didn't have sort of our distribution center capacity right now, things would be a lot more difficult finding customer solutions. So we feel like the investments we've made which have been substantial over the last 12 years to get the network we have, is really helping us now make sure we can serve customers. And we think that's giving us a pretty significant advantage in the marketplace.\nJustin Bergner: And then just a question on sort of free cash flow. Is it still the case that sort of you're going to be focused on deploying the vast majority of your free cash flow to dividends and repurchases? Or has anything sort of changed there?\nD.G. Macpherson: So thanks for the question. No, nothing has really changed related to our capital allocation strategy. And so we're still sticking exactly to what we have said in the past.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nPatrick Baumann: Thank you for taking my question. On the Zoro growth, I mean, it looked really strong to me in the quarter. I'm not sure what the comp was. So I'm just kind of curious if you could tell us what it looked like on a tier stack basis? And then how should we think about growth there in the second half of the year?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So I don't remember the 2-year stack number at Zoro. But what I will say is there is going to be a lot of lumpiness in every quarter-to-quarter comparison this year for reasons that mostly have to do with supply. So last year in the second quarter, we prioritized supply for healthcare and government customers of pandemic products.  And so we turned off a whole bunch of volume that Zoro probably could have sold. So Zoro did not have the kind of growth last year that certainly it was used to. In this year's, we're very pleased with the trajectory they're on. They're ahead of plan and doing very well. But this year's number in the second quarter, I wouldn't assume that that's going to be the number we see going forward because that is off of a very low number, given the supply decisions that we made last year. We still have a lot of confidence in Zoro's ability to grow 20% going forward, but there's going to be some lumpiness in the back half of the year. There's going to be bad compares. In the summer last year, we had a bunch of consumer business as we were the only ones that have product that we're going to compare against still be strong growth but may not be quite as much as you're used to seeing. That will all work its way out, and we expect very consistent strong growth in our business.\nPatrick Baumann: And then my follow-up is can you remind us where your freight costs are recognized? I'm not sure, if it's inbound or outbound or different areas of the P&L or maybe part of it is - SG&A part of it in COGS. If it's in COGS when you say price cost neutrality does this include freight? And then also, does the neutrality mean keeping profits neutral or margin rate neutral? I know there was a bunch of questions in there, but I just wanted to fit them all in?\nD.G. Macpherson: So the freight costs are included in GP for us. And what was the - you were talking so fast? Can you repeat the second and third question again for me? Sorry.\nPatrick Baumann: Yes. So I was saying, if it's in the GP, which it is when you talk about price/cost neutrality, does this include freight in that comment? And then when you talk about price cost neutrality also, does it mean keeping profits neutral? Or is it keeping the margin rate neutral?\nDee Merriwether: So, yes. So when we talk about price cost neutrality, it doesn't include the freight portion. And then to answer the second question, we're talking about rate. GP Rate not run rate.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kevin Marek with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nKevin Marek: Maybe just one on Cromwell quickly where gross margins have improved this quarter. Can you talk about what's driving that and how sustainable the improvement is? I'm kind of wondering if we should still think about Cromwell losses being halved for the full year versus last year? Thanks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So we do think Cromwell is going to roughly have losses from last year to this year. The market in Cromwell in the UK has been challenged as most people are aware. But that business has done a really nice job of improving service and starting to see some growth now, which is great. And they're starting to bounce back a little bit, and they're in a good position from a cost perspective and from a service perspective. So we still have some of our expectations that we had at the beginning of the year for how that business will shake out through the balance.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions in queue. I'll turn it back to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Great. Thanks. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I really appreciate it. The one thing I'll just leave you with is, as we think about what has been a very strange period the last 18 months, our focus is clearly on the future. And we keep saying this, but I will continue to repeat this. Our goal this period is to exit the pandemic in better shape than we started, and that means consistent share gain. We believe we will have done that, and that means having better economics as we exit, and we believe we will be there as well as we exit the year and head into, hopefully, we put the pandemic behind us, although, of course, that's no guarantee. But that is our goal. And we continue to focus on making sure we deliver a great customer experience and manage the business for long-term share gain and long-term margin expansion. So we're going to continue to do that. And we feel really good about where we're at. And so I appreciate the time, and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Dee Merriwether",
            "content": "Thanks D.G. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continue to see a robust recovery with daily sales up 13.7% compared to the second quarter of 2020 and up 9.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. In the U.S., we saw strong growth in our non-pandemic product category with product mix returning to more normal levels. For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 36.9%, down 125 basis points versus the prior year. I think it's important to note that without the $63 million of inventory adjustment, GP would have been up 125 basis points year-over-year. This 250 basis point swing demonstrates that our underlying GP rate would have otherwise been a healthy 39.4%. Coupled with our focus on achieving price/cost neutrality, we are confident that our run rate GP remains strong. SG&A in the segment ramped as expected to $640 million, lapping the lowest point of SG&A spend in the second quarter of 2020. Canada continue to make solid progress and expanded operating margins, approximately 315 basis points year-over-year. Consistent with last quarter, we have included a chart with details on the U.S. and the Canadian businesses on the first page of the appendix. On Slide 10 ,looking at pandemic product trends, I want to highlight two things before we dive into the Q2 numbers. First, we left the extreme growth experience last year and saw decreased demand for PPE products. Accordingly, pandemic sales declined approximately 28% versus 2020. However, that's an impressive 27% increase versus 2019. We estimate July 2021 will be down about 28% over July 2020, in line with what we saw in the second quarter of this year. More importantly, we see the trend in our non-pandemic sales as a positive sign of economic recovery. During the quarter, we grew 31% versus 2020 and up 7% versus 2019. We're seeing end markets like commercial, which include our severely disrupted customers in hospitality, along with heavy manufacturing, make a significant comeback. We estimate that for the month of July 2021, non-pandemic sales growth of about 22%. As it relates to pandemic product mix, while we expected it to taper off to near pre-pandemic levels to about 20% by year-end, we're seeing this happen more quickly now at about 22% of sales. In total, our U.S. High Tech Solutions business is up about 12% for the second quarter of 2021 and up 10% over 2019. Looking at market outgrowth on slide 11, we are lapping the highest concentration of large pandemic purchases of the prior year. At this time, the market declined between 14% and 15% and we saw outsized share gains of roughly 1,200 basis points. For Q2 2021, we're seeing the opposite effect. We estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 18.5% and 19.5%. The U.S. High-Touch business grew 12.4%, about 650 basis points lower than the market. To normalize for the volatility, we calculated the two-year average share gain to be 275 basis points over the market. There's some noise in the market number because across industrials, given the dynamics and fluctuations over the last two years. Therefore, the 2-year average is a better estimate of what's really going on. As I previously noted, our U.S. High-Touch business is up 10% over 2019. As the impact of the pandemic subside, coupled with our coupled with our strong progress on key initiatives, and our return on investments like marketing, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our share gain goals. Now let's cover our U.S. GP rate. As previously discussed, our second quarter GP decline resulted from the $63 million inventory adjustment. This adjustment lowered U.S. GP by 270 basis points. Without this, our underlying U.S. GP rate is 39.8% in the second quarter. As we look to the remainder of 2021, it is important to note, we are operating in a very challenging and fluid environment. We're doing everything within our control to exit the year with a Q4 GP rate at/or above the Q1 2020 levels or 40.1%. We remain confident in our ability to achieve this target for a few reasons. First, as noted earlier, we anticipate no further material pandemic related inventory adjustments. Excluding the inventory impact, our GP rate is nearing this level already. As we discussed on slide 10, our pandemic product mix is close to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect this to fully normalize in the second half. And we've seen evidence that we can continue to maintain price/cost neutrality. On the cost side, we have a robust process to partner with our suppliers and understand the specific raw material impacts as well as other conditions that may result in increased costs. As it relates to price, our goal is to continue to maintain competitiveness in the market and pass what is applicable. In the first half, we were slightly above neutrality. And as we expect to take additional price increases in the second half to offset what we're expecting in costs. Even in this inflationary environment, we are confident we will be able to execute and achieve neutrality through the remainder of the year. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Daily sales increased 23% or 23.9% on a constant currency basis driven by continued strength in new customer acquisitions at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as growth of larger enterprise customers in MonotaRO. We did had 75 basis points year over year, driven by positive trends and both businesses and operating margins finished up 95 basis points over the prior year. I'll go into more detail on the next slide, as we provide further transparency on the results of both of these businesses  Moving to Slide 14, please remember that MonotaRO is a public company, and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers we disclose will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements.  In local currency, and using Japan's local selling days which occasionally different from U.S. selling days, MonotaROs daily sales grew 16.7%. of GP finishing the quarter at 26.4%, 25 basis points above the prior year. Operating margin decreased 15 basis points to 12% as they continue to ramp up operations at the Ibaraki DC. Again, another strong quarter for MonotaRO. Switching to Zoro U.S., daily sales grew 32.6% as it laps its softest quarter of 2020. Zoro GP grew 95 basis points to 31.5% and achieved 320 basis points of operating margin expansion through substantial SG&A leverage in the quarter. All in all, very impressive results. Moving to Slide 15. In addition to the strong financial performance, we're seeing positive results with our key operating metrics. As you saw in the first quarter, we've listed total registered users for both businesses, an important driver of top line performance. Both MonotaRO and Zoro have shown progress and are up over 20% over the second quarter last year. On the right, Zoro continues to actively add skews to the portfolio. At the end of the second quarter of 2021, we had a total of 7.5 million skews available online. Closer. Our goal was 8 million for the year. We remain encouraged by our progress with SKU additions beyond traditional MRO. Now I'll provide commentary as it relates to the upcoming quarter and our expectations for the full year. For the third quarter, on a total company level, we expect our revenue growth to be between 10% and 11% on a daily organic basis. We believe any material pandemic-related inventory adjustments are complete, and we expect GP to be up between 100 and 120 basis points year-over-year and to improve sequentially. SG&A is anticipated to fall between $805 million and $815 million as we continue to invest in marketing and wages in the DCs to remain competitive. Transitioning to our total company guidance, I'd like to provide some brief commentary on how we're trending so far. We expect strong sales to continue, while GP operating margin and EPS will face pressure as a result of the incremental inventory adjustments and freight costs, along with increased DC wages and marketing. While we are maintaining our guidance, we expect results to trend towards the low end of our range with the exception of revenue. We expect revenue to be near the midpoint. As it relates to our segment operating margins, we think that some of the supply chain challenges as well as the first half inventory adjustment will weigh more heavily on the High-Touch Solutions segment, and therefore, High-Touch operating margin may trend at the low end of the range. At the same time, we believe Endless Assortment, driven by strong performance and improving margins may end the year at the high end, both helping to support delivery of total company results. We are not adjusting guidance as we are confident in our ability to deliver results within our guidance ranges. As we learn more, we'll continue to keep you apprised of any changes. With that, I'll turn it back over to. D.G. for some closing remarks. Sure. So as we've discussed in the past, we have about 70% of our business in the U.S. with large customers, and that business runs through their contracts. We have the right to pass on price increases to those customers at different times in the year. And so as you can imagine, our cost increases coming in from our suppliers and the timing of when we can pass on price increases to those contract customers do not always line up perfectly. So it ends up having some lumpiness as it relates to GP. But overall, those actions that we're taking with those customers are going well. And we have been able to pass on cost increases to those customers. I'd also like to remind you that the rest of the business, about 30% is on a wet price, which we have the ability to change in line with the market. And we do that to remain competitive with others in the market that have visible prices. So I think if you go back to our prepared remarks, we expect revenue to remain strong and fall within the range. And while GP operating margin and EPS will be pressured primarily due to some of the inventory adjustments that we have taken this year, we're happy to be back past that. But because of that, and some other pressures related to some wage increases and things like that that D.G. noted, we will - we're saying now that GP operating margin and EPS will fall at the lower end of the guidance range that we provided in the first quarter. So we are maintaining our guidance and giving color related to revenue, GP, operating margins and EPS. Yes, I'll start and then maybe D.G. can add on if he wants to add any more color. A couple of things have happened since the last time we talked. And we talked about it in our prepared remarks related to the messiness of the market and industry supply chain challenges, being able to make sure that we can hire and retain the right people in our DCs, which is critical to our business. And so we're seeing some labor inflation that wasn't projected at that time. So, that plays into it additional marketing spend to continue to focus on our brand and improve our web conversion with our customers as well. So, we talked about some of those things in our stated remarks as well. And so again, we're guiding to the low end of the range as it relates to that plus the inventory actions we've taken. So, starting last year, as you can imagine trying to work through somewhere north 2,000 type customers with conversations with large customers. Those conversations have been going well. But there's two things I think you have to take into account. Either there are some freight rate changes that have come from some visible partners that are easier to talk through. And so those things have gone extremely well and continue to go well. So, no problems up to this point with being able to pass on some freight costs to our customers. Yes. So if you look at - I think I'll start with your question just around the gross profit for our total company, the guide was that we expect that to be up 100 to 120 basis points. And so that's really being driven by a little bit of the conversation we just had. Achieving price/cost neutrality, we're slightly above neutrality through the first half, but we think that we're going to maintain that and be neutral for the full year. And we believe that because of the pricing actions, as D.G. noted, that we expect to continue to take, our cost rigor with our supply base, gives us confidence in what we've been able to do up to this point this year. And as it relates to SG&A, the range of 8.05 to 8.15 is pretty solid in our mind on a go-forward basis, and it looks similar for Q4. Yes, I'd agree. So when we talked about, at the highest level, daily revenue expectation of 10 to 11 in Q3 that implies SG&A leverage will improve and so we expect that. But again, we just talked about the fact that we are going to continue to invest in marketing spend as well as continue to see some uptick in the full quarter's worth of the - some of the DC labor changes and transportation changes that have happened. We are working on a number of mitigating factors to continue to see how much we can offset that over time. But we have laid into Q3 as far as providing color and expectations that that's where we're going to get to when you take into account those increases. So, yes. So when we talk about price cost neutrality, it doesn't include the freight portion. And then to answer the second question, we're talking about rate. GP Rate not run rate."

            "name": "D.G. Macpherson",
            "content": "Thanks, Irene. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today I'll provide an overview of our second quarter results and progress toward our goals as the economy recovers. Before we get into details on the quarter, I'd like to spend a moment highlighting our Grainger Edge framework. Two years ago, we launched this framework that defines who we are, why we exist, and where we're going. It covers our purpose, aspiration, strategy and the principles that drive our actions. It all starts with our purpose. We keep the world working. We shared this with all team members across the company in 2019, while the concepts weren't new and many were already part of our operational DNA, the framework provided clarity on who we are and what we do, as well as a common language for our team members. The Grainger Edge has guided us through the pandemic, and I'm proud of how the Grainger team has continued to embrace it. It's also been a strong foundation for how we serve our customers and helped us through the challenges of the last 18 months. Speaking of challenges, 2021 has provided plenty. The year has been characterized by strong demand, but a very challenging supply chain environment. Raw material shortages, labor shortages and transportation challenges have been the norm particularly in the second quarter. These challenges are industry-wide. And while we're not immune to them, we are uniquely positioned to leverage our scale and navigate through these ongoing difficulties. Importantly, this year, the supply chain has become a competitive sport. And while we've had obstacles and things are messier than normal, our customer research suggests we are navigating the obstacles well and providing very strong relative service during this time. We are actively leveraging our network. For example, for a customer located in New York, we would typically fulfill their entire order from our Northeast DC. Due to supply constraints or product delays, now part of the order may only be available in Louisville. In this case, the order may be fulfilled from Louisville, adding an extra day and incremental cost to the order. But we are able to leverage our network to provide and protect our great service. We are also leveraging our branches for more shipping in this environment. In addition, we have accelerated the ramp of our Louisville DC, which has helped alleviate capacity constraints. This building is a great asset for Grainger, and will continue to ramp capacity through the next 18 months. The good news is that we still have very high availability in our network even if the product comes from an alternate location. I've had the opportunity to be in the field quite a bit this past quarter and have been excited to spend time with the customers and hear their feedback. I'm hearing consistently that while we may be delivering a bit differently than the past, we are serving our customers better than the competition. We have validated this feedback on our recent customer service and a vast majority said we were doing better than distributors right now. We are also investing on non-pandemic inventory and partnering closely with our suppliers to work through any supply constraints, inbound lead time challenges and any potential cost increases. Additionally, shortage in the labor market have had a significant impact for all companies this year. In response, we have increased our wages to attract and retain talent, especially in our distribution centers. We've implemented robust training programs to onboard new team members and train existing team members to work throughout our buildings. We have made great progress in closing staff and gaps and will continue to do so over the third quarter. Finally, transportation has been very challenging. That is clearly linked to the product and labor shortages. While we have always prioritized optimal routes and cost efficiencies, over the last few months, we have partnered with our carriers in new ways to ensure we are meeting customer expectations. We have also added new partners to our carrier mix to handle our volume and provide us flexibility. It's important to note that the overall freight market is volatile and uncertain. While we are confident in our current plans to manage these challenges, there are a lot of moving pieces and constraints across all modes, parcel, LTL and ocean freight. For example, the ocean freight market has been uncertain as the pandemic surges again in Asia and container costs fluctuate. We are ready to respond to any of these dynamics. We expect the supply chain challenges to last through the end of the year and likely well into next year. I have no doubt, as we continue to live the Grainger Edge and follow our principles, we'll not only get through these challenges, but will deliver strong results and take market share. Turning to our financial highlights. The bottom line is that our performance has been in line with our expectations and what we communicated on our last earnings call. The only exception that this has been gross profit impacted primarily by the changes in May to the CDC mask guidelines halfway through the quarter. Heading into the second quarter, all external factors were pointing to a reopening in the U.S. around or sometime after the 4th of July, giving us a full quarter to sell through as much of our remaining pandemic inventory as possible. Based on our internal scenario planning, we thought that potential adjustments in Q2 would fall somewhere between $45 million and $50 million. We shouldn't predict precisely how the demand curve has fall and when. Then when a CDC mass guidance change in mid-May, we saw demand for pandemic product especially in mask declined rapid. As a result of the sudden weakening in demand, we had more pandemic inventory remaining than expected, and we took a $63 million adjustment, about $15 million more than our internal scenario planning. We believe this completes, any material pandemic related inventory adjustments. Without this incremental changed we would have been roughly flat sequentially. We understand the CDC has just changed guidance again this week. While the situation is fluid, we do not expect any material change in our outlook as a result of this change. Shifting to the other financial results. We achieved strong organic daily sales growth of 15% for the company on a constant currency basis within our guided range. When compared to 2019, Q2 was up about 14% on a daily organic basis, a positive indicator of our strong performance and recovery beyond the pandemic. Our High-Touch Solutions North America segment grew 12.7% on a daily constant currency basis. In the U.S., we lapped the most extreme volatility of 2020. Looking at the 2-year average in the second quarter of 2021, we drove approximately 275 basis points of average market outgrowth. We remain very confident in our ability to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market on an ongoing basis. We expect the volatility of 2020 and 2021 to average out and get back to normal heading into 2022. Our Canadian business drove positive operating earnings growth for the quarter and managed expense as well. We are seeing continued momentum in targeted end markets, especially heavy manufacturing and higher education as schools prepare to reopen in the fall. And we continue to diversify the business beyond natural resources. The Endless Assortment model had another impressive quarter with 23.9% daily sales growth on a constant currency basis, fueled by strong customer acquisition. Lastly, we generated $269 million in operating cash flow and achieved strong ROIC of 29. 2%. Turning to our quarterly results for the company. I've discussed most of what's on this slide, but I wanted to point out two additional items. First, our SG&A was $790 million, in line with the guided range provided on our first quarter call. As expected, we increased SG&A for the quarter as we continue to invest in marketing and in our people through increased variable compensation and wage rates in the DCs. This resulted in total company operating margin of 10.4%, down 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of the $15 million incremental inventory adjustment, GP would have been roughly flat sequentially and have been roughly flat sequentially and operating margin would have been 10.9%. Resulting EPS would have been around $4.50. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on our two segments. Dee? Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up questions, I wanted to share two recent company accomplishments. First, I'm proud to announce that earlier this month, Grainger was certified as A Great Place to Work, a true testament to the exceptional team member experience we've built and an important milestone in advancing the Grainger Edge. Second is our 10th year of publicly reporting our ESG efforts. I wanted to share highlights from our new corporate responsibility report. At Grainger, we embrace our obligation to operate sustainably and with a long-term fact based view of critical issues regarding the environment, society at large, and corporate governance. For example, in 2012, we became the first industrial distributed publicly disclose our carbon footprint. In 2013 we became the first in our industry to set a public greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, which we achieved two years early. We just set a new goal last year to reduce the absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. We're also committed to helping our customers achieve their ESG goals through our products and services. We now offer more than 100,000 environmentally-friendly products. Through this portfolio, we're able to help customers maintain sustainable facilities, the efficient energy management, water conservation, waste reduction, and improved indoor air quality. In 2017, Grainger signed the Chicago Network Equity Pledge focused on achieving 50% representation of women in leadership positions by 2030. And this year, we formed the ESG Leadership Council, which I Chair. The council is comprised of Grainger leaders who provide strategic direction and oversight on our ESG efforts. You can find the new report at graingeresg.com. With that, we will open up the line for questions. Dee, why don't you take that one? The only thing I'd add to that, Chris, and thanks for the question, is that we have a very - as Dee said, a very robust process in terms of managing costs. This is an environment right now where everybody is raising price on everything. And we are effectively working with our suppliers to mitigate the cost. And so the conversations with customers are well-understood and expected at this point. So I would say if we continue to do both of those things well, we feel like we can be in good shape. So thanks for the question. I think if you step back, I think we find that comparisons to 2019 or early 2020 are probably better than last year at this point because there's so much messages in the year-over-year numbers. But our general thinking is, we will exit the year with having gained significant share and in a better spot from an economic perspective with similar GP and better SG&A leverage. And that's kind of the model going forward. We feel like we're priced competitively. We feel like we can hold GP in each of our business units fairly consistently over time and get some SG&A leverage. And so our whole model is based on consistent share gain and slightly expanding operating margins. Typically, we would expect GP to hold relatively flat as a percentage moving forward with some SG&A leverage. Yes. For the year, we're still within our expectation. Now I would say, just to be frank, a lot of the comparisons, we had the market growing 18% to 19% in the second quarter. It's tough to find sort of any peers that have grown that way. Relative to peers, we think we're doing good. And we look at both our own metric, which is based on industrial production, and we look at peers. And so we feel very strong about our performance. We also feel and the returns we're seeing. We're tracking everything, and we feel very good. We think right, what you're seeing for the second quarter is a lot of messiness in metrics and pandemic-driven sort of ups and downs. But through cycle, we're very confident we're going to be able to achieve our target. Yes. So to be clear, our accounting for the quarter was what happened at the end of the quarter and through a couple of weeks after that when we actually put the results together, working with our team and our external accountants. And we just follow our process, the mask change that happened in a last couple of days, I will say that every single external announcement in the pandemic has driven behavior. So we are expecting in the short term to get some increased mask sales. We haven't flown that through. You're right, there's a potential, but it's so early, 48 hours' worth of revenue wouldn't give us any indication. And things are so fluid and change so fast, it's really hard to tell. Obviously, if we went into full lockdown with full mask usage, what you described could in fact could in fact be true. But it's just really uncertain right now. I think Dee talked about it. But basically, starting at the [Rocky] DC, which was an expected cost is a big part of that. So, given their growth, they have put significant investments in the distribution centers and that has added some costs. They're still very, very profitable and still seeing very good growth relative to what has been a pretty challenging market in Japan. I would add, Ryan, there's a number of factors. One is freight rates. The other is just the service challenges, and we are - we've certainly added some costs. We are going to recoup certainly some of that, if not all of that. But just to be able to make sure that we have delivery assurance they can actually get product to customers right now is not as trivial as it historically has been. So we're having to prioritize loads more than we've ever prioritized loads, containers coming from Asia or the cost is way, way up. And that, trying to avoid taking too much cost increase while still providing great service. So it's challenging. And certainly, there's some uncertainty. We do think that ultimately, it will balance out. But for right now, it's relatively chaotic in the freight market. I would say, and Dee can add to this if she'd like. I would say we're pretty confident in that. We've actually had conversations through the summer with most of our suppliers about cost expectations, and we've already been managing those negotiations and getting to a place that we think makes sense. And we have we have price set for some increases in the back half of the year. So, most of that is already set. There are surprises that happen and are likely to happen this year. But typically, we're able to manage those and either push those out or find ways to mitigate those. So we're pretty confident that we're going to be within that sort of price cost neutrality range. You're talking about operating earnings, Nigel? Revenue per customer. Got you. So there's a couple of things that will make that be different going forward. And I would expect MonotaRO to have much higher sales per customer. One is, in the Japanese market, there is no industrial distributors - broadline industrial distributors like there are in the U.S. that direct to customer. So, actually, the MonotaRO business is starting to build a pretty strong enterprise customer solution, and they're having some success there. We don't expect Zoro to do that, because the competition in the U.S. is much more stiff on that front. And so, they have some larger customers that Zoro doesn't have. Zoro is focused on that small business more fully and really focused there. So I think that's probably the primary difference, and I would expect that difference to continue. We expect the growth rates to be strong in both businesses, and we expect the margins to improve to high single digits in Zoro over the next couple of years. And so, we feel like it's a great story. But I would expect that metric to be slightly different. Yes. We think they're very sustainable. So just as a sort of reminder, we made - a couple of years back, we made pretty significant investments to give that business more independence. And there were really two types of investments being made. One was in systems to allow them to have their own - for example, their own product management system. So they're pretty much clean now, in terms of their own systems infrastructure. And the second one is, building teams that could do things like add millions and millions of products a year, improving their marketing and data analytics capabilities, improving their IT team. A lot of those were one-time investments. And now, as we grow, we're starting to see the leverage and we expect to see that leverage moving forward. We feel like the GP is in a good place, and we think that price points are in a good place. So we don't see concerns there. And we just see a role where we can continue to grow the business fairly quickly and leverage the investments that we've made. Yes. We've got a really good handle on what the budget is going to look like on marketing. We just look at returns on a periodic basis, and the returns we're getting were really strong, And we had some - we've been running a number of tests and those tests came back positive. Some did not. But the ones that came back positive, we decided to push on. And so that's what drove that incremental money. Yes. So, it's a great question. The answer is yes, we're getting out to our customers more. If our customers are accepting visits from us, we are going would be the answer to that question. I would say that the vast majority are. And as you know, our service team members have been there every day of the pandemic, basically. We've been able to visit customers to fill inventory bins and do the things that we do on from a servicing side. But in terms of customer discussions, we are pretty much running like normal. There's some customers that don't allow visits, but I've been in front of probably 10 to 15 customers in the last six, seven weeks. And those conversations feel very normal, and we're talking about how to expand the business, really leveraging the work we've done to help them stay up and running in the pandemic and keep their people safe to try to improve the relationship and grow. And I think that's going to be a positive story moving forward. Yes, I think the customer changes or trend changes, there are two I would point to. One is the pandemic did teach a lot of our customers that having a digital solution is pretty important. And the other is having an inventory solution is pretty important. And so almost every conversation you have with customers now centers on how can we install processes so that it's really easy to order and that we can help them manage inventory and keep inventory levels where they need to be. Those are the two biggest changes. Those are really across all customers. Obviously, there's differences by segment. There are still some segments that are pretty significantly disrupted and some that are ranging. But I think from a customer interest standpoint, helping them manage their inventory and getting on the right digital solution are the two things that are even more intense even though they've always been important, they're really intent right now. Well, first, and I'll turn it over to Dee. I think that we expect to have better SG&A leverage in the third quarter than we do in the second quarter, but I'll turn it over to Dee to talk about the details. Well, the vast majority of our shipments do go parcel. And for those, we have obviously very big contracts and contract rates. And so that is correct. In terms of alternatives right now, the LTL market is probably the most challenged from a service perspective, from a driver shortage perspective, and as a result, from a cost perspective. And so there, we've developed new solutions. We're working with some new carriers, working with some existing carriers in trying to find the right solution. That would be where it is most messy right now, I would say. The other place would be on ocean freight, which is mostly a container cost issue and a capacity issue right now, where we're prioritizing more than we ever had to make sure that we get our contracted rates and don't have to get outside those, because if you get outside of this right now, that's very expensive. Yes. I think that's absolutely right. And I think that if we didn't have sort of our distribution center capacity right now, things would be a lot more difficult finding customer solutions. So we feel like the investments we've made which have been substantial over the last 12 years to get the network we have, is really helping us now make sure we can serve customers. And we think that's giving us a pretty significant advantage in the marketplace. So thanks for the question. No, nothing has really changed related to our capital allocation strategy. And so we're still sticking exactly to what we have said in the past. Yes. So I don't remember the 2-year stack number at Zoro. But what I will say is there is going to be a lot of lumpiness in every quarter-to-quarter comparison this year for reasons that mostly have to do with supply. So last year in the second quarter, we prioritized supply for healthcare and government customers of pandemic products.  And so we turned off a whole bunch of volume that Zoro probably could have sold. So Zoro did not have the kind of growth last year that certainly it was used to. In this year's, we're very pleased with the trajectory they're on. They're ahead of plan and doing very well. But this year's number in the second quarter, I wouldn't assume that that's going to be the number we see going forward because that is off of a very low number, given the supply decisions that we made last year. We still have a lot of confidence in Zoro's ability to grow 20% going forward, but there's going to be some lumpiness in the back half of the year. There's going to be bad compares. In the summer last year, we had a bunch of consumer business as we were the only ones that have product that we're going to compare against still be strong growth but may not be quite as much as you're used to seeing. That will all work its way out, and we expect very consistent strong growth in our business. So the freight costs are included in GP for us. And what was the - you were talking so fast? Can you repeat the second and third question again for me? Sorry. Yes. So we do think Cromwell is going to roughly have losses from last year to this year. The market in Cromwell in the UK has been challenged as most people are aware. But that business has done a really nice job of improving service and starting to see some growth now, which is great. And they're starting to bounce back a little bit, and they're in a good position from a cost perspective and from a service perspective. So we still have some of our expectations that we had at the beginning of the year for how that business will shake out through the balance. Great. Thanks. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I really appreciate it. The one thing I'll just leave you with is, as we think about what has been a very strange period the last 18 months, our focus is clearly on the future. And we keep saying this, but I will continue to repeat this. Our goal this period is to exit the pandemic in better shape than we started, and that means consistent share gain. We believe we will have done that, and that means having better economics as we exit, and we believe we will be there as well as we exit the year and head into, hopefully, we put the pandemic behind us, although, of course, that's no guarantee. But that is our goal. And we continue to focus on making sure we deliver a great customer experience and manage the business for long-term share gain and long-term margin expansion. So we're going to continue to do that. And we feel really good about where we're at. And so I appreciate the time, and look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you."

Macpherson - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Dee Merriwether - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer Irene Holman - Vice President of Investor Relations\nOperator: Greetings! And welcome to the Grainger First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nIrene Holman: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures and their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q1 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results, which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings release. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks Irene. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today I'll provide a brief overview of our first quarter results, key initiatives and encouraging signs for our business as the economy recovers. Of note, this will be our first quarter with results aligned to our two new reportable segments. Also as MonotaRO, our majority owned subsidiary as a publicly traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we have now aligned the timing of our earnings releases. I am very proud of the way the Grainger team has continued to serve our customers through the recovery and has addressed new challenges as they arise. We're supporting many customers through vaccination deployment, including pharmacies and other large sites. Recently we partnered with the State University Medical Center, The National Guard, and The Department of Health to support a max vaccination site. We updated the site with important pandemic related products like safety equipment, as well as more traditional MRO products needed to support the operation, like power and extension cords, lighting and traffic cones. As it ramped up, this site has been able to facilitate thousands of vaccinations a day. We're seeing vaccination distribution progressing around the world, albeit at different speeds. In the U.S. as more of the population gets vaccinated, we are seeing many customers return to the normal operations and purchasing patterns. This is evident as our non-pandemic sales continue to return to normal levels and as sales in most end markets grow sequentially. In the U.K. we are seen business activity rise. In Canada solar vaccine distribution and potential shutdowns are slowing the business recovery. We're also seeing a modestly slower recovery in Japan. No matter what stage of the recovery our customers are in, our relationships with them are very strong given our support of their operations over the past year; part of being there for our customers and having the products they needed, when they needed it. To bring this to life, at this time last year when customers needed hand sanitizer, we sold them 55 gallon drums and they were filling their own containers. As supply constraints eased, customers reverted back to purchasing more normal PPE skews and far fewer 55 gallon drums. As I said before, we took calculated risks in procuring pandemic products and reasonable alternatives, especially in the second quarter of 2020. As the pandemic progressed and market dynamics changed, we had to revalue some of our inventory in Q4 and again in Q1. We anticipate further price deterioration on some of these non-core alternative pandemic products. While our profitability on these products, including all potential write downs was below normal, supporting our customers by taking these risks was the right thing to do. We improved relationships with our existing customers, developed new repeat business and delivered strong incremental growth at lower, but still profitable margins. On last quarter's call we shared our first quarter expectations. As it relates to revenue in the first quarter, all of our businesses surpassed our outlook. We expected first quarter company GP to be down 150 to 200 basis points versus prior year, and our actual results fell within the stated range. Excluding the inventory adjustment our U.S. GP was up versus the prior year, giving us further confidence in the path forward. Based on our strong results and improving economic trends, we are providing full year guidance which Dee will discuss in a few minutes. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continue to make progress on our key initiatives across geographies. The U.S. is seeing positive signs of economic recovery with growth of non-pandemic sales in virtually all segments. The exception is healthcare, which has very high pandemic fuel comps. Gross margin are returning to pre-pandemic levels in the U.S., net of inventory adjustments. In Canada the path to recovery is slower as they struggle to get the virus under control. Despite this, Grainger Canada achieved its revenue and margin targets in the first quarter. The Endless Assortment segment grew over 27% as we execute the playbook and gained momentum with our strategy. The team continues to add skews beyond traditional MRO products which helps grow web traffic, our continued marketing efforts, and more targeted discounting strategies are working well and driving operating margin expansion at Zoro. Also we are gaining real traction with new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO. Finally, I'm excited to announce that MonotaRO has opened its newest distribution center in Ibaraki, Japan, which will allow the business to stock additional high demand products locally. Shifting to the financial results, we achieved organic daily sales growth of 5.9% for the total company on a comp and currency basis. In the U.S. we started to lap the volatility of 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021 we drove approximately 250 basis points of market outgrowth. To normalize for all the volatility, we look to the two year average share gains, which we believe is a more reasonable measure of outgrowth. Using this we averaged 475 basis points of annual market outgrowth from 2019 to 2021. We anticipate showing both measures going forward. Endless Assortment had strong performance in the quarter at 27.4% daily sales grow. For the total company we delivered operating margin of 11.6% with 210 basis points in adjusted SG&A leverage, more than offsetting the anticipated GP pressure from pandemic inventory adjustments. To be clear, we expect to sell through the remainder of these non-core pandemic products and complete any potential market driven inventory adjustments by the end of Q2. Finally, we generated $294 million in operating cash flow, returned $256 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and maintained strong ROIC of 30.3%. All-in-all we are very pleased with the performance and our trajectory. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dee to take us through our first quarter results. Dee.\nDee Merriwether: Thank you, D.G. As we move to our new reportable segment, you will continue to see a total company slide then a familiar four lines P&L for both High-Touch Solutions North America and Endless Assortments. We\u2019ll also continue to provide transparency into the U.S., Canada. MonotaRO and the Zoro U.S. business. As we lap the pandemic, we will continue to provide pandemic related data to clarify our results, especially for the U.S. Turning to our quarterly results, organic daily sales which adjust for the divestitures of Fabory and China finished up 7% and 5.9% on a constant currency basis, underpinned by growth in both segments. Note that we have one less selling day in Q1, 2021 versus Q1, 2020. At the total company level, GP was down 190 basis points. 180 basis point of this was driven by pandemic fueled inventory adjustments in the U.S., consistent with what we shared in our Q4, 2020 earnings call. We anticipated the need for adjustment. As D.G. shared, we expect to complete any potential market driven inventory adjustments by the end of the second quarter and we estimate the amount will be similar to or lower than Q1. This expectation has been factored into our GP ramp, as well as our 2021 guidance. Endless Assortment expanded gross margins overall, driven by continued improvement at Zoro, while the mix impact of growing these businesses is alluded to company gross margin. It drives incremental gross profit and earnings dollars and is an important driver for the company\u2019s performance. SG&A of $735 million was favorable by $43 million year-over-year, in-line with our expectation shared last quarter. We captured 210 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period and continued prudent cost control in the High-Touch Solutions segment and strong expense leverage in Endless Assortment. This resulted in total company operating margin of 11.6%, up 20 basis points over last year. The business continues to produce robust cash flow with operating cash flow of $294 million, 124% of net adjusted earnings and free cash flow of $221 million. We also returned $175 million back to shareholders through repurchases and $81 million through dividends in the period. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment, daily sales increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020. We started to lap the pandemic sales by mid-February, resulting in more challenging comparisons. In the U.S. daily sales were up 3.5%. In Canada, daily sales were up 3.3% in U.S. dollars, however still down 2.8% in local days and local currency. Canada\u2019s decline was primarily driven by pandemic disruptions, most notably with our natural resource customer. As we diversify beyond natural resources, we are seeing improvement in our targeted end markets, including healthcare, higher education and manufacturing. For the segment GP finished the quarter at 37.4%, a sequential improvement of 30 basis points versus Q4, 2020 and down 230 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline was due to the inventory adjustment to U.S. and the pandemic mix in Canada. Excluding the adjustment, U.S. GP would have been up versus prior year, which is a better indicator of expected performance moving forward. We have included a chart towards the end of this presentation which highlights the impact of the pandemic inventory adjustments in the U.S. by quarter. Finally, we continue to gain SG&A leverage with our costs down $24 million, driven by reduced travel expenses and general operating efficiency in both the U.S. and Canada. Canada expanded operating margins 110 basis points over the prior year. As a part of our commitment to providing continued transparency of our U.S. and Canadian businesses, we've included a chart with details in the appendix. Moving on to slide nine. Looking at pandemic product growth trends, we have started to lap the spike experienced in early 2020. For reference, pandemic product sales grew 41% in the first quarter of 2020. Accordingly, growth rates have eased throughout the quarter this year, growing a very modest 1% year-over-year. Pandemic mix as a percent of the total remained elevated at 25%. As a comparison point, mix was 19% in 2019 and rose to 28% for the full year of 2020. Most importantly though, on the non-pandemic side things continued to improve. We started to see year-over-year sales growth and not-pandemic product sales in March of this year, with daily sales dollars increasing sequentially each month during the quarter, with April ending up roughly 36%, the highest growth to date in 2021. This is a very encouraging sign that trends especially for customer business activity are beginning to revert to more normal levels. Looking at share gain on slide 10, we estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 0.5% to 1.5% in the first quarter, showing continued improvement as the economy recovers. We knew there will be tremendous noise in measuring share gains throughout 2021 given the extreme volatility of the prior year. Our 2020 share gain is inflated due to the pandemic. Correspondingly our 2021 share gains will be muted as we wrap the unusual sales spikes from non-repeating orders. We outgrew the market by roughly 250 basis points in the quarter as we lapped the pandemic sales spike. To eliminate the noise and better understand our market outgrowth, we\u2019ve also provided a two year average share gain metric. While it is perfect, it does normalize activity across the two year period and provide a more reasonable view into our share gains since the end of 2019. The two year average was approximately 475 basis points, each quarter we plan to share both numbers. We think this will be especially helpful in the second quarter given the extreme volatility. We remain confident in our ability to serve new and existing customers during the challenging times and to produce 300 to 400 basis point of sustainable outgrowth in our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business. Moving to our Endless Assortment Segment, daily sales increased 27.4% or 23.3% on a constant currency basis, driven by new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as MonotaRO\u2019s continued pursuit of large enterprise customers in Japan. I will share some of our key growth metrics to provide further color into how we think about these businesses. GP expanded 35 basis points year-over-year driven by Zoro\u2019s improved discounting strategies. Operating margins expanded 185 basis points due primarily to substantial SG&A leverage at Zoro. Moving to slide 12. We have provided further transparency on the results of both businesses. As you're aware, MonotaRO is a public company and as such, MonotaRO follows Japanese Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or JGAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP. In Grainger\u2019s consolidated results, we translate MonotaRO\u2019s financials into U.S. dollars and U.S. GAAP. In addition, we continue to report MonotaRO results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers we disclose would different somewhat from MonotaRO\u2019s public statements. In local currency and using Japan's local selling days, which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days, MonotaRO daily sales grew 25.5% with GP finishing the quarter at 26.5% in basis points below prior year. Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 12%. This is a very strong quarter for MonotaRO. We are excited for the new distribution center that will allow them to stack many of the fastest moving items locally. They also continue to make enhancements in both product information and order management systems, hoping to improve the customer search experience and delivery speed, preparing them for the future. Switching to Zoro U.S., March was our stronger average daily sales month since Zoro\u2019s inception in 2010, with daily sales up 15.2% driven by strong customer acquisition. In addition, we drove solid SG&A leverage resulting in 370 basis points of operating margin expansion. I\u2019d like to spend a minute on the metrics we are using to measure progress on our growth initiatives for both Zoro and MonotaRO. On the left side of the chart we've listed total registered users for both businesses. This is a long standing metric that MonotaRO has shared externally. Growing our registered user base is an important driver of top line performance and as you can see, both businesses have shown tremendous progress. Moving to the right side, Zoro is aggressively adding skew to the portfolio. Having an expansive assortment is the key factor to Zoro\u2019s customer acquisition and growth strategy. As of Q1, 2021 we had a total of 6.7 million skews available online. We are excited by our robust top line and targeting to reach 10 million total skews by 2024. Before I discuss our full year 2021 guidance, I'd like to first provide additional color on the current quarter to help you understand what we expect as the economy recovers and our business performance improves. From a sales perspective, our preliminary results for April are strong. As last April was our softest sales month of the year, we expect to grow \u2013 we expect our growth to moderate in May and June and to end the second quarter up between 14% and 15% on a daily organic basis. Note that our reported revenue growth will be about 280 basis points lower as Fabory and China, both of those businesses were divested after June of 2020. We expect Q2 company GP to be roughly flat on a sequential basis, which implies down about 30 basis points year-over-year. The pandemic impacts including inventory adjustments and mix continued to improve both sequentially and year-over-year. We are starting to see modest cost inflation, especially on some specific product categories and raw materials such as resin and steel. While the quarters may still be a bit bumpy as the timing of cost increases and price actions do not align perfectly, we expect price cost spreads to be neutral for the year. We're also starting to see general inflation in the freight market, especially in ocean freight rates and LTL shipping. In the second quarter, we expect freight shipment will be muted as we are lapping inflated prior year costs from air shipments. For SG&A, we expect to see cost step-up most notably in the second quarter as business activity resumes. Specifically, we expect increases in travel, variable compensation and merit as well as advertising spend as we take advantage of higher returns. With this, we anticipate SG&A between $780 million and $800 million for the second quarter of 2021, and to remain in this general range for the remaining quarters of the year. This will drive leverage for the full year versus both 2020 and 2019. As always, we remain focused on managing costs while continuing to invest in the business for the long term. We've learned a great deal through the pandemic and don't expect all costs to return to pre-pandemic levels moving forward. Related to U.S. GP we still expect to see improved rates as pandemic mix reverts to more normal levels and as we put non-core pandemic inventory adjustments behind us. Run rate margins are stabilizing, and we maintain our expectation that we will exit the year with U.S. GP rate as high or higher with Q1 2020 level. As a reminder, this slide relates to U.S. business. We choose to highlight it, because it represents more than 70% of the total company results, and was most heavily impacted by the pandemic. As we become more comfortable with the pace of the economic recovery primarily in the U.S., coupled with our recent performance, we are providing full year 2021 guidance and will provide updates as we move through the year. For the total company, we expect daily sales growth between 8.5% and 11% or 10% and 12.5% organically, driven by strong top line performance in both segments. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we anticipate U.S. business will grow between 7% and 9.5% based on estimated MRO market growth between 6.5% and 9%. This years\u2019 one year market outgrowth of roughly 50 basis points and a two-year average annual outgrowth of 425 basis points; the two year average normalizes for the extreme spikes experienced in 2020 and anchors to 2019. In Canada the recovery is a bit more choppy than the U.S. with the slower vaccine rollout and recent business shut downs. With that in mind, we do expect volumes to stabilize as we move through the year. We expect endless assortment to continue growing at roughly 20% as the MonotaRO team delivers consistently strong results and as we rapidly add skews and continue to drive greater market efficiencies at Zoro. From a profitability perspective, total company GP is expected to be between 36.1% and 36.6%, up in 2020 and 70 basis points in 2021. Both the High-Touch Solutions and Endless Assortment segments are expanding gross profit margins. However, there's a roughly 30 basis points dilutive impact to total company GP as the lower margin endless assortment of growth outpaces the High-Touch Solutions Segment. Both segments are expected to deliver high ROIC and drive GP and earnings dollars growth for the company. For High-Touch Solutions, our GP guidance incorporates the sequential improvement in the back half of the year as we move beyond the unfavorable pandemic impact and get back to more normal business operations. For the year in the U.S. we expect our price cost spread to be neutral. Total company operating margins are expected to be between 11.8% and 12.4% and expand between 50 basis points and 115 basis points versus 2020. At the midpoint we expect our operating margins will be back to 2019 levels. Operating margin improvements are expected to be driven by both GP expansion versus 2020 loans and SG&A leverage as we grow the top line, while maintaining cost discipline. These top line and profitability targets, as well as continued execution of our share repurchase program are expected to produce earnings per share between $19 and $20.50; that\u2019s growth between 17.5% and 26.5%. Continuing with guidance on slide 17, in addition to the total company guidance, we wanted to provide some additional color by segment, as well as our plans for capital allocation. At the segment level, we expect operating margin expansion in both of our reportable segments, with margins and High-Touch Solutions between 13.2% and 13.7% and endless assortment landing between 8.8% and 9.2%. Cromwell represented in other is expected to reduce operating losses and anticipate closing the year with operating margin down approximately 7%. We expect to cut Cromwell\u2019s losses in half and return the business to profitability in the back half of 2022. From a cash flow perspective for the year, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1 million and $1.2 million. Our capital expenditures outlook for the year remains between $225 million and $275 million. The large majority of our investment this year includes DC expansion in Japan, KeepStock enhancements in the U.S., continued IT investment and a normal level of maintenance capital. We expect the balance of our cash to be used to fund our quarterly dividend and to continue executing against our new share repurchase authorization. For 2021 we're expecting between $600 million and $700 million of share repurchases, which continue to reflect our confidence in successfully executing our strategies and growth initiatives. And I'll close with the highlights from our dividends announced this week, representing 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, a testament to the strength and stability of our business and our commitment to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. I'm proud of the team and our results for the quarter across those segments and I'm confident in our performance moving forward. As Dee discussed, we expect to end this year having gained strong share and to be in a better profitability position than before the pandemic as we enter into 2022. We remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of keeping the world working as we get through the rest of the pandemic and back to normal operations, as well as continue to execute our strategy so we can achieve this purpose for years to come. And with that, we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.\nRyan Merkel: Hey! Thanks and good morning all. I guess first off, your sales outlook is encouraging and a little bit better than I was thinking. Can you put some context around the 36% non-pandemic grow for the High-Touch Business in April. I know it was an easy comp, but it feels like the macro noticeably picked up. Is that the right read?\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks Ryan for the questions. I think as we talked about this year\u2019s comparisons for 2020 are going to be pretty closed upon given what happened this year. And so if you go back to 2019, what we see is a very consistent increase in non-pandemic relative to that 2019, and we see you know the pandemic sales continue to be elevated, but not as elevated as time goes on. And so really if you think about the revenue outlook for us, we're basically taking run rates and looking at what we think's going to happen with run rates and that gets us to the numbers we're talking about. So you don\u2019t have to believe a lot about anything really changing in the macro versus just continued recovery. We still \u2013 you know we still have some segments that are struggling, that aren\u2019t anywhere near where they were before, but a lot of the economy is really back and running fairly smoothly and non-pandemic is as well with those segments.\nRyan Merkel: Okay, cool. And then secondly, the gross margin outlook for the High-Touch looks pretty consistent with the outlook in February. But my question is and I think you hit on this, are there cost headwinds that creep in during the second half relative to what you just reported here in the first quarter? I ask, because the first quarter adjusted results, you know near 40% imply that the second half could be 40% or higher, you know because the mix is going to improve. So is there an offset is the question?\nD.G. Macpherson: You know not really offset. So we think there's going to be some inflation. It's already starting to come in as Dee mentioned. We think as she said, that price cost is going to be neutral for the year. We think most of that's going to be noise. We think we\u2019re going to get a little better mix moving forward, and then we get through the inventory write downs and you know where we're at now is similar to where we're likely to be moving forward, so it's not going to be a big shift due to cost increases that we foresee at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.\nDavid Manthey: Hi! Good morning. Yeah, this all looks very good and thank you for all the modeling details, but I have a strategy question. Could you update us on the High-Touch Strategy, if you want to talk about sales force technology, service offerings, any key initiatives for the rest of this year and into 2022, please D.J. \u2013 D.G., sorry.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes, sure, sure, absolutely. Thanks Dave. You know so I would say that our strategic initiatives remain similar to what they've been the last year or so. We continue to invest pretty heavily in technology to improve our digital offerings to make this more curated and to help customers [Inaudible]\nDavid Manthey: D.G., I'm not sure if anybody else is having the trouble hearing you. Is the moderator around here?\nOperator: Yes, Mr. Macpherson, can you adjust your mic here. You're cutting out quite a bit.\nD.G. Macpherson: Okay, can you hear me now?\nDavid Manthey: Much better, yeah.\nD.G. Macpherson: Alright, so what I was saying was the initiatives that we have are very similar to what we\u2019ve had the last year. Our merchandising, we continue to invest in merchandising the assortment. We continue to invest in technology to improve our digital solutions. We continue to improve our marketing capabilities and increase spend in the marketing area. And you know our sales initiatives, a lot of what we're doing with our sellers is just getting back in front of customers again. We\u2019ve done a really nice job of staying connected to customers and we're now getting out in the field more and we\u2019re able to visit customers and re-engage and get started on things that might have been put off. And the other thing I'd say is, we've really seen nice growth in our KeepStock technology, and we're going to continue invest in KeepStock and improve our ability to serve customers and maintain their inventory. So those are the main initiatives in the business. All are moving along well and effectively.\nDavid Manthey: Sounds good. Thanks again D.G. I appreciate it.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.\nChristopher Glynn: Hey, thanks. The low double digits are again a daily outlook, clearly very good. I'm wondering what amount of lower pandemic product sales is that net out. I was sort of thinking 3% given the 50 basis point delta with the H.T.S. outlook versus the market for the present year versus your normal 3% to 4% outgrowth, but maybe you have a better way to frame it up.\nD.G. Macpherson: Sure. Chris, just so I understand the question. Are you asking what we think is going to happen to the pandemic product sales as the year progresses?\nChristopher Glynn: Well, basically your top line guidance has some you know headwind netted out from lower pandemic sales. I\u2019m wondering what kind of the mid-point basis that that is.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah, okay. So you know we \u2013 as Dee mentioned last year, at the peak of the pandemic we were probably 30% pandemic sales and for the year it was 28%. You know we're running about 25% now. We do expect that to moderate and get closer to 20%. I would say, we expect relative to 2019, we still expect some elevated pandemic sales. We're seeing that with, certainly for any of you that have been in the hospitals or medical offices, you know there's still much more PPE than in the past. We see that in government agencies, we see that in retail establishments and certainly in warehouses. So we expect some elevated, but we expect to slowly see that go from that 25% number down approaching 20%, closer to 20% by the end of the year. So we expect the comparisons year-over-year to go down with the pandemic, as non-pandemic comes up. But we don't expect the elevated sales to go away entirely. We expect there to be some long tail out here where there\u2019s going to be elevated pandemic sales, so that's our expectation.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay, great. And just a point of clarification, I missed the revenue comments from the second quarter.\nD.G. Macpherson: On the call?\nChristopher Glynn: Yeah.\nD.G. Macpherson: Dee, do you want to get that?\nDee Merriwether: Yeah. I mean the only thing we mentioned related to Q2 really was what we kind of lay out for High-Touch Solutions on page 9, which is between the range in April of 15 to 16.\nChristopher Glynn: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. Great color in the slides, so thanks for that. I wanted to hone in on 2Q gross margins, and first of all, if we could just clarify the price cost recovery and mutual comments, is that on $1 basis. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s $1 basis and therefore there\u2019d be some element of margin dilution from there. Could you just clarify that? And then on 2Q margins, gross margins, are we still in a situation where you know normal seasonality, whatever normal means, would have gross margins down Q-to-Q? And then how do we size the inventory impact into 2Q versus 1Q? Thanks.\nD.G. Macpherson: So Dee, do you want to go ahead and take that one?\nDee Merriwether: Sure. I mean, at the total company level we're expecting GP to be about flat year-over-year. I\u2019d also reference you to you know \u2013 we really didn't size Q2. Specifically, we kind of talked about what we believe the size of the impact is this quarter, and that we do not expect an inventory adjustment to be actually any larger than the adjustment that we had in Q1. We are still selling through a lot of the pandemic product very well; however, as we go through the year, we really want to get back to focusing on non-pandemic through investing in inventory and serving our customers well, so you know based upon the sell through on whatever we have remaining, it will be the adjustments that we expect in the second quarter, because we really want to get past that and get back to much normal operating numbers on a go forward basis.\nNigel Coe: And then the price cost impact, but this is margin.\nDee Merriwether: So from a price cost perspective, I will go back probably to the earlier question and response, which is you know we're seeing some inflation in the market. You know we took some pricing actions earlier in the year. We continue to work with our supply base. You know on any increases we have a pretty rigorous cost process that we work with our suppliers based on facts and from an outlook perspective, if we continue to see any more inflation that we feel and deem as needed to be passed on to customers, we feel confident in our ability to do that and that is why from an outlook perspective we are targeting price cost neutrality for the year.\nD.G. Macpherson: And Nigel, just to your point, the numbers, the inflation numbers are small enough that it doesn't really have a meaningful impact on Grainger, weather its $1 or rate. So we expect that to be very little impact, either on dollars or rate.\nNigel Coe: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please state your questions.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. You guys have talked about Zoro margins getting into the high single digit range. But if we think a longer term beyond I think the three to five years you guys have talked about, is there a structural reason that Zorro cannot get to the MonotaRO 12%-ish level. I'm going to ask if Zoro gross margin is running at 500 bips above MonotaRO, which is quite meaningful, and I presume it is supported by the Grainger U.S. distribution network.\nD.G. Macpherson: So, there's a lot in that question. So we do expect Zoro margins in the three to five year frame to be back, tipping in the upper single digits. There are some differences in the Japanese market and the U.S. market. The digital advertising market is very, very different and so that\u2019s a structural difference. You know we expect the \u2013 one thing I'd point out is over time, and we\u2019ve already started to see this. As we added skews into the assortment, we\u2019ve actually leveraged third party shipper relationships more. We've already seen \u2013 you know we're getting away a little bit from the U.S. supply chains. The U.S. supply chains still makes up the bulk of the shipments, but not \u2013 will not be in that position forever. And one other thing \u2013 reason that's important is, on any way you look at it, the return on invested capital in the business going forward is going to be very strong. Today either we reallocate some of the U.S. inventory very strong, and as it goes forward it'll even be stronger. So we don't expect to get fully to the Japanese margins. It's a different market, different market dynamics, but we do expect to have very strong profitability from the business, both from an operating margin perspective, but even more so from a return on invested capital.\nChris Snyder: I appreciate that. And then turning to the U.S. High-Touch, how do you feel about the revised 300 bps and 400 bps of outgrowth relative to when you first gave the guidance last year? And are you seeing new customers that came last year for pandemic products, re-order non pandemic?\nD.G. Macpherson: I\u2019d say the short answer is, we feel good about the 300 to 400 basis points. You know last year if you take all the mess away, from what we saw, which was positive for us in terms of share gains given our supply chain strength and position, we were over 400 basis points of share gains just on sort of our demand generation activities. This year adjusted will be in a similar position. Something like that number we think is a good number for us at this point. What was the second half of that? I'm sorry.\nChris Snyder: Are the new customers that came last year for pandemic products, are you seeing them in the order now panned out?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes, absolutely. We're seeing strong repurchase from those customers and you know we \u2013 one of the things I would say is that, in the heat of the pandemic we had more consumer volume that we typically would have had. Filtering through that and getting the business customers, we\u2019re seeing strong business repeated and business repeated in non-pandemic product as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning everyone and I\u2019ll also echo the \u2013 how much we appreciate the slides. Even though it\u2019s the first time we've seen the new cast, yet it seems pretty intuitive there and a lot of details, so thanks. Here's my question; in these remarks sheet, it said that not all costs will come back and was hoping you could either just size for us, so just you know frame what kinds of costs maybe magnitude. And did I hear correctly that you're assuming only 50 basis points of outgrowth? Is that a second quarter or 2021 assumption?\nDee Merriwether: Sure. You want me to start D.G. here?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah, go ahead.\nDee Merriwether: So, as it relates to not all comps will come back, I think \u2013 you know I know we've learned a lot during the pandemic about working remotely and internally we're looking at what that could mean for us long term as it relates to helping us improve the SGA leverage on an ongoing basis. You know there may be different ways as you can imagine. We can interact with investors in the more virtual means as an example with suppliers and with customers to some extent in the future, so we may have some impact on a long term basis on overall company travel expenses as an example. Those are the type of things that we're thinking about and looking at now to help us look at long term leverage opportunity. You know so hopefully that helps answer that part of the question. And can you repeat the last part again Deane?\nDeane Dray: Yes, it was the assumption of 50 basis points of outgrowth and I think that was for 2021. It seems that's under trend, but if you look at on a two year average maybe you're in line, but what's causing the more modest outgrowth?\nDee Merriwether: Yeah, so you know we continue to share that there was a lot of noise last year in 2020 and you know last quarter and then now we talked about the fact that we believe our 2020 share gain was inflated due to the pandemic and so then this year as we lap that, our share gain will be less than that. It\u2019ll be muted as we lap those one-time, you know non-repeating pretty large orders that we experienced last year. So that's why we put those two year metrics in. We think it's more reasonable, because it takes out some of the noise that\u2019s not perfect and so yes, then this year based upon that, we expect to outgrow the market by 50 bps. But as you said, last year at 800 when you average those two to get to about 425, and that is still above the targeted goal we set of you know consistently growing 300 to 400 basis points above the market.\nDeane Dray: Alright, that's really helpful. And then just as a second question, the 30 basis points of structural headwind from the lower margin Endless Assortment growing faster than High-Touch, is that the same kind of headwind we should expect for 2022, like the same magnitude? If not, you know what might change? Thanks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah, I would say yeah, we haven't calculated exactly, but I would see no reason why it would be similar. Our expectation is that the Assortment Business will continue to grow at about 20% a year moving forward and we\u2019ll continue to gain share in the U.S. and the High-Touch is at a similar pace, so that should be roughly right. You know the map changed a little bit as the Endless Assortment gets bigger, but they should be roughly right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jeffries. Please state your question.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning, thank you. My question is on the medium customer growth. It was pretty good in Q1 at 11%. Could you maybe talk about what your market share today is now on the medium customer business and then just remind us how accretive medium customers are to gross margins as well. Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: To share on\u2026.\nOperator: Mr. Macpherson, it sounds like your mic is cutting out again.\nD.G. Macpherson: Okay, sorry about that. Is it better now?\nOperator: Yeah, go ahead please.\nD.G. Macpherson: Alright, there you go. So in terms of mid-sized customer growth, we're seeing very good growth right now. We will continue to see good growth. One of the reasons is that last year during the height of the pandemic we allocated inventory to the hospitals and government agencies. Actually it\u2019s the right thing to do and so we had just inflated the growth of mid-sized customers last year. So we're going to see very good numbers this year and a lot of that's real, but a lot of that's due to the fact that we detailed inventory last year. Our expect \u2013 we\u2019re about 2% share with mid-sized customers. We have a lot of room to grow. We\u2019re getting back to where we were several years ago when we think we've got \u2013 you know 10 years ago, but we think we've got a long ways to go to grow and both with uncovered customers through digital means and through covered customers and inside sales we\u2019re saying nice growth rates. And in terms of margin, its significantly higher gross profit. You know on the contribution margin level it's not as big a difference, but still a difference and you know we talked about 500 basis point plus difference in the past.\nHamzah Mazari: Got you. And just my follow-up question is just on the Endless Assortment Business. Could you maybe talk about MonotaRO growing sales with enterprise customers? Is that something that's new? Is that something that Zoro can do as well or is that just sort of a difference in the market place in Japan versus the U.S.?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah, it's a great question, it\u2019s not new. MonotaRO been doing it for five or six years I think. I may have that a little bit wrong, but something like that, they become better at it. The market in Japan is very, very different. I would say that there aren\u2019t distributors like Grainger serving customers with the kind of intensity that we have in the U.S. there, enterprise customers, and so we\u2019re going to keep Zoro focused on small and mid-sized businesses. There's a ton of runway for small and mid-sized businesses. And as they get better, we're seeing the fruits of that work and so that's going to be our focus for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jake Levinson with Melius Research. Please state your question.\nJake Levinson: Good morning everyone.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nJake Levinson: Just turning to Canada for a second, I just wanted to ask if you \u2013 you guys see a path to profitability in that business that looks more like what we see in the U.S. over time?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah, the answers is yes, we do. Obviously, we\u2019ve had a long ride that\u2019s been challenged in Canada. I think for the last two year, for the first time we have a really good customer experience. We have a team that's really energized. We will be \u2013 we feel we will be right at breakeven this year, we will be profitable next year and that's with what has been a very difficult path economically for Canada. So, we feel good, you know whether or not we're going to get it up to the level of the U.S., ours is debatable. We feel like we have line of sight to getting it to strong profitability in Canada, and there's really no structural reason why we can't do that, and we are just on the execution path to making that happen now.\nJake Levinson: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you D.G. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Marek with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.\nKevin Marek: Yes, hi! Thanks, good morning.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nKevin Marek: Just with respect to the full year guidance, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of the general supply chain conditions we touched on. It\u2019s obviously, a topic that you talked about a lot and I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re seeing, and what kind of improvement or lack thereof you're expecting within the full year guide?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah, so I assume you're referring to sort of a lot of the global challenges in the supply chain. We see some of those issues certainly, the freight markets challenging right now. It's actually easing a bit and getting a little bit better as we head throughout the year it appears, and we feel like servicing costs are going to be \u2013 we have a decent chance for where that\u2019s going to go. You know we see some of our customers disrupted by supply chain challenges, certainly you know automotive has been one that there\u2019s been a lot of press on. Most of our customers are not disrupted by some of the supply chain challenges that we see, so we don't expect huge disruptions, although we expect a lot of messiness in the supply chain. I would say some things are getting a little bit better. I think port clearance is getting a little bit better now which is good to see. We are trying to bring a bunch of inventory into our buildings as we grow and there\u2019s challenges. I would say in the entire supply chain, certain things are slower than they've been historically and I think that's definitely a condition that everybody has. Our assumption is that there's going to be messiness, we\u2019ll manager it as well or better than anybody else and come through it well. At this point, but we do recognize that there's a lot of challenges in supply chain right now.\nKevin Marek: Got it, thank you. And just a follow-up, just looking at the other segment, you\u2019ve narrowed the loss to $3 million in 1Q. Just curious what you're seeing there? I think you said having losses in \u201921 turning to profitability in the second half. You know they are medium term, kind of profitability target or framework that you should be thinking about?\nD.G. Macpherson: You know I think most of that, most of the Cromwell business and I would say a couple things about the Cromwell business. One is, that business has very high customer satisfaction now. It has very high team engagement, they were just named 11th I guess best employer in the U.K. for large companies. That is very different than where we were at three years ago, on both of those dimensions and you know they're starting to see a return to growth now. U.K. is doing okay coming out the pandemic. We have some confidence that they're going to actually be able to get back to growth and get back to profitability, taking a bunch of cost out of the business and they're doing a lot of the right things. So, we feel good about it. It's too early for me to talk about where they\u2019re going to be kind of mid-term. We\u2019ve talked about, we need to see profitability from that business next year. We expect to exit the year profitable in Cromwell and that's going to be kind of a big check point for us, but there's a lot of positive signs that we will be able to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please state your question.\nAdam Uhlman: Hey guys, good morning. Congrats on good execution this quarter. I have a couple of questions on Zoro. First of all, I think you mentioned there has been some changes with the discounting strategies at Zoro. I guess what's changed there to help drive the gross margin expansion.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah, I won\u2019t go into too many details Adam. Thanks for the question. I would just say that we\u2019ve used some analytics to determine where discount works and where it doesn't work. And that has allowed us to be more targeted in our discounting to acquire new customers, and that is a big part of what the benefit and improvements are.\nAdam Uhlman: Okay. And then related to the customer count, thanks for sharing all that details, it's really helpful. I guess I'm surprised that Zoro and MonotaRO have the same number of customers, but MonotaRO is twice the size in revenues as Zoro is. As we think about like you know the path forward closing that gap, is all that just the skew expansion that you mentioned to get better customer penetration within the Zoro customers or is there other levers that you need to pull to continue to drive that sales growth.\nD.G. Macpherson: I think its two things Adam. I think it\u2019s skew expansion and I think it\u2019s, to your point about the size of the customer from the revenue. It's repeat buying and the Zoro business is getting traction on doing better, getting repeat volume from customers and building relationships with existing customers more, and that's been a lesson that we're learning from the Japanese business, that they've done very, very well. Is how do you take \u2013 how do you take a customer who buys and actually turn them into a customer for a long time. And that's the other piece that the team is really working hard to drive, and those are the skew count and that are really the drivers of what we need to get.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nMichael McGinn: Hey, thanks a lot for sneaking me in here. I just wanted to go back to the Endless Assortment model. Can you talk about the trajectory of GMV versus the sales and maybe the skew count? And as you shift away from the U.S. supply chain, I think you alluded to, does that change your private label mix within your overall business?\nD.G. Macpherson: You know I\u2019ll ask you to repeat the first part of that. Our private label mix should change all that much. Most of the private level we sell is through the Grainger brand and we are going to continue to push on growing private brand. And we have great brands and great products, and working hard to make sure we're able to cross those with national brands and that type of thing. I didn't quite understand the first part of your question. Could you repeat that?\nMichael McGinn: Yeah, so sequentially active skews on Zoro went from 6.1 to 6.7. I'm trying to kind of back into what is the internal I guess sales contribution versus what's being done on a GMV basis that would be more indicative of that reseller model that you're shifting to? So the skews went up 9% sequentially, does that \u2013 is the GMV sales trend following that same kind of trajectory?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah, so what I would say there is a couple of things. One is, most of the new skews we\u2019re adding are going to be third party. We already have access to Zoro through Grainger, Grainger skews. So most of them are going to be third party, not all of those. The other thing I would say is that if you look at - we look very carefully at sort of revenue per skew for different tranches of ads. We continue to see very high productivity and similar revenue per skew as we add items across the assortment at Zoro, and in fact, given the numbers of skews we\u2019ve added over the last couple of years, if you look at those curves, you will get pretty confident that we're going to see a big lift over time as we continue to add skews given what we are seeing. So we're pretty confident about sort of revenue path and what skew expansion will add for that business.\nMichael McGinn: Okay. And then, I don't know if this is asked or it was in the script, but the variance in national versus smaller and mid-sized accounts, is that simply a function. I think you've turned off some skews last year to protect some of the large customers. So it\u2019s an easy comp or some other distributors or large customers are coming back faster than the local accounts. So any color there would be great.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah, I mean we are seeing good activity with both large and local accounts. I would say that for us you're going to see, particularly in the second quarter you're going to see a bigger list with mid-sized and local accounts as a result of holding skews in inventory for hospitals and government agencies in the peak of the pandemic last year. So we turned off skews for a number of our customers to make sure that we can get the product to the most helpful place, and so that's going to be a big factor in what you see.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with G Research. Please state your question.\nJustin Bergner: Thank you for double sneaking me in D.G. and Dee. My first question is, with respect to mix, as we look at the business over the medium term, obviously mid-sized customers are growing a little bit faster. Maybe there's some headwinds from larger customers getting larger. Is mix sort of a neutral for your U.S. business as you look at the business on a two to three year view?\nD.G. Macpherson: So, we haven't shared probably the full perspective. I think mix is likely to be, if at all slightly positive in the High-Touch business. It's slightly negative from the growth of the Endless Assortment. As a company level we would expect it to not be a huge lever either way, but we do we do feel like the mid-sized customers are likely to grow faster over the next several years. So, I think that will be a slight positive.\nJustin Bergner: Okay, and then the other question I\u2019ll slip in was the government sales looked very strong this quarter and they were lapping a pretty good comp. I mean I realize there's a lot of comp noise there, but is there anything you want to call out that was particularly positive in the government performance this quarter that maybe was beyond the pandemic.\nD.G. Macpherson: No, I mean I think our government team does a great job and we have great relationships with government customers. Their comp gets tougher you know in the second quarter for sure, and the third quarter given the pandemic activities. I would say, you know the initial flow last year at the pandemic hospitals were far and away the biggest demand and then government came in after that, but overall we are seeing really nice run rates with our government customers and expect that to continue.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back over to Mr. D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks. Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: Alright, terrific. Thanks for joining us. I really appreciate having you on the call. You know I would just reiterate that with what we've seen as we look through the last 18 months is certainly remarkable for all of us, but if you sort of boil it down, I think what we are likely to see is for us significant share gain over a two year period and I think our economics will be in a better place when we come out of this than when we started going into the pandemic at the end of 2019. We feel like we\u2019ve got great customer relationships and our team has done a very nice job of providing good service through what has been a challenging time and we feel like we are really in a good place going forward. So, with that I\u2019ll close, and I wish you all a fantastic day. Thanks for your time. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dee Merriwether",
            "content": "Thank you, D.G. As we move to our new reportable segment, you will continue to see a total company slide then a familiar four lines P&L for both High-Touch Solutions North America and Endless Assortments. We'll also continue to provide transparency into the U.S., Canada. MonotaRO and the Zoro U.S. business. As we lap the pandemic, we will continue to provide pandemic related data to clarify our results, especially for the U.S. Turning to our quarterly results, organic daily sales which adjust for the divestitures of Fabory and China finished up 7% and 5.9% on a constant currency basis, underpinned by growth in both segments. Note that we have one less selling day in Q1, 2021 versus Q1, 2020. At the total company level, GP was down 190 basis points. 180 basis point of this was driven by pandemic fueled inventory adjustments in the U.S., consistent with what we shared in our Q4, 2020 earnings call. We anticipated the need for adjustment. As D.G. shared, we expect to complete any potential market driven inventory adjustments by the end of the second quarter and we estimate the amount will be similar to or lower than Q1. This expectation has been factored into our GP ramp, as well as our 2021 guidance. Endless Assortment expanded gross margins overall, driven by continued improvement at Zoro, while the mix impact of growing these businesses is alluded to company gross margin. It drives incremental gross profit and earnings dollars and is an important driver for the company's performance. SG&A of $735 million was favorable by $43 million year-over-year, in-line with our expectation shared last quarter. We captured 210 basis points of SG&A leverage in the period and continued prudent cost control in the High-Touch Solutions segment and strong expense leverage in Endless Assortment. This resulted in total company operating margin of 11.6%, up 20 basis points over last year. The business continues to produce robust cash flow with operating cash flow of $294 million, 124% of net adjusted earnings and free cash flow of $221 million. We also returned $175 million back to shareholders through repurchases and $81 million through dividends in the period. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment, daily sales increased 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020. We started to lap the pandemic sales by mid-February, resulting in more challenging comparisons. In the U.S. daily sales were up 3.5%. In Canada, daily sales were up 3.3% in U.S. dollars, however still down 2.8% in local days and local currency. Canada's decline was primarily driven by pandemic disruptions, most notably with our natural resource customer. As we diversify beyond natural resources, we are seeing improvement in our targeted end markets, including healthcare, higher education and manufacturing. For the segment GP finished the quarter at 37.4%, a sequential improvement of 30 basis points versus Q4, 2020 and down 230 basis points versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline was due to the inventory adjustment to U.S. and the pandemic mix in Canada. Excluding the adjustment, U.S. GP would have been up versus prior year, which is a better indicator of expected performance moving forward. We have included a chart towards the end of this presentation which highlights the impact of the pandemic inventory adjustments in the U.S. by quarter. Finally, we continue to gain SG&A leverage with our costs down $24 million, driven by reduced travel expenses and general operating efficiency in both the U.S. and Canada. Canada expanded operating margins 110 basis points over the prior year. As a part of our commitment to providing continued transparency of our U.S. and Canadian businesses, we've included a chart with details in the appendix. Moving on to slide nine. Looking at pandemic product growth trends, we have started to lap the spike experienced in early 2020. For reference, pandemic product sales grew 41% in the first quarter of 2020. Accordingly, growth rates have eased throughout the quarter this year, growing a very modest 1% year-over-year. Pandemic mix as a percent of the total remained elevated at 25%. As a comparison point, mix was 19% in 2019 and rose to 28% for the full year of 2020. Most importantly though, on the non-pandemic side things continued to improve. We started to see year-over-year sales growth and not-pandemic product sales in March of this year, with daily sales dollars increasing sequentially each month during the quarter, with April ending up roughly 36%, the highest growth to date in 2021. This is a very encouraging sign that trends especially for customer business activity are beginning to revert to more normal levels. Looking at share gain on slide 10, we estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 0.5% to 1.5% in the first quarter, showing continued improvement as the economy recovers. We knew there will be tremendous noise in measuring share gains throughout 2021 given the extreme volatility of the prior year. Our 2020 share gain is inflated due to the pandemic. Correspondingly our 2021 share gains will be muted as we wrap the unusual sales spikes from non-repeating orders. We outgrew the market by roughly 250 basis points in the quarter as we lapped the pandemic sales spike. To eliminate the noise and better understand our market outgrowth, we've also provided a two year average share gain metric. While it is perfect, it does normalize activity across the two year period and provide a more reasonable view into our share gains since the end of 2019. The two year average was approximately 475 basis points, each quarter we plan to share both numbers. We think this will be especially helpful in the second quarter given the extreme volatility. We remain confident in our ability to serve new and existing customers during the challenging times and to produce 300 to 400 basis point of sustainable outgrowth in our U.S. High-Touch Solutions business. Moving to our Endless Assortment Segment, daily sales increased 27.4% or 23.3% on a constant currency basis, driven by new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO as well as MonotaRO's continued pursuit of large enterprise customers in Japan. I will share some of our key growth metrics to provide further color into how we think about these businesses. GP expanded 35 basis points year-over-year driven by Zoro's improved discounting strategies. Operating margins expanded 185 basis points due primarily to substantial SG&A leverage at Zoro. Moving to slide 12. We have provided further transparency on the results of both businesses. As you're aware, MonotaRO is a public company and as such, MonotaRO follows Japanese Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or JGAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP. In Grainger's consolidated results, we translate MonotaRO's financials into U.S. dollars and U.S. GAAP. In addition, we continue to report MonotaRO results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers we disclose would different somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. In local currency and using Japan's local selling days, which occasionally differ from U.S. selling days, MonotaRO daily sales grew 25.5% with GP finishing the quarter at 26.5% in basis points below prior year. Operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 12%. This is a very strong quarter for MonotaRO. We are excited for the new distribution center that will allow them to stack many of the fastest moving items locally. They also continue to make enhancements in both product information and order management systems, hoping to improve the customer search experience and delivery speed, preparing them for the future. Switching to Zoro U.S., March was our stronger average daily sales month since Zoro's inception in 2010, with daily sales up 15.2% driven by strong customer acquisition. In addition, we drove solid SG&A leverage resulting in 370 basis points of operating margin expansion. I'd like to spend a minute on the metrics we are using to measure progress on our growth initiatives for both Zoro and MonotaRO. On the left side of the chart we've listed total registered users for both businesses. This is a long standing metric that MonotaRO has shared externally. Growing our registered user base is an important driver of top line performance and as you can see, both businesses have shown tremendous progress. Moving to the right side, Zoro is aggressively adding skew to the portfolio. Having an expansive assortment is the key factor to Zoro's customer acquisition and growth strategy. As of Q1, 2021 we had a total of 6.7 million skews available online. We are excited by our robust top line and targeting to reach 10 million total skews by 2024. Before I discuss our full year 2021 guidance, I'd like to first provide additional color on the current quarter to help you understand what we expect as the economy recovers and our business performance improves. From a sales perspective, our preliminary results for April are strong. As last April was our softest sales month of the year, we expect to grow \u2013 we expect our growth to moderate in May and June and to end the second quarter up between 14% and 15% on a daily organic basis. Note that our reported revenue growth will be about 280 basis points lower as Fabory and China, both of those businesses were divested after June of 2020. We expect Q2 company GP to be roughly flat on a sequential basis, which implies down about 30 basis points year-over-year. The pandemic impacts including inventory adjustments and mix continued to improve both sequentially and year-over-year. We are starting to see modest cost inflation, especially on some specific product categories and raw materials such as resin and steel. While the quarters may still be a bit bumpy as the timing of cost increases and price actions do not align perfectly, we expect price cost spreads to be neutral for the year. We're also starting to see general inflation in the freight market, especially in ocean freight rates and LTL shipping. In the second quarter, we expect freight shipment will be muted as we are lapping inflated prior year costs from air shipments. For SG&A, we expect to see cost step-up most notably in the second quarter as business activity resumes. Specifically, we expect increases in travel, variable compensation and merit as well as advertising spend as we take advantage of higher returns. With this, we anticipate SG&A between $780 million and $800 million for the second quarter of 2021, and to remain in this general range for the remaining quarters of the year. This will drive leverage for the full year versus both 2020 and 2019. As always, we remain focused on managing costs while continuing to invest in the business for the long term. We've learned a great deal through the pandemic and don't expect all costs to return to pre-pandemic levels moving forward. Related to U.S. GP we still expect to see improved rates as pandemic mix reverts to more normal levels and as we put non-core pandemic inventory adjustments behind us. Run rate margins are stabilizing, and we maintain our expectation that we will exit the year with U.S. GP rate as high or higher with Q1 2020 level. As a reminder, this slide relates to U.S. business. We choose to highlight it, because it represents more than 70% of the total company results, and was most heavily impacted by the pandemic. As we become more comfortable with the pace of the economic recovery primarily in the U.S., coupled with our recent performance, we are providing full year 2021 guidance and will provide updates as we move through the year. For the total company, we expect daily sales growth between 8.5% and 11% or 10% and 12.5% organically, driven by strong top line performance in both segments. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we anticipate U.S. business will grow between 7% and 9.5% based on estimated MRO market growth between 6.5% and 9%. This years' one year market outgrowth of roughly 50 basis points and a two-year average annual outgrowth of 425 basis points; the two year average normalizes for the extreme spikes experienced in 2020 and anchors to 2019. In Canada the recovery is a bit more choppy than the U.S. with the slower vaccine rollout and recent business shut downs. With that in mind, we do expect volumes to stabilize as we move through the year. We expect endless assortment to continue growing at roughly 20% as the MonotaRO team delivers consistently strong results and as we rapidly add skews and continue to drive greater market efficiencies at Zoro. From a profitability perspective, total company GP is expected to be between 36.1% and 36.6%, up in 2020 and 70 basis points in 2021. Both the High-Touch Solutions and Endless Assortment segments are expanding gross profit margins. However, there's a roughly 30 basis points dilutive impact to total company GP as the lower margin endless assortment of growth outpaces the High-Touch Solutions Segment. Both segments are expected to deliver high ROIC and drive GP and earnings dollars growth for the company. For High-Touch Solutions, our GP guidance incorporates the sequential improvement in the back half of the year as we move beyond the unfavorable pandemic impact and get back to more normal business operations. For the year in the U.S. we expect our price cost spread to be neutral. Total company operating margins are expected to be between 11.8% and 12.4% and expand between 50 basis points and 115 basis points versus 2020. At the midpoint we expect our operating margins will be back to 2019 levels. Operating margin improvements are expected to be driven by both GP expansion versus 2020 loans and SG&A leverage as we grow the top line, while maintaining cost discipline. These top line and profitability targets, as well as continued execution of our share repurchase program are expected to produce earnings per share between $19 and $20.50; that's growth between 17.5% and 26.5%. Continuing with guidance on slide 17, in addition to the total company guidance, we wanted to provide some additional color by segment, as well as our plans for capital allocation. At the segment level, we expect operating margin expansion in both of our reportable segments, with margins and High-Touch Solutions between 13.2% and 13.7% and endless assortment landing between 8.8% and 9.2%. Cromwell represented in other is expected to reduce operating losses and anticipate closing the year with operating margin down approximately 7%. We expect to cut Cromwell's losses in half and return the business to profitability in the back half of 2022. From a cash flow perspective for the year, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1 million and $1.2 million. Our capital expenditures outlook for the year remains between $225 million and $275 million. The large majority of our investment this year includes DC expansion in Japan, KeepStock enhancements in the U.S., continued IT investment and a normal level of maintenance capital. We expect the balance of our cash to be used to fund our quarterly dividend and to continue executing against our new share repurchase authorization. For 2021 we're expecting between $600 million and $700 million of share repurchases, which continue to reflect our confidence in successfully executing our strategies and growth initiatives. And I'll close with the highlights from our dividends announced this week, representing 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, a testament to the strength and stability of our business and our commitment to our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks. Yeah. I mean the only thing we mentioned related to Q2 really was what we kind of lay out for High-Touch Solutions on page 9, which is between the range in April of 15 to 16. Sure. I mean, at the total company level we're expecting GP to be about flat year-over-year. I'd also reference you to you know \u2013 we really didn't size Q2. Specifically, we kind of talked about what we believe the size of the impact is this quarter, and that we do not expect an inventory adjustment to be actually any larger than the adjustment that we had in Q1. We are still selling through a lot of the pandemic product very well; however, as we go through the year, we really want to get back to focusing on non-pandemic through investing in inventory and serving our customers well, so you know based upon the sell through on whatever we have remaining, it will be the adjustments that we expect in the second quarter, because we really want to get past that and get back to much normal operating numbers on a go forward basis. So from a price cost perspective, I will go back probably to the earlier question and response, which is you know we're seeing some inflation in the market. You know we took some pricing actions earlier in the year. We continue to work with our supply base. You know on any increases we have a pretty rigorous cost process that we work with our suppliers based on facts and from an outlook perspective, if we continue to see any more inflation that we feel and deem as needed to be passed on to customers, we feel confident in our ability to do that and that is why from an outlook perspective we are targeting price cost neutrality for the year. Sure. You want me to start D.G. here? So, as it relates to not all comps will come back, I think \u2013 you know I know we've learned a lot during the pandemic about working remotely and internally we're looking at what that could mean for us long term as it relates to helping us improve the SGA leverage on an ongoing basis. You know there may be different ways as you can imagine. We can interact with investors in the more virtual means as an example with suppliers and with customers to some extent in the future, so we may have some impact on a long term basis on overall company travel expenses as an example. Those are the type of things that we're thinking about and looking at now to help us look at long term leverage opportunity. You know so hopefully that helps answer that part of the question. And can you repeat the last part again Deane? Yeah, so you know we continue to share that there was a lot of noise last year in 2020 and you know last quarter and then now we talked about the fact that we believe our 2020 share gain was inflated due to the pandemic and so then this year as we lap that, our share gain will be less than that. It'll be muted as we lap those one-time, you know non-repeating pretty large orders that we experienced last year. So that's why we put those two year metrics in. We think it's more reasonable, because it takes out some of the noise that's not perfect and so yes, then this year based upon that, we expect to outgrow the market by 50 bps. But as you said, last year at 800 when you average those two to get to about 425, and that is still above the targeted goal we set of you know consistently growing 300 to 400 basis points above the market."

            "name": "D.G. Macpherson",
            "content": "Thanks Irene. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today I'll provide a brief overview of our first quarter results, key initiatives and encouraging signs for our business as the economy recovers. Of note, this will be our first quarter with results aligned to our two new reportable segments. Also as MonotaRO, our majority owned subsidiary as a publicly traded company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we have now aligned the timing of our earnings releases. I am very proud of the way the Grainger team has continued to serve our customers through the recovery and has addressed new challenges as they arise. We're supporting many customers through vaccination deployment, including pharmacies and other large sites. Recently we partnered with the State University Medical Center, The National Guard, and The Department of Health to support a max vaccination site. We updated the site with important pandemic related products like safety equipment, as well as more traditional MRO products needed to support the operation, like power and extension cords, lighting and traffic cones. As it ramped up, this site has been able to facilitate thousands of vaccinations a day. We're seeing vaccination distribution progressing around the world, albeit at different speeds. In the U.S. as more of the population gets vaccinated, we are seeing many customers return to the normal operations and purchasing patterns. This is evident as our non-pandemic sales continue to return to normal levels and as sales in most end markets grow sequentially. In the U.K. we are seen business activity rise. In Canada solar vaccine distribution and potential shutdowns are slowing the business recovery. We're also seeing a modestly slower recovery in Japan. No matter what stage of the recovery our customers are in, our relationships with them are very strong given our support of their operations over the past year; part of being there for our customers and having the products they needed, when they needed it. To bring this to life, at this time last year when customers needed hand sanitizer, we sold them 55 gallon drums and they were filling their own containers. As supply constraints eased, customers reverted back to purchasing more normal PPE skews and far fewer 55 gallon drums. As I said before, we took calculated risks in procuring pandemic products and reasonable alternatives, especially in the second quarter of 2020. As the pandemic progressed and market dynamics changed, we had to revalue some of our inventory in Q4 and again in Q1. We anticipate further price deterioration on some of these non-core alternative pandemic products. While our profitability on these products, including all potential write downs was below normal, supporting our customers by taking these risks was the right thing to do. We improved relationships with our existing customers, developed new repeat business and delivered strong incremental growth at lower, but still profitable margins. On last quarter's call we shared our first quarter expectations. As it relates to revenue in the first quarter, all of our businesses surpassed our outlook. We expected first quarter company GP to be down 150 to 200 basis points versus prior year, and our actual results fell within the stated range. Excluding the inventory adjustment our U.S. GP was up versus the prior year, giving us further confidence in the path forward. Based on our strong results and improving economic trends, we are providing full year guidance which Dee will discuss in a few minutes. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continue to make progress on our key initiatives across geographies. The U.S. is seeing positive signs of economic recovery with growth of non-pandemic sales in virtually all segments. The exception is healthcare, which has very high pandemic fuel comps. Gross margin are returning to pre-pandemic levels in the U.S., net of inventory adjustments. In Canada the path to recovery is slower as they struggle to get the virus under control. Despite this, Grainger Canada achieved its revenue and margin targets in the first quarter. The Endless Assortment segment grew over 27% as we execute the playbook and gained momentum with our strategy. The team continues to add skews beyond traditional MRO products which helps grow web traffic, our continued marketing efforts, and more targeted discounting strategies are working well and driving operating margin expansion at Zoro. Also we are gaining real traction with new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO. Finally, I'm excited to announce that MonotaRO has opened its newest distribution center in Ibaraki, Japan, which will allow the business to stock additional high demand products locally. Shifting to the financial results, we achieved organic daily sales growth of 5.9% for the total company on a comp and currency basis. In the U.S. we started to lap the volatility of 2020 and in the first quarter of 2021 we drove approximately 250 basis points of market outgrowth. To normalize for all the volatility, we look to the two year average share gains, which we believe is a more reasonable measure of outgrowth. Using this we averaged 475 basis points of annual market outgrowth from 2019 to 2021. We anticipate showing both measures going forward. Endless Assortment had strong performance in the quarter at 27.4% daily sales grow. For the total company we delivered operating margin of 11.6% with 210 basis points in adjusted SG&A leverage, more than offsetting the anticipated GP pressure from pandemic inventory adjustments. To be clear, we expect to sell through the remainder of these non-core pandemic products and complete any potential market driven inventory adjustments by the end of Q2. Finally, we generated $294 million in operating cash flow, returned $256 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and maintained strong ROIC of 30.3%. All-in-all we are very pleased with the performance and our trajectory. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through our first quarter results. Dee. Thank you, Dee. I'm proud of the team and our results for the quarter across those segments and I'm confident in our performance moving forward. As Dee discussed, we expect to end this year having gained strong share and to be in a better profitability position than before the pandemic as we enter into 2022. We remain committed to fulfilling our purpose of keeping the world working as we get through the rest of the pandemic and back to normal operations, as well as continue to execute our strategy so we can achieve this purpose for years to come. And with that, we will open it up for questions. Thanks Ryan for the questions. I think as we talked about this year's comparisons for 2020 are going to be pretty closed upon given what happened this year. And so if you go back to 2019, what we see is a very consistent increase in non-pandemic relative to that 2019, and we see you know the pandemic sales continue to be elevated, but not as elevated as time goes on. And so really if you think about the revenue outlook for us, we're basically taking run rates and looking at what we think's going to happen with run rates and that gets us to the numbers we're talking about. So you don't have to believe a lot about anything really changing in the macro versus just continued recovery. We still \u2013 you know we still have some segments that are struggling, that aren't anywhere near where they were before, but a lot of the economy is really back and running fairly smoothly and non-pandemic is as well with those segments. You know not really offset. So we think there's going to be some inflation. It's already starting to come in as Dee mentioned. We think as she said, that price cost is going to be neutral for the year. We think most of that's going to be noise. We think we're going to get a little better mix moving forward, and then we get through the inventory write downs and you know where we're at now is similar to where we're likely to be moving forward, so it's not going to be a big shift due to cost increases that we foresee at this point. Yes, sure, sure, absolutely. Thanks Dave. You know so I would say that our strategic initiatives remain similar to what they've been the last year or so. We continue to invest pretty heavily in technology to improve our digital offerings to make this more curated and to help customers [Inaudible] Okay, can you hear me now? Alright, so what I was saying was the initiatives that we have are very similar to what we've had the last year. Our merchandising, we continue to invest in merchandising the assortment. We continue to invest in technology to improve our digital solutions. We continue to improve our marketing capabilities and increase spend in the marketing area. And you know our sales initiatives, a lot of what we're doing with our sellers is just getting back in front of customers again. We've done a really nice job of staying connected to customers and we're now getting out in the field more and we're able to visit customers and re-engage and get started on things that might have been put off. And the other thing I'd say is, we've really seen nice growth in our KeepStock technology, and we're going to continue invest in KeepStock and improve our ability to serve customers and maintain their inventory. So those are the main initiatives in the business. All are moving along well and effectively. Thank you. Sure. Chris, just so I understand the question. Are you asking what we think is going to happen to the pandemic product sales as the year progresses? Yeah, okay. So you know we \u2013 as Dee mentioned last year, at the peak of the pandemic we were probably 30% pandemic sales and for the year it was 28%. You know we're running about 25% now. We do expect that to moderate and get closer to 20%. I would say, we expect relative to 2019, we still expect some elevated pandemic sales. We're seeing that with, certainly for any of you that have been in the hospitals or medical offices, you know there's still much more PPE than in the past. We see that in government agencies, we see that in retail establishments and certainly in warehouses. So we expect some elevated, but we expect to slowly see that go from that 25% number down approaching 20%, closer to 20% by the end of the year. So we expect the comparisons year-over-year to go down with the pandemic, as non-pandemic comes up. But we don't expect the elevated sales to go away entirely. We expect there to be some long tail out here where there's going to be elevated pandemic sales, so that's our expectation. On the call? Dee, do you want to get that? So Dee, do you want to go ahead and take that one? And Nigel, just to your point, the numbers, the inflation numbers are small enough that it doesn't really have a meaningful impact on Grainger, weather its $1 or rate. So we expect that to be very little impact, either on dollars or rate. So, there's a lot in that question. So we do expect Zoro margins in the three to five year frame to be back, tipping in the upper single digits. There are some differences in the Japanese market and the U.S. market. The digital advertising market is very, very different and so that's a structural difference. You know we expect the \u2013 one thing I'd point out is over time, and we've already started to see this. As we added skews into the assortment, we've actually leveraged third party shipper relationships more. We've already seen \u2013 you know we're getting away a little bit from the U.S. supply chains. The U.S. supply chains still makes up the bulk of the shipments, but not \u2013 will not be in that position forever. And one other thing \u2013 reason that's important is, on any way you look at it, the return on invested capital in the business going forward is going to be very strong. Today either we reallocate some of the U.S. inventory very strong, and as it goes forward it'll even be stronger. So we don't expect to get fully to the Japanese margins. It's a different market, different market dynamics, but we do expect to have very strong profitability from the business, both from an operating margin perspective, but even more so from a return on invested capital. I'd say the short answer is, we feel good about the 300 to 400 basis points. You know last year if you take all the mess away, from what we saw, which was positive for us in terms of share gains given our supply chain strength and position, we were over 400 basis points of share gains just on sort of our demand generation activities. This year adjusted will be in a similar position. Something like that number we think is a good number for us at this point. What was the second half of that? I'm sorry. Yes, absolutely. We're seeing strong repurchase from those customers and you know we \u2013 one of the things I would say is that, in the heat of the pandemic we had more consumer volume that we typically would have had. Filtering through that and getting the business customers, we're seeing strong business repeated and business repeated in non-pandemic product as well. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, I would say yeah, we haven't calculated exactly, but I would see no reason why it would be similar. Our expectation is that the Assortment Business will continue to grow at about 20% a year moving forward and we'll continue to gain share in the U.S. and the High-Touch is at a similar pace, so that should be roughly right. You know the map changed a little bit as the Endless Assortment gets bigger, but they should be roughly right. To share on.... Okay, sorry about that. Is it better now? Alright, there you go. So in terms of mid-sized customer growth, we're seeing very good growth right now. We will continue to see good growth. One of the reasons is that last year during the height of the pandemic we allocated inventory to the hospitals and government agencies. Actually it's the right thing to do and so we had just inflated the growth of mid-sized customers last year. So we're going to see very good numbers this year and a lot of that's real, but a lot of that's due to the fact that we detailed inventory last year. Our expect \u2013 we're about 2% share with mid-sized customers. We have a lot of room to grow. We're getting back to where we were several years ago when we think we've got \u2013 you know 10 years ago, but we think we've got a long ways to go to grow and both with uncovered customers through digital means and through covered customers and inside sales we're saying nice growth rates. And in terms of margin, its significantly higher gross profit. You know on the contribution margin level it's not as big a difference, but still a difference and you know we talked about 500 basis point plus difference in the past. Yeah, it's a great question, it's not new. MonotaRO been doing it for five or six years I think. I may have that a little bit wrong, but something like that, they become better at it. The market in Japan is very, very different. I would say that there aren't distributors like Grainger serving customers with the kind of intensity that we have in the U.S. there, enterprise customers, and so we're going to keep Zoro focused on small and mid-sized businesses. There's a ton of runway for small and mid-sized businesses. And as they get better, we're seeing the fruits of that work and so that's going to be our focus for us. Good morning. Yeah, the answers is yes, we do. Obviously, we've had a long ride that's been challenged in Canada. I think for the last two year, for the first time we have a really good customer experience. We have a team that's really energized. We will be \u2013 we feel we will be right at breakeven this year, we will be profitable next year and that's with what has been a very difficult path economically for Canada. So, we feel good, you know whether or not we're going to get it up to the level of the U.S., ours is debatable. We feel like we have line of sight to getting it to strong profitability in Canada, and there's really no structural reason why we can't do that, and we are just on the execution path to making that happen now. Thanks. Good morning. Yeah, so I assume you're referring to sort of a lot of the global challenges in the supply chain. We see some of those issues certainly, the freight markets challenging right now. It's actually easing a bit and getting a little bit better as we head throughout the year it appears, and we feel like servicing costs are going to be \u2013 we have a decent chance for where that's going to go. You know we see some of our customers disrupted by supply chain challenges, certainly you know automotive has been one that there's been a lot of press on. Most of our customers are not disrupted by some of the supply chain challenges that we see, so we don't expect huge disruptions, although we expect a lot of messiness in the supply chain. I would say some things are getting a little bit better. I think port clearance is getting a little bit better now which is good to see. We are trying to bring a bunch of inventory into our buildings as we grow and there's challenges. I would say in the entire supply chain, certain things are slower than they've been historically and I think that's definitely a condition that everybody has. Our assumption is that there's going to be messiness, we'll manager it as well or better than anybody else and come through it well. At this point, but we do recognize that there's a lot of challenges in supply chain right now. You know I think most of that, most of the Cromwell business and I would say a couple things about the Cromwell business. One is, that business has very high customer satisfaction now. It has very high team engagement, they were just named 11th I guess best employer in the U.K. for large companies. That is very different than where we were at three years ago, on both of those dimensions and you know they're starting to see a return to growth now. U.K. is doing okay coming out the pandemic. We have some confidence that they're going to actually be able to get back to growth and get back to profitability, taking a bunch of cost out of the business and they're doing a lot of the right things. So, we feel good about it. It's too early for me to talk about where they're going to be kind of mid-term. We've talked about, we need to see profitability from that business next year. We expect to exit the year profitable in Cromwell and that's going to be kind of a big check point for us, but there's a lot of positive signs that we will be able to do that. Yeah, I won't go into too many details Adam. Thanks for the question. I would just say that we've used some analytics to determine where discount works and where it doesn't work. And that has allowed us to be more targeted in our discounting to acquire new customers, and that is a big part of what the benefit and improvements are. I think its two things Adam. I think it's skew expansion and I think it's, to your point about the size of the customer from the revenue. It's repeat buying and the Zoro business is getting traction on doing better, getting repeat volume from customers and building relationships with existing customers more, and that's been a lesson that we're learning from the Japanese business, that they've done very, very well. Is how do you take \u2013 how do you take a customer who buys and actually turn them into a customer for a long time. And that's the other piece that the team is really working hard to drive, and those are the skew count and that are really the drivers of what we need to get. You know I'll ask you to repeat the first part of that. Our private label mix should change all that much. Most of the private level we sell is through the Grainger brand and we are going to continue to push on growing private brand. And we have great brands and great products, and working hard to make sure we're able to cross those with national brands and that type of thing. I didn't quite understand the first part of your question. Could you repeat that? Yeah, so what I would say there is a couple of things. One is, most of the new skews we're adding are going to be third party. We already have access to Zoro through Grainger, Grainger skews. So most of them are going to be third party, not all of those. The other thing I would say is that if you look at - we look very carefully at sort of revenue per skew for different tranches of ads. We continue to see very high productivity and similar revenue per skew as we add items across the assortment at Zoro, and in fact, given the numbers of skews we've added over the last couple of years, if you look at those curves, you will get pretty confident that we're going to see a big lift over time as we continue to add skews given what we are seeing. So we're pretty confident about sort of revenue path and what skew expansion will add for that business. Yeah, I mean we are seeing good activity with both large and local accounts. I would say that for us you're going to see, particularly in the second quarter you're going to see a bigger list with mid-sized and local accounts as a result of holding skews in inventory for hospitals and government agencies in the peak of the pandemic last year. So we turned off skews for a number of our customers to make sure that we can get the product to the most helpful place, and so that's going to be a big factor in what you see. So, we haven't shared probably the full perspective. I think mix is likely to be, if at all slightly positive in the High-Touch business. It's slightly negative from the growth of the Endless Assortment. As a company level we would expect it to not be a huge lever either way, but we do we do feel like the mid-sized customers are likely to grow faster over the next several years. So, I think that will be a slight positive. No, I mean I think our government team does a great job and we have great relationships with government customers. Their comp gets tougher you know in the second quarter for sure, and the third quarter given the pandemic activities. I would say, you know the initial flow last year at the pandemic hospitals were far and away the biggest demand and then government came in after that, but overall we are seeing really nice run rates with our government customers and expect that to continue. Alright, terrific. Thanks for joining us. I really appreciate having you on the call. You know I would just reiterate that with what we've seen as we look through the last 18 months is certainly remarkable for all of us, but if you sort of boil it down, I think what we are likely to see is for us significant share gain over a two year period and I think our economics will be in a better place when we come out of this than when we started going into the pandemic at the end of 2019. We feel like we've got great customer relationships and our team has done a very nice job of providing good service through what has been a challenging time and we feel like we are really in a good place going forward. So, with that I'll close, and I wish you all a fantastic day. Thanks for your time. Have a good day."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nKyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q4 earnings release, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website. This morning's call will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2022 adjusted results, which exclude the gain related to the divestiture of Cromwell's enterprise software business, which was sold in the fourth quarter. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm going to discuss some of our key accomplishments from 2022, and then I'll pass it to Dee to walk through the specifics of our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2023. Turning to Slide 4. The Grainger Edge framework has been instrumental in guiding our work in 2022. We know that when we live our principles, focus on the things that matter and serve our customers well, we can achieve great things. Our customer base is very broad. I've been with customers that are seeing positive economic signs like aerospace, and I've also been with other customers like some retailers that are seeing some concerning economic signs. But in general, our customers continue to be busy, and Grainger has and will remain the trusted partner of providing value to their operations every day. As we look to 2023 and beyond, we are excited to continue living out the Grainger Edge starting with the customer and serving as their valued partner through any cycle. In 2022, the Grainger team stayed relentlessly focused on what matters most, providing our customers exceptional service, supporting each other and making a positive impact on our communities and the environment. In both models, we made strategic investments to support customers and build the business for the future. This included adding supply chain capacity, including a new bulk warehouse in the U.S. and the start-up of the Anegawa distribution center in Japan, expanding our digital and data capabilities, including progress with our customer and product information systems, in our high-touch business and improved account management tools and our endless assortment model, and executing against our merchandising and marketing initiatives, including temp search and recommendation functionality. During the year, we also continued to strengthen our purpose-driven culture by ensuring Grainger is a place where our team members can be their true cells and have a fulfilling career. We continue to receive external recognition for our workplace culture. But what means the most to me and the rest of the leadership team is the positive feedback from team members about why they choose to build their career at Grainger. And finally, we continue to make progress with our environmental, social and governance objectives, both internally and in supporting our customers to help them achieve their own ESG goals. The result of this focus was an outstanding year of profitable growth, and we are extremely proud of our results, which surpassed our own expectations throughout the year. Turning to Slide 6. We finished the year with over $15.2 billion in sales, up 16.5% on a daily basis or 19.3% in daily constant currency as demand across the business remains strong. In our high-touch business in North America, we focused on our growth engines and achieved approximately 775 basis points of U.S. market outgrowth in 2022, far exceeding our updated target of 400 to 500 basis points. In the endless assortment model, both Zoro and MonotaRO made progress to achieve high-teens growth in local currency and local days. During the year, we drove 215 basis points of gross margin improvement, which, when coupled with 40 basis points of SG&A leverage resulted in 255 basis points of operating margin expansion and a nearly 50% increase in adjusted EPS. We also generated over $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 42% over 2021 and returned $949 million to Grainger shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We accomplished this while also improving our ROIC by 870 basis points to 40.6%. The strong 2022 financials were the result of staying focused throughout the year on what truly matters to our customers, our suppliers and our team members, and we are well positioned to continue this momentum into 2023. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to discuss the details of the fourth quarter and our outlook.\nDee Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. Turning to our fourth quarter 2022 results for the total company, it was a solid quarter to finish out this year. And while you'll notice some noise as we walk through the financials, at the end of the day, we delivered great results. Sales growth in the quarter was 13.2% or 17.2% on a daily constant currency basis, which normalizes for the impact of the depreciating yen. Our results this quarter included strong growth in both segments as we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities. This includes approximately 800 basis points of share gain in the U.S. high-touch business and high-teens growth in local currency across endless assortment. Total company gross profit margin in the quarter was 39.6%, expanding 230 basis points over the prior year fourth quarter driven by increases in both segments and including a favorable year-over-year impact from year-end inventory adjustments, which I'll detail in a moment. The strong gross margin performance was partially offset by a decrease in SG&A leverage in the quarter. We continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and also incurred an aggregate $35 million in non-recurring items in the quarter. This includes a one-time bonus to most hourly employees within high touch to recognize their significant contributions towards our 2022 performance. Excluding these one-time non-recurring items, total company SG&A as a percentage of sales would have been roughly flat year-over-year. Despite these non-recurring costs, we still finished the quarter with operating margin up 135 basis points over the prior year period. This profitable growth resulted in diluted EPS of $7.14 for the fourth quarter, representing a 31% increase versus the fourth quarter 2021, another strong quarter of performance. In our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continue to see strong growth with daily sales up 16.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. We saw continued positive growth in all major customer end markets across the segment, including over 20% growth in natural resources, transportation and heavy manufacturing. The daily sales increase in the U.S. of over 17% was fueled by mid-single-digit volume growth and continued strong price realization of over 11% in the quarter. Canadian daily sales were also strong, up 7% or 17.2% in local days in local currency. For the segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 41.9%, achieving 225 basis points of margin expansion. During the quarter, the segment benefited from lower freight costs and continued improvement in product mix. Margin was also favorably impacted by year-end inventory adjustments as we lap the unfavorable LIFO adjustment from the prior year period and also recorded a positive net inventory adjustment in the current year period. The net impact of these inventory adjustments was around 130 basis points for the segment. Price/cost spread in the quarter was also roughly neutral. Moving to SG&A. The segment delevered by about 35 basis points, which was driven by continued investments in marketing and headcount to support growth. In addition, the segment incurred $29 million in non-recurring items in the period, including the one-time bonus payment previously discussed and some accounting true-ups to close the year. While we did modestly delever SG&A, we still expanded operating margins by 190 basis points year-over-year, finishing with a 15.5% operating margin for the segment. This is a strong finish for our High-Touch team. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market, including volume and price inflation, grew between 9% and 10%, implying we outpaced the market by roughly 800 basis points in the quarter. This strong finish helped us deliver 775 basis points of market outgrowth for the full year 2022. We continue to have great success in gaining share as we execute against our strategic growth engines in our High-Touch model. We remain confident in our ability to deliver the 400 to 500 basis points of annual outgrowth going forward and are excited to continue partnering with our customers and our suppliers to drive value for all parties each and every day. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment, reported and daily sales increased 0.9% or 18.2% on a daily constant currency basis after normalizing for the significant impact of the depreciating yen. In local currency and local days, MonotaRO achieved 19.4% growth and Zoro U.S. was up 19.5%. Revenue growth continues to be driven by strong new customer acquisition and repeat business for the segment as well as enterprise customer growth at MonotaRO. Gross margin for this segment expanded 170 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2022 as we saw strong price realization, coupled with continued freight efficiencies as average order values have increased year-over-year. We also benefited from favorable business unit mix as Zoro grew faster than MonotaRO in the quarter. Segment operating margin declined 180 basis points as favorable gross margin was more than offset by heightened SG&A costs. While Zoro's operating margins were roughly flat in the quarter, MonotaRO was impacted by start-up costs at the new Anegawa DC as well as non-recurring asset retirement costs related to the upcoming closure of the Amagasaki facility. As we lap the DC transition costs and ramp a new facility to peak efficiency, we expect profitability will begin trending towards more normal levels as we move through 2023. On Slide 12, we continue to see positive results with our key Endless Assortment operating metrics. Total registered users are tracking nicely with Zoro and MonotaRO combined, up 17% over the prior year. On the right, we show the continued growth of Zoro SKU portfolio, now at over 11 million SKUs. And in 2022, the team successfully delivered on our stated goal to add 2 million SKUs per year over the next several years. In summary, a great job of spending the Endless Assortment flywheel by both Zoro and MonotaRO in 2022. I also want to acknowledge the exciting news that our Zoro U.S. business surpassed $1 billion in annual sales in 2022, the first time they exceeded that threshold in their history. It's been an amazing success story since we launched this business back in 2011, and we remain excited about what Masaya, Kevin and the rest of the Zoro team will accomplish going forward. Moving to our outlook. Despite the economic uncertainty heading into 2023, our high-level earnings algorithm remains intact. Within our High-Touch segment, over the longer-term economic cycle, we target growing 400 to 500 basis points faster than the U.S. MRO market and remain confident in our ability to do so. In our Endless Assortment segment, we expect to continue our track record of strong growth, both in the U.S. and in Japan. At the total company level, we target generally stable gross margin performance over time while sticking to our core pricing tenant, and as we strive to grow SG&A slower than sales to help expand operating margin. Couple this with our balanced and consistent approach to capital allocation, and we can drive attractive returns over the long term as we've done especially well over the last few years. So what does this mean for 2023? At the total company, we expect revenue between $16.2 billion and $16.8 billion, with daily sales growth between 7% and 11%, driven by strong top line performance in both segments. Note that this range is 40 basis points lower on a reported basis when factoring in one less selling day in 2023. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect daily sales growth between 5% and 9.5%. In the U.S., we're planning for MRO market growth between 1% and 5%, comprised of a volume range of flat to down 3% coupled with price inflation between 4% and 5%, largely representing the wrap of 2022 price increases. On top of a 1% to 5% market, we expect to continue executing against our strategic growth engines to achieve 400 to 500 basis points of U.S. market outgrowth in 2023. In the Endless Assortment segment, we anticipate daily sales to grow between 16% and 18% or roughly 17% to 19% in daily constant currency when factoring in 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwind at the segment level from the Japanese yen. Zoro is anticipated to grow within the segment range, reflecting further SKU expansion and a continued focus on acquiring and retaining high-value business customers. MonotaRO is also expected to grow within the segment range and local currency as they continue to grow with both small businesses and large enterprise customers. Moving to our margin expectations. We expect strong performance in both segments with stable to expanding performance in High-Touch Solutions and improving profitability in Endless Assortment. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect gross profit in the year to be flat to slightly down as we anticipate some of the price/cost favorability experienced in 2022 to unwind as we trend back to neutrality over the long term. We expect this headwind will be partially offset by freight favorability given the improvement in container cost and the current outlook for diesel prices. On the SG&A side, we will continue to make incremental investments toward our strategic initiatives as we fuel our growth algorithm. We will also have some tailwinds as we lap the non-recurring items that hit in the fourth quarter and a certain expenses like variable compensation reset in the new year. Overall, in total, we expect SG&A leverage to be favorable, and therefore, when combined with our top line growth expectations, we anticipate operating margin of 16.3% to 16.8% in High-Touch for 2023. In the Endless Assortment segment, we expect MonotaRO's operating margins to improve year-over-year as they continue to benefit from favorable freight efficiencies and strong price realization. At Zoro, we expect operating margins to continue to ramp as they gain leverage on their cost base. Overall, this represents operating margin for the segment between 8.6% and 9%, an improvement of 60 to 100 basis points compared to 2022. Growing this up for total company, we expect to gain SG&A leverage of 30 to 60 basis points to offset a modest decline in gross margin, resulting in operating margin between 14.4% and 14.9% for the full year. Turning now to capital allocation, we expect the business will continue to generate strong cash flow in the year with an expected range of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion, an increase of over $215 million at the midpoint compared to 2022. We expect to use this cash to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. As discussed at our Investor Day in September, we plan to invest in our DC network over the next few years to support strong growth and to maintain industry-leading service levels. With this, we anticipate capital spending in the range of $450 million to $525 million in 2023. This includes DC capacity investments to expand our service advantage in the U.S. as well as the start of a new DC project in Tokyo. We are also continuing to invest in technology to further our customer and product information advantage and we'll continue spending on accretive ESG investment across the portfolio. We expect to continue to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders in line with our historical approach. This will include share repurchases to the tune of $550 million to $700 million and a strong cash dividend, which we've increased consistently for the past 51 years and expect to do so again here in 2023. Summarizing the high-level points on Slide 17, you can see these revenue, profitability and capital allocation expectations translate to adjusted EPS of $32 to $34.50 per share, a 7.9 to 16.3 percentage increase over 2022, and nearly double our pre-pandemic 2019 adjusted EPS of $17.29. We are off to a really strong start in January with preliminary total company daily sales of 16% or around 19% in daily constant currency. We do expect growth rates will be stronger in the first half as results will benefit from a more pronounced price wrap. In the second half, we will face tougher comps and have modeled a slower economic cycle. On profitability, while every year is different, we do expect gross margins will generally follow our traditional seasonal pattern with a high water mark in the first quarter and sequential declines in the second and third quarters. We anticipate SG&A will be reasonably consistent over the course of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I want to first and foremost, thank the Grainger team as well as our customers and supplier partners who have helped to drive such a successful year. We truly kept the world working in 2022 and in turn achieved outstanding results for the year, both financially and operationally. I am excited for what is to come in 2023 and remain confident in Grainger's ability to create tangible value, the liver follows experience to drive profitable growth over the long haul. With our team's continued commitment to focusing on the things that matter, we are well poised to deliver in any macro environment. With that, we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please state your question.\nTommy Moll: I'll ask two, both on High-Touch. Let's start on pricing there. It looks like for 2023, four to five points of growth on price. Dee, I think you heard -- I think I heard you say that most, but maybe not all of that is a wrap, but if you could comment there on the wrap versus any new initiatives? And then also just a related point, are there any areas of pricing pressure? That's something that's been picked up in the marketplace this quarter elsewhere. And I just wonder if you've seen any of that in your business.\nDee Merriwether: So I'll start with the first part and then maybe D.G. can add in a little bit on what he's hearing from -- what he's hearing from some customers on the visit. So, yes, when we look at the market outlook, it includes both price and volume. And so the sum of that, we believe, will be somewhere in the range of 1% to 5% of the total market. We believe that volume will be down 3% to flat. And as you know, at price, up 4% to up 5%, we have more visibility into our pricing than anyone. And so when we look at price, we are also taking into account our wrap, which is basically the price increases that we took in 2022 and their full impact to 2023. So, we still see a little bit more price coming our way. So, it takes that three-ish percent up to about 4% to 5% from for the price outlook.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. Tommy, I would say most of the -- if there's deflationary pressure, it's mostly due to commodities. So there are -- we have -- we've taken prices up and down across the assortment and the ones that are down are almost always very commodity intensive. So they're very steel-intensive or very -- some specific commodity intensive. So, we do see -- we do see that broad market pressure. We don't see that much. It's more specific commodities that we're seeing right now.\nTommy Moll: That's helpful. And then I wanted to follow up on the volume -- the volume outlook for High-Touch flat to down three. And D.G., you mentioned at least one area of strength in aero and one area of relative weakness in retail. But I'm just curious, as you roll it all up into that full year outlook, are there other areas of weakness you're already seeing? Or is it more just potentially some conservatism around the back half? Anything you could provide there would be helpful.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. We're really sticking to what the market projections are at this point. In terms of -- you heard the January results. We aren't seeing a lot of weakness to be fair at this point. We do expect in the back half, there to be more challenges from a volume perspective. What I would say is every customer we have has a COVID-fueled story about what's happened to their volume over the past few years and where they've been determines whether they're facing pressures now or whether they're seeing optimism. So obviously, with aerospace, they -- we shut down the airlines for a long time and they now have orders. So they're starting to build up. And that's going to take a couple more years to actually get the full speed, we think, with aerospace. With some, they may have forward loaded some of their volume because they were selling things that were very important during the pandemic, and now they're faced with situations where things are slowing down. So, I would say every customer has their own story, net-net, that we're not seeing any real softness as of yet, and that's showing in the numbers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Please state your question.\nRyan Merkel: Nice quarter. I wanted to start with a couple of questions on price cost. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more. So last quarter, I think price cost held by 60 basis points. And then in the fourth quarter, it was flat. I'm just curious, why does it move around so much. And then I think you're managing the price cost being neutral. But typically in the past, when there's a lot of inflation, right, your gross margins would expand. I'm curious how you're sort of managing to that price cost neutral.\nDee Merriwether: Well, if you're specifically focused on GP in the U.S., our gross margins have expanded, if you look over a longer period of time here. And as it relates to price cost, just want to reiterate, when we talk about neutrality, we do talk about that over time. And we have continued to speak about the fact that price cost just like GP is lumpy. We have a cost cycle, which we have traditionally had for years that really didn't hold last year because of how fast cost inflation was coming in to suppliers. So that makes the cost piece of that a little bit lumpier. And then if you recall, we have the opportunity based upon our percentage of revenue, highly contracted. We have the right to introduce price at different periods during the time. We also have web price, which is also a good portion of our business, and we can pass price on web at any particular time. So that is the lumpiness. It's the timing of when we can actually price plus the timing of when cost actually comes through. And that's why our focus is doing that over a period of time and when it makes sense, both for our supply base as well as for our customer base.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. That makes sense. And then my follow-up, I think you had 9% price mix in '22. And my question is, is that 9% also included in your definition of the MRO market? And really what I'm getting at is, did Grainger have more price in '22 than the market? And if so, why?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. Maybe I'll cover that. First of all, I think that the way you measure price inflation is probably not common across everybody. So you dive into the details that we don't really know how others are talking about price inflation, so we wouldn't comment on that. I think the thing I would point to is, to Dee's point, we generally think of price as pricing to the market, and we are very confident that what we have now is market competitive, and we look at that very, very, very closely, given our history, you might understand why we would do that. And so we are more wired on how we price competitive. As you said, there's really a lot of lumpiness. We may have taken price later than others or some may have taken earlier who knows. But the reality is that we are very competitive now and feel like we're in a good position on pricing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nDeane Dray: Could we touch on freight for a second? It looked like that rate efficiencies helped you on price cost, if I read that correctly, but it still sounds like there's freight inflation. So where does that stand today?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So our price cost does not include freight the way we define it for you. So freight is a separate issue. Obviously, we consider freight in everything we do. Like everybody, we saw huge freight increases during 2021 and 2022. That has certainly moderated. It's still above 2019 levels fairly substantially, but we have seen that come down quite a bit. So -- and we talked about for this year, we expect it to be a benefit in terms of some of the moderating prices. And some of that is sort of obvious places the containers from overseas or a lot cheaper than they were six months ago, quite a bit. They're still relatively higher than 2019, but getting closer. Other parts of the market are still tight. So net-net, we still feel like it will be a small benefit this year for sure.\nDeane Dray: That's helpful. And then a follow-up on the supply chain. Just where does it stand today in efficiencies? What kind of lead times are you seeing and expectations about returning to normal?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean, it's a great question. So what I would say is that -- from our perspective, once we have the product to -- when customers get it, that part of the supply chain is all good. We were basically clean every night, barring a storm in Dallas or something that we've seen in the last couple of days where people won't pick up. But in general, the supply chain on the outbound side, both in our buildings and then our freight partners is very, very good. On the inbound side, we still have some elongated supply chains. It's gotten much better in the past four or five months, and we expect to continue to get better. At normal, I think I'd probably say in quotes now. I do expect it to get closer to 2019 lead times, but maybe not quite all the way there as the year progresses, but we do expect it to continue to get better.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please go ahead.\nChris Snyder: And congrats on a really great year. Market outgrowth for the U.S. High-Touch business has continued to improve despite presumably better product availability across your smaller competitors. So it seems like the strategic initiatives are certainly taking hold. So I guess my question with that, does this change the way you think about the 400 to 500 basis points of outgrowth? And should we think about price as part of that outgrowth? It sounds like a lot of the questioning seems to suggest that you guys are overpricing the market. But it just feels like with the digital divide we're seeing and the increased importance that brings to customers, I would suspect you guys should be able to outprice the smaller regional competitors who do not offer that.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean I guess I would say just from a core sort of principle for us, we think of outgrowth in terms of volume, we expect price to be relatively neutral. You're right, we make it modest benefits over time that can happen. But certainly, what we're talking about is volume outgrowth. The position from last year, certainly, we got some benefit from supply chain fairly modest. And what we do is we sort of decouple that analytically and look at what our initiatives are doing, and that's how we came up with the 400 to 500 basis point target at the Analyst Day, we're still sticking with that. I mean, obviously, we've done a little better than that. But for now, we're not changing that. That's our expectation going forward.\nChris Snyder: And then for my follow-up, I wanted to talk about the High-Touch favorable mix during the quarter, typically mixed screens as transitory. But on the last call, the Company talked about the mix benefit coming from an increased focus on technical products. And just given the strategic nature of that, it sounds more structural, so just hoping for more color on how to think about mix going forward.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So we have a favorable mix. Mix for us generally means product mix here. And so you can imagine during 2020 and 2021, in particular, we had a very negative mix because we had -- we were selling any mask in the world we could find, we're selling it, and that is a lower margin product. I would say we are more back to normal now in terms of the industrial products that we have typically sold, and that's been a favorable mix for us. And certainly, we are working hard to make sure that we can compete with technical products or industrial products, and that will be a focus for us going forward. But most of the mix benefit has been getting -- really getting back to normal is the way I describe it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jake Levinson with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nJake Levinson: D.G., are you guys still experiencing any kind of labor issues either at the factory level or otherwise? Just thinking about kind of the mix signals we're seeing in the labor market. You still got wage inflation at the lower end and seemingly a lot of competition and warehouses and factories and whatnot, but just curious what -- how that translates for you guys.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. Well, I mean -- so a couple of things. One is we certainly, we had wage labor challenges 18 months ago, a year ago. We have made adjustments in wages for our team members. I would say we are in a much, much better position. Our churn rates are back to normal basically in most parts of the business. And we are in a much more stable staffing pattern than we've been. And I mentioned some of the outbound, our DCs are performing well. Our call centers are performing well. We don't have as much churn -- near as much churn as we did at the peak, and we're really close to back to normal at this point.\nJake Levinson: That's helpful. And just switching gears, I guess, as a consumer when you get a lot of inflation, you see people switching from the premium product to the private label brand. Are you seeing that kind of trend in your business where customers that might want to prefer your Grainger brand over some of the marquee brands, if you will.\nD.G. Macpherson: You know, not. We aren't seeing a big shift there. I would say that most customers, when they're buying industrial products, they need the product for the application they're using it for. And so if our private brand works that we use it and they always have. But generally, we aren't seeing certainly a down shift to lower cost products. That's not what we're seeing right now.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.\nChristopher Glynn: So I think last quarter, another topic that came into the improved mix discussion for HTS was the result of the merchandising initiatives. So drilling into that, is that trend kind of in the input there full throttle now or still ramping up? And is that kind of expected to be a good guide driver for an indefinite number of years?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes, it's the latter, Chris. So we've -- we started this initiative three or four years ago. We've worked through sort of some initial category reviews. We keep getting better at them. What we've discovered is that we've learned a ton as we've gone, and we're just getting better and better at it and there's still a lot of improvement to be made. It will be a consistent benefit for us, we believe, going forward for the foreseeable future, sort of that midterm three- to five-year time frame. We still see a lot of benefit from improving the way we merge. And it's core to what we do. I mean helping customers have confidence that they found the right product, it's kind of what we do. So getting better at that seems to have a good result, and we're going to continue to really push hard on that.\nChristopher Glynn: And to be clear, that's just highlighting higher value-add products within categories for the most part?\nD.G. Macpherson: No. We are -- I would say we are agnostic to what the -- not agnostic to the economics, but agnostic to sort of identifying higher-value products. We're trying to make it super easy for customers to find what they need. And so it's really all about, do we have the right assortment, can we present it in a way that makes it really easy for customers to find so they can have a lot of confidence that they're getting the product that they need to use for the right application.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.\nDavid Manthey: First off, I'm interested in understanding how you capture a LIFO benefit when both inventories and the LIFO reserve are up quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. I just if you could go through the mechanics of that, I'd appreciate it.\nDee Merriwether: Sure, sure, Dave. So I'll go back to last year, you just start with that because there was two things. We're lapping last year's -- it was unfavorable last year, favorably this year adjustment. And if you recall last year, we had a sharp increase in cost, and then we had an outsized amount of inventory kind of get delivered in the fourth quarter. And that combination of those two factors happening at the same time, resulted in us recording a meaningful LIFO adjustment to our fourth quarter adjustments in 2021. Now looking at that and understanding that we were still in an inflationary period as it relates to cost and we saw costs still coming in. From our suppliers, we worked on improving our processes, tightening our processes, making sure that we were booking entries and looking at the process, not just from the financials, but with the chain leaders to ensure our inventory valuation was staying up to par as we move through the year. So I feel like we did a much better job there. However, when you look at the inventory that was sold through in the last quarter of the year, it required us to take a favorable LIFO adjustment to correct for that. Because if something has an increase for those that don't know, something has an increase in the quarter, it haven't sold it or the price change in that quarter from when it changed early in the year, the LIFO adjustment causes you to refactor all of those sales to the latest cost. So that adjustment was favorable for us. The combination of those two year-over-year in Q4 resulted in about 130 basis points, a net 130 basis point year-over-year impact to GP for the High-Touch business.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And the second, the share gains that you've been seeing has clearly been terrific. Could you discuss the balance that you're seeing between new customer adds and selling more to existing customers? I would imagine there's a difference between High-Touch and Endless Assortment. But could you just give us some color on that.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean in High-Touch, so I would just say that in High-Touch that the vast majority of our share gain is the existing customers. The reality is that the Grainger brand sells something to most large and midsized customers' business customers in a year. And so a vast majority of those are -- the share gains we're seeing are actually share of wallet as opposed to new customer acquisitions. In the Endless Assortment, it's more balanced. We're seeing in Japan, we're seeing a mix of new customers, but also significant growth with existing customers. And at Zoro, we're seeing nice retention rates. So we are seeing more balance between new customer acquisition and volume and existing customer volume in the Endless assortment model.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ken Newman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nKen Newman: I think the midpoint of guide implies SG&A leverage of, call it, high teens for 2023 at the midpoint. Just remind me how much of the SG&A spend is fixed versus variable at this point? And should we think about high teens as kind of the right way for SG&A leverage to progress if sales stay at this at or above mid-single-digit growth going forward?\nDee Merriwether: So the -- if you're looking at our guide, the guide is implying 30 to 60 basis points of SG&A leverage for next year. And as I think about that, let's remember a couple of things. We're continuing to invest in demand generation, and we had some one-time costs this year that we don't expect to impact us next year. And I will say the -- one of the last things to consider is going into a new year, we get to reset our variable cost like variable costs such as variable compensation back to a 100% of our plan. And then we have some modest productivity that we built into the plan because we focus our organization on looking at driving standard work automation and productivity every day. So, we don't have to have huge events. We do that in times when things are going really well, and we can scale and also when things are tightening up. So, those are the numbers that I had related to the type of SG&A leverage we're looking to gain. And remember, that's in the midst of us continuing to invest.\nKen Newman: That's helpful. For my follow-up here, it does look like inventories took a decent step up from the third quarter to fourth quarter, which makes sense given the sales guide increase. Can you just provide some color on what's embedded in the operating cash guide for how inventories and working capital trend throughout the year?\nDee Merriwether: Can you repeat that question again?\nD.G. Macpherson: What can happen to have inventory levels next year and working capital next year?\nDee Merriwether: So with that investment, it also includes some investments in DC capacity. So we expect to continue to build inventory as we stand up some of those new buildings. We do expect to see some slight improvement in working capital as far as it is not diminishing as much as it has in the last couple of years because we were investing much more significantly in inventory, say, last year, and we're starting to see some improvement and our accounts receivable execution as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nChris Dankert: I guess looking at the margin guide for analyst assortment, pretty impressive expansion in '23 expected here. How do we think about kind of the long-term path towards that 11% margin guide? I mean does the DC investment in Tokyo, what else should we be thinking about in terms of cost and investments in '24 and beyond maybe as we think about Endless Assortment profitability over time here?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So I mean the two biggest portions of the Endless Assortment are on our Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO. MonotaRO, their profitability in the last year was deflated by operating two buildings at once in the in the Osaka area. That goes away. So they'll see some improvement next year. They will be investing in a building in the Tokyo region in the next several years. But generally, I think the pattern for them will be getting closer back to where they were prior to the dual DC Osaka situation. So, we would expect them to improve over time. And then we talked a lot about Zoro U.S. We expect that to get a kind of high single-digit operating margins over the next several years. And so that combination gets you to sort of that long-term guidance.\nChris Dankert: Okay. And just to put a finer point on that last piece about Tokyo. I mean, will that have a similar impact as the stand of Osaka did in terms of operating two facilities that once whenever that investment comes through?\nDee Merriwether: So, we expect -- so, the Anegawa DC that went up and getting out of Amagasaki in 2023, the first half, they will still be incurring some costs as well as wrapping up to their full efficiency. In the midst of that, they're also launching Phase 2 of the Anegawa DC, which has additional cost -- so our expectation is that they will end the year in 2023 or exit that year with op margin rate similar to what you saw prior to both product.\nD.G. Macpherson: I think Chris was asking a different question, which you were asking about Tokyo, whether it's going to be a similar issue with Tokyo when that comes on board. The answer is who knows. It depends on the pattern of the timing and when things open. It may or may not be as impactful, but we'll comment on that as we get closer to that's three or four years out so.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Pat Baumann with JPMorgan. Please go ahead and state your question.\nPat Baumann: A quick one, I think you're expecting on gross margin for the fourth quarter, like 38% to 34%. Can you just walk from what you were expecting to that 39.6% that you reported kind of like what surprised you? You called out LIFO benefit, but that's like a year-over-year impact. So I'm not sure if that's like the entire bridge to that 39.6%. I know, it's 1/3 year-over-year, but I'm not sure that that's like the difference in kind of where you came in at versus what you expected. So maybe color on that.\nDee Merriwether: Sure. So admittedly, we did end stronger than what we expected as we continue to execute well. And a number of things as you kind of note went our way. So we talked about one of them earlier. We got some tailwind from freight efficiencies with both fuel and container costs coming down over the last couple of months. In addition to that, we did get some price/cost timing benefits as we look to implement some web prices, we implemented some web prices in the quarter ahead of our January price increases, so that helped us a bit. And then if you break away the inventory valuation adjustment this year from what we saw last year that was more something that wasn't anticipated. So that inventory valuation adjustment that we booked in the quarter that was favorable, that was the third piece.\nPat Baumann: Okay. Is it kind of like in that order in terms of like the magnitude of difference?\nDee Merriwether: I would say, if you take all three, it was about 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3 from a value perspective.\nPat Baumann: Great. And then my follow-up is just on -- it's also on gross margin, just to guide for '23. Just wondering what the assumptions are kind of behind that modest contraction for some of these moving parts? Like is it price/cost negative which is offset by freight kind of those wash out and then kind of the decline is like just kind of segment mix related? Or is there anything in there for kind of the inventory adjustment dynamics to think about? Just wondering that year-over-year guide, how to think about the moving parts for that.\nDee Merriwether: No, I think you said it exactly right. I can repeat what you said, but we have some price/cost benefit timing. Some of that may fall away. We may have some freight efficiencies. Those may or may not cover that completely up. And then you've got the business unit mix between Endless Assortment and High-Touch and the fact that Endless Assortment is going to grow faster. So it has a negative impact.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session today. I will now turn the call over to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. Thanks for joining us today. I really appreciate you jumping on the call. Hopefully, you get a sense that we feel pretty good about the path we're on. We've had at a really good year, but we're more excited about the future and driving things to help our customers operate better and help them succeed. So with that, I'll just say thanks for joining again, and hope you stay safe. If you're going to get cold, I think, in the Northeast. So, hopefully, you don't ice up too much. That does affect us too. But have a great rest of the week. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",

            "name": "Dee Merriwether",
            "content": "Thanks, D.G. Turning to our fourth quarter 2022 results for the total company, it was a solid quarter to finish out this year. And while you'll notice some noise as we walk through the financials, at the end of the day, we delivered great results. Sales growth in the quarter was 13.2% or 17.2% on a daily constant currency basis, which normalizes for the impact of the depreciating yen. Our results this quarter included strong growth in both segments as we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities. This includes approximately 800 basis points of share gain in the U.S. high-touch business and high-teens growth in local currency across endless assortment. Total company gross profit margin in the quarter was 39.6%, expanding 230 basis points over the prior year fourth quarter driven by increases in both segments and including a favorable year-over-year impact from year-end inventory adjustments, which I'll detail in a moment. The strong gross margin performance was partially offset by a decrease in SG&A leverage in the quarter. We continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and also incurred an aggregate $35 million in non-recurring items in the quarter. This includes a one-time bonus to most hourly employees within high touch to recognize their significant contributions towards our 2022 performance. Excluding these one-time non-recurring items, total company SG&A as a percentage of sales would have been roughly flat year-over-year. Despite these non-recurring costs, we still finished the quarter with operating margin up 135 basis points over the prior year period. This profitable growth resulted in diluted EPS of $7.14 for the fourth quarter, representing a 31% increase versus the fourth quarter 2021, another strong quarter of performance. In our High-Touch Solutions segment, we continue to see strong growth with daily sales up 16.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. We saw continued positive growth in all major customer end markets across the segment, including over 20% growth in natural resources, transportation and heavy manufacturing. The daily sales increase in the U.S. of over 17% was fueled by mid-single-digit volume growth and continued strong price realization of over 11% in the quarter. Canadian daily sales were also strong, up 7% or 17.2% in local days in local currency. For the segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 41.9%, achieving 225 basis points of margin expansion. During the quarter, the segment benefited from lower freight costs and continued improvement in product mix. Margin was also favorably impacted by year-end inventory adjustments as we lap the unfavorable LIFO adjustment from the prior year period and also recorded a positive net inventory adjustment in the current year period. The net impact of these inventory adjustments was around 130 basis points for the segment. Price/cost spread in the quarter was also roughly neutral. Moving to SG&A. The segment delevered by about 35 basis points, which was driven by continued investments in marketing and headcount to support growth. In addition, the segment incurred $29 million in non-recurring items in the period, including the one-time bonus payment previously discussed and some accounting true-ups to close the year. While we did modestly delever SG&A, we still expanded operating margins by 190 basis points year-over-year, finishing with a 15.5% operating margin for the segment. This is a strong finish for our High-Touch team. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market, including volume and price inflation, grew between 9% and 10%, implying we outpaced the market by roughly 800 basis points in the quarter. This strong finish helped us deliver 775 basis points of market outgrowth for the full year 2022. We continue to have great success in gaining share as we execute against our strategic growth engines in our High-Touch model. We remain confident in our ability to deliver the 400 to 500 basis points of annual outgrowth going forward and are excited to continue partnering with our customers and our suppliers to drive value for all parties each and every day. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment, reported and daily sales increased 0.9% or 18.2% on a daily constant currency basis after normalizing for the significant impact of the depreciating yen. In local currency and local days, MonotaRO achieved 19.4% growth and Zoro U.S. was up 19.5%. Revenue growth continues to be driven by strong new customer acquisition and repeat business for the segment as well as enterprise customer growth at MonotaRO. Gross margin for this segment expanded 170 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2022 as we saw strong price realization, coupled with continued freight efficiencies as average order values have increased year-over-year. We also benefited from favorable business unit mix as Zoro grew faster than MonotaRO in the quarter. Segment operating margin declined 180 basis points as favorable gross margin was more than offset by heightened SG&A costs. While Zoro's operating margins were roughly flat in the quarter, MonotaRO was impacted by start-up costs at the new Anegawa DC as well as non-recurring asset retirement costs related to the upcoming closure of the Amagasaki facility. As we lap the DC transition costs and ramp a new facility to peak efficiency, we expect profitability will begin trending towards more normal levels as we move through 2023. On Slide 12, we continue to see positive results with our key Endless Assortment operating metrics. Total registered users are tracking nicely with Zoro and MonotaRO combined, up 17% over the prior year. On the right, we show the continued growth of Zoro SKU portfolio, now at over 11 million SKUs. And in 2022, the team successfully delivered on our stated goal to add 2 million SKUs per year over the next several years. In summary, a great job of spending the Endless Assortment flywheel by both Zoro and MonotaRO in 2022. I also want to acknowledge the exciting news that our Zoro U.S. business surpassed $1 billion in annual sales in 2022, the first time they exceeded that threshold in their history. It's been an amazing success story since we launched this business back in 2011, and we remain excited about what Masaya, Kevin and the rest of the Zoro team will accomplish going forward. Moving to our outlook. Despite the economic uncertainty heading into 2023, our high-level earnings algorithm remains intact. Within our High-Touch segment, over the longer-term economic cycle, we target growing 400 to 500 basis points faster than the U.S. MRO market and remain confident in our ability to do so. In our Endless Assortment segment, we expect to continue our track record of strong growth, both in the U.S. and in Japan. At the total company level, we target generally stable gross margin performance over time while sticking to our core pricing tenant, and as we strive to grow SG&A slower than sales to help expand operating margin. Couple this with our balanced and consistent approach to capital allocation, and we can drive attractive returns over the long term as we've done especially well over the last few years. So what does this mean for 2023? At the total company, we expect revenue between $16.2 billion and $16.8 billion, with daily sales growth between 7% and 11%, driven by strong top line performance in both segments. Note that this range is 40 basis points lower on a reported basis when factoring in one less selling day in 2023. Within our High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect daily sales growth between 5% and 9.5%. In the U.S., we're planning for MRO market growth between 1% and 5%, comprised of a volume range of flat to down 3% coupled with price inflation between 4% and 5%, largely representing the wrap of 2022 price increases. On top of a 1% to 5% market, we expect to continue executing against our strategic growth engines to achieve 400 to 500 basis points of U.S. market outgrowth in 2023. In the Endless Assortment segment, we anticipate daily sales to grow between 16% and 18% or roughly 17% to 19% in daily constant currency when factoring in 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwind at the segment level from the Japanese yen. Zoro is anticipated to grow within the segment range, reflecting further SKU expansion and a continued focus on acquiring and retaining high-value business customers. MonotaRO is also expected to grow within the segment range and local currency as they continue to grow with both small businesses and large enterprise customers. Moving to our margin expectations. We expect strong performance in both segments with stable to expanding performance in High-Touch Solutions and improving profitability in Endless Assortment. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect gross profit in the year to be flat to slightly down as we anticipate some of the price/cost favorability experienced in 2022 to unwind as we trend back to neutrality over the long term. We expect this headwind will be partially offset by freight favorability given the improvement in container cost and the current outlook for diesel prices. On the SG&A side, we will continue to make incremental investments toward our strategic initiatives as we fuel our growth algorithm. We will also have some tailwinds as we lap the non-recurring items that hit in the fourth quarter and a certain expenses like variable compensation reset in the new year. Overall, in total, we expect SG&A leverage to be favorable, and therefore, when combined with our top line growth expectations, we anticipate operating margin of 16.3% to 16.8% in High-Touch for 2023. In the Endless Assortment segment, we expect MonotaRO's operating margins to improve year-over-year as they continue to benefit from favorable freight efficiencies and strong price realization. At Zoro, we expect operating margins to continue to ramp as they gain leverage on their cost base. Overall, this represents operating margin for the segment between 8.6% and 9%, an improvement of 60 to 100 basis points compared to 2022. Growing this up for total company, we expect to gain SG&A leverage of 30 to 60 basis points to offset a modest decline in gross margin, resulting in operating margin between 14.4% and 14.9% for the full year. Turning now to capital allocation, we expect the business will continue to generate strong cash flow in the year with an expected range of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion, an increase of over $215 million at the midpoint compared to 2022. We expect to use this cash to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. As discussed at our Investor Day in September, we plan to invest in our DC network over the next few years to support strong growth and to maintain industry-leading service levels. With this, we anticipate capital spending in the range of $450 million to $525 million in 2023. This includes DC capacity investments to expand our service advantage in the U.S. as well as the start of a new DC project in Tokyo. We are also continuing to invest in technology to further our customer and product information advantage and we'll continue spending on accretive ESG investment across the portfolio. We expect to continue to return a significant amount of cash to shareholders in line with our historical approach. This will include share repurchases to the tune of $550 million to $700 million and a strong cash dividend, which we've increased consistently for the past 51 years and expect to do so again here in 2023. Summarizing the high-level points on Slide 17, you can see these revenue, profitability and capital allocation expectations translate to adjusted EPS of $32 to $34.50 per share, a 7.9 to 16.3 percentage increase over 2022, and nearly double our pre-pandemic 2019 adjusted EPS of $17.29. We are off to a really strong start in January with preliminary total company daily sales of 16% or around 19% in daily constant currency. We do expect growth rates will be stronger in the first half as results will benefit from a more pronounced price wrap. In the second half, we will face tougher comps and have modeled a slower economic cycle. On profitability, while every year is different, we do expect gross margins will generally follow our traditional seasonal pattern with a high water mark in the first quarter and sequential declines in the second and third quarters. We anticipate SG&A will be reasonably consistent over the course of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks. So I'll start with the first part and then maybe D.G. can add in a little bit on what he's hearing from -- what he's hearing from some customers on the visit. So, yes, when we look at the market outlook, it includes both price and volume. And so the sum of that, we believe, will be somewhere in the range of 1% to 5% of the total market. We believe that volume will be down 3% to flat. And as you know, at price, up 4% to up 5%, we have more visibility into our pricing than anyone. And so when we look at price, we are also taking into account our wrap, which is basically the price increases that we took in 2022 and their full impact to 2023. So, we still see a little bit more price coming our way. So, it takes that three-ish percent up to about 4% to 5% from for the price outlook. Well, if you're specifically focused on GP in the U.S., our gross margins have expanded, if you look over a longer period of time here. And as it relates to price cost, just want to reiterate, when we talk about neutrality, we do talk about that over time. And we have continued to speak about the fact that price cost just like GP is lumpy. We have a cost cycle, which we have traditionally had for years that really didn't hold last year because of how fast cost inflation was coming in to suppliers. So that makes the cost piece of that a little bit lumpier. And then if you recall, we have the opportunity based upon our percentage of revenue, highly contracted. We have the right to introduce price at different periods during the time. We also have web price, which is also a good portion of our business, and we can pass price on web at any particular time. So that is the lumpiness. It's the timing of when we can actually price plus the timing of when cost actually comes through. And that's why our focus is doing that over a period of time and when it makes sense, both for our supply base as well as for our customer base. Sure, sure, Dave. So I'll go back to last year, you just start with that because there was two things. We're lapping last year's -- it was unfavorable last year, favorably this year adjustment. And if you recall last year, we had a sharp increase in cost, and then we had an outsized amount of inventory kind of get delivered in the fourth quarter. And that combination of those two factors happening at the same time, resulted in us recording a meaningful LIFO adjustment to our fourth quarter adjustments in 2021. Now looking at that and understanding that we were still in an inflationary period as it relates to cost and we saw costs still coming in. From our suppliers, we worked on improving our processes, tightening our processes, making sure that we were booking entries and looking at the process, not just from the financials, but with the chain leaders to ensure our inventory valuation was staying up to par as we move through the year. So I feel like we did a much better job there. However, when you look at the inventory that was sold through in the last quarter of the year, it required us to take a favorable LIFO adjustment to correct for that. Because if something has an increase for those that don't know, something has an increase in the quarter, it haven't sold it or the price change in that quarter from when it changed early in the year, the LIFO adjustment causes you to refactor all of those sales to the latest cost. So that adjustment was favorable for us. The combination of those two year-over-year in Q4 resulted in about 130 basis points, a net 130 basis point year-over-year impact to GP for the High-Touch business. So the -- if you're looking at our guide, the guide is implying 30 to 60 basis points of SG&A leverage for next year. And as I think about that, let's remember a couple of things. We're continuing to invest in demand generation, and we had some one-time costs this year that we don't expect to impact us next year. And I will say the -- one of the last things to consider is going into a new year, we get to reset our variable cost like variable costs such as variable compensation back to a 100% of our plan. And then we have some modest productivity that we built into the plan because we focus our organization on looking at driving standard work automation and productivity every day. So, we don't have to have huge events. We do that in times when things are going really well, and we can scale and also when things are tightening up. So, those are the numbers that I had related to the type of SG&A leverage we're looking to gain. And remember, that's in the midst of us continuing to invest. Can you repeat that question again? So with that investment, it also includes some investments in DC capacity. So we expect to continue to build inventory as we stand up some of those new buildings. We do expect to see some slight improvement in working capital as far as it is not diminishing as much as it has in the last couple of years because we were investing much more significantly in inventory, say, last year, and we're starting to see some improvement and our accounts receivable execution as well. So, we expect -- so, the Anegawa DC that went up and getting out of Amagasaki in 2023, the first half, they will still be incurring some costs as well as wrapping up to their full efficiency. In the midst of that, they're also launching Phase 2 of the Anegawa DC, which has additional cost -- so our expectation is that they will end the year in 2023 or exit that year with op margin rate similar to what you saw prior to both product. Sure. So admittedly, we did end stronger than what we expected as we continue to execute well. And a number of things as you kind of note went our way. So we talked about one of them earlier. We got some tailwind from freight efficiencies with both fuel and container costs coming down over the last couple of months. In addition to that, we did get some price/cost timing benefits as we look to implement some web prices, we implemented some web prices in the quarter ahead of our January price increases, so that helped us a bit. And then if you break away the inventory valuation adjustment this year from what we saw last year that was more something that wasn't anticipated. So that inventory valuation adjustment that we booked in the quarter that was favorable, that was the third piece. I would say, if you take all three, it was about 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3 from a value perspective. No, I think you said it exactly right. I can repeat what you said, but we have some price/cost benefit timing. Some of that may fall away. We may have some freight efficiencies. Those may or may not cover that completely up. And then you've got the business unit mix between Endless Assortment and High-Touch and the fact that Endless Assortment is going to grow faster. So it has a negative impact."

            "content": "Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I'm going to discuss some of our key accomplishments from 2022, and then I'll pass it to Dee to walk through the specifics of our fourth quarter performance and our outlook for 2023. Turning to Slide 4. The Grainger Edge framework has been instrumental in guiding our work in 2022. We know that when we live our principles, focus on the things that matter and serve our customers well, we can achieve great things. Our customer base is very broad. I've been with customers that are seeing positive economic signs like aerospace, and I've also been with other customers like some retailers that are seeing some concerning economic signs. But in general, our customers continue to be busy, and Grainger has and will remain the trusted partner of providing value to their operations every day. As we look to 2023 and beyond, we are excited to continue living out the Grainger Edge starting with the customer and serving as their valued partner through any cycle. In 2022, the Grainger team stayed relentlessly focused on what matters most, providing our customers exceptional service, supporting each other and making a positive impact on our communities and the environment. In both models, we made strategic investments to support customers and build the business for the future. This included adding supply chain capacity, including a new bulk warehouse in the U.S. and the start-up of the Anegawa distribution center in Japan, expanding our digital and data capabilities, including progress with our customer and product information systems, in our high-touch business and improved account management tools and our endless assortment model, and executing against our merchandising and marketing initiatives, including temp search and recommendation functionality. During the year, we also continued to strengthen our purpose-driven culture by ensuring Grainger is a place where our team members can be their true cells and have a fulfilling career. We continue to receive external recognition for our workplace culture. But what means the most to me and the rest of the leadership team is the positive feedback from team members about why they choose to build their career at Grainger. And finally, we continue to make progress with our environmental, social and governance objectives, both internally and in supporting our customers to help them achieve their own ESG goals. The result of this focus was an outstanding year of profitable growth, and we are extremely proud of our results, which surpassed our own expectations throughout the year. Turning to Slide 6. We finished the year with over $15.2 billion in sales, up 16.5% on a daily basis or 19.3% in daily constant currency as demand across the business remains strong. In our high-touch business in North America, we focused on our growth engines and achieved approximately 775 basis points of U.S. market outgrowth in 2022, far exceeding our updated target of 400 to 500 basis points. In the endless assortment model, both Zoro and MonotaRO made progress to achieve high-teens growth in local currency and local days. During the year, we drove 215 basis points of gross margin improvement, which, when coupled with 40 basis points of SG&A leverage resulted in 255 basis points of operating margin expansion and a nearly 50% increase in adjusted EPS. We also generated over $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, an increase of 42% over 2021 and returned $949 million to Grainger shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We accomplished this while also improving our ROIC by 870 basis points to 40.6%. The strong 2022 financials were the result of staying focused throughout the year on what truly matters to our customers, our suppliers and our team members, and we are well positioned to continue this momentum into 2023. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to discuss the details of the fourth quarter and our outlook. Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I want to first and foremost, thank the Grainger team as well as our customers and supplier partners who have helped to drive such a successful year. We truly kept the world working in 2022 and in turn achieved outstanding results for the year, both financially and operationally. I am excited for what is to come in 2023 and remain confident in Grainger's ability to create tangible value, the liver follows experience to drive profitable growth over the long haul. With our team's continued commitment to focusing on the things that matter, we are well poised to deliver in any macro environment. With that, we will open up the line for questions. Yes. Tommy, I would say most of the -- if there's deflationary pressure, it's mostly due to commodities. So there are -- we have -- we've taken prices up and down across the assortment and the ones that are down are almost always very commodity intensive. So they're very steel-intensive or very -- some specific commodity intensive. So, we do see -- we do see that broad market pressure. We don't see that much. It's more specific commodities that we're seeing right now. Yes. We're really sticking to what the market projections are at this point. In terms of -- you heard the January results. We aren't seeing a lot of weakness to be fair at this point. We do expect in the back half, there to be more challenges from a volume perspective. What I would say is every customer we have has a COVID-fueled story about what's happened to their volume over the past few years and where they've been determines whether they're facing pressures now or whether they're seeing optimism. So obviously, with aerospace, they -- we shut down the airlines for a long time and they now have orders. So they're starting to build up. And that's going to take a couple more years to actually get the full speed, we think, with aerospace. With some, they may have forward loaded some of their volume because they were selling things that were very important during the pandemic, and now they're faced with situations where things are slowing down. So, I would say every customer has their own story, net-net, that we're not seeing any real softness as of yet, and that's showing in the numbers. Yes. Maybe I'll cover that. First of all, I think that the way you measure price inflation is probably not common across everybody. So you dive into the details that we don't really know how others are talking about price inflation, so we wouldn't comment on that. I think the thing I would point to is, to Dee's point, we generally think of price as pricing to the market, and we are very confident that what we have now is market competitive, and we look at that very, very, very closely, given our history, you might understand why we would do that. And so we are more wired on how we price competitive. As you said, there's really a lot of lumpiness. We may have taken price later than others or some may have taken earlier who knows. But the reality is that we are very competitive now and feel like we're in a good position on pricing. Yes. So our price cost does not include freight the way we define it for you. So freight is a separate issue. Obviously, we consider freight in everything we do. Like everybody, we saw huge freight increases during 2021 and 2022. That has certainly moderated. It's still above 2019 levels fairly substantially, but we have seen that come down quite a bit. So -- and we talked about for this year, we expect it to be a benefit in terms of some of the moderating prices. And some of that is sort of obvious places the containers from overseas or a lot cheaper than they were six months ago, quite a bit. They're still relatively higher than 2019, but getting closer. Other parts of the market are still tight. So net-net, we still feel like it will be a small benefit this year for sure. Yes. I mean, it's a great question. So what I would say is that -- from our perspective, once we have the product to -- when customers get it, that part of the supply chain is all good. We were basically clean every night, barring a storm in Dallas or something that we've seen in the last couple of days where people won't pick up. But in general, the supply chain on the outbound side, both in our buildings and then our freight partners is very, very good. On the inbound side, we still have some elongated supply chains. It's gotten much better in the past four or five months, and we expect to continue to get better. At normal, I think I'd probably say in quotes now. I do expect it to get closer to 2019 lead times, but maybe not quite all the way there as the year progresses, but we do expect it to continue to get better. Yes. I mean I guess I would say just from a core sort of principle for us, we think of outgrowth in terms of volume, we expect price to be relatively neutral. You're right, we make it modest benefits over time that can happen. But certainly, what we're talking about is volume outgrowth. The position from last year, certainly, we got some benefit from supply chain fairly modest. And what we do is we sort of decouple that analytically and look at what our initiatives are doing, and that's how we came up with the 400 to 500 basis point target at the Analyst Day, we're still sticking with that. I mean, obviously, we've done a little better than that. But for now, we're not changing that. That's our expectation going forward. Yes. So we have a favorable mix. Mix for us generally means product mix here. And so you can imagine during 2020 and 2021, in particular, we had a very negative mix because we had -- we were selling any mask in the world we could find, we're selling it, and that is a lower margin product. I would say we are more back to normal now in terms of the industrial products that we have typically sold, and that's been a favorable mix for us. And certainly, we are working hard to make sure that we can compete with technical products or industrial products, and that will be a focus for us going forward. But most of the mix benefit has been getting -- really getting back to normal is the way I describe it. Yes. Well, I mean -- so a couple of things. One is we certainly, we had wage labor challenges 18 months ago, a year ago. We have made adjustments in wages for our team members. I would say we are in a much, much better position. Our churn rates are back to normal basically in most parts of the business. And we are in a much more stable staffing pattern than we've been. And I mentioned some of the outbound, our DCs are performing well. Our call centers are performing well. We don't have as much churn -- near as much churn as we did at the peak, and we're really close to back to normal at this point. You know, not. We aren't seeing a big shift there. I would say that most customers, when they're buying industrial products, they need the product for the application they're using it for. And so if our private brand works that we use it and they always have. But generally, we aren't seeing certainly a down shift to lower cost products. That's not what we're seeing right now. Yes, it's the latter, Chris. So we've -- we started this initiative three or four years ago. We've worked through sort of some initial category reviews. We keep getting better at them. What we've discovered is that we've learned a ton as we've gone, and we're just getting better and better at it and there's still a lot of improvement to be made. It will be a consistent benefit for us, we believe, going forward for the foreseeable future, sort of that midterm three- to five-year time frame. We still see a lot of benefit from improving the way we merge. And it's core to what we do. I mean helping customers have confidence that they found the right product, it's kind of what we do. So getting better at that seems to have a good result, and we're going to continue to really push hard on that. No. We are -- I would say we are agnostic to what the -- not agnostic to the economics, but agnostic to sort of identifying higher-value products. We're trying to make it super easy for customers to find what they need. And so it's really all about, do we have the right assortment, can we present it in a way that makes it really easy for customers to find so they can have a lot of confidence that they're getting the product that they need to use for the right application. Yes. I mean in High-Touch, so I would just say that in High-Touch that the vast majority of our share gain is the existing customers. The reality is that the Grainger brand sells something to most large and midsized customers' business customers in a year. And so a vast majority of those are -- the share gains we're seeing are actually share of wallet as opposed to new customer acquisitions. In the Endless Assortment, it's more balanced. We're seeing in Japan, we're seeing a mix of new customers, but also significant growth with existing customers. And at Zoro, we're seeing nice retention rates. So we are seeing more balance between new customer acquisition and volume and existing customer volume in the Endless assortment model. What can happen to have inventory levels next year and working capital next year? Yes. So I mean the two biggest portions of the Endless Assortment are on our Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO. MonotaRO, their profitability in the last year was deflated by operating two buildings at once in the in the Osaka area. That goes away. So they'll see some improvement next year. They will be investing in a building in the Tokyo region in the next several years. But generally, I think the pattern for them will be getting closer back to where they were prior to the dual DC Osaka situation. So, we would expect them to improve over time. And then we talked a lot about Zoro U.S. We expect that to get a kind of high single-digit operating margins over the next several years. And so that combination gets you to sort of that long-term guidance. I think Chris was asking a different question, which you were asking about Tokyo, whether it's going to be a similar issue with Tokyo when that comes on board. The answer is who knows. It depends on the pattern of the timing and when things open. It may or may not be as impactful, but we'll comment on that as we get closer to that's three or four years out so. Yes. Thanks for joining us today. I really appreciate you jumping on the call. Hopefully, you get a sense that we feel pretty good about the path we're on. We've had at a really good year, but we're more excited about the future and driving things to help our customers operate better and help them succeed. So with that, I'll just say thanks for joining again, and hope you stay safe. If you're going to get cold, I think, in the Northeast. So, hopefully, you don't ice up too much. That does affect us too. But have a great rest of the week. Thank you."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nKyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q3 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning\u2019s call will focus on our third quarter 2022 results, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis for the respective quarterly periods presented. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from US GAAP, and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO\u2019s public statements. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to D.G.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'm going to provide an overview of our third quarter performance and I'll pass it to Dee to walk through the financials. As I typically do, I'd like to start with our Grainger Edge framework, which guides our strategy and behaviors across the company and with our customer and supply partners. One of our Grainger Edge principles is to do the right thing. No word is that commitment more obvious than when we respond to the natural disasters. Grainger's long history of being there for our customers before, during and after a crisis strikes. Last month, Hurricane Ian destroyed parts of the US, most notably in Southwest Florida. Our team spent days, nights, and weekends on the front lines, working long hours to get essential products like generators, sandbags, and tarps to our customers. After the storm passed, our sellers on-site service representatives and branch team members are on the ground making sure we serve our customers, and many of them did this while balancing their own personal recovery efforts. We know the road ahead will not be easy, but the Grainger team will continue to be there to support the community as they recover and rebuild. Before I get into the financial highlights from the quarter, I want to talk a little bit about what I've seen and heard during my market visits with customers. I recently visited an outdoor equipment manufacturer that experienced a surge in demand during the pandemic. As consumers had excess cash and a desire to spend more time outside during COVID, they saw a major uptick in revenue. They're now facing a dip in demand as consumers begin to pull back on spending. I've also visited some of our aerospace customers where it's clear that business activity has picked up, especially in 2022 as COVID impacts have diminished. The industry is now making investments in new airplanes and other equipment to meet ongoing changes in business and leisure travel demands. All told, we continue to experience a dynamic market, with some industry still on the upswing, some that are stabilized, and others that are trending down. And while our customers will face different levels of impact as we navigate through this inflationary period, we know that Grainger wins because of our ability to add tangible value to our customers' operations through inventory management, digital solutions, and product substitutes. This has been true in past economic cycles, and we expect to continue as more and more customers turn to us for solutions, thanks to our relevant product offering, know-how, and advantaged supply chain. Turning now to our results. We performed very well in the third quarter with sales growth of 16.9% or 20.3% on a daily constant currency basis. This normalizes for the impact to the significantly depreciating Japanese yen. Our results this quarter include strong growth in both segments as we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities. We outgrew the US MRO market by 700 basis points in our US High-Touch business and delivered over 23% sales growth in Endless Assortment on a daily constant currency basis. Total company gross profit margin finished the quarter at 38.5%, expanding 145 basis points over the prior year third quarter. Profitability was strong throughout the quarter, was especially strong in the month of September as we benefited from a confluence of factors, including some timing benefits that provided a tailwind to gross margin. Steve will outline the details in a few minutes. Strong gross margin performance, coupled with solid SG&A leverage, helped us achieve 15.3% operating margin, an increase of 230 basis points over the prior year third quarter. We delivered adjusted ROIC of nearly 42%, up over 1,000 basis points compared to the same period last year. We also generated $380 million in operating cash flow and returned $286 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Due to the strong results achieved in the quarter and continued strong trends in October, we are again raising our 2022 full year guidance, starting with the customer and living our Grainger Edge principles is helping us deliver value to all of our stakeholders. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to discuss the details.\nDee Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. As D.G. highlighted, it was another quarter of exceptional results, which are summarized at the total company level on Slide 7. We delivered strong growth and gross margin performance across both segments and also manage our SG&A well, driving 85 basis points of leverage in the quarter as we continue to stay disciplined, while investing to support long-term sustainable growth. This growth in profitability resulted in diluted EPS for the quarter of $8.27, up 46.4% versus third quarter of 2021. Turning now to our High-Touch Solutions segment for the third quarter. We continue to see strong results with daily sales up 19.4% compared to the third quarter of 2021. We saw a broad-based double-digit growth across all geographies and over 20% growth with both midsized and large customers in the US. Daily sales growth in the US of 20% was fueled by broad-based volume growth and strong price realization of over 12% in the quarter. Canadian daily sales were also strong, up 11.4% or 15.5% in local days and local currency. For this segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 40.6%, achieving 125 basis points of margin expansion. The increase is primarily due to product mix as well as favorable price/cost spread, realizing a timing benefit as we continue to work through cost discussions with our suppliers. Price/cost was also aided by some targeted customer and product actions as we work to ensure we are receiving the right economics for the value we provide to customers. These favorable contributors to gross margin were partially offset by heightened freight costs in the quarter. Our pricing team continues to do a really nice job managing through this highly inflationary environment. And while the timing will always be choppy from quarter-to-quarter, we remain focused on our core pricing tenets of achieving price/cost neutrality over time while ensuring our prices remain market competitive. Increased SG&A spend in this segment was driven primarily by higher headcount to support growth and compensation costs as well as continued investments in marketing. Even with the increased investment, we delivered 150 basis points of SG&A leverage year-over-year, and we're combined with the continued gross margin expansion, Q3 operating margin of 17.3% was up 275 basis points versus the prior year. Overall, a very strong quarter for the High-Touch Solutions business. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, we estimate that the US MRO market, including volume and price inflation, grew between 12.5% and 13.5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 700 basis points of market outgrowth in the quarter. As you heard at Investor Day last month, we're having great success gaining share as we execute against our strategic growth engine. Given our recent performance and go-forward expectations, as announced at Investor Day, we are now targeting 400 to 500 basis points of annual outgrowth going forward, a 100 basis point increase from our previous outlook target. The strength of our initiatives, coupled with our supply chain advantage, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver against this commitment. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Reported and daily sales increased 8.6% or up 23.7% on a daily constant currency basis after normalizing for the significant impact of the depreciating Japanese yen, which is down over 23% versus last year. In local currency and local days, MonotaRO achieved 19.8% growth and Zoro US was up 27.4%. Revenue growth continues to be driven by strong new customer acquisition and repeat business for this segment as well as enterprise customer growth at MonotaRO. Gross margin expanded 130 basis points versus the third quarter of 2021 as we continue to see freight efficiencies from increased average order value. We also benefited from favorable business unit mix as Zoro grew faster than MonotaRO in the quarter. Segment operating margin declined 95 basis points in the quarter as favorable gross margins were offset by continued investments to support growth in both businesses as well as DC start-up costs at MonotaRO for the new Inagawa DC. The new facility is ramping nicely. As we exit our legacy facility in the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate that the business will return to normal operating margins thereafter. On Slide 11, we continue to see positive results with our key Endless Assortment operating metrics. Total registered users are tracking nicely with Zoro and MonotaRO combined, up 17% over the prior year period. On the right, we show the continued growth of the Zoro SKU portfolio, now at over 10.3 million SKUs. You'll see a more modest increase between the second and third quarter as Zoro -- is offering of SKUs that could not meet our service level expectations. We continue to target around 2 million SKU additions in 2022 and have a robust pipeline to meet that goal as we finish the year. Turning to guidance. With another very strong quarter and with sales in October trending up over 16% on a daily reported basis or over 21% in constant currency, we are raising our 2022 full year outlook. While we acknowledge that the broader market conditions remain uncertain and the risk of a potential recession has certainly increased, we have not seen any meaningful slowdown in our business and continue to outperform our normal seasonal trends. Our updated outlook for the full year 2022 includes: expected daily sales growth between 15.5% and 16.5% and EPS between $29.10 and $29. 70, a 48% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. This implies Q4 daily sales, which normally slowed due to seasonality, will grow roughly 9% to 13% as we face into difficult comps over the fourth quarter 2021, especially in November and December. We also continue to see further FX headwinds from the depreciation of the Japanese yen. We've included updates to our supplemental guidance as well, which can be found in the appendix. While it is not our typical practice to change guidance each quarter, doing so provides our most up-to-date expectations in light of the current economic environment. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I would make just a few comments. While this quarter brought more market fluctuation and potential uncertainty broadly, both our market and our performance was strong. I remain confident in Grainger's ability to create tangible value, deliver flawless experience, and gain share profitably over the long haul. We are grateful for our customers' continued confidence in Grainger. No matter what comes next, we will remain a trusted resource ready to help them navigate any cycle. I would also like to thank the Grainger team for all they've done and continue to do to support our customers. With our team's continued commitment to focusing on the things that matter, we are well poised to deliver a very strong finish to the year. And with that, we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, we'll conduct our question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please state your question.\nTommy Moll: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nDee Merriwether: Good morning.\nTommy Moll: Dee, I wanted to circle back to your comments on High-Touch profit in the third quarter. You called out price/cost was a tailwind in the period, and there were some timing impacts, I think, related to discussions with suppliers, but if you could elaborate on what you were referencing there around the timing and whether that implies that it may look different next quarter or at some point in the future, that'd be helpful. Thank you.\nDee Merriwether: Thanks for the question, Tommy. So yes, we did perform well in the quarter, both top and bottom line and specifically related to the gross margin expectations. We did experience significant product mix tailwinds as well as favorable price/cost spread. And I did note that, that was due to a couple of factors: price/cost being favorably as we realize the timing benefit that we -- as we continue to work through cost negotiations with our suppliers, we do expect that benefit to normalize over the next couple of quarters. And so that really aided in some of the outperformance. In addition to that, from time to time and good hygiene, we continue to work with customers to make sure that we are receiving the value that we provide to them from an economic perspective. And so we also received some benefits in the quarter for that. We also expect that to continue.\nTommy Moll: That's helpful. Thank you, Dee. Shifting gears to capital allocation. If I'm looking at your guidance for this year correctly, I think in terms of operating cash flow, there's no update to your prior guidance, but it looks like CapEx and share repurchases have been pulled in a little bit. So I'm curious for any commentary you can give there. And then also as you think about CapEx for next year and some of the capacity expansion initiatives you talked about at Investor Day, if there's any early peak you can give us about priorities for 2023, that'd be helpful as well. Thank you.\nDee Merriwether: Sure. Yes, that is correct. We did -- based upon the range we had out there for operating cash flow less that as is. And just based upon where we were trending with share repurchases as well as we looked at what we thought will fall through CapEx by the end of the year, we made some tweaks in those numbers as well since we have the opportunity to do so. As it relates to 2025, we'll talk a little bit more about what we expect CapEx to look like in February.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Good morning. At the Investor Day, you discussed seller coverage and seller effectiveness as two of your strategic growth engines. I'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory there. How many outside sellers do you have today versus what you had last year? And what is the plan for 2023?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. Sure. So thanks, Dave. We have -- we talked at Investor Day, based on our improved customer information, we have been able to identify a potential to add some sellers. We've added them relatively small percentages overall to a couple of pilot areas that we're running now, and we expect to have results of that early in the year, and that will inform what we do going forward. We do think we're going to have the ability to consistently add sellers and also improve the effectiveness of sellers based on the information we've now built and have on customers. And so that's a pretty exciting path. We won't have details for you in terms of what that looks like in the aggregate probably until second quarter next year when we start to hear -- get all the results back from the pilots.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. So TBD. And then as a follow-up, could you tell us specifically when the MonotaRO occupancy expenses that are duplicate today drop off and approximately what the magnitude of that overage is right now?\nD.G. Macpherson: Sure. I was over there--\nDee Merriwether: Yes.\nD.G. Macpherson: I was over there four weeks ago. I'll let Dee answer the sort of exact timing. But just to give you sort of a magnitude, they're operating two buildings in the Osaka area. The new ones, a six-story enormous building that is coming up to speed and getting up to the line volumes to take over entirely, and they expect that to happen mostly by the end of the year. The other one has been running at the same time. So, that's a duplicate cost. And Dee, I'll turn it over to you for the numbers.\nDee Merriwether: Yes. So just to add on what D.G. says, we expect the duplicative cost to drop off after Q1 of 2023.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning folks.\nDee Merriwether: Good morning.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: I just wanted to focus in a little bit more on the outgrowth. I mean I think we've sort of transitioned here from a period of time with kind of more hyper-inflation and a little bit more scarcity supply chain-wise to what sounds like it's sort of an improving supply chain environment today just based on what some of your peers and broader industrial cohort have said. Any sort of change in the way customers or competitors are sort of interacting with the marketplace? Clearly, the background circumstances are changing. Just wondering if their needs or their priorities are changing as well?\nD.G. Macpherson: I think that there's been a fairly significant increased attention to supply assuredness given what's happened in the last few years. And supply chain is improving. They've improved. They aren't fully back, but they are improving for sure, hasn't really changed those discussions. Customers still want to understand how they can make sure that they have what they need to get their jobs done. Obviously, we've always done that through different ways, whether having inventory in a branch or managing inventory on site or having next day delivery, all those things help customers. but we're still having a lot of conversations with customers about -- based on our ability to serve them during these challenging times, how can we continue to help them. And we think a lot of the performance we've had in our supply chain is going to be pretty sticky moving forward based on what we're hearing.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it, that's helpful. And then, Dee, just a follow-up question for you on the margin tailwinds and those kind of, I'll call it, extra conversations you're having with your suppliers about that economic value, which -- it sort of sounds like a different way of saying rebate. Maybe I'm mischaracterizing it, but is that something that's on more of an annual cycle where that normalizes when the calendar flips, or what's the time line that we should think about there?\nDee Merriwether: Yes, I wouldn't think about it so much as rebates, but just we're constantly negotiating on price take timing with our supplier partners. And some of that timing, some has moved up, some has slipped out. And that's why we continually and talk about the lumpiness of GP because it's very difficult to time everything perfectly both from a price perspective and a cost actualization perspective. So, it's nothing more than that. It isn't. We really aren't focused on supplier rebates as a reason for this.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And nice quarter. I'll leave it there.\nDee Merriwether: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jake Levinson with Melius Research. Please state your question.\nJake Levinson: Good morning, everyone.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nJake Levinson: D.G., if we did a postmortem, if you will, on the pandemic period over the last couple of years, do you have a sense of how many of these new customers that you picked up during COVID are still buying from you, or maybe just any color you have on kind of the retention rates?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. Sure. So it's inherently tricky thing to figure out. What I would say is that our customer file has increased substantially versus 2019. So a lot of the new customers have stuck around. Our customer file was at its peak in the heart of the pandemic in 2020, both for Grainger and for Zoro and for MonotaRO. They all had sort of a similar pattern. And what was going on there was there was a lot of consumers buying and just trying to find whatever they could find for safety reasons. That's all gone back to normal. And so we think that what we see now is all of the business customers that we were able to acquire during the pandemic, either for pandemic reasons or other reasons. And we've had really healthy growth of the customer file. And I think that's probably the biggest signal that make -- that matters the most.\nJake Levinson: Okay. That's helpful. And just shifting gears on price. Are your suppliers -- I mean, certainly, you're still seeing price increases for you folks, well after that on a year-over-year basis. Are your suppliers still putting through broad-based increases, or is what we're seeing in the P&L today mostly just reflecting what's already been actioned?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So -- and Dee, you may have other adds to this. We continue to see through our cost cycle this year increases from a number of suppliers. I would say it's less intense now than it was certainly in the first half of the year. But most -- and what you're going to see in terms of price increase, a lot of it is sort of what's already been taken before. And so you're just seeing the impact of that. But we do expect some increases to continue to flow in as things continue to roll forward, but just not as intense.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I want to touch back on price realization. And D.G., can you give us a sense of how much of your price now is being driven by what you would call the value-based pricing as opposed to standard markup?\nD.G. Macpherson: Deane, what do you -- what are you trying to understand? Go ahead. Go ahead, Dee. You can take that one.\nDee Merriwether: Yes. Deane, I want to -- first, I want to clarify, I want to make sure I understand the question. So do you want to add a little bit more color? Is there a question...\nDeane Dray: It's more of a holistic question, but just give us a sense on pricing traditionally, historically with distributors was much more of a standard markup. And what you've seen is with the advent of more services being added and then understanding exactly the kind of value that Grainger is providing, you're actually able to gain more pricing and, under this umbrella, value-based pricing and wanted to get a sense of where you are in that transition. Do you feel like you've done as much as you can? Are you halfway through? Just any color there would be helpful.\nDee Merriwether: Sure. Well, I would say I think if you go back several years to the pricing strategy change to ensure that we could provide competitive pricing to all size customers, we're through that cycle. Now, we're in more of a cycle, I would say, with higher sophistication related to using our own internal information, product information and coupling that with market information to get to the best price for customers. And if it's High-Touch business, as you kind of articulated, it is making sure we get to the best price based upon the value we provide to those customers. And if it's like a midsized customer that has less -- with less services from us, price is relevant for them as well. So, I will say we are there. However, we always have opportunities with the broad assortment that we have, over 1.7 million SKUs, 2 million SKUs. Things are constantly changing. The market is changing. Costs are changing. And market price is changing. So, I will say our pricing sophistication continues to get better. From time to time, that leads to us being able to have some pricing levers in our benefit while we still remain competitive.\nDeane Dray: Okay, that's helpful. And then, look, supply chain has come up a number of times. How would you characterize it in terms of product availability, lead-time, stock outs? And just also, if you could weave in if that's been the same for your private label offerings.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So, what I would say is that certainly, portions of the supply chain, I would say, are pretty much back to normal. But the portions that we control being able to pick back and shipping at things out were clean pretty much every night. A year ago, we had labor challenges and all kinds of challenges. Those have pretty much gone away in terms of our own supply chain. And then the outbound transportation is also pretty strong at this point and less of a problem. From a supplier standpoint, there's still suppliers that are catching up to challenge that they've had. And so lead-times are elongated in some cases. What I would say is that our service levels in terms of having product and being able to get to customers are high on a relative basis and getting back -- moving back towards what we'd expect to have from an absolute basis. So, we do see a lot of improvement. There's still long ways to go. I mean this is -- that was -- it's been quite a shock to the supply chain, and there's still long ways to go from our suppliers and from transportation entities. Coming from -- I think your question on global sourced product, certainly, we're seeing it become much easier to get sailings from Asia into the US, and the cost of that is coming down substantially from its peak, maybe back to where it was, but certainly coming down. And so we do see that starting to flow much better than it had earlier in the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.\nRyan Merkel: Hey everyone. I had a follow-up on gross margin. Can you help quantify the price/cost timing benefit in 3Q and just speak to sustainability into 4Q?\nDee Merriwether: Sure. Well, if you look at -- maybe if I take it to the over in the US, gross margin was up like in the 125 basis points. About half of that, I would call it the price costs of benefit and again, we see that price costs benefit normalizing as we get into 2023 or during the fourth quarter.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then I had a follow-up on price. Really, I'm trying to get at how much price is going to carry over into 2023 just based on what you've passed through so far. And when do you lap sort of the bigger price increases that you took in 2022?\nDee Merriwether: Well, let me start 2021. Like when you look at this quarter here, it's going to be -- especially November and December, we'll be lapping 2021. That's our first, I would say, significant price inflation period. So that's why it's going to be a little bit tougher comps for us, we believe, the last two months of this year. Our rep for price, we're thinking it will be in the single -- mid-single-digits, low to mid-single-digits will -- looks like what the rent will be heading into 2023.\nRyan Merkel: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please state your question.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. So in the past, the company has spoken to an ability to hold North American High-Touch gross margins. So does the fact that 2022 is running a bit hotter than expected change that at all? Should we expect maybe some slight easing or normalization lower in 2023?\nDee Merriwether: Yes.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. Maybe let's just talk about philosophy here, and Dee, if you want to add to it again. I think that we -- as Dee mentioned, there have been some tailwinds that are probably modest and might come back -- drop down a little bit. I think the overall algorithm hasn't changed at all. There's been a lot of messiness the last two years. Obviously, we had deflated GP given all the pandemic product and challenges with that, which was all the right things, and right things to do to serve our customers. And now you're seeing sort of the normal GP with probably a little bit of tailwinds that may bleed off. But the algorithm is still the same. We're going to -- our plan is to grow faster than the market in the High-Touch model, 400 to 500 basis points, to have consistent GP and slight SG&A leverage as we go forward. And that's the algorithm and the algorithm for the High-Touch DNS server models exactly the same as well.\nChris Snyder: Appreciate that. Thanks for all that color. And then my follow-up on that outgrowth in the US. So obviously, the company raised the target to 400 to 500 bps, and it's really substantially above kind of the pre-COVID run rate for the business. But I guess my question is, year-to-date, the outgrowth is running in the 700 or so bp range. When we think about that compression from, say, 700 down to 400 or 500, what does that reflect? Is it just maybe some level of conservatism? Is it the fact that maybe 2022 is seeing outsized pricing versus the market, or that some -- maybe some of the product availability share gains that the company has realized is going away? What's that kind of delta, that compression back? Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean it's a great question. So I think we mentioned this at Investor Day, but just to put maybe a finer point on it. When we look at what we get from a share gain perspective, we're looking at cause and effect for the actions that we take. This year is higher, obviously, than our target. And we've actually been able to determine that we think some of that might be availability-related just having product when others didn't. And some of that becomes sticky, as we've mentioned before. But when we look at the 400 to 500 basis points, that's looking at the actions and seller coverage, seller effectiveness and keep stock to drive share gain, and that's where that number comes from. So, we've had a little bit of benefit, we think, this year that's due just to having a better execution around the supply chain than maybe others have had.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Good morning. So, D.G., building off the immediately prior question for Chris, I want to kind of bridge that to the medium customer discretely. The large customer is obviously a bigger revenue base, but you have lower share there. You're doing 20% on 20%, and a lot of your capabilities do seem to be ramping as you've hit on some nice algorithms. And you have a long-term CAGR for the Endless Assortment. Should we start to think about medium customer along those lines? Can you hold the 20% with that lower share demographic?\nD.G. Macpherson: What I would say is that we think we can grow midsize customers faster than large customers through the cycle. A lot of that has to do with the lower share we have, but also some of the actions we're taking are allowing us to acquire and penetrate midsized customers. Whether that's 20% or not, I won't comment on that. But I'll just -- if you recall, we were in the high 1.5 billion -- 1.8 billion number 10, 15 years ago, and we're going to break through 1.5 billion here in the next year or so, we think. And so we're getting back to where we were, but there's still long ways to go. So, we do feel comfortable that there's going to be faster outgrowth of midsized customers than there are for.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And then just to revisit the gross margin algorithm. You had the 37% target in 2025 that was based on a 30% -- or a 30 basis point kind of tiny mix impact over the interim based on kind of a 37.3% this year. Should we just shift that algorithm thinking about the multiyear target?\nDee Merriwether: Are you talking about the GP mix effect?\nChristopher Glynn: Yes. Using the minus 30 basis points as the driving force, and maybe you want to shift my thoughts relative to that.\nDee Merriwether: Not necessarily. I think the only thing that's probably changed on a consolidated basis is the yen continues to depreciate, but that's going to impact on the topline. The GP rate should be the same algorithm that we've discussed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please state your question. Patrick Baumann, your line is open. Please state your question, unmute yourself.\nPatrick Baumann: Can you hear me?\nOperator: Yes. We got you.\nPatrick Baumann: Sorry about that. So, you mentioned product mix as a favorable factor in the quarter year-over-year. Can you elaborate on that at all? I thought we'd move past kind of the pandemic versus non-pandemic stuff. So I'm just wondering what that might be now related to.\nDee Merriwether: That is true, but don't forget that the pandemic stuff that was also safety equipment, which is a significant piece of our business, and we continue to sell more safety. But the other piece is that we're also selling a whole lot more technical products. And technical product, that's also a product mix for us. And generally, those SKUs have a little bit better margin rate for us.\nPatrick Baumann: I'm sorry. What are some examples of that, technical product? What is that?\nDee Merriwether: Material [ph] handling products, things that are more technical, help in manufacturing processes, pieces and parts as it relates to assembly lines and things like that are the more technical product. When we say safety product, I think a lot of people think about vest and gloves and things of that nature. So these are more products that are utilized or adjacent to manufacturing.\nPatrick Baumann: Do you view that piece of the expansion that you're seeing as more sustainable? Like is that a function of like maybe some of your remerchandising efforts or anything else, or is that temporary?\nDee Merriwether: Absolutely. You hit it on the head. Our remerchandising efforts are making sure that those products are much easier for our customers to find and are helping them solve their business problems.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay. Thanks. And my follow-up is on Zoro. Can you give a sense of how fast you think that market for Endless Assortment, that, that business model is growing in the US? The Zoro growth in kind of the 27% range this quarter, obviously very strong. Just curious like how you think that market itself is growing. It's obviously taking share from, like, I think, traditional distribution. But I don't really have a good sense of how fast it's growing.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean we don't -- we think that market is growing similar to what the whole market is growing, which would be sort of low double-digits, 10% to 13% in the quarter is kind of the market growth that we saw.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I'm guessing the mix of -- heat manufacturing has grown high 20s. Light manufacturing, mid-20s. Commercial, up low 20s. Government, up mid-teens. I'm guessing that -- you talk about technical products and payable mix. I'm guessing that's what comes down to. But I do want to go back to the -- this kind of mix or temporary kind of gross margin benefit. Did you say 25 bps, Dee? Did I get that right?\nDee Merriwether: No. What were you -- you're talking about how much the price/cost one versus...\nNigel Coe: Yes. That's just the temporary supplier negotiation benefit.\nDee Merriwether: Yes. Well, I noted was the US over make year-over-year was about 125 basis points, and I said about half of that -- roughly half of that, so call it, 50 basis points \u2013 50 so basis points is what we're saying is the price/ cost favorability that we believe will normalize heading into...\nNigel Coe: 50 basis points. Okay. So about $20 million. Okay. Got it. That makes a lot more sense. And then just thinking about your sort of APAC supply chain, we're seeing some big movements in currencies, the change yuan. So, to the extent that you still manufacture -- sorry, source white label products from China, given the move in the yuan, given the move in ocean freight rates, what kind of benefit do you realize, or does that benefit get fully captured by your suppliers?\nD.G. Macpherson: So what I would say is that as we think about next year, as we think about any year, we try to think about the total cost we're going to see and the -- make sure we're pricing the market and get the best cost we can get. In many ways, those cost improvements will be embedded in price/cost because we will understand how those movements, and everybody else is going to have similar movements. The portion of product that comes from China is actually pretty similar across major competitors today. And so we don't think we are disadvantaged or advantaged necessarily on that. So we would expect that to sort of flow through in sort of normal ways from the competitive environment.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: All right. Thanks for joining us today. We really appreciate you being on the call. As we said, we're certainly happy with the quarter, probably happier with sort of our longer-term ability to consistently gain share and do it in a profitable way and feel really good about the things we're doing in -- as we face into an uncertain market. I hope all of you have a great weekend and a great rest of the year and look forward to talking to you in 2023. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",

            "name": "Dee Merriwether",
            "content": "Thanks, D.G. As D.G. highlighted, it was another quarter of exceptional results, which are summarized at the total company level on Slide 7. We delivered strong growth and gross margin performance across both segments and also manage our SG&A well, driving 85 basis points of leverage in the quarter as we continue to stay disciplined, while investing to support long-term sustainable growth. This growth in profitability resulted in diluted EPS for the quarter of $8.27, up 46.4% versus third quarter of 2021. Turning now to our High-Touch Solutions segment for the third quarter. We continue to see strong results with daily sales up 19.4% compared to the third quarter of 2021. We saw a broad-based double-digit growth across all geographies and over 20% growth with both midsized and large customers in the US. Daily sales growth in the US of 20% was fueled by broad-based volume growth and strong price realization of over 12% in the quarter. Canadian daily sales were also strong, up 11.4% or 15.5% in local days and local currency. For this segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 40.6%, achieving 125 basis points of margin expansion. The increase is primarily due to product mix as well as favorable price/cost spread, realizing a timing benefit as we continue to work through cost discussions with our suppliers. Price/cost was also aided by some targeted customer and product actions as we work to ensure we are receiving the right economics for the value we provide to customers. These favorable contributors to gross margin were partially offset by heightened freight costs in the quarter. Our pricing team continues to do a really nice job managing through this highly inflationary environment. And while the timing will always be choppy from quarter-to-quarter, we remain focused on our core pricing tenets of achieving price/cost neutrality over time while ensuring our prices remain market competitive. Increased SG&A spend in this segment was driven primarily by higher headcount to support growth and compensation costs as well as continued investments in marketing. Even with the increased investment, we delivered 150 basis points of SG&A leverage year-over-year, and we're combined with the continued gross margin expansion, Q3 operating margin of 17.3% was up 275 basis points versus the prior year. Overall, a very strong quarter for the High-Touch Solutions business. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, we estimate that the US MRO market, including volume and price inflation, grew between 12.5% and 13.5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 700 basis points of market outgrowth in the quarter. As you heard at Investor Day last month, we're having great success gaining share as we execute against our strategic growth engine. Given our recent performance and go-forward expectations, as announced at Investor Day, we are now targeting 400 to 500 basis points of annual outgrowth going forward, a 100 basis point increase from our previous outlook target. The strength of our initiatives, coupled with our supply chain advantage, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver against this commitment. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Reported and daily sales increased 8.6% or up 23.7% on a daily constant currency basis after normalizing for the significant impact of the depreciating Japanese yen, which is down over 23% versus last year. In local currency and local days, MonotaRO achieved 19.8% growth and Zoro US was up 27.4%. Revenue growth continues to be driven by strong new customer acquisition and repeat business for this segment as well as enterprise customer growth at MonotaRO. Gross margin expanded 130 basis points versus the third quarter of 2021 as we continue to see freight efficiencies from increased average order value. We also benefited from favorable business unit mix as Zoro grew faster than MonotaRO in the quarter. Segment operating margin declined 95 basis points in the quarter as favorable gross margins were offset by continued investments to support growth in both businesses as well as DC start-up costs at MonotaRO for the new Inagawa DC. The new facility is ramping nicely. As we exit our legacy facility in the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate that the business will return to normal operating margins thereafter. On Slide 11, we continue to see positive results with our key Endless Assortment operating metrics. Total registered users are tracking nicely with Zoro and MonotaRO combined, up 17% over the prior year period. On the right, we show the continued growth of the Zoro SKU portfolio, now at over 10.3 million SKUs. You'll see a more modest increase between the second and third quarter as Zoro -- is offering of SKUs that could not meet our service level expectations. We continue to target around 2 million SKU additions in 2022 and have a robust pipeline to meet that goal as we finish the year. Turning to guidance. With another very strong quarter and with sales in October trending up over 16% on a daily reported basis or over 21% in constant currency, we are raising our 2022 full year outlook. While we acknowledge that the broader market conditions remain uncertain and the risk of a potential recession has certainly increased, we have not seen any meaningful slowdown in our business and continue to outperform our normal seasonal trends. Our updated outlook for the full year 2022 includes: expected daily sales growth between 15.5% and 16.5% and EPS between $29.10 and $29. 70, a 48% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. This implies Q4 daily sales, which normally slowed due to seasonality, will grow roughly 9% to 13% as we face into difficult comps over the fourth quarter 2021, especially in November and December. We also continue to see further FX headwinds from the depreciation of the Japanese yen. We've included updates to our supplemental guidance as well, which can be found in the appendix. While it is not our typical practice to change guidance each quarter, doing so provides our most up-to-date expectations in light of the current economic environment. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks. Good morning. Thanks for the question, Tommy. So yes, we did perform well in the quarter, both top and bottom line and specifically related to the gross margin expectations. We did experience significant product mix tailwinds as well as favorable price/cost spread. And I did note that, that was due to a couple of factors: price/cost being favorably as we realize the timing benefit that we -- as we continue to work through cost negotiations with our suppliers, we do expect that benefit to normalize over the next couple of quarters. And so that really aided in some of the outperformance. In addition to that, from time to time and good hygiene, we continue to work with customers to make sure that we are receiving the value that we provide to them from an economic perspective. And so we also received some benefits in the quarter for that. We also expect that to continue. Sure. Yes, that is correct. We did -- based upon the range we had out there for operating cash flow less that as is. And just based upon where we were trending with share repurchases as well as we looked at what we thought will fall through CapEx by the end of the year, we made some tweaks in those numbers as well since we have the opportunity to do so. As it relates to 2025, we'll talk a little bit more about what we expect CapEx to look like in February. Yes. Yes. So just to add on what D.G. says, we expect the duplicative cost to drop off after Q1 of 2023. Good morning. Yes, I wouldn't think about it so much as rebates, but just we're constantly negotiating on price take timing with our supplier partners. And some of that timing, some has moved up, some has slipped out. And that's why we continually and talk about the lumpiness of GP because it's very difficult to time everything perfectly both from a price perspective and a cost actualization perspective. So, it's nothing more than that. It isn't. We really aren't focused on supplier rebates as a reason for this. Thank you. Yes. Deane, I want to -- first, I want to clarify, I want to make sure I understand the question. So do you want to add a little bit more color? Is there a question... Sure. Well, I would say I think if you go back several years to the pricing strategy change to ensure that we could provide competitive pricing to all size customers, we're through that cycle. Now, we're in more of a cycle, I would say, with higher sophistication related to using our own internal information, product information and coupling that with market information to get to the best price for customers. And if it's High-Touch business, as you kind of articulated, it is making sure we get to the best price based upon the value we provide to those customers. And if it's like a midsized customer that has less -- with less services from us, price is relevant for them as well. So, I will say we are there. However, we always have opportunities with the broad assortment that we have, over 1.7 million SKUs, 2 million SKUs. Things are constantly changing. The market is changing. Costs are changing. And market price is changing. So, I will say our pricing sophistication continues to get better. From time to time, that leads to us being able to have some pricing levers in our benefit while we still remain competitive. Sure. Well, if you look at -- maybe if I take it to the over in the US, gross margin was up like in the 125 basis points. About half of that, I would call it the price costs of benefit and again, we see that price costs benefit normalizing as we get into 2023 or during the fourth quarter. Well, let me start 2021. Like when you look at this quarter here, it's going to be -- especially November and December, we'll be lapping 2021. That's our first, I would say, significant price inflation period. So that's why it's going to be a little bit tougher comps for us, we believe, the last two months of this year. Our rep for price, we're thinking it will be in the single -- mid-single-digits, low to mid-single-digits will -- looks like what the rent will be heading into 2023. Yes. Are you talking about the GP mix effect? Not necessarily. I think the only thing that's probably changed on a consolidated basis is the yen continues to depreciate, but that's going to impact on the topline. The GP rate should be the same algorithm that we've discussed. That is true, but don't forget that the pandemic stuff that was also safety equipment, which is a significant piece of our business, and we continue to sell more safety. But the other piece is that we're also selling a whole lot more technical products. And technical product, that's also a product mix for us.

No. What were you -- you're talking about how much the price/cost one versus... Yes. Well, I noted was the US over make year-over-year was about 125 basis points, and I said about half of that -- roughly half of that, so call it, 50 basis points \u2013 50 so basis points is what we're saying is the price/ cost favorability that we believe will normalize heading into..."

            "content": "Thanks, Kyle. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'm going to provide an overview of our third quarter performance and I'll pass it to Dee to walk through the financials. As I typically do, I'd like to start with our Grainger Edge framework, which guides our strategy and behaviors across the company and with our customer and supply partners. One of our Grainger Edge principles is to do the right thing. No word is that commitment more obvious than when we respond to the natural disasters. Grainger's long history of being there for our customers before, during and after a crisis strikes. Last month, Hurricane Ian destroyed parts of the US, most notably in Southwest Florida. Our team spent days, nights, and weekends on the front lines, working long hours to get essential products like generators, sandbags, and tarps to our customers. After the storm passed, our sellers on-site service representatives and branch team members are on the ground making sure we serve our customers, and many of them did this while balancing their own personal recovery efforts. We know the road ahead will not be easy, but the Grainger team will continue to be there to support the community as they recover and rebuild. Before I get into the financial highlights from the quarter, I want to talk a little bit about what I've seen and heard during my market visits with customers. I recently visited an outdoor equipment manufacturer that experienced a surge in demand during the pandemic. As consumers had excess cash and a desire to spend more time outside during COVID, they saw a major uptick in revenue. They're now facing a dip in demand as consumers begin to pull back on spending. I've also visited some of our aerospace customers where it's clear that business activity has picked up, especially in 2022 as COVID impacts have diminished. The industry is now making investments in new airplanes and other equipment to meet ongoing changes in business and leisure travel demands. All told, we continue to experience a dynamic market, with some industry still on the upswing, some that are stabilized, and others that are trending down. And while our customers will face different levels of impact as we navigate through this inflationary period, we know that Grainger wins because of our ability to add tangible value to our customers' operations through inventory management, digital solutions, and product substitutes. This has been true in past economic cycles, and we expect to continue as more and more customers turn to us for solutions, thanks to our relevant product offering, know-how, and advantaged supply chain. Turning now to our results. We performed very well in the third quarter with sales growth of 16.9% or 20.3% on a daily constant currency basis. This normalizes for the impact to the significantly depreciating Japanese yen. Our results this quarter include strong growth in both segments as we continue to execute well against our strategic priorities. We outgrew the US MRO market by 700 basis points in our US High-Touch business and delivered over 23% sales growth in Endless Assortment on a daily constant currency basis. Total company gross profit margin finished the quarter at 38.5%, expanding 145 basis points over the prior year third quarter. Profitability was strong throughout the quarter, was especially strong in the month of September as we benefited from a confluence of factors, including some timing benefits that provided a tailwind to gross margin. Steve will outline the details in a few minutes. Strong gross margin performance, coupled with solid SG&A leverage, helped us achieve 15.3% operating margin, an increase of 230 basis points over the prior year third quarter. We delivered adjusted ROIC of nearly 42%, up over 1,000 basis points compared to the same period last year. We also generated $380 million in operating cash flow and returned $286 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Due to the strong results achieved in the quarter and continued strong trends in October, we are again raising our 2022 full year guidance, starting with the customer and living our Grainger Edge principles is helping us deliver value to all of our stakeholders. With that, I will turn it over to Dee to discuss the details. Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I would make just a few comments. While this quarter brought more market fluctuation and potential uncertainty broadly, both our market and our performance was strong. I remain confident in Grainger's ability to create tangible value, deliver flawless experience, and gain share profitably over the long haul. We are grateful for our customers' continued confidence in Grainger. No matter what comes next, we will remain a trusted resource ready to help them navigate any cycle. I would also like to thank the Grainger team for all they've done and continue to do to support our customers. With our team's continued commitment to focusing on the things that matter, we are well poised to deliver a very strong finish to the year. And with that, we will open the line for questions. Good morning. Yes. Sure. So thanks, Dave. We have -- we talked at Investor Day, based on our improved customer information, we have been able to identify a potential to add some sellers. We've added them relatively small percentages overall to a couple of pilot areas that we're running now, and we expect to have results of that early in the year, and that will inform what we do going forward. We do think we're going to have the ability to consistently add sellers and also improve the effectiveness of sellers based on the information we've now built and have on customers. And so that's a pretty exciting path. We won't have details for you in terms of what that looks like in the aggregate probably until second quarter next year when we start to hear -- get all the results back from the pilots. Sure. I was over there-- I was over there four weeks ago. I'll let Dee answer the sort of exact timing. But just to give you sort of a magnitude, they're operating two buildings in the Osaka area. The new ones, a six-story enormous building that is coming up to speed and getting up to the line volumes to take over entirely, and they expect that to happen mostly by the end of the year. The other one has been running at the same time. So, that's a duplicate cost. And Dee, I'll turn it over to you for the numbers. I think that there's been a fairly significant increased attention to supply assuredness given what's happened in the last few years. And supply chain is improving. They've improved. They aren't fully back, but they are improving for sure, hasn't really changed those discussions. Customers still want to understand how they can make sure that they have what they need to get their jobs done. Obviously, we've always done that through different ways, whether having inventory in a branch or managing inventory on site or having next day delivery, all those things help customers. but we're still having a lot of conversations with customers about -- based on our ability to serve them during these challenging times, how can we continue to help them. And we think a lot of the performance we've had in our supply chain is going to be pretty sticky moving forward based on what we're hearing. Good morning. Yes. Sure. So it's inherently tricky thing to figure out. What I would say is that our customer file has increased substantially versus 2019. So a lot of the new customers have stuck around. Our customer file was at its peak in the heart of the pandemic in 2020, both for Grainger and for Zoro and for MonotaRO. They all had sort of a similar pattern. And what was going on there was there was a lot of consumers buying and just trying to find whatever they could find for safety reasons. That's all gone back to normal. And so we think that what we see now is all of the business customers that we were able to acquire during the pandemic, either for pandemic reasons or other reasons. And we've had really healthy growth of the customer file. And I think that's probably the biggest signal that make -- that matters the most. Yes. So -- and Dee, you may have other adds to this. We continue to see through our cost cycle this year increases from a number of suppliers. I would say it's less intense now than it was certainly in the first half of the year. But most -- and what you're going to see in terms of price increase, a lot of it is sort of what's already been taken before. And so you're just seeing the impact of that. But we do expect some increases to continue to flow in as things continue to roll forward, but just not as intense. Deane, what do you -- what are you trying to understand? Go ahead. Go ahead, Dee. You can take that one. Yes. So, what I would say is that certainly, portions of the supply chain, I would say, are pretty much back to normal. But the portions that we control being able to pick back and shipping at things out were clean pretty much every night. A year ago, we had labor challenges and all kinds of challenges. Those have pretty much gone away in terms of our own supply chain. And then the outbound transportation is also pretty strong at this point and less of a problem. From a supplier standpoint, there's still suppliers that are catching up to challenge that they've had. And so lead-times are elongated in some cases. What I would say is that our service levels in terms of having product and being able to get to customers are high on a relative basis and getting back -- moving back towards what we'd expect to have from an absolute basis. So, we do see a lot of improvement. There's still long ways to go. I mean this is -- that was -- it's been quite a shock to the supply chain, and there's still long ways to go from our suppliers and from transportation entities. Coming from -- I think your question on global sourced product, certainly, we're seeing it become much easier to get sailings from Asia into the US, and the cost of that is coming down substantially from its peak, maybe back to where it was, but certainly coming down. And so we do see that starting to flow much better than it had earlier in the year. Yes. Maybe let's just talk about philosophy here, and Dee, if you want to add to it again. I think that we -- as Dee mentioned, there have been some tailwinds that are probably modest and might come back -- drop down a little bit. I think the overall algorithm hasn't changed at all. There's been a lot of messiness the last two years. Obviously, we had deflated GP given all the pandemic product and challenges with that, which was all the right things, and right things to do to serve our customers. And now you're seeing sort of the normal GP with probably a little bit of tailwinds that may bleed off. But the algorithm is still the same. We're going to -- our plan is to grow faster than the market in the High-Touch model, 400 to 500 basis points, to have consistent GP and slight SG&A leverage as we go forward. And that's the algorithm and the algorithm for the High-Touch DNS server models exactly the same as well. Yes. I mean it's a great question. So I think we mentioned this at Investor Day, but just to put maybe a finer point on it. When we look at what we get from a share gain perspective, we're looking at cause and effect for the actions that we take. This year is higher, obviously, than our target. And we've actually been able to determine that we think some of that might be availability-related just having product when others didn't. And some of that becomes sticky, as we've mentioned before. But when we look at the 400 to 500 basis points, that's looking at the actions and seller coverage, seller effectiveness and keep stock to drive share gain, and that's where that number comes from. So, we've had a little bit of benefit, we think, this year that's due just to having a better execution around the supply chain than maybe others have had. What I would say is that we think we can grow midsize customers faster than large customers through the cycle. A lot of that has to do with the lower share we have, but also some of the actions we're taking are allowing us to acquire and penetrate midsized customers. Whether that's 20% or not, I won't comment on that. But I'll just -- if you recall, we were in the high 1.5 billion -- 1.8 billion number 10, 15 years ago, and we're going to break through 1.5 billion here in the next year or so, we think. And so we're getting back to where we were, but there's still long ways to go. So, we do feel comfortable that there's going to be faster outgrowth of midsized customers than there are for. Yes. I mean we don't -- we think that market is growing similar to what the whole market is growing, which would be sort of low double-digits, 10% to 13% in the quarter is kind of the market growth that we saw. So what I would say is that as we think about next year, as we think about any year, we try to think about the total cost we're going to see and the -- make sure we're pricing the market and get the best cost we can get. In many ways, those cost improvements will be embedded in price/cost because we will understand how those movements, and everybody else is going to have similar movements. The portion of product that comes from China is actually pretty similar across major competitors today. And so we don't think we are disadvantaged or advantaged necessarily on that. So we would expect that to sort of flow through in sort of normal ways from the competitive environment. All right. Thanks for joining us today. We really appreciate you being on the call. As we said, we're certainly happy with the quarter, probably happier with sort of our longer-term ability to consistently gain share and do it in a profitable way and feel really good about the things we're doing in -- as we face into an uncertain market. I hope all of you have a great weekend and a great rest of the year and look forward to talking to you in 2023. Thank you."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to our host, Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nKyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q2 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on our second quarter 2022 results, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis for the respective quarterly periods presented. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from US GAAP, and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. Now, I'll turn it over to D.G.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter performance and pass it to Dee to walk through the financials. Before I get to the quarter, I'd like to start with our Grainger Edge framework, which guides our strategy and behaviors across the company and with our customer and supplier partners. Over the last several years, this has been critical to our response to COVID and our efforts to gain share. Importantly, these principles that you see here for the basis of what we expect of each other. Team members have embraced these principles to build better customer solutions, focus on what matters and move faster to deliver value. They are more than words on a page. They are how we work together to support our customers and team members. One example of the Grainger Edge helping guide our efforts is around ESG. Our principles of starting with the customer investing in our success and doing the right thing, heavily influence our approach. At Grainger, we operate sustainably and with a long-term approach to critical issues. Our ESG approach, which we have reported on now for 11 years, is tightly integrated into the Grainger Edge and increasingly tied to our daily operations. In our recently published 2022 ESG report, we discussed how we are organizing our environmental, social and governance practices, as well as our four near-term priorities, which is where we believe we could make the most impact. These near-term focus areas are: diversity, equity, inclusion, making sure that Grainger is a place where each team member feels welcome and able to give their best work; energy and emissions, we continue to make great progress on improving our carbon footprint, and we have significant plans moving forward; customer sustainability solutions, helping customers reduce energy and water consumption; and finally, supplier diversity, which helps us identify and support great supplier partners to propel the business. Our team members have brought and will continue to bring these priorities into their work with our customers, helping them to achieve their ESG goals and creating even more value. As highlighted in the 2022 ESG report, we have recently worked with the state university to retrofit parking garage lighting, creating over $200,000 in annual energy savings, assisted a CPG company as they build out their supplier diversity program, and partner with a nationwide hospital system in identifying a roofing vendor to install bio-based materials on roughly 500,000 square feet of rooftop, which will reduce greenhouse emissions by 39 million pounds over a 40-year period. These are just a few examples of ESG in action, and I am incredibly proud of how our teams are continuing to live our principles each day as they work with our customers, suppliers and each other to further our efforts in this area. I hope you will take some time to review our full 2022 ESG report, which can be found on graingeresg.com. Turning now to our second quarter results. We had another strong quarter with sales growth of 19.6% or 22% on a daily constant currency basis. Our results were driven by strong performance in both segments. This included 1,000 basis points of market outgrowth in our US High-Touch business fueled by continued solid execution on our strategic initiatives and strong returns on our inventory and supply chain investments. Total company gross profit finished the quarter at 37.6%, expanding 255 basis points over the prior year second quarter. The largest driver of our expansion in the quarter was lapping the prior year pandemic-related inventory adjustment. Even when excluding that adjustment, however, we were still up around 60 basis points year-over-year with both segments contributing to the favorable results. We delivered 13.9% operating margin, an increase of 350 basis points over the prior year second quarter. This is primarily a result of the improved gross margin performance as well as our ability to continue to drive SG&A leverage on the top line growth. In the quarter, we delivered adjusted ROIC of 40.5% and a significant increase over the 29.2% generated in the second quarter of last year. We also returned $219 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. It was an excellent quarter all around. As a result of the strong performance and the continued momentum we are seeing through July, we are raising our full year 2022 guidance, which Steve will discuss in more detail And with that, I'll pass it over to Dee.\nDee Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. Turning to Slide 8. We covered revenue and margins at a total company level, but I'd like to highlight a few other key points. Our total company SG&A as a percent of sales was 23.7%, a 95 basis point improvement over the prior year second quarter as we drove leverage from our top line performance. We continue to invest in our strategic initiatives but remain committed to not adding unnecessary cost to the business. And our resulting EPS in the quarter was $7.19, up 68% versus the second quarter of 2021. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment for the second quarter. We continue to see strong results with daily sales up 22.2% compared to the second quarter of 2021. We saw broad-based double-digit growth across all geographies and over 20% growth in both midsized and large customers in the US. In the US, we continue to see strong double-digit volume growth and price realization of around 11%, all helping fuel 23.1% daily sales growth. Canadian daily sales were also strong, up 11.1% or 15.5% in local days in local currency. It's been a long journey, and we are proud of the traction the Canadian team has gained with their now fifth consecutive quarter of profitability. For the segment, GP margins finished the quarter at 39.7%, up 275 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by lapping of a $63 million pandemic product inventory adjustment in the prior year period. Excluding this inventory adjustment, we achieved gross margin expansion of over 25 basis points as favorable product mix and largely neutral price cost spread were partially offset by heightened freight costs. As we manage through this highly inflationary period, while there will be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations due to timing, our goal is to remain price competitive, while achieving price/cost neutrality. Increased SG&A spend was driven primarily by higher variable compensation expense as well as continued investments in marketing, payroll, and benefits to support growth. Even with the increased investment, we delivered 150 basis points of SG&A leverage year-over-year and when combined with strong growth margin recovery, Q2 operating margin of 15.6% was up 425 basis points versus the prior year period. Overall, the performance in our High-Touch Solutions business remains strong as our powerful value proposition continues to resonate with customers. Looking at market outgrowth on slide 10, and we estimate that the US MRO market, including both volume and price inflation, grew between 12.5% and 13.5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 1,000 basis points of market outgrowth in the quarter. While we know that our advantaged supply chain contributes to our success, we also continue to see strong growth with our strategic investments. We are excited about the returns that we are seeing on these investments, most notably with our remerchandising and our data-driven marketing programs. Our continued success gives us confidence in our ability to consistently achieve 300 to 400 basis points of annual market outgrowth on an ongoing basis and through the cycle. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment, reported and daily sales increased 11.4%, up 21.1% on a daily constant currency basis after normalizing for significant impact of the depreciating Japanese yen. In local currency and local days, MonotaRO achieved 21.9% growth and Zoro US daily sales were up 23.2%. The segment growth continues to be driven by new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO and enterprise and repeat customer growth at MonotaRO, an impressive quarter of growth across the segment. Gross margin expanded 100 basis points versus the second quarter 2021 and was primarily driven by freight efficiencies as average order values increased at both Zoro and MonotaRO as both continue to focus on B2B customers. As planned, segment operating margin declined 25 basis points in the quarter, consistent with the first quarter. This decline was primarily a result of the new DC at MonotaRO coupled with continued investment in technology, marketing, and payroll costs to support growth at Zoro. Despite the increased investment, Zoro operating margins still improved 85 basis points over the second quarter of 2021 as strong GP -- on strong GP improvement. As a reminder, the increased cost at MonotaRO will continue for the remainder of 2022 as they transition to their new Inagala DC. We anticipate that the business will return to more normal operating margins in 2023. In addition, we also continue to see positive results with our key Endless Assortment operating metrics. On slide 12, you can see total registered users across MonotaRO and Zoro combined are up 18% over the prior year period. On the right, we show the continued growth of Zoro key portfolio. We are targeting about 2 million SKU additions in 2022 and will likely exceed that given our progress after the first six months. At the end of the second quarter, we have around 10.2 million active SKUs on the website. Now looking to the back half of the year. With another very strong quarter and with July total company daily sales of 19% or 21% in constant currency, we are raising our 2022 full year outlook. While we acknowledge that the broader market conditions remain uncertain, we have not seen a slowdown in demand in our business and continue to hear positive sentiment from our customers, further supporting our revised outlook. Our updated outlook for the full year 2022 includes expected daily sales growth between 14.5% and 16.5%, and EPS between $27.25 and $28.75, a 41% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. We've also updated our supplemental guidance in the appendix, which reflects improved segment operating margins and net ranges for all other metrics. While it is not typical for us to change our guidance this frequently, our objective is to provide our most up-to-date view with each earnings cycle. Given the strong revenue and profitability performance to date, we felt it was necessary to update our segment metric again this quarter. With that, I will turn it back to DG for some closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I would make just a few comments. While we may not know exactly what the rest of this and next year will bring from a market perspective, I'm confident in our team's ability to execute, drive market outgrowth and invest in the areas that matter most. The time that I spent with customers this past quarter has reinforced the pride I have in the Grainger team and our ongoing commitment to remain customer-focused. I hear consistently that we have delivered to keep our customers working. As a result of our team's efforts, we have deepened customer relationships becoming the trusted partner to many. We performed extremely well in the quarter, and I am confident that we will produce a strong finish to 2022 and remain well positioned to serve our customers for the years to come. And with that, let's open the line up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.\nRyan Merkel: Thanks, good morning and very nice quarter.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Ryan.\nRyan Merkel: So I wanted to ask a question on the share gains, which have been really impressive. I guess it's a two-part question. So first, is the key driver of the share gains, the advantaged inventory that you have, or have the initiatives also maybe added a couple of hundred basis points above that 300 to 400 target?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. It's a great question. Thanks for asking. Yes, the initiatives have added more than 300 to 400 basis points, we do on many of the initiatives we do A/B tests and we're able to track what the initiatives are bringing and they've been very, very effective in the last year or so. So we continue to see very strong gain from the initiatives. We are getting some tailwind from our inventory position as well. But the initiatives have been very strong in terms of their performance.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. And I guess, the follow-up is, why don't you raise the share gain target if these initiatives are adding more than the 300 to 400, is it not sustainable, or you just not have enough evidence yet?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I think more time will help us understand if this is going to be -- if we're going to get to a new norm in terms of higher share gain. Thus far, we've committed to the share gain targets and we'll continue to talk to you about what we expect going forward.\nRyan Merkel: Perfect. Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please state your question.\nTommy Moll: Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nTommy Moll: I was going to ask if you'd seen any slowdown in demand and Dee beat me to the punch. So I guess I'll ask it a different way. Is there any end market or customer anecdote that's not as positive as you could even hope for at this point? Is there anything at all that's changed? I just want to circle back on that, because your comment, you haven't yet seen a slowdown. It was pretty clear at the same time, investors are searching closely for any sign of anything that's changed and there have been at least a few macro indicators that have been met.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. No, so let me just -- we're not showing experts on every segment, but I will give you some observations. And a lot of this probably has to do with what we've seen through the pandemic and coming out of the pandemic. So if you look at our segment performance in the appendix of the materials, you'll see that slower growth markets, but still growth markets are retail, which is a lot of distribution centers, typically for us, that market was way up the last couple of years. So that has certainly slowed down, but still growing. Health care and government have -- are still growing and have sort of accelerated recently again, but they were -- they're not as strong as general manufacturing, the industrial parts of the economy are certainly growing faster for us than the non-industrial parts right now. So that would be my observation. I think that's certainly consistent with what we're hearing from others as well. But I think the nice thing here is that we are seeing growth in all segments and the share gain is helping us.\nTommy Moll: Yes. That's great. Thank you. Pivoting to a question on your technology investment for high touch. D.G., you've talked for some time about some of the investments you made in the website, the product information systems, customer database, et cetera. Can you bring us up to speed on those initiatives? What inning are we in for this investment cycle? And I was going to ask -- \nD.G. Macpherson: Yes.\nTommy Moll:  -- if you could identify any of the fruit that's been borne out of these initiatives, which you've already touched on a little bit, but maybe you could give a few more examples.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. And I would say, and I'll just plug for the Analyst Day, we'll talk a little bit more about this during Analyst Day for sure. But what I would say is, the things we started earlier have proven to be very, very valuable around product information and publishing, which allows us to help -- helps our merchandising efforts and website efforts and print publications as well. And so we've seen really good results from that. We started to see really good results from the investments in customer information as well, in terms of things like improving seller coverage, improving marketing outreach, making sure we're sending the right message to the right customers. So we'll talk more in September about sort of what we have and what we plan to work on from a technology transformation, but we really like the signs we've seen so far, and we've had some very significant results.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDeane Dray: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just first a clarification for Dee on the price cost neutrality. Just -- is that on the margin basis, I trust?\nDee Merriwether: So that is on product cost. And so -- if you kind of go back, when we've talked over a period of time, we try to focus on the inflation that comes through product versus what comes through like transportation. And what we have noted is that we -- our goal over the cycle, any cycle is to be price cost neutral as it relates to our product costs, and to cover a majority of any incremental freight costs on a go-forward basis. And as you all probably know, we saw a significant acceleration of fuel pricing during the quarter. And we are working very hard to look for ways to cover some of that incremental freight costs. So it is not -- when we say price/cost neutrality, we're not talking about overall gross margin. It is a component within gross margin.\nDeane Dray: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for that. And this is more of a nuance, but you lowered the high end of the buyback guidance and this quarter, share count creep was up, and it costs you $0.03. I don't know that it's more of a nuance. But just why would you lower the buyback? And how do you feel about trying to contain share creep? Thanks.\nDee Merriwether: Yeah. So thanks for the question. And we are generally always in the market from a repurchase perspective. We're not specifically looking to attempt to try to time the market with our repurchases. And we really try to balance that with our cash generation. And so it was nothing more than Q1 and Q2, we have some large cash payouts during those periods as it relates to our bonuses, some tax payments. So it's generally just timing for us.\nDeane Dray: Got it. Thanks for all the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.\nDavid Manthey: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. The high-touch gross margin has seasonality, so I get the second half operating margin guidance relative to the first half. But in Endless Assortment, the op margin looked like it averaged about 8.3% in the first half. Your guidance for the second half implies lower than that. And I'm just wondering if you can outline what are the key factors that are pressuring second half profitability relative to the first half in Endless Assortment?`\nDee Merriwether: Well, I'll start D.G. Well, generally, we're continuing as it relates to MonotaRO to ramp up our investments there and fund those investments for carrying two DCs Anegawa and Amagasaki at the same time. So those ramp costs continue to have an impact on us. And similar to the High-Touch segment, the Zoro business is continuing to invest in marketing, payroll costs, as well as technology to drive their long-term revenue growth. So it is just investments during the period of time. And as we get to 2023, specifically for MonotaRO, we expect their operating margins to normalize back to historic levels. And so we'll see some settling out at that point.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thank you for that. And then second, could you outline the impact of LIFO accounting on your results? We don't talk much about that, but can you talk about sort of gross margin impact in the current quarter, the recent past, the near future?\nDee Merriwether: Sure. We generally speak to or share our LIFO impact on an annual basis. So what I will say is that with us being in an inflationary period is very important as you can imagine, to stay on top of standard cost increases with product. And so we are doing that. And so we continue to have increased cost inflation within our inventory and COGS related to LIFO, but we feel like we're fairly on top of that now that we've been in this situation for going on two -- well, I won't say two years, close to a year, a year now. So materially, in the quarter, it was a really immaterial impact, but because we continue to update our standard costs on our inventory and cover that LIFO impact with price.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please state your question.\nHans Hoffman: Hi. This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Hamza. On the endless assortment segment, specifically Zoro, where do you think profitability can go longer term from where we sit today and where SKU count can go? And then just what does the competitive set or competition look like for Zoro? Thanks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean, so with Zoro, what we've talked about is we're going to pass 10 million items this year, unique SKUs. We expect profitability to get to the high single digits over the next several years. It's on a very good path to do that. And from a return on invested capital perspective, it's obviously very profitable given it doesn't have the inventory position. So profitability is getting better. It's going to continue to get better. We think we can get to probably 20 million SKUs at a minimum through Zoro over time, but that's sort of a long-term effort, probably four or five-year effort to get there, we'd expect. And yes, and so competitive set wise, it's a lot of digital players that we see, and there's a lot of them out there, but we continue to perform well and I think we can gain share consistently through that model.\nHans Hoffman: Got it. Thanks. And then could you just talk about how you're thinking about headcount additions going forward? What you're seeing in terms of labor inflation, turnover and labor availability?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So it's been a challenging labor market to say the least, over the last year or 1.5 years, I'd say. We feel like we are in a good position from a staffing perspective, particularly in areas that are so important like our distribution centers, we've been able to add significantly to our headcount. We still need to manage that effectively on an ongoing basis. And we're looking at what turnover we have, typically at the distribution center, if we -- our biggest turnover is in the first year, people come in, they don't realize the jobs as challenging as it is and may not like the job. So we do see high first year turnover once we get people through that first year, they typically stay and become long-term team members. That continues to be the dynamic, but it's been certainly challenging. We've had to hire a lot over the last couple of years, and we have a turnover in those population pools. Generally, we're very focused on making sure that we have the right staffing levels for the volume that we see and then not adding costs where it doesn't make sense in the business. So we are being careful about sort of headcount additions outside of areas that are sort of volume dependent.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.\nNigel Coe: Hi, guys. Good morning. I got a couple of clarifications and then one question on assortments. Just on the market outgrowth definition. The 12% growth in the market this quarter, is that price and volumes, or is that just volumes? Just want to make sure we're comparing like-for-like?\nDee Merriwether: Yeah. Price and volume, the 12%.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Great. That's what I thought. And then just on the price cost. So essentially, it's an invoice price. So basically, your invoice minus supplier invoice, that's how you define it?\nDee Merriwether: Well, are you talking about price inflation?\nNigel Coe: Price cost. So your definition, you said it's based on product price minus product costs. So that -- okay. Like an invoice spread basically?\nDee Merriwether: Yeah.\nNigel Coe: Yeah. Okay. Great. Just on the Endless Assortment, the growth in users is pretty consistent and pretty impressive quarter-by-quarter. Just wondering, what is the typical profile of the active users you're adding? How do you reach these users kind of acquisition cost? Any kind of help there would be helpful. And then just kind of how do you expect Zoro to perform in a recession. If these are sort of smaller users, do you expect it to be more volatile, more cyclical perhaps, or do you think that the underlying structural growth in that business can offset any pressures in a downturn?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah. So what I would say is the typical customer that we acquire is a small business customer. We have actually gotten out of some of the lower-value marketplaces where we weren't getting business users as frequently as you want. So mostly business customers and relatively small business customers. We are then really focused on getting those customers to repeat. And we've seen really nice results through MonotaRO or over the last year in terms of increasing repeat rates for existing customers. And so that's been a nice trend and a very positive trend. In terms of a downturn, we would expect the underlying growth to be able to sort of power through the downturn, we would be affected by the downturn, but we still think we'd have significant outgrowth from the Zoro model given the way the model works and what we've seen in other downturns in MonotaRO and other places.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.\nChristopher Glynn: Thank you. Great first half. And curious on the second half outlook, the HTS margin guide implies a little bit of a softer sort of tail off on the margin versus normal seasonality. I know last year was bent a little differently. So looking past that, but I think the tape is usually a little more than what's implied here. So curious if you could comment on that?\nDee Merriwether: So this is, again, another year that's been difficult to forecast based upon what's going on in the marketplace. But as you know, seasonally, Q3 is a lower gross margin point for us in high-touch US. And we're planning and forecasting for that to be the case. And then we usually see a deceleration, seasonal deceleration with customers on the top line in Q4. And so we feel confident in how we have planned out and provided updated guidance for High-Touch. Nothing to read into that other than, we don't think the last couple of years are necessarily a great benchmark. And so we've gone back and looked at longer term trends to actually forecast how we believe the High-Touch US business will perform for the remainder of this year, taking into account our jumping off point from H1.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. And just on this price level getting 10%, 11%, what scenarios within reason, would you see maybe price giving back and reversing a little bit, or are you pretty confident this is a new baseline?\nDee Merriwether: So what we're seeing right now is fairly steady. It's hard to see it reversing itself. And I think if you go back and look over a number of prior cycles, there -- I think there's only one instance where there may have been a true give back versus just a slowdown in price inflation, but I think time will tell.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hey, good morning all.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Just a question on the inbound inflation that you're seeing, how that's progressed over the last couple of months. I think you're starting to see some of the PPI indicators plateau a little bit. Obviously, you guys are diverse across your purchases. So just wondering what that looks like in terms of what you're seeing today in the marketplace as you go out to make purchases and maybe how that's trended over the past quarter?\nD.G. Macpherson: So, do you mean inbound transportation or amount product cost or all of it?\nJosh Pokrzywinski: All-in, but I guess more product than transportation?\nD.G. Macpherson: Okay, yeah. Yeah. So we have not -- we've seen a stabilizing of purchase prices from our suppliers. We have had fewer requests for price increases in the last several weeks than we had several months ago, for sure. But we really haven't seen any backtracking at this point. So it's stabilized, but still not -- not going down, going up slightly, going up less than it was going up.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And on the -- I guess, kind of related to that on availability, I think there's probably a point in time further back in the pandemic when there's a wider spread between what Grainger could get and maybe what some of your smaller competitors can get? How would you characterize that spread today?\nD.G. Macpherson: Well, of course, we don't know exactly what our competitors can get. So this is all speculation. It's still a pretty challenging availability market. There still is certainly, the China shutdown didn't help anything and there's still areas of supply that are challenged. So I suspect we still have an advantage on some level. And I think some of the things we've done with our product information, management system has helped us get to crosses, which has been very important in the last 1.5 years to be able to cross to a functional equivalent, so we can get -- if a product is not in stock, we can actually get customer solutions. So I think we have some advantages. And I would say that we are not out of the woods from a global supply chain in our industry yet. It's going to take some while to get out of this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jacob Levinson with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nJacob Levinson: Good morning, everyone.\nDee Merriwether: Good morning.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nJacob Levinson: At the risk of beating a dead horse here on price. Certainly, the 11 points to go in the high touch business is quite a bit higher than we've seen at some of your peers. But I realize there are going to be some nuances. But if we peel back the onion, I guess the question is what's really changed the cycle that's allowing you to stay ahead of cost. Because certainly, DG, when you took over that, maybe that muscle memory wasn't there. So just curious what's happening under the hood, if you will.\nD.G. Macpherson: Well, I think one thing I would say is that, it's -- there's -- the signal to noise in some cases is probably lower than you'd like, if you're looking from the outside, because some competitors are taking price at different times. And so what's changed is, we know we are market price competitive now. And we spend a lot more time focused on that. And the pricing changes we've made have been in line with market. Now we may have taken them at different times, later, earlier, depending on how things go, but we we're very confident that we are market priced at this point. And that's our primary tenant for pricing.\nJacob Levinson: Okay. That's helpful. And just changing gears a bit on Zoro, still seeing the growth accelerated over time, and that's a different tone, I guess, than what we're hearing from other e-commerce players more broadly. So, I guess, the question is, how much of this is that, you built a better mouse trap with the investments you've made over the years and the IT and the buying experience itself. Or how much of that is SKU additions or you're spending on advertising? Just trying to get a sense of what you feel like is really contributing to that success there.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I think few additions are a big part of it. I also think that the customers we're going after are business customers. And so, I think, most of what you would see as compares in the digital space would not be business focused, so we think business customers are probably doing better than consumers online right now. And so that's a big part of it too.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask about customer inventory levels. One of the concerns that investors have on the distributors is that industrial companies are reporting outsized inventory levels. Obviously, a good chunk of that is price. But I would appreciate any color or views you have on MRO inventory at your customer base?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. And just to -- I'll try to take this one. I think that the industrial manufacturers that are reporting higher inventory levels. My guess is that, most of that is actually WIP. When you visit customers now, there are many cases in which product is not MRO products. I will get to MRO product in a minute. The product generally is sitting around and you see it, and the reason it's sitting around is they don't have everything they need to actually produce. So they have strong demand, but they just can't get it out the door because they don't have everything they need to produce. And I've seen that at many, many customers that I visited in the last three or four months. I think that's the bigger issue. We don't -- our customers don't have stockpiles of MRO product. That's not the way it works. And in fact, our value proposition is to make sure they have only what they need. And so, our inventory management solutions and such, make sure that we don't have too much stock. And so -- and I'll talk with any customer, it was a backlog of MRO product. I do see supply chain-driven work in process inventory issues at a lot of manufacturers.\nChris Snyder: I appreciate that color. I guess, I wanted to follow-up for my second question on previous commentary around product availability across the industry, so at your competitors. I guess as industry-wide product availability gets better and starts to normalize. What do you think that means for your business? It sounds like some of the market outgrowth could compress back to the target range. Do you think that carries any risk of price cost, as I'd imagine maybe some of those smaller competitors will look to get back to their market share? Any thoughts on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean, of course, we haven't really gone through a period driven by a pandemic like this. So any answer here is speculative. I would say that more customer visits that I'm on, our ability to keep customers going has actually led to a lot stickier relationships led to us connecting more directly from a digital perspective, led to us managing our inventory pools, we see very strong growth with our key stock. And so things that we're doing on site are really valued right now. So I'm not overly concerned that, that will be a detriment. Are we going to grow outgrowth of 1,000 basis points every quarter now or not. But we feel like we can gain share consistently and that we've built the right relationships and processes to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nChris Dankert: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. It looks like the operating cash flow guidance increases based principally on that better sales and profitability outlook here. But has anything changed as far as working capital requirements for expectations into the back half of the year here?\nDee Merriwether: Well, I mean, as you can kind of see our working capital needs have kind of grown with trying to ensure we have the right inventory in stock to meet demand, and to support our customer sales. And so we see that trend continuing. I will say some of the AR growth is starting to stabilize here for us a little bit. And just inside, collections are strong, so we have no issues with collecting from our customers. But it's more a matter of ensuring that we have the right inventory on a go-forward basis. We still will have strong growth, as you know, in the back half that's implied by the guidance. So no big material changes. I would just say a little bit more stability as it relates to working capital needs.\nChris Dankert: Okay. Well, I guess inventory specific we had expected some of those purchases to taper a bit or flatten out a bit. Is that kind of still the case?\nDee Merriwether: Well, I mean, based on what you just heard, D.G. say, we still -- as our customers continue to operate, they will still need MRO product. And we're building inventory on some SKUs. And on some SKUs, we still can't quite build inventory. So we will continue to attempt to get inventory back -- levels back to where we feel they need to be to meet demand.\nChris Dankert: Got it. Got it. Okay. And then I guess switching gears to analyst assortment. Is the value per order there continue to trend higher? And I guess, how does that trend on value per order compared to what kind of the internal targets are for that metric?\nD.G. Macpherson: We see nice increases in average order value for the Zoro business. And I think a lot of that has to do with whom we're targeting. We're targeting only business customers. And we found ways to avoid acquiring consumers, I would say, through that process that helps average order value. We expect that to continue to get a little bit better as we continue to refine our processes and continue to get more repeat business from these business customers. But we feel like we're on a trend. It's been a little bit better than we expected actually this year from an average order value. So, probably a little better than expected, but we're basically on the path we want to be.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Newman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKen Newman: Hi, good morning.\nD.G. Macpherson: Hi, good morning.\nKen Newman: I just wanted to follow-up on the comments you made earlier in the call about your retail and e-commerce sales. I think they were up mid-single-digits in the quarter, but -- can you just talk a little bit about what's embedded in the sales outlook for that portfolio? And maybe just a little bit more color on how customer behavior has changed through the quarter and into July?\nDee Merriwether: So, we really aren't changing the outlook for -- I believe you're talking about our Endless Assortment segment?\nD.G. Macpherson: No, no, I got it.\nDee Merriwether: Okay.\nD.G. Macpherson: So, you're talking about our retail segment within Grainger. Just to make sure you understand what that is, that is a lot of distribution centers, some is e-commerce some is not. So, we do a lot of work with big retailers that are that are traditional as well in terms of helping them. We don't -- we expect that segment to grow slower the rest of the year versus other segments for sure. We don't typically give out sort of segment-level growth guidance, but we certainly are seeing trends that everybody is seeing. And again, I think there's -- the single noise there is probably not that as strong as it might otherwise be because what we saw during the pandemic was those channels explode. And so a lot of our growth was in retail, government, healthcare and now that's reversed because the compares are so high. So, I don't think it's like activity is not strong, it is. It's just not growing as fast as some of the other segments are.\nKen Newman: Understood. So, it\u2019s a deceleration rather than a true year-over-year decline with that customer mix. Is that fair?\nD.G. Macpherson: Correct.\nKen Newman: And then for my follow-up, I know there's been a lot of questions on pricing this call. Just again, can you just help me what are the expectations for pricing momentum in the second half within High-Touch, I think we are closer to pricing peaking here within the second half or how we already approached that.\nDee Merriwether: So, as we go through the Q3, I kind of noted it ends up being low point for GM for us. We're looking at continuing to pass on any inflation that we may see. We have another opportunity to potentially do that within the third quarter, but it will be nowhere as meaningful as like our first quarter increases have been. So, we're looking to -- from a full year perspective for price to end around 9% to 10% range, and we're a little bit higher than that now. And so we're just looking to end the year, price cost neutral which is our overall goal. And so -- and as D.G. noted, while remaining price competitive.\nD.G. Macpherson: And the other thing I would say there to add to what Dee said is that the slowdown in inflation in the second half isn't really -- it's not resetting prices or lowering prices. It's basically the comparisons, because we started taking inflation last year in the back half of the year. So it's basically just on the compares to last year, that's the reason.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nPatrick Baumann: Hi. The math on the guide suggests you expect SG&A to level off in the second half of the year versus what you just reported in the second quarter around $900 million. Maybe my math is off, but that's kind of what I was coming to? It looks like in prior years, those costs can increase second half versus the second quarter. So the question is, if my math is right, which might be wrong, you could just tell me it's wrong. If it's right, though, what causes those costs to be flat sequentially this year?\nDee Merriwether: So I think it's just timing of our investments. And so earlier this year, like in most years, we have our variable comp payout, and this year based upon performance, we were able to accrue some of those expenses based upon how we were running in H1 and settled out in line with our guidance and our forecast. So we don't see a lot of incrementality in the second half from that perspective. And we're continuing to invest at a more steady rate. And again, as D.G. noted, we started some of those investments a little hotter last year in the second quarter. So we're comping some of that year-over-year from an SG&A perspective. But the numbers are right.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay. So my math is right. Got it. Helpful color. And then Dee, also in the past, you've been more specific on month-to-date trends, when you report the quarter. Is there any way to put a finer point on July when you say that there's no slowdown in demand \u2013 can I take that to mean that July sales are still running 20% plus at constant currency?\nDee Merriwether: Yes. We noted that, yeah.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah. It is in the script. I think you said, we're running close to 21% on a constant currency basis.\nDee Merriwether: Currency basis. That's correct.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the floor back over to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks. Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: All right. Well, thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to have you on. I hope you all get to enjoy the rest of your summer. As a quick reminder, we are hosting our Investor Day on Wednesday, September 21. We hope you can join us in person, if possible, at our Northeast Distribution Center in New Jersey or virtually. We really look forward to spending time with you there. And again, thanks for the time, and take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dee Merriwether",
            "content": "Thanks, D.G. Turning to Slide 8. We covered revenue and margins at a total company level, but I'd like to highlight a few other key points. Our total company SG&A as a percent of sales was 23.7%, a 95 basis point improvement over the prior year second quarter as we drove leverage from our top line performance. We continue to invest in our strategic initiatives but remain committed to not adding unnecessary cost to the business. And our resulting EPS in the quarter was $7.19, up 68% versus the second quarter of 2021. Turning to our High-Touch Solutions segment for the second quarter. We continue to see strong results with daily sales up 22.2% compared to the second quarter of 2021. We saw broad-based double-digit growth across all geographies and over 20% growth in both midsized and large customers in the US. In the US, we continue to see strong double-digit volume growth and price realization of around 11%, all helping fuel 23.1% daily sales growth. Canadian daily sales were also strong, up 11.1% or 15.5% in local days in local currency. It's been a long journey, and we are proud of the traction the Canadian team has gained with their now fifth consecutive quarter of profitability. For the segment, GP margins finished the quarter at 39.7%, up 275 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by lapping of a $63 million pandemic product inventory adjustment in the prior year period. Excluding this inventory adjustment, we achieved gross margin expansion of over 25 basis points as favorable product mix and largely neutral price cost spread were partially offset by heightened freight costs. As we manage through this highly inflationary period, while there will be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations due to timing, our goal is to remain price competitive, while achieving price/cost neutrality. Increased SG&A spend was driven primarily by higher variable compensation expense as well as continued investments in marketing, payroll, and benefits to support growth. Even with the increased investment, we delivered 150 basis points of SG&A leverage year-over-year and when combined with strong growth margin recovery, Q2 operating margin of 15.6% was up 425 basis points versus the prior year period. Overall, the performance in our High-Touch Solutions business remains strong as our powerful value proposition continues to resonate with customers. Looking at market outgrowth on slide 10, and we estimate that the US MRO market, including both volume and price inflation, grew between 12.5% and 13.5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 1,000 basis points of market outgrowth in the quarter. While we know that our advantaged supply chain contributes to our success, we also continue to see strong growth with our strategic investments. We are excited about the returns that we are seeing on these investments, most notably with our remerchandising and our data-driven marketing programs. Our continued success gives us confidence in our ability to consistently achieve 300 to 400 basis points of annual market outgrowth on an ongoing basis and through the cycle. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment, reported and daily sales increased 11.4%, up 21.1% on a daily constant currency basis after normalizing for significant impact of the depreciating Japanese yen. In local currency and local days, MonotaRO achieved 21.9% growth and Zoro US daily sales were up 23.2%. The segment growth continues to be driven by new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO and enterprise and repeat customer growth at MonotaRO, an impressive quarter of growth across the segment. Gross margin expanded 100 basis points versus the second quarter 2021 and was primarily driven by freight efficiencies as average order values increased at both Zoro and MonotaRO as both continue to focus on B2B customers. As planned, segment operating margin declined 25 basis points in the quarter, consistent with the first quarter. This decline was primarily a result of the new DC at MonotaRO coupled with continued investment in technology, marketing, and payroll costs to support growth at Zoro. Despite the increased investment, Zoro operating margins still improved 85 basis points over the second quarter of 2021 as strong GP -- on strong GP improvement. As a reminder, the increased cost at MonotaRO will continue for the remainder of 2022 as they transition to their new Inagala DC. We anticipate that the business will return to more normal operating margins in 2023. In addition, we also continue to see positive results with our key Endless Assortment operating metrics. On slide 12, you can see total registered users across MonotaRO and Zoro combined are up 18% over the prior year period. On the right, we show the continued growth of Zoro key portfolio. We are targeting about 2 million SKU additions in 2022 and will likely exceed that given our progress after the first six months. At the end of the second quarter, we have around 10.2 million active SKUs on the website. Now looking to the back half of the year. With another very strong quarter and with July total company daily sales of 19% or 21% in constant currency, we are raising our 2022 full year outlook. While we acknowledge that the broader market conditions remain uncertain, we have not seen a slowdown in demand in our business and continue to hear positive sentiment from our customers, further supporting our revised outlook. Our updated outlook for the full year 2022 includes expected daily sales growth between 14.5% and 16.5%, and EPS between $27.25 and $28.75, a 41% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. We've also updated our supplemental guidance in the appendix, which reflects improved segment operating margins and net ranges for all other metrics. While it is not typical for us to change our guidance this frequently, our objective is to provide our most up-to-date view with each earnings cycle. Given the strong revenue and profitability performance to date, we felt it was necessary to update our segment metric again this quarter. With that, I will turn it back to DG for some closing remarks. So that is on product cost. And so -- if you kind of go back, when we've talked over a period of time, we try to focus on the inflation that comes through product versus what comes through like transportation. And what we have noted is that we -- our goal over the cycle, any cycle is to be price cost neutral as it relates to our product costs, and to cover a majority of any incremental freight costs on a go-forward basis. And as you all probably know, we saw a significant acceleration of fuel pricing during the quarter. And we are working very hard to look for ways to cover some of that incremental freight costs. So it is not -- when we say price/cost neutrality, we're not talking about overall gross margin. It is a component within gross margin. Yeah. So thanks for the question. And we are generally always in the market from a repurchase perspective. We're not specifically looking to attempt to try to time the market with our repurchases. And we really try to balance that with our cash generation. And so it was nothing more than Q1 and Q2, we have some large cash payouts during those periods as it relates to our bonuses, some tax payments. So it's generally just timing for us. Well, I'll start D.G. Well, generally, we're continuing as it relates to MonotaRO to ramp up our investments there and fund those investments for carrying two DCs Anegawa and Amagasaki at the same time. So those ramp costs continue to have an impact on us. And similar to the High-Touch segment, the Zoro business is continuing to invest in marketing, payroll costs, as well as technology to drive their long-term revenue growth. So it is just investments during the period of time. And as we get to 2023, specifically for MonotaRO, we expect their operating margins to normalize back to historic levels. And so we'll see some settling out at that point. Sure. We generally speak to or share our LIFO impact on an annual basis. So what I will say is that with us being in an inflationary period is very important as you can imagine, to stay on top of standard cost increases with product. And so we are doing that. And so we continue to have increased cost inflation within our inventory and COGS related to LIFO, but we feel like we're fairly on top of that now that we've been in this situation for going on two -- well, I won't say two years, close to a year, a year now. So materially, in the quarter, it was a really immaterial impact, but because we continue to update our standard costs on our inventory and cover that LIFO impact with price. Yeah. Price and volume, the 12%. Well, are you talking about price inflation? Yeah. So this is, again, another year that's been difficult to forecast based upon what's going on in the marketplace. But as you know, seasonally, Q3 is a lower gross margin point for us in high-touch US. And we're planning and forecasting for that to be the case. And then we usually see a deceleration, seasonal deceleration with customers on the top line in Q4. And so we feel confident in how we have planned out and provided updated guidance for High-Touch. Nothing to read into that other than, we don't think the last couple of years are necessarily a great benchmark. And so we've gone back and looked at longer term trends to actually forecast how we believe the High-Touch US business will perform for the remainder of this year, taking into account our jumping off point from H1. So what we're seeing right now is fairly steady. It's hard to see it reversing itself. And I think if you go back and look over a number of prior cycles, there -- I think there's only one instance where there may have been a true give back versus just a slowdown in price inflation, but I think time will tell. Good morning. Well, I mean, as you can kind of see our working capital needs have kind of grown with trying to ensure we have the right inventory in stock to meet demand, and to support our customer sales. And so we see that trend continuing. I will say some of the AR growth is starting to stabilize here for us a little bit. And just inside, collections are strong, so we have no issues with collecting from our customers. But it's more a matter of ensuring that we have the right inventory on a go-forward basis. We still will have strong growth, as you know, in the back half that's implied by the guidance. So no big material changes. I would just say a little bit more stability as it relates to working capital needs. Well, I mean, based on what you just heard, D.G. say, we still -- as our customers continue to operate, they will still need MRO product. And we're building inventory on some SKUs. And on some SKUs, we still can't quite build inventory. So we will continue to attempt to get inventory back -- levels back to where we feel they need to be to meet demand. So, we really aren't changing the outlook for -- I believe you're talking about our Endless Assortment segment? Okay. So, as we go through the Q3, I kind of noted it ends up being low point for GM for us. We're looking at continuing to pass on any inflation that we may see. We have another opportunity to potentially do that within the third quarter, but it will be nowhere as meaningful as like our first quarter increases have been. So, we're looking to -- from a full year perspective for price to end around 9% to 10% range, and we're a little bit higher than that now. And so we're just looking to end the year, price cost neutral which is our overall goal. And so -- and as D.G. noted, while remaining price competitive. So I think it's just timing of our investments. And so earlier this year, like in most years, we have our variable comp payout, and this year based upon performance, we were able to accrue some of those expenses based upon how we were running in H1 and settled out in line with our guidance and our forecast. So we don't see a lot of incrementality in the second half from that perspective. And we're continuing to invest at a more steady rate. And again, as D.G. noted, we started some of those investments a little hotter last year in the second quarter. So we're comping some of that year-over-year from an SG&A perspective. But the numbers are right. Yes. We noted that, yeah. Currency basis. That's correct."

            "content": "Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter performance and pass it to Dee to walk through the financials. Before I get to the quarter, I'd like to start with our Grainger Edge framework, which guides our strategy and behaviors across the company and with our customer and supplier partners. Over the last several years, this has been critical to our response to COVID and our efforts to gain share. Importantly, these principles that you see here for the basis of what we expect of each other. Team members have embraced these principles to build better customer solutions, focus on what matters and move faster to deliver value. They are more than words on a page. They are how we work together to support our customers and team members. One example of the Grainger Edge helping guide our efforts is around ESG. Our principles of starting with the customer investing in our success and doing the right thing, heavily influence our approach. At Grainger, we operate sustainably and with a long-term approach to critical issues. Our ESG approach, which we have reported on now for 11 years, is tightly integrated into the Grainger Edge and increasingly tied to our daily operations. In our recently published 2022 ESG report, we discussed how we are organizing our environmental, social and governance practices, as well as our four near-term priorities, which is where we believe we could make the most impact. These near-term focus areas are: diversity, equity, inclusion, making sure that Grainger is a place where each team member feels welcome and able to give their best work; energy and emissions, we continue to make great progress on improving our carbon footprint, and we have significant plans moving forward; customer sustainability solutions, helping customers reduce energy and water consumption; and finally, supplier diversity, which helps us identify and support great supplier partners to propel the business. Our team members have brought and will continue to bring these priorities into their work with our customers, helping them to achieve their ESG goals and creating even more value. As highlighted in the 2022 ESG report, we have recently worked with the state university to retrofit parking garage lighting, creating over $200,000 in annual energy savings, assisted a CPG company as they build out their supplier diversity program, and partner with a nationwide hospital system in identifying a roofing vendor to install bio-based materials on roughly 500,000 square feet of rooftop, which will reduce greenhouse emissions by 39 million pounds over a 40-year period. These are just a few examples of ESG in action, and I am incredibly proud of how our teams are continuing to live our principles each day as they work with our customers, suppliers and each other to further our efforts in this area. I hope you will take some time to review our full 2022 ESG report, which can be found on graingeresg.com. Turning now to our second quarter results. We had another strong quarter with sales growth of 19.6% or 22% on a daily constant currency basis. Our results were driven by strong performance in both segments. This included 1,000 basis points of market outgrowth in our US High-Touch business fueled by continued solid execution on our strategic initiatives and strong returns on our inventory and supply chain investments. Total company gross profit finished the quarter at 37.6%, expanding 255 basis points over the prior year second quarter. The largest driver of our expansion in the quarter was lapping the prior year pandemic-related inventory adjustment. Even when excluding that adjustment, however, we were still up around 60 basis points year-over-year with both segments contributing to the favorable results. We delivered 13.9% operating margin, an increase of 350 basis points over the prior year second quarter. This is primarily a result of the improved gross margin performance as well as our ability to continue to drive SG&A leverage on the top line growth. In the quarter, we delivered adjusted ROIC of 40.5% and a significant increase over the 29.2% generated in the second quarter of last year. We also returned $219 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. It was an excellent quarter all around. As a result of the strong performance and the continued momentum we are seeing through July, we are raising our full year 2022 guidance, which Steve will discuss in more detail And with that, I'll pass it over to Dee. Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I would make just a few comments. While we may not know exactly what the rest of this and next year will bring from a market perspective, I'm confident in our team's ability to execute, drive market outgrowth and invest in the areas that matter most. The time that I spent with customers this past quarter has reinforced the pride I have in the Grainger team and our ongoing commitment to remain customer-focused. I hear consistently that we have delivered to keep our customers working. As a result of our team's efforts, we have deepened customer relationships becoming the trusted partner to many. We performed extremely well in the quarter, and I am confident that we will produce a strong finish to 2022 and remain well positioned to serve our customers for the years to come. And with that, let's open the line up for questions. Thank you, Ryan. Yes. It's a great question. Thanks for asking. Yes, the initiatives have added more than 300 to 400 basis points, we do on many of the initiatives we do A/B tests and we're able to track what the initiatives are bringing and they've been very, very effective in the last year or so. So we continue to see very strong gain from the initiatives. We are getting some tailwind from our inventory position as well. But the initiatives have been very strong in terms of their performance. Yes. I think more time will help us understand if this is going to be -- if we're going to get to a new norm in terms of higher share gain. Thus far, we've committed to the share gain targets and we'll continue to talk to you about what we expect going forward. Thanks. Good morning. Yes. No, so let me just -- we're not showing experts on every segment, but I will give you some observations. And a lot of this probably has to do with what we've seen through the pandemic and coming out of the pandemic. So if you look at our segment performance in the appendix of the materials, you'll see that slower growth markets, but still growth markets are retail, which is a lot of distribution centers, typically for us, that market was way up the last couple of years. So that has certainly slowed down, but still growing. Health care and government have -- are still growing and have sort of accelerated recently again, but they were -- they're not as strong as general manufacturing, the industrial parts of the economy are certainly growing faster for us than the non-industrial parts right now. So that would be my observation. I think that's certainly consistent with what we're hearing from others as well. But I think the nice thing here is that we are seeing growth in all segments and the share gain is helping us. Yes. Yes. And I would say, and I'll just plug for the Analyst Day, we'll talk a little bit more about this during Analyst Day for sure. But what I would say is, the things we started earlier have proven to be very, very valuable around product information and publishing, which allows us to help -- helps our merchandising efforts and website efforts and print publications as well. And so we've seen really good results from that. We started to see really good results from the investments in customer information as well, in terms of things like improving seller coverage, improving marketing outreach, making sure we're sending the right message to the right customers. So we'll talk more in September about sort of what we have and what we plan to work on from a technology transformation, but we really like the signs we've seen so far, and we've had some very significant results. Yes. I mean, so with Zoro, what we've talked about is we're going to pass 10 million items this year, unique SKUs. We expect profitability to get to the high single digits over the next several years. It's on a very good path to do that. And from a return on invested capital perspective, it's obviously very profitable given it doesn't have the inventory position. So profitability is getting better. It's going to continue to get better. We think we can get to probably 20 million SKUs at a minimum through Zoro over time, but that's sort of a long-term effort, probably four or five-year effort to get there, we'd expect. And yes, and so competitive set wise, it's a lot of digital players that we see, and there's a lot of them out there, but we continue to perform well and I think we can gain share consistently through that model. Yes. So it's been a challenging labor market to say the least, over the last year or 1.5 years, I'd say. We feel like we are in a good position from a staffing perspective, particularly in areas that are so important like our distribution centers, we've been able to add significantly to our headcount. We still need to manage that effectively on an ongoing basis. And we're looking at what turnover we have, typically at the distribution center, if we -- our biggest turnover is in the first year, people come in, they don't realize the jobs as challenging as it is and may not like the job. So we do see high first year turnover once we get people through that first year, they typically stay and become long-term team members. That continues to be the dynamic, but it's been certainly challenging. We've had to hire a lot over the last couple of years, and we have a turnover in those population pools. Generally, we're very focused on making sure that we have the right staffing levels for the volume that we see and then not adding costs where it doesn't make sense in the business. So we are being careful about sort of headcount additions outside of areas that are sort of volume dependent. Yeah. So what I would say is the typical customer that we acquire is a small business customer. We have actually gotten out of some of the lower-value marketplaces where we weren't getting business users as frequently as you want. So mostly business customers and relatively small business customers. We are then really focused on getting those customers to repeat. And we've seen really nice results through MonotaRO or over the last year in terms of increasing repeat rates for existing customers. And so that's been a nice trend and a very positive trend. In terms of a downturn, we would expect the underlying growth to be able to sort of power through the downturn, we would be affected by the downturn, but we still think we'd have significant outgrowth from the Zoro model given the way the model works and what we've seen in other downturns in MonotaRO and other places. Good morning. So, do you mean inbound transportation or amount product cost or all of it? Okay, yeah. Yeah. So we have not -- we've seen a stabilizing of purchase prices from our suppliers. We have had fewer requests for price increases in the last several weeks than we had several months ago, for sure. But we really haven't seen any backtracking at this point. So it's stabilized, but still not -- not going down, going up slightly, going up less than it was going up. Well, of course, we don't know exactly what our competitors can get. So this is all speculation. It's still a pretty challenging availability market. There still is certainly, the China shutdown didn't help anything and there's still areas of supply that are challenged. So I suspect we still have an advantage on some level. And I think some of the things we've done with our product information, management system has helped us get to crosses, which has been very important in the last 1.5 years to be able to cross to a functional equivalent, so we can get -- if a product is not in stock, we can actually get customer solutions. So I think we have some advantages. And I would say that we are not out of the woods from a global supply chain in our industry yet. It's going to take some while to get out of this. Good morning. Well, I think one thing I would say is that, it's -- there's -- the signal to noise in some cases is probably lower than you'd like, if you're looking from the outside, because some competitors are taking price at different times. And so what's changed is, we know we are market price competitive now. And we spend a lot more time focused on that. And the pricing changes we've made have been in line with market. Now we may have taken them at different times, later, earlier, depending on how things go, but we we're very confident that we are market priced at this point. And that's our primary tenant for pricing. Yes. I think few additions are a big part of it. I also think that the customers we're going after are business customers. And so, I think, most of what you would see as compares in the digital space would not be business focused, so we think business customers are probably doing better than consumers online right now. And so that's a big part of it too. Yes. And just to -- I'll try to take this one. I think that the industrial manufacturers that are reporting higher inventory levels. My guess is that, most of that is actually WIP. When you visit customers now, there are many cases in which product is not MRO products. I will get to MRO product in a minute. The product generally is sitting around and you see it, and the reason it's sitting around is they don't have everything they need to actually produce. So they have strong demand, but they just can't get it out the door because they don't have everything they need to produce. And I've seen that at many, many customers that I visited in the last three or four months. I think that's the bigger issue. We don't -- our customers don't have stockpiles of MRO product. That's not the way it works. And in fact, our value proposition is to make sure they have only what they need. And so, our inventory management solutions and such, make sure that we don't have too much stock. And so -- and I'll talk with any customer, it was a backlog of MRO product. I do see supply chain-driven work in process inventory issues at a lot of manufacturers. Yes. I mean, of course, we haven't really gone through a period driven by a pandemic like this. So any answer here is speculative. I would say that more customer visits that I'm on, our ability to keep customers going has actually led to a lot stickier relationships led to us connecting more directly from a digital perspective, led to us managing our inventory pools, we see very strong growth with our key stock. And so things that we're doing on site are really valued right now. So I'm not overly concerned that, that will be a detriment. Are we going to grow outgrowth of 1,000 basis points every quarter now or not. But we feel like we can gain share consistently and that we've built the right relationships and processes to do that. We see nice increases in average order value for the Zoro business. And I think a lot of that has to do with whom we're targeting. We're targeting only business customers. And we found ways to avoid acquiring consumers, I would say, through that process that helps average order value. We expect that to continue to get a little bit better as we continue to refine our processes and continue to get more repeat business from these business customers. But we feel like we're on a trend. It's been a little bit better than we expected actually this year from an average order value. So, probably a little better than expected, but we're basically on the path we want to be. Hi, good morning. No, no, I got it. So, you're talking about our retail segment within Grainger. Just to make sure you understand what that is, that is a lot of distribution centers, some is e-commerce some is not. So, we do a lot of work with big retailers that are that are traditional as well in terms of helping them. We don't -- we expect that segment to grow slower the rest of the year versus other segments for sure. We don't typically give out sort of segment-level growth guidance, but we certainly are seeing trends that everybody is seeing. And again, I think there's -- the single noise there is probably not that as strong as it might otherwise be because what we saw during the pandemic was those channels explode. And so a lot of our growth was in retail, government, healthcare and now that's reversed because the compares are so high. So, I don't think it's like activity is not strong, it is. It's just not growing as fast as some of the other segments are. Correct. And the other thing I would say there to add to what Dee said is that the slowdown in inflation in the second half isn't really -- it's not resetting prices or lowering prices. It's basically the comparisons, because we started taking inflation last year in the back half of the year. So it's basically just on the compares to last year, that's the reason. Yeah. It is in the script. I think you said, we're running close to 21% on a constant currency basis. All right. Well, thanks for joining us. It's a pleasure to have you on. I hope you all get to enjoy the rest of your summer. As a quick reminder, we are hosting our Investor Day on Wednesday, September 21. We hope you can join us in person, if possible, at our Northeast Distribution Center in New Jersey or virtually. We really look forward to spending time with you there. And again, thanks for the time, and take care."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Kyle Bland, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me are DG MacPherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures, are found in the table at the end of this presentation and in our Q1 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on our first quarter 2022 results, which are consistent on both the reported and adjusted basis for all periods presented. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP, and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. Now, I'll turn it over to DG.\nDon Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our first quarter performance, and then pass it to Dee to walk through the financials in detail. I'll begin by quickly highlighting our strategic operating framework, the Grainger Edge. I am proud of our team members as we embrace the edge at every level of the organization and in everything we do day in and day out. This framework serves as the basis for our culture and define how we work together to serve our customers and communities. I'm excited to share that earlier this month, we were recognized as one of Fortune 100's -- Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. This award is attributed to team members across the organization. Turning to Slide 5. Not unlike the past 2 years, the first quarter of 2022 threw us some challenges, including the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, heightened inflationary pressures, supply chain and labor challenges and now the Russian war in Ukraine. I'd like to spend a few minutes on how we are managing through these challenges. First, we continue to manage through the highest inflationary period in our careers. On the cost side, we are leveraging our purchasing scale and working closely with our supplier partners to chart a shared path forward. Despite high inflation, our goal remains to be price competitive while targeting price/cost neutrality. On the supply chain front, we continue to work with our supplier and transportation partners to ensure products are available and delivered to customers on a timely basis. U.S. customer service levels are starting to improve as carrier capacity increases. Overseas freight remains pressured with delays, port congestion and container challenges and when coupled with increasing fuel prices, is pushing costs higher than historical trends. We expect these costs to remain elevated throughout the year. We remain focused on securing product for our customers as we navigate through the continued product shortages and delays. We expect the ongoing COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai and broader China will further challenge supply chains over the coming months. We have been increasing our inventory position since the middle of last year to maintain service levels and continue to monitor developments to stay ahead of the game. In my visits to our customers in Q1, I continue to hear that we are performing well, relative to the market, on securing product. We also continue to stay focused on hiring and maintaining competitive payroll and benefits to ensure we attract, engage and retain high-performing teams. This is especially important for customer-facing and support roles within our distribution and contact centers. We continue to receive feedback that Grainger is a great place to work, and our team members still value as they work to support our customers each day. We continue to invest in our strategic initiatives like marketing, remerchandising, KeepStock and technology. These efforts, coupled with our advantaged service, have allowed Grainger to have strong outgrowth versus the broader MRO market. Switching gears to our financials. Demand remained robust, and we finished the quarter with sales growth of 18.2% or 17.9% on a daily constant currency basis. Our results were driven by strong performance in both segments. High-Touch Solutions North America had exceptional daily sales growth of 18.2%. In the U.S., we outgrew the broader MRO market by 550 basis points for the quarter as our supply chain and inventory investments helped us meet our customers' needs. Total company gross profit margin finished the quarter at 37.9%, expanding 245 basis points over the prior-year first quarter. The largest component of our expansion over the prior year was lacking the pandemic-related inventory adjustment that we took in the first quarter of 2021. Even when excluding that adjustment, however, we were still up nicely year-over-year. We delivered 14.6% operating margin, an increase of 305 basis points over the prior year as the improved gross margin performance was further aided by top-line leverage and disciplined cost management. In the quarter, we delivered an adjusted ROIC of 41% and returned $163 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Yesterday, we announced an increase in our dividend, which marks our 51st year of consistent increases and continued commitment to our shareholders. As a result of our strong performance, we are raising our full-year 2022 guidance estimates. I continue to be impressed with how our team has come together to deliver such great results. Earlier this year, we talked about our focus areas for 2022, executing on our key growth initiatives, driving operational excellence and strengthening our culture. We've made strong progress in all 3 areas and continue to build the company for success. With that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on the quarter and our guidance. Dee?\nDee Merriwether: Thanks, DG. I'd like to echo DG's sentiments. Our execution and teamwork in the first quarter drove very strong results. Turning to Slide 8. We covered revenue and margins at the total company level, and I'll get into more detail on the segments in a minute. Before we do, I'd like to highlight a few other key points. Our total company SG&A as a percentage of sales was 23.3%, gaining solid leverage over the prior-period first quarter. Given our investments in the DCs at MonotaRO and our continued strategic initiatives in High-Touch Solutions, I am proud of the way the team concurrently managed these investments as well as operating expenses to support strong top-line performance in the quarter. Finally, resulting EPS in the quarter was $7.07, up 58% versus the first quarter of 2021. Turning now to our High-Touch Solutions segment for the first quarter. We continue to see strong results with daily sales up 18.2%, compared to the first quarter of 2021. We saw impressive growth across the board with double-digit revenue growth across all of our North American geographies and both large and midsize customers. In the U.S., we saw a strong price realization from our recent pricing actions and delivered strong growth in every end market, with particular strength in commercial, transportation and heavy manufacturing. In Canada, the economy has rallied back, and the business saw year-over-year sales growth in nearly every end market, with manufacturing especially strong this quarter. Canadian daily sales were up 10% or 11.8% in local days and local currency. For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 40.4%, up 310 basis points versus the prior year. If we exclude the first quarter 2021 pandemic product inventory adjustment, we still achieved gross margin expansion of roughly 80 basis points. This expansion was largely driven by favorable product mix and also aided by the return of the in-person Grainger Show in February. While the sale provided a modest tailwind in the quarter, it is expected to net out as we move through the balance of the year. Given the timing of price and cost increases in the quarter, our price/cost spread was favorable. However, when netted against increased freight costs, it was largely neutral. I'll also note that our pandemic mix at the end of the quarter was back to near prepandemic levels at just above 20% of sales mix, and we continue to see similar results through the first few weeks of April. While we have included our pandemic-related sales in the appendix for this period, given that we have returned to prepandemic mix levels, we do not expect to provide this information in subsequent quarters. At the operating margin line, we saw improvement of 395 basis points year-over-year as the strong gross margin recovery was aided by 85 basis points of operational expense leverage. Overall, an extremely solid quarter for the High-Touch Solutions North American segment. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market grew between 12.5% and 13.5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 550 basis points of market outgrowth in the quarter. As I've gone out and spent time with customers and investors over the last few months, we often are asked about the drivers of our share gain. We know our supply chain scale and our ability to deliver products to customers has been strong. We also know that by focusing on and investing in the right areas like remerchandising our assortment, increasing our use of analytically-driven marketing and improving the effectiveness of our salesforce, we can consistently deliver growth above the market. We continue to execute well, and our goal to achieve 300 to 400 basis points of annual market outgrowth remains intact. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 12.1% or 10.4% on a daily basis. Results were heavily impacted by foreign exchange, given the depreciation of the Japanese yen. In local currency and local days, MonotaRO achieved 18.4% growth, whereas Zoro U.S. daily sales were up over 19%, both very strong. Growth continues to be driven by new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO and MonotaRO's continued success with enterprise customers. GP expanded 10 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021, while operating margins declined 95 basis points as planned. This decline was primarily a result of our increased DC investments at MonotaRO and was partially offset by Zoro's operating margin expansion, which improved 90 basis points over the first quarter of 2021 on strong GP improvement. Please note the slide covering channel-specific performance for Zoro and MonotaRO is included in the appendix. In addition, we've also continued to see positive results in our key operating metrics. On Slide 12, you can see registered users are up 20% over the prior period. You'll see the count of registered users for Zoro has been restated for prior reporting. In 2021, Zoro made a strategic pivot away from certain less productive channels, allowing them to focus on more profitable B2B customers, who also have a higher likelihood to make repeat purchases. These all drives higher lifetime-value customers to Zoro. As a result, we've elected to remove these customers from this metric, which lowers the nominal user count for Zoro, but the growth rate remains relatively consistent to what we have shown in the past. We think this is a more accurate way to reflect this metric, and we will use this new definition, going forward. On the right, we show the continued growth of the Zoro SKU portfolio. We are targeting around 2 million SKU additions again in 2022 and are off to a good start as we continue to onboard more strategic third-party partner -- supplier partners. Now looking forward to the rest of the year. We're off to a great start and results remained strong in April, with total company daily sales trending up around 20%. While we don't typically adjust our guidance expectations after a quarter and acknowledge the broad market uncertainty, our conversations with customers' results to date and continued momentum give us confidence to make a change at this time. As a result, we are raising our 2022 full-year guidance. Our new outlook includes expected daily sales growth between 11% and 14% and EPS between $25 and $27, representing over 30% earnings growth year-over-year at the midpoint. We've also updated our supplemental guidance in the appendix, which reflects a slight upward revision in the High-Touch Solutions operating margin and an increase in total company operating cash flow. With that, I'll turn it back to DG for some closing remarks.\nDon Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I would make just a few comments. First, we performed extremely well in the quarter. I'm proud of the team and the way we've executed, focused on serving customers well and navigated through some of the bigger challenges that we discussed at the beginning of the call. We continue to execute on our growth drivers, drive operational excellence and strengthen our culture. We are well positioned to continue serving customers well and they have a very strong 2022. As we shared last quarter, I'm excited to provide some information on our upcoming Investor Day. We will be hosting it on Wednesday, September 21 at our Northeast distribution center in Bordentown, New Jersey. We will be focused on providing more details on our strategic initiatives and longer-term outlook, as well as provide a tour of our DC, where we will highlight some of our automation and ESG investments at work. More detailed information will be available in the coming weeks, and we certainly look forward to an exciting day. With that, we will open up the lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Jake Levinson from Melius Research.\nJake Levinson: I just wanted to see if we could get a little bit more color on what's happening with our neighbors in the North. I know you folks used to break that out a little bit separately, but maybe you can just give us an update on how things are progressing in Canada. It seems like the end markets have finally turned in your favor, but are we kind of on the sustainable path to profitability there?\nDon Macpherson: Yes, yes. It's a great question. Thanks for asking. So I think the business is on a very sustainable path to profitability. We have reset the way the business operates over the last 3 or 4 years. We're seeing signs of share gain returning into that business. The cost structure is in a good place, and we're seeing growth with some attractive customer segments, most notably manufacturing in healthcare. And that business just continues to get better and better, from a profitability perspective, and it's steady, and it's going to continue to be a steady rise in profitability, but we feel pretty good about the path we're on.\nJake Levinson: Okay. That's helpful. And then, just as a quick follow-up, I'm looking at the safety side of the business. You mentioned that, that's back to kind of prepandemic levels as a percent of sales. I guess the question is, what does the new normal look like for your customers, in terms of buying those products? Obviously, the mandates seem to be changing or social norms around mask-wearing and what not, so are your customers still buying masks and hand sanitizer and things like that at elevated rates, I guess, you could say?\nDon Macpherson: Yes. I think Dee talked about it. We're pretty much back to prepandemic mix. I'd say, there's a slight elevation in some of those products. I can't really predict what customer behavior is going to be around those products, given the way the virus proceeds. But what I will say is that we see most customers going back to some normalcy. I've been in a number of manufacturing plants the last couple of weeks. And in almost all cases, there isn't a lot of new PPE versus what was borne in 2019 being used. So we don't expect it to be hugely elevated, mask and sanitizer sales, going forward. And we're pretty much back to normal, still elevated, but not that much.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Ryan Merkel from William Blair.\nRyan Merkel: First off, I was hoping you could unpack the comment you made about speaking with customers and they expressed a lot of confidence about demand. In particular, I'm curious if you spoke with energy customers, if they're seeing a big uplift here?\nDon Macpherson: I can give you my perspective and Dee, if you've talked to customers that have a different perspective. I have not talked to all that many energy customers. I have talked to a lot of heavy manufacturing, line manufacturing commercial customers. And despite -- we talked about -- a little bit about it despite sort of the uncertainty of the world, everybody right now would say super busy, just hanging on. If I can get the supply chain parts into my operation, I have the demand, and we see that through most of the customers that we're talking to, right now. So a lot of positivity. I haven't been -- I'm trying to think, it's been a while since I've been in an energy plant. So I don't have that perspective. But generally, customers are pretty bullish on demand, right now.\nDee Merriwether: I was just going to concur. My time with customers is similar to DG's experience up to this point in the year.\nRyan Merkel: All right. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, what really stood out to me was the profit margin in the High-Touch business. And I'm curious, the guidance seems to imply that 1Q will be the high watermark. So can you just unpack why that might be the case?\nDon Macpherson: Sure. Dee, do you want to take that one?\nDee Merriwether: Yes. So when we talked about guidance last year, I think a lot of the underlying assumptions really stick, even with some strong performance up to this point. We, of course, had to lap for the E&O adjustments. The first quarter is the time when we work with our suppliers on some of our largest price increases in line with our cost cycle that we work with them. I know the cost cycle has been a little unusual, but I will say, the seasonality related to our price changes, we are assuming the same types of outcomes. So you are exactly right. We feel like Q1 will be a higher watermark as it relates to that, and we will moderate as we go through the year. Again, some of the tenants are the same. We're still focusing on price/cost neutrality and remaining price competitive in this market.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: So I wanted to just return to Canada. That business, in days gone by, it was tracking low double digits until the oil and gas bubble burst in 2014, but any reason why it can't get back to those kinds of levels? I mean there's been some changes in the business profile and the cost base. So just curious on that. And then on the midsized customer margins, they used to be running, I think, about 10 points above the average in that segment. Are they still in that kind of zone?\nDon Macpherson: I think, Nigel, your question on Canada is revenue growth, can we get back to sort of double-digit revenue growth, is that your question?\nNigel Coe: No, no, no. Margins, margins.\nDon Macpherson: Oh, margins, yes. Yes. Structurally, we don't think there's any reason why we can't get there. Given the path of the business, we're focused on sequential improvement, and we do feel like we can build to that, but it's going to take multiple years to get back to that 10%. They're going on a good path. I am very confident that we will continue to improve margins in Canada. But structurally, there's no reason why we can't get back to double-digit margins there. And then Dee, do you want to take the second half of that?\nDee Merriwether: Yes. Yes. And on midsized customers, I think it's a good assumption now to use high single-digit number.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's great. And then just April, any comments on how April has been tracking relative to the strength to the 1Q?\nDon Macpherson: Very well. It's -- Dee mentioned that it's 20%. It's, if anything, it's been slightly better than what we saw for 1Q revenue in April. But generally, it's very, very good.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from David Manthey from Baird.\nDavid Manthey: And congrats on the Fortune designation. It's a great honor. Could you please update us on High-Touch and some of your efforts there? I mean you had really nice outgrowth, and I'm trying to understand the factors there. I'm sure it's a combination of these things. But if you could talk about customer receptivity? And then, any idiosyncratic things that are going on there, in terms of a better offering or changes in incentives, anything that you're doing inside Grainger to drive those better results?\nDon Macpherson: Yes. And we've talked about some of these things before. The primary initiatives for us are around continuing to improve our product assortment through merchandising efforts and making it easy for customers to find what they need. We continue to make great progress there. We see cause and effect in terms of driving share gain through that effort. Our marketing efforts, we're getting more capable in terms of marketing, spending money in the right places and getting really strong returns out of marketing, and that's a big piece of it. We see a nice expansion of our KeepStock offer, so becoming more integrated with our customers' inventory management practices and supporting their inventory management practices. Those are things that have been very consistent and are a bit evergreen for us at this point, in the sense that we're always getting better at those and we -- those -- cause actually drive significant share gain. I don't think there's really anything even idiosyncratic. I think the core thing that we are working on, I would add providing better insights to our customers to help them manage their business, they cost out, and I think we're getting better and better at that as well. But the only idiosyncratic thing would probably be supply chain related. I think, through this time, we've done a better job than most of managing, adding product of finding customers' substitute products, if we don't have products, and being able to serve them. And so we're probably getting some -- it's hard to quantify from just having inventory and being able to serve customers where others cannot.\nDavid Manthey: Got it. That sounds good. And then just quickly, if you could zoom out on gross margin kind of 5-year plus sort of basis. Do you expect gross margin to continue to decline gradually over time, all else equal?\nDon Macpherson: Yes, go ahead, Dee. You can take that.\nDee Merriwether: I was going to add that -- DG, you can continue on. In the High-Touch business, we've kind of noted, specifically for this year, that we're focusing on gross margin stability around 40%. And DG, were you going to talk about the outlook?\nDon Macpherson: Yes. Yes. I mean -- so what I would say is, we feel like we are price competitive at the gross margins we're at. We feel like within the High-Touch, the 40% number is going to be a fairly stable number over time. Our company gross margins are likely to go down slightly, just given the assortment growth continues to be -- to grow faster than the business, and then they tend to operate at a lower gross margin and lower SG&A. But in terms of the segment performance, we actually expect pretty stable gross margins over the next several years.\nOperator: Your next question today is coming from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.\nJoshPokrzywinski: Just first question, I guess, a clarification. Dee, you mentioned, I think, in some of your opening remarks about kind of a seasonal benefit in 1Q kind of tied into a sales event in February, I just -- starting to unpack -- hoping to unpack that a little bit more and maybe add some numbers to it.\nDee Merriwether: Well, sure. Yes. We returned to an in-person Grainger show in Orlando in February. That's what I meant in my prepared remarks related to a show. It was really great to be back in person. Our show was well attended. We heard great feedback from our customers and from our team members. From a Q1 GP perspective, the show provides a modest tailwind for us year-over-year. And that's due to supplier funding, as you can imagine. And this favorable impact through the year will moderate versus prior year as we will go through the year.\nJoshPokrzywinski: Okay. Got it.\nDee Merriwether: Verified [ph].\nJoshPokrzywinski: Understood. And then a competitor of yours, pretty recently, talked about some supply chain stabilization, maybe not seeing as much inbound inflation outside of freight-related items. What would the Grainger take on that be? I mean, obviously, the freight environment has gotten more difficult, and China has a bit more of wild COVID lockdowns. But would that be your take as well? Or do you see that differently?\nDon Macpherson: We certainly have seen some improvement in -- particularly, domestic freight, in terms of service. And price increases have certainly moderated. They were starting to moderate a little bit on ocean freight as well with the lockdown in China. You know how that's going to play out. But yes, we would say something similar, where things were easing a little bit and continue to do that domestically, the overseas piece is probably the more complicated .\nOperator: And your next question is coming from Chris Snyder from UBS.\nChris Snyder: I guess, so first, I kind of wanted to follow up on DG's prior commentary around the longer-term gross margin drivers. And certainly, I understand that Endless Assortment outgrowth is a structural gross margin, I don't have the consolidated level. But what gives the company confidence that it can hold business line, gross margin steady beyond '22? This is a pretty competitive business. So it is the midsized outgrowth. What gives you on that?\nDon Macpherson: Yes. I think, just working with our customers, understanding the value we provide, the value we create, seeing some midsized outgrowth and having confidence as we continue to return to more industrial product as we've seen. We just feel like our price is in a competitive place. And we can continue to support our customers and provide what they need and sell on the value that we provide. And that's really what our business is based on. And we're going to continue to do that.\nChris Snyder: All right. And then I wanted to also follow up on the last question and commentary around potentially maybe easing some of the domestic freight costs or supply chain, and I understand that part of it. But has supply chains overall eased? Or has procurement gotten more difficult with the China shutdowns, even at -- some of the domestic freight market has opened up a little bit?\nDon Macpherson: Yes. So I would first comment that the China shutdown is going to take weeks and maybe longer for that to flow through, in terms of understanding the impact. I would say that ex that, what we were seeing before was still significant supply chain challenges but more isolated to specific suppliers that were having trouble getting product to meet their manufacturing needs. And so it wasn't as widespread as transportation improved. And we do buy a lot domestically as well. And so for customers that have the materials that we haven't seen, labor has gotten a little bit better and transportation got a little bit better. There's still plenty of pockets of challenges though. And we still see -- it's still a challenged supply chain, from our suppliers' perspective, in many cases, but it is more isolated to specific suppliers rather than -- it was broad-based this time last year. You would have just said, it was kind of chaos, and it's less chaos now, but there's still plenty of challenges.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies.\nHans Hoffman: This is Hans Hoffman filling in for Hamzah Mazari. My first question is just on the cyclicality of the portfolio today. Can you just walk us through how to think about how your business performed in a recession? And maybe any differences in the mix of the portfolio today versus past downturns?\nDon Macpherson: You're talking about if there's a recession, how have we performed in past recessions? Is that your question?\nHans Hoffman: Yes. Yes, yes. If there's any difference in the mix of the portfolio today versus past downturns.\nDon Macpherson: I don't think -- so to answer the second part first, I don't think there's a significant change in the mix of the portfolio. We have more on those assortment business, but I don't -- that will probably perform similarly. The short answer is, we generally perform well in downturns. We look at share gain during downturns, and it's usually been very good. Part of that is because we are steadfast in maintaining service to customers in downturns, and that allows us to serve customers better than many others can. And we generally still generate a whole bunch of cash during downturns and still perform well. Obviously, everybody takes a hit. We take a financial -- you can go back and look at 2008, '09, is probably the most severe one we've had, and you can model what happened there. But we're -- one of the things that I would sort of say is, we are -- while we don't know when a recession will hit, we are certainly aware of the uncertainties of the world and we are being very mindful of the cost of running the business. So we are prepared for anything that happens. But in general, we performed well, and we would expect to do that again.\nHans Hoffman: Great. And then, could you just walk us through where your market share is today with midsized customers? And what the total addressable market there is?\nDon Macpherson: Yes. So -- and Dee, do you want to -- you may have the details. Roughly, if you go back over a kind of 10-, 12-year period, we were at about $2 billion of midsized customers. We dropped below $1 billion. We're now, I think, $1.5 billion or more, $1.6 billion, maybe this year, something like that, is the expectation. We're still to and change market share with midsized customers. We feel like we've got a long road ahead. And we continue to do a really nice job of reacquiring customers that left us, and then growing with existing customers and building solid relationships. So we think we've got a long runway, in terms of share gain, with midsized customers.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: But DG, I was hoping you could expand on what types of products are in short supply? Did you have any missed sales because you would blame it on the supply chain?\nDon Macpherson: No, I wouldn't say we had many missed sales. We have -- I mentioned this a little bit before, more than ever, probably we're relying on some of our product information investments to make sure we can get customers to substitutes. But we wouldn't have any sort of things that wouldn't be in the news already. Obviously, if a product has a chip in it, that's been a challenge. There are certain commodity products that have been challenged. So I won't call out specific products, but I would say, we've done a nice job of finding alternatives in most cases, and it's hard to argue that we're missing too many sales. I'm sure we are missing some sales and they're just not occurring because nobody has those products.\nDeane Dray: That's helpful. And then just qualitatively, can you comment on the mix with regard to a typical reopening? Coming out of the pandemic, you've got a number of your customers opening up shop, back to work. And so that's when Grainger typically gets a nice lift as they haven't restocked their shelves but now they have to. So you typically get a bigger lift during the, like reopening or restarting process. Is that still reading across in your North America businesses? Or is this kind of the steady MRO run rate?\nDon Macpherson: This is -- first of all, we have not had many customers that closed shop. I mean, we've been with our customers throughout. There were a few in certain categories that shut down. So if you said cruise lines, which we have cruise line customers, obviously, they shut down. And you'd see a little bit of that type of growth potentially there, but it's a very small portion. Hospitals, governments, manufacturing plants, retail organizations in terms of distribution centers have all been open the whole time. So one of the things that's been maybe surprising through the pandemic is just how consistent the growth has been. If you go back to 2019, we've seen substantial growth, and we saw really growth only in the front end of the pandemic in 2022 that we really see a drop because most customers actually kept operating. And so, I think it's just normal business. We don't see much restocking going on.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Chris Dankert from Loop Capital.\nChris Dankert: I guess, and forgive me if I've missed it, but can we get a little bit more detail on the Zoro strategic pivot? I mean, it sounds like you're moving more into productive channels. I mean, does this merely change the TAM? Does it change the growth outlook for that business? Was it a margin-driven decision? Any color on that strategy change would be great.\nDon Macpherson: Yes. We've been making a strategic pivot with that business for the last several years, dramatically expanding the product line, building new data analytics capabilities, getting that business independent from a technology stack. So there's been a lot of investment that's happened. In terms of the question specifically you're asking, we have done a whole bunch of analysis, working with the team in Japan, on customer profitability. And customer profitability, not in terms of the first transaction but in terms of lifetime value. And we are skewing our efforts to attractive business customers. And so what you've seen is dropped some volume that we certainly could have in the short term because it's just not helpful in terms of creating a profitable long-term business. I think, ultimately, it actually will accelerate our growth rate as we get better at acquiring and getting attractive customers to the second, third order, where they become more frequent buyers. But certainly, we have made a little bit of a shift in getting out of some channels that were lower lifetime.\nChris Dankert: Got it. That's really, really helpful. I guess, kind of, with that as a backdrop, any kind of color you're able to provide in terms of kind of price versus volume inside of the Zoro business this quarter?\nDon Macpherson: I think the price volume wasn't much different than what we saw in the whole business that we talked about before. So high single-digit price and substantial volume growth is what we're seeing in that business at this point.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: So I appreciate the comments that reopening isn't causing really episodic demand that you can really think of. But I think Dee maybe referred to some idiosyncratic benefit from competitors that are in relatively less supply chain wherewithal than you getting product through. I think, historically, when you accrue volumes in customers, it's pretty sticky base for continued scaling. So I just wanted to kind of revisit that there might be some reversion, once everyone has sort of democratic access to process or to procurement. But yes, just -- I'll listen from there.\nDon Macpherson: Yes. It's a great question. I think what I'm hearing from customers is, most of the work that we've done has been highly valued to support their operations and to keep them up and running. And in many cases, we've actually added inventory management solutions to our KeepStock solutions or further embedded in customers really, really want to continue to have long-term relationships. So you could argue there may be some pullback, but that's really not the behavior we're seeing, and it's not what we're hearing from our customers. Our customers are saying, if anything, we've learned a whole lot about who we want to partner with and why we want to partner with them through this. And our ability to keep customers going is super valued, and I think it will continue to help us be sticky with those customers.\nOperator: Our next question today is coming from Patrick Baumann from JPMorgan.\nPatrick Baumann: Can you talk about the approach to pricing this year? Should we assume the 8% in the first quarter is a good level to work from now? Or have you taken more actions that are providing another boost here in April and for the rest of the year?\nDon Macpherson: Yes. Dee, why don't you -- do you want to jump in? I can not hear you, Dee. I can take it then. So what we basically have been looking at is, we took price, obviously, through some of the back half of last year as well, as everybody has. We think prices will moderate a bit. So we don't think the level we're at will be the full-year number year-over-year because we think that the price increases will moderate. That doesn't mean prices will go down, they won't. But relative to some of the changes that we made last year, you'll start to see a bit slower -- a lower difference. So we would expect them to moderate somewhat, still a pretty healthy price, obviously, this year.\nPatrick Baumann: Got it. And then with all this -- oh, sorry, Dee, go ahead.\nDee Merriwether: Yes. Sorry, I don't know, there was a problem with my line, I apologize for that. Yes, we -- in High-Touch U.S., I know specifically, we usually talk a little bit about our pricing outlook. And so we're expecting price to be about 6 to 7 for the year.\nPatrick Baumann: Helpful. And then with all the pricing and the positive price/cost in the first quarter, just curious, why you aren't able to increase the gross margin guide? Can you just talk about the puts and takes there? And whether you may see some benefit if cost inflation moderates, given that the LIFO accounting dynamic you mentioned last quarter?\nDee Merriwether: Yes. So we've kind of usually talked about the lumpiness of price for us and how it impacts gross margin through the year, with a large portion of our High-Touch U.S. business being contract based. So in light of still saying suppliers continue to come in, with cost inflation request and our ability to continue to work with them on that, when we look at the outlook, we believe that staying in line with our current gross margin is most feasible right now, knowing that we're going to have some lumpiness as we continue to appropriately pass through some inflation as it comes through off-cycle. As the year progresses, as you know, the math works, you have less months to push some of that through.\nOperator: We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to DG for any further closing comments.\nDon Macpherson: Sure. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. It is a pleasure to have you on and hope you're all doing well. I would just reiterate the fact that we're completely focused on what we can control, and that's making sure we advance our strategic initiatives to grow profitably. Building the culture, we think, is really, really important and making sure that we serve our customers well. And while there are many things going on, the market right now is very, very strong, and we feel good about the share gain performance we're getting. We feel good about what we're seeing in both models. And really optimistic for the future. So thanks. I hope you all have a great rest of the week, and take care.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Don Macpherson",
            "content": "Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our first quarter performance, and then pass it to Dee to walk through the financials in detail. I'll begin by quickly highlighting our strategic operating framework, the Grainger Edge. I am proud of our team members as we embrace the edge at every level of the organization and in everything we do day in and day out. This framework serves as the basis for our culture and define how we work together to serve our customers and communities. I'm excited to share that earlier this month, we were recognized as one of Fortune 100's -- Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. This award is attributed to team members across the organization. Turning to Slide 5. Not unlike the past 2 years, the first quarter of 2022 threw us some challenges, including the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, heightened inflationary pressures, supply chain and labor challenges and now the Russian war in Ukraine. I'd like to spend a few minutes on how we are managing through these challenges. First, we continue to manage through the highest inflationary period in our careers. On the cost side, we are leveraging our purchasing scale and working closely with our supplier partners to chart a shared path forward. Despite high inflation, our goal remains to be price competitive while targeting price/cost neutrality. On the supply chain front, we continue to work with our supplier and transportation partners to ensure products are available and delivered to customers on a timely basis. U.S. customer service levels are starting to improve as carrier capacity increases. Overseas freight remains pressured with delays, port congestion and container challenges and when coupled with increasing fuel prices, is pushing costs higher than historical trends. We expect these costs to remain elevated throughout the year. We remain focused on securing product for our customers as we navigate through the continued product shortages and delays. We expect the ongoing COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai and broader China will further challenge supply chains over the coming months. We have been increasing our inventory position since the middle of last year to maintain service levels and continue to monitor developments to stay ahead of the game. In my visits to our customers in Q1, I continue to hear that we are performing well, relative to the market, on securing product. We also continue to stay focused on hiring and maintaining competitive payroll and benefits to ensure we attract, engage and retain high-performing teams. This is especially important for customer-facing and support roles within our distribution and contact centers. We continue to receive feedback that Grainger is a great place to work, and our team members still value as they work to support our customers each day. We continue to invest in our strategic initiatives like marketing, remerchandising, KeepStock and technology. These efforts, coupled with our advantaged service, have allowed Grainger to have strong outgrowth versus the broader MRO market. Switching gears to our financials. Demand remained robust, and we finished the quarter with sales growth of 18.2% or 17.9% on a daily constant currency basis. Our results were driven by strong performance in both segments. High-Touch Solutions North America had exceptional daily sales growth of 18.2%. In the U.S., we outgrew the broader MRO market by 550 basis points for the quarter as our supply chain and inventory investments helped us meet our customers' needs. Total company gross profit margin finished the quarter at 37.9%, expanding 245 basis points over the prior-year first quarter. The largest component of our expansion over the prior year was lacking the pandemic-related inventory adjustment that we took in the first quarter of 2021. Even when excluding that adjustment, however, we were still up nicely year-over-year. We delivered 14.6% operating margin, an increase of 305 basis points over the prior year as the improved gross margin performance was further aided by top-line leverage and disciplined cost management. In the quarter, we delivered an adjusted ROIC of 41% and returned $163 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Yesterday, we announced an increase in our dividend, which marks our 51st year of consistent increases and continued commitment to our shareholders. As a result of our strong performance, we are raising our full-year 2022 guidance estimates. I continue to be impressed with how our team has come together to deliver such great results. Earlier this year, we talked about our focus areas for 2022, executing on our key growth initiatives, driving operational excellence and strengthening our culture. We've made strong progress in all 3 areas and continue to build the company for success. With that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on the quarter and our guidance. Dee? Thank you, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I would make just a few comments. First, we performed extremely well in the quarter. I'm proud of the team and the way we've executed, focused on serving customers well and navigated through some of the bigger challenges that we discussed at the beginning of the call. We continue to execute on our growth drivers, drive operational excellence and strengthen our culture. We are well positioned to continue serving customers well and they have a very strong 2022. As we shared last quarter, I'm excited to provide some information on our upcoming Investor Day. We will be hosting it on Wednesday, September 21 at our Northeast distribution center in Bordentown, New Jersey. We will be focused on providing more details on our strategic initiatives and longer-term outlook, as well as provide a tour of our DC, where we will highlight some of our automation and ESG investments at work. More detailed information will be available in the coming weeks, and we certainly look forward to an exciting day. With that, we will open up the lines for questions. Yes, yes. It's a great question. Thanks for asking. So I think the business is on a very sustainable path to profitability. We have reset the way the business operates over the last 3 or 4 years. We're seeing signs of share gain returning into that business. The cost structure is in a good place, and we're seeing growth with some attractive customer segments, most notably manufacturing in healthcare. And that business just continues to get better and better, from a profitability perspective, and it's steady, and it's going to continue to be a steady rise in profitability, but we feel pretty good about the path we're on. Yes. I think Dee talked about it. We're pretty much back to prepandemic mix. I'd say, there's a slight elevation in some of those products. I can't really predict what customer behavior is going to be around those products, given the way the virus proceeds. But what I will say is that we see most customers going back to some normalcy. I've been in a number of manufacturing plants the last couple of weeks. And in almost all cases, there isn't a lot of new PPE versus what was borne in 2019 being used. So we don't expect it to be hugely elevated, mask and sanitizer sales, going forward. And we're pretty much back to normal, still elevated, but not that much. I can give you my perspective and Dee, if you've talked to customers that have a different perspective. I have not talked to all that many energy customers. I have talked to a lot of heavy manufacturing, line manufacturing commercial customers. And despite -- we talked about -- a little bit about it despite sort of the uncertainty of the world, everybody right now would say super busy, just hanging on. If I can get the supply chain parts into my operation, I have the demand, and we see that through most of the customers that we're talking to, right now. So a lot of positivity. I haven't been -- I'm trying to think, it's been a while since I've been in an energy plant. So I don't have that perspective. But generally, customers are pretty bullish on demand, right now. Sure. Dee, do you want to take that one? I think, Nigel, your question on Canada is revenue growth, can we get back to sort of double-digit revenue growth, is that your question? Oh, margins, yes. Yes. Structurally, we don't think there's any reason why we can't get there. Given the path of the business, we're focused on sequential improvement, and we do feel like we can build to that, but it's going to take multiple years to get back to that 10%. They're going on a good path. I am very confident that we will continue to improve margins in Canada. But structurally, there's no reason why we can't get back to double-digit margins there. And then Dee, do you want to take the second half of that? Very well. It's -- Dee mentioned that it's 20%. It's, if anything, it's been slightly better than what we saw for 1Q revenue in April. But generally, it's very, very good. Yes. And we've talked about some of these things before. The primary initiatives for us are around continuing to improve our product assortment through merchandising efforts and making it easy for customers to find what they need. We continue to make great progress there. We see cause and effect in terms of driving share gain through that effort. Our marketing efforts, we're getting more capable in terms of marketing, spending money in the right places and getting really strong returns out of marketing, and that's a big piece of it. We see a nice expansion of our KeepStock offer, so becoming more integrated with our customers' inventory management practices and supporting their inventory management practices. Those are things that have been very consistent and are a bit evergreen for us at this point, in the sense that we're always getting better at those and we -- those -- cause actually drive significant share gain. I don't think there's really anything even idiosyncratic. I think the core thing that we are working on, I would add providing better insights to our customers to help them manage their business, they cost out, and I think we're getting better and better at that as well. But the only idiosyncratic thing would probably be supply chain related. I think, through this time, we've done a better job than most of managing, adding product of finding customers' substitute products, if we don't have products, and being able to serve them. And so we're probably getting some -- it's hard to quantify from just having inventory and being able to serve customers where others cannot. Yes, go ahead, Dee. You can take that. Yes. Yes. I mean -- so what I would say is, we feel like we are price competitive at the gross margins we're at. We feel like within the High-Touch, the 40% number is going to be a fairly stable number over time. Our company gross margins are likely to go down slightly, just given the assortment growth continues to be -- to grow faster than the business, and then they tend to operate at a lower gross margin and lower SG&A. But in terms of the segment performance, we actually expect pretty stable gross margins over the next several years. We certainly have seen some improvement in -- particularly, domestic freight, in terms of service. And price increases have certainly moderated. They were starting to moderate a little bit on ocean freight as well with the lockdown in China. You know how that's going to play out. But yes, we would say something similar, where things were easing a little bit and continue to do that domestically, the overseas piece is probably the more complicated . Yes. I think, just working with our customers, understanding the value we provide, the value we create, seeing some midsized outgrowth and having confidence as we continue to return to more industrial product as we've seen. We just feel like our price is in a competitive place. And we can continue to support our customers and provide what they need and sell on the value that we provide. And that's really what our business is based on. And we're going to continue to do that. Yes. So I would first comment that the China shutdown is going to take weeks and maybe longer for that to flow through, in terms of understanding the impact. I would say that ex that, what we were seeing before was still significant supply chain challenges but more isolated to specific suppliers that were having trouble getting product to meet their manufacturing needs. And so it wasn't as widespread as transportation improved. And we do buy a lot domestically as well. And so for customers that have the materials that we haven't seen, labor has gotten a little bit better and transportation got a little bit better. There's still plenty of pockets of challenges though. And we still see -- it's still a challenged supply chain, from our suppliers' perspective, in many cases, but it is more isolated to specific suppliers rather than -- it was broad-based this time last year. You would have just said, it was kind of chaos, and it's less chaos now, but there's still plenty of challenges. You're talking about if there's a recession, how have we performed in past recessions? Is that your question? I don't think -- so to answer the second part first, I don't think there's a significant change in the mix of the portfolio. We have more on those assortment business, but I don't -- that will probably perform similarly. The short answer is, we generally perform well in downturns. We look at share gain during downturns, and it's usually been very good. Part of that is because we are steadfast in maintaining service to customers in downturns, and that allows us to serve customers better than many others can. And we generally still generate a whole bunch of cash during downturns and still perform well. Obviously, everybody takes a hit. We take a financial -- you can go back and look at 2008, '09, is probably the most severe one we've had, and you can model what happened there. But we're -- one of the things that I would sort of say is, we are -- while we don't know when a recession will hit, we are certainly aware of the uncertainties of the world and we are being very mindful of the cost of running the business. So we are prepared for anything that happens. But in general, we performed well, and we would expect to do that again. Yes. So -- and Dee, do you want to -- you may have the details. Roughly, if you go back over a kind of 10-, 12-year period, we were at about $2 billion of midsized customers. We dropped below $1 billion. We're now, I think, $1.5 billion or more, $1.6 billion, maybe this year, something like that, is the expectation. We're still to and change market share with midsized customers. We feel like we've got a long road ahead. And we continue to do a really nice job of reacquiring customers that left us, and then growing with existing customers and building solid relationships. So we think we've got a long runway, in terms of share gain, with midsized customers. No, I wouldn't say we had many missed sales. We have -- I mentioned this a little bit before, more than ever, probably we're relying on some of our product information investments to make sure we can get customers to substitutes. But we wouldn't have any sort of things that wouldn't be in the news already. Obviously, if a product has a chip in it, that's been a challenge. There are certain commodity products that have been challenged. So I won't call out specific products, but I would say, we've done a nice job of finding alternatives in most cases, and it's hard to argue that we're missing too many sales. I'm sure we are missing some sales and they're just not occurring because nobody has those products. This is -- first of all, we have not had many customers that closed shop. I mean, we've been with our customers throughout. There were a few in certain categories that shut down. So if you said cruise lines, which we have cruise line customers, obviously, they shut down. And you'd see a little bit of that type of growth potentially there, but it's a very small portion. Hospitals, governments, manufacturing plants, retail organizations in terms of distribution centers have all been open the whole time. So one of the things that's been maybe surprising through the pandemic is just how consistent the growth has been. If you go back to 2019, we've seen substantial growth, and we saw really growth only in the front end of the pandemic in 2022 that we really see a drop because most customers actually kept operating. And so, I think it's just normal business. We don't see much restocking going on. Yes. We've been making a strategic pivot with that business for the last several years, dramatically expanding the product line, building new data analytics capabilities, getting that business independent from a technology stack. So there's been a lot of investment that's happened. In terms of the question specifically you're asking, we have done a whole bunch of analysis, working with the team in Japan, on customer profitability. And customer profitability, not in terms of the first transaction but in terms of lifetime value. And we are skewing our efforts to attractive business customers. And so what you've seen is dropped some volume that we certainly could have in the short term because it's just not helpful in terms of creating a profitable long-term business. I think, ultimately, it actually will accelerate our growth rate as we get better at acquiring and getting attractive customers to the second, third order, where they become more frequent buyers. But certainly, we have made a little bit of a shift in getting out of some channels that were lower lifetime. I think the price volume wasn't much different than what we saw in the whole business that we talked about before. So high single-digit price and substantial volume growth is what we're seeing in that business at this point. Yes. It's a great question. I think what I'm hearing from customers is, most of the work that we've done has been highly valued to support their operations and to keep them up and running. And in many cases, we've actually added inventory management solutions to our KeepStock solutions or further embedded in customers really, really want to continue to have long-term relationships. So you could argue there may be some pullback, but that's really not the behavior we're seeing, and it's not what we're hearing from our customers. Our customers are saying, if anything, we've learned a whole lot about who we want to partner with and why we want to partner with them through this. And our ability to keep customers going is super valued, and I think it will continue to help us be sticky with those customers. Yes. Dee, why don't you -- do you want to jump in? I can not hear you, Dee. I can take it then. So what we basically have been looking at is, we took price, obviously, through some of the back half of last year as well, as everybody has. We think prices will moderate a bit. So we don't think the level we're at will be the full-year number year-over-year because we think that the price increases will moderate. That doesn't mean prices will go down, they won't. But relative to some of the changes that we made last year, you'll start to see a bit slower -- a lower difference. So we would expect them to moderate somewhat, still a pretty healthy price, obviously, this year. Sure. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. It is a pleasure to have you on and hope you're all doing well. I would just reiterate the fact that we're completely focused on what we can control, and that's making sure we advance our strategic initiatives to grow profitably. Building the culture, we think, is really, really important and making sure that we serve our customers well. And while there are many things going on, the market right now is very, very strong, and we feel good about the share gain performance we're getting. We feel good about what we're seeing in both models. And really optimistic for the future. So thanks. I hope you all have a great rest of the week, and take care."

            "name": "Dee Merriwether",
            "content": "Thanks, DG. I'd like to echo DG's sentiments. Our execution and teamwork in the first quarter drove very strong results. Turning to Slide 8. We covered revenue and margins at the total company level, and I'll get into more detail on the segments in a minute. Before we do, I'd like to highlight a few other key points. Our total company SG&A as a percentage of sales was 23.3%, gaining solid leverage over the prior-period first quarter. Given our investments in the DCs at MonotaRO and our continued strategic initiatives in High-Touch Solutions, I am proud of the way the team concurrently managed these investments as well as operating expenses to support strong top-line performance in the quarter. Finally, resulting EPS in the quarter was $7.07, up 58% versus the first quarter of 2021. Turning now to our High-Touch Solutions segment for the first quarter. We continue to see strong results with daily sales up 18.2%, compared to the first quarter of 2021. We saw impressive growth across the board with double-digit revenue growth across all of our North American geographies and both large and midsize customers. In the U.S., we saw a strong price realization from our recent pricing actions and delivered strong growth in every end market, with particular strength in commercial, transportation and heavy manufacturing. In Canada, the economy has rallied back, and the business saw year-over-year sales growth in nearly every end market, with manufacturing especially strong this quarter. Canadian daily sales were up 10% or 11.8% in local days and local currency. For the segment, GP finished the quarter at 40.4%, up 310 basis points versus the prior year. If we exclude the first quarter 2021 pandemic product inventory adjustment, we still achieved gross margin expansion of roughly 80 basis points. This expansion was largely driven by favorable product mix and also aided by the return of the in-person Grainger Show in February. While the sale provided a modest tailwind in the quarter, it is expected to net out as we move through the balance of the year. Given the timing of price and cost increases in the quarter, our price/cost spread was favorable. However, when netted against increased freight costs, it was largely neutral. I'll also note that our pandemic mix at the end of the quarter was back to near prepandemic levels at just above 20% of sales mix, and we continue to see similar results through the first few weeks of April. While we have included our pandemic-related sales in the appendix for this period, given that we have returned to prepandemic mix levels, we do not expect to provide this information in subsequent quarters. At the operating margin line, we saw improvement of 395 basis points year-over-year as the strong gross margin recovery was aided by 85 basis points of operational expense leverage. Overall, an extremely solid quarter for the High-Touch Solutions North American segment. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market grew between 12.5% and 13.5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 550 basis points of market outgrowth in the quarter. As I've gone out and spent time with customers and investors over the last few months, we often are asked about the drivers of our share gain. We know our supply chain scale and our ability to deliver products to customers has been strong. We also know that by focusing on and investing in the right areas like remerchandising our assortment, increasing our use of analytically-driven marketing and improving the effectiveness of our salesforce, we can consistently deliver growth above the market. We continue to execute well, and our goal to achieve 300 to 400 basis points of annual market outgrowth remains intact. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 12.1% or 10.4% on a daily basis. Results were heavily impacted by foreign exchange, given the depreciation of the Japanese yen. In local currency and local days, MonotaRO achieved 18.4% growth, whereas Zoro U.S. daily sales were up over 19%, both very strong. Growth continues to be driven by new customer acquisition at both Zoro and MonotaRO and MonotaRO's continued success with enterprise customers. GP expanded 10 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021, while operating margins declined 95 basis points as planned. This decline was primarily a result of our increased DC investments at MonotaRO and was partially offset by Zoro's operating margin expansion, which improved 90 basis points over the first quarter of 2021 on strong GP improvement. Please note the slide covering channel-specific performance for Zoro and MonotaRO is included in the appendix. In addition, we've also continued to see positive results in our key operating metrics. On Slide 12, you can see registered users are up 20% over the prior period. You'll see the count of registered users for Zoro has been restated for prior reporting. In 2021, Zoro made a strategic pivot away from certain less productive channels, allowing them to focus on more profitable B2B customers, who also have a higher likelihood to make repeat purchases. These all drives higher lifetime-value customers to Zoro. As a result, we've elected to remove these customers from this metric, which lowers the nominal user count for Zoro, but the growth rate remains relatively consistent to what we have shown in the past. We think this is a more accurate way to reflect this metric, and we will use this new definition, going forward. On the right, we show the continued growth of the Zoro SKU portfolio. We are targeting around 2 million SKU additions again in 2022 and are off to a good start as we continue to onboard more strategic third-party partner -- supplier partners. Now looking forward to the rest of the year. We're off to a great start and results remained strong in April, with total company daily sales trending up around 20%. While we don't typically adjust our guidance expectations after a quarter and acknowledge the broad market uncertainty, our conversations with customers' results to date and continued momentum give us confidence to make a change at this time. As a result, we are raising our 2022 full-year guidance. Our new outlook includes expected daily sales growth between 11% and 14% and EPS between $25 and $27, representing over 30% earnings growth year-over-year at the midpoint. We've also updated our supplemental guidance in the appendix, which reflects a slight upward revision in the High-Touch Solutions operating margin and an increase in total company operating cash flow. With that, I'll turn it back to DG for some closing remarks. I was just going to concur. My time with customers is similar to DG's experience up to this point in the year. Yes. So when we talked about guidance last year, I think a lot of the underlying assumptions really stick, even with some strong performance up to this point. We, of course, had to lap for the E&O adjustments. The first quarter is the time when we work with our suppliers on some of our largest price increases in line with our cost cycle that we work with them. I know the cost cycle has been a little unusual, but I will say, the seasonality related to our price changes, we are assuming the same types of outcomes. So you are exactly right. We feel like Q1 will be a higher watermark as it relates to that, and we will moderate as we go through the year. Again, some of the tenants are the same. We're still focusing on price/cost neutrality and remaining price competitive in this market. Yes. Yes. And on midsized customers, I think it's a good assumption now to use high single-digit number. I was going to add that -- DG, you can continue on. In the High-Touch business, we've kind of noted, specifically for this year, that we're focusing on gross margin stability around 40%. And DG, were you going to talk about the outlook? Well, sure. Yes. We returned to an in-person Grainger show in Orlando in February. That's what I meant in my prepared remarks related to a show. It was really great to be back in person. Our show was well attended. We heard great feedback from our customers and from our team members. From a Q1 GP perspective, the show provides a modest tailwind for us year-over-year. And that's due to supplier funding, as you can imagine. And this favorable impact through the year will moderate versus prior year as we will go through the year. Verified [ph]. Yes. Sorry, I don't know, there was a problem with my line, I apologize for that. Yes, we -- in High-Touch U.S., I know specifically, we usually talk a little bit about our pricing outlook. And so we're expecting price to be about 6 to 7 for the year. Yes. So we've kind of usually talked about the lumpiness of price for us and how it impacts gross margin through the year, with a large portion of our High-Touch U.S. business being contract based. So in light of still saying suppliers continue to come in, with cost inflation request and our ability to continue to work with them on that, when we look at the outlook, we believe that staying in line with our current gross margin is most feasible right now, knowing that we're going to have some lumpiness as we continue to appropriately pass through some inflation as it comes through off-cycle. As the year progresses, as you know, the math works, you have less months to push some of that through."

I will now turn the conference over to Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nKyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and D. Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is included in the company's most recent Form 8-K and periodic reports filed with the SEC. This morning's call will focus on our adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2023, which excludes the loss on the divestiture of our E&R Industrial sales subsidiary. We have also included a daily organic constant currency growth metric to normalize for the impact on revenue. Definitions and full reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website.  We will also share results related to MonotaRo. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and followed Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP, and as reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ from Monotaro's public statements.  Now I'll turn it over to D.G.\nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thanks for joining the call. In 2023, the Grainger team continued to drive our strategy forward. by remaining focused on what matters most, providing our customers with a great experience and exceptional service. The customers we serve play a vital role in keeping their businesses and institutions running and everything we do is focused on making their jobs easier. We made meaningful progress this year in building new capabilities in both segments to help our customers and team members support the work they do. We've done this by investing in technology, our supply chain network and our High-Touch growth engines to ensure we can provide the best experience as possible.  As a result of this focus, we delivered record sales and earnings for the year. I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made and want to take a few minutes to highlight some of this progress in more detail. The Grainger High-Touch solutions model has undergone a digital transformation over the past several years with strategic investments in our infrastructure, talent and the development of custom capabilities to support our customers. We have built key technology infrastructure capabilities focused on 2 main domains that affect customer experience: one, knowing our products better than anyone else and 2 knowing our customers better than anyone else. These endeavors include the development of homegrown software assets around product information management, or PIM and Customer Information Management or CIM, which allow us to store, codify and scale our data assets.  These investments may seem simple and obvious, but in the MRO industry context, product and customer integration is very challenging. We offer millions of products with many technical attributes unique to each product category and then deliver these products to millions of customers across a wide range of industries. We have made great progress here, but the exciting part is that we still have a long way to go. We have invested in additional technology talent that can partner with our MRO subject matter experts to bring Grainger's industry know-how to life. This partnership of talent is yielding significant benefits and helping us generate high-quality proprietary data insights through PIM and CIM. These insights are fueling our growth engines and helping us drive share. For example, our ability to capture detailed product attributes allows us to bid on more relevant keywords that could ultimately yield higher returns on our marketing spend.  In addition, having this detailed product information, coupled with customized workflows and processes, means we're able to work with more granularity to gain confidence that our products are competitively priced, and we can do that at scale. Honestly, what we know about our customers' business operations through CIM, alongside our detailed product data, allows us to better match products to customers saving in time and increasing confidence in their purchase. These are just a few examples where we have leveraged our data investments in an ecosystem where talent and technology work together to drive great outcomes. This work is serving as a great foundation for the value we deliver through our high-touch strategic growth engines.  Starting with merchandising, we've reviewed roughly 80% of the overall product portfolio at least once, and plan to finish collectively reviewing the entire assortment by the time we close out 2024. We continue to see strong revenue lift equating to several hundred basis points per remerchandise category. Our second and third passes through the assortment have a broader lens in the first pass as we continue to leverage learnings, evolve our PIM capabilities, as we add other relevant areas to our review process. We are seeing strong results from this Evergreen initiative, which we believe sets us up well to continue to drive share gain through this work stream in the future.  Shifting to marketing. We continue to make progress through this initiative. This year, we've put a particular emphasis on leveraging CIM and expanding top of funnel marketing efforts to TV and streaming channels to increase brand awareness. We have seen positive results in many areas and plan to continue to increase investment at attractive returns going forward. Our sales force remains an important demand generator for Grainger. As mentioned at Investor Day, [indiscernible] the use of our enhanced CIM data to redraw seller territories to better serve underpenetrated customer locations.  With this, for the first time in several years, we've added about 200 salespeople to the organization over the last 1.5 years. It takes anywhere from 18 to 24 months for these new team members to ramp to a profitable level. But with the results we've seen so far, we are on the right path and expect this initiative to contribute to outgrowth over the next few years. To ensure that our sales force is most effective, we're investing in tools and technology, which leverage information from PIM and CIM to provide insights to our sellers at scale to help them better plan the day-to-day interactions with customers. We are piloting several different capabilities here in 2024.  Lastly, with our enhanced customer information, we are finding additional opportunities to embed our solutions and reinforce the value we bring to customers. This includes bolstering our value-added services offering and advancing our inventory management capabilities to improve keep stock processes and technology, both of which increase stickiness with customers, improve our productivity and drive share. This has been a multiyear journey, which is creating a significant competitive advantage for our business. As we layer on further enhancements and leverage machine learning and AI capabilities, we will continue to power our growth engines, drive share and deliver customer value.  Moving to the end assortment model, despite more muted top line growth in 2023, the proven flywheel continues to fell forward. MonotaRO continues to execute well. They've seen strong growth with enterprise customers continue to expand with small and midsized customers and are gaining operating leverage as they ramp into their distribution center in Gala. In January, I had the opportunity to visit MonotaRo and was able to see the progress within the Gala, which has been supported by a tight partnership between our U.S. supply chain organization and our Japanese counterparts. The team has progressed on their strategy, expanding their assortment, attracting new customers and improving B2B customer retention.  While repeat rates improved in 2023, the team continues to focus on this evergreen initiative. This includes presenting and personalizing our most advantaged assortment, assessing our price competitiveness and proactively communicating delivery times to highlight where we are advantaged. For many of these efforts, the team continues to work with their MonotaRO peers to share best practices that work together to move the business forward.  Now let's turn to Grainger's advantaged supply chain. We've made great progress to return service back to near normal levels following the unprecedented global supply chain disruption that our industry experienced over the last few years. We continue to hear that Grainger's product availability and our next-day order complete shipping capabilities greatly set us apart from our competitors, allowing us to show up well and win with customers. As I mentioned at our 2022 Investor Day, we set out to accelerate our investment in capacity, automation and sustainability initiatives to further strengthen our service advantage.  We are well on that path as we add new square footage to the network, including the following: Three new bulk warehouses, including a 525,000 square foot facility in Pineville, North Carolina, that's scheduled to open later this year. A 535,000 square foot distribution center currently under construction in Gresham, Oregon which is on track to open in 2025. and as shared earlier this week a new 1.2 million square foot distribution center near Houston, Texas. With the addition of these facilities, we're adding 3.5 million square feet to our supply chain network in total, representing more than a 35% increase from where we began 2023. These latest investments will only strengthen our promise to customers who count on us to provide next-day complete orders to keep their operations running and people safe.  Finally, I think it's important to reinforce how the Grainger Edge is truly the key to all of the success that I just mentioned. Every day, our purpose, we keep the world working, motivates us to do our best for customers, communities and each other. That commitment has driven a culture we are very proud of and one that's continuously being noticed externally. Recently, Grainger ranked third out of 400 of America's largest companies and the American Opportunity Index for our commitment to developing internal talent drive, business performance and individual growth. The index primarily focuses on the experience of workers and non-college degree roles and the company's ability to offer them growth and development on that of their career path. Additionally, Grainger [indiscernible] Glassdoor's 2024 Best Places to Work. Glassdoor has more than 50 million unique monthly visitors, and this recognition is particularly special as it was first time Grainger was named to Glassdoor's U.S. large employer list. Both of these awards are based on third-party facts or proprietary career databases, not surveys. So they eliminate subjectivity and service a testament to the way that Grainger Edge has strengthen our team member experience and employer brand.  Lastly, before switching to the financials, I want to take a second to announce an update to our 2030 sustainability target. Our target approved by the Board early in the fourth quarter of 2023 seeks to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 by 50% and from a 2018 baseline, up from the previous 30% target. This new goal aligns with the level required to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Environmental stewardship, which has long been a standing focus for Grainger remains a key component of our culture and is embedded with the Grainger Edge in everything we do.  To be clear, our investments in sustainability are profitable as our team has been very resourceful at finding ways to improve our missions while also supporting results.  Turning to Slide 9. We finished the year with over $16.5 billion in sales, up 8.6% on a daily basis or 9.5% in daily organic constant currency amidst the normalizing demand [indiscernible] Growth for the year is highlighted by our high-touch solutions U.S. business, which continued to gain profitable share finishing the year with 525 basis points of market outgrowth, exceeding our annual target of 400 to 500 basis points. Alongside the strong top line, the team also did a great job of managing profitability through the year with operating margins up 130 basis points in 2023, finishing the year at 15.7%. Together, these strong results fueled record earnings ROIC and cash flow. For the year, adjusted EPS was up over 23% to $36.67 per share. ROIC finished at 42.8% and operating cash flow was over $2 billion which allowed us to return $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, these strong results for 2023 are the byproduct of a lot of hard work from our entire team, and I'm very proud of what we've been able to accomplish. As we embark on another year, regardless of what market we face, we are well positioned to continue our momentum and expect to drive great results for our stakeholders in 2024 and beyond.  With that, I will turn it over to Dee.\nDeidra Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. And I pause those upfront, everyone. I'm a little [indiscernible] today, so please bear with me. Turning to our [Technical Difficulty] fourth quarter results. We had a solid quarter to finish out the year with profitability coming in stronger than expected, but also reflected some top line softness as we exited the year. For the total company results, daily sales grew 5.1% or 5.5% on a daily organic constant currency basis, which was driven by growth across both segments. Consistent with what we've seen all year, year-over-year top line growth rates continue to moderate as we wrap price pass in the prior year. While sales finished within our implied guidance range for the quarter, we did see more holiday-related softness than anticipated as we ended the quarter.  The total company gross margin for the quarter finished at 39.1%. And declining by 50 basis points over the prior year period. Both segments saw slight year-over-year margin contraction as expected, which I will detail in the coming slides, but in total, finished the quarter at the top end of our implied fourth quarter guidance. Total company operating margin was up 80 basis points which was aided by a lap of roughly $35 million of onetime expenses in the prior year period. When excluding this impact, SG&A as a percentage of sales was still favorable versus prior year by roughly 40 basis points. In total, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $8.33, which was up over 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2022.  Moving on to segment level results. The High Tech Solutions segment continues to perform well, with sells up 4.7% of both the reported and daily organic constant currency basis, fueled by growth across all geographies. Volume growth remains strong and accounts for a vast majority of the overall year-over-year expansion. In the U.S., almost all customer end markets continue to see growth in the fourth quarter with government contractors and health care seeing the strongest year-over-year performance. Canada grew slowly in Q4, driven by a softer macro but the business remains solidly profitable in the quarter and finished 2023 with their most profitable year and over half a decade.  For the segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 41.4%, down 50 basis points versus the prior year due to negative price/cost spread a year-end inventory cost adjustments, which included the lap of a prior year LIFO inventory benefit that we did not repeat in 2023. These headwinds were partially offset by the continued supply chain tailwinds we've seen all year as improved product availability and lower fuel and container costs drove year-over-year favorability. Although we were price cost negative in the quarter and for the full year of 2023, we are nearly neutral on a 2-year stack as the timing favorability captured in 2022 as fully unwound and we enter 2024 on a neutral [indiscernible].  At the operating margin line, we saw an improvement of 90 basis points year-over-year as the slight GP decline was offset by leverage in the business despite continued investment in marketing and head count to drive long-term growth. As mentioned, the year-over-year SG&A leverage was aided by roughly 90 basis points due to the lap of onetime expenses in the prior year period. Overall, it was another solid quarter for the High-Touch Solutions North American segment, wrapping up a great year.  Looking at market outlook on Slide 13. We estimate that the U.S. MRO market grew in the quarter between 2.5% and 3%, largely driven by price with industrial production, our proxy for volume remaining roughly flat year-over-year. This indicates that the High-Touch Solutions U.S. business achieved roughly 225 basis points of outgrowth in the fourth quarter in total. This more muted quarterly outgrowth reflects higher market-based inflation and Grainger's Q4 price contribution due to the timing of where we pass price versus the market. On a pure volume basis, when looking at our volume contribution versus IP growth our market out growth was closer to 475 basis points.  In any case, as D.G. mentioned, looking at the full year, we achieved an annual outgrowth target by capturing approximately 525 basis points of growth above the market and remain poised to deliver against our target again in 2024.  Moving to our endless assortment segment. Sales increased 6% or 8.2% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 2.6%, while MonotaRO achieved 9.9% growth in local days local currency. At a business level, Zoro's growth reflects the continuation of headwinds they've experienced all year with declines in noncore B2C volume and slowing macro environment impacting its B2B customers.  B2B customer growth remained steady in the high single digits for the quarter while noncore B2C and B2C light customer performance remained down over 20% year-over-year. At MonotaRO, macro-related headwinds continued to impact results, however, the business still drove strong growth with increased sales to new and enterprise customers while also maintaining strong repeat purchase rate. From a profitability perspective, gross margins in the segment declined 60 basis points versus the prior year as MonotaRO favorability was offset by year-over-year declines at Zoro.  As in the prior quarters, MonotaRO results reflect continued freight efficiencies, while the Zoro decline was driven by negative product mix and the impact of unfavorable timing from prior year price increases. Operating margins for this segment expanded by 50 basis points to 7.8% as the unfavorable gross margin was offset by SG&A leverage aided by the lap of onetime distribution center and commissioning costs in the prior year.  Now looking forward to 2024. We expect to deliver another solid year of performance [indiscernible] more muted MRO market. Our outlook for the year includes revenue to be between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion at the total company level with daily organic constant currency sales growth between 4% and 7%, driven by top line growth in both segments. With our High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect daily organic constant currency sales growth between 3.5% and 6.5%. In the U.S., we're planning for the total MRO market growth to be largely flat with a range of down 0.5% to plus 1.5%. This assumes the flattish volume range coupled with price inflation between 0 and 1%.  On top of this market outlook, we expect to continue executing against our strategic growth engines to achieve 400 to 500 basis points of U.S. market outlook in 2024. In the endless assortment segment, we anticipate daily constant grocery sales to grow between 7% and 10%, which normalizes for the impact of 2 additional business days and expected foreign currency exchange headwinds. MonotaRO is expected to grow in the low double digits in local currency and local gains as they continue to ramp new and enterprise customers [indiscernible] an expected slower macro demand environment. Zoro is anticipated to grow in the mid-single digits as we anticipate that many of the macro-related headwinds impacting their core B2B customers hold over to 2024. We also expect the continued unwind of B2C and B2C like customers, which include resellers and marketplaces to impact results, especially in the first half of the year.  In 2024, the team will focus on growing long-term relationships with its core B2B customers, including work to improve targeted marketing, fine-tune their pricing model and drive consistent service for all of their customers.  Moving to our margin expectations. Even after normalizing to some onetime gross margin benefits we realized in 2023, we expect total company operating margins to remain quite healthy in 2024. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, operating margins will stay relatively flat year-over-year between 17.4% and 17.9%. We expect gross profit margins to be down in 2024 after lapping roughly 50 basis points of onetime benefits captured in 2023.  We anticipate price cost for the year will be the only neutral as we worked our way through the timing discrepancy we've seen over the last couple of years. On the SG&A side, we expect modest leverage while we continue to make incremental investments towards our strategic initiatives to fuel our growth. In endless assortment, we are modeling operating margins to be roughly consistent to what we've seen in the back half of 2023 and 7.3% to 7.8% range as the segment rebaseline following Zoro's revenue declines with the noncore B2C and B2C-like customers.  At the business unit level, Zoro's operating margins are expected to decline, while MonotaRO's operating margins are expected to be neutral for the year.  Turning now to capital allocation. We expect the business will continue to generate strong cash flow in the year with an expected range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, implying operating cash conversion around 100%. We plan to continue to execute a consistent return-driven approach to our capital allocation strategy, meaning our priorities remain largely unchanged from prior years. First, we look at investing in the business and both organic investment and opportunistic M&A. For 2024, we expect capital spending in the range of $400 million to $500 million. Spending here includes continued supply chain expansion in the United States as we worked to [indiscernible] facilities in the Pacific Northwest and the Houston area. We also plan to further invest in our homegrown data and technology capabilities, helping power our growth engines and further our customer value proposition. Lastly, sustainability-related spin remains a priority. We will continue to invest in projects with solid returns to help achieve our emissions targets.  On M&A, we remain highly selective, but are also open to investing in capabilities and acquiring the right assets to further our strategy. And we have a small dedicated team who continually evaluate opportunities in this area. Secondly, we expect to return the balance of our excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As always, we'll formally set our 2024 dividend in the second quarter, but I can say we remain proud of our history of increasing the dividend for 52 consecutive years we expect to do so in day this year. We do not tie our dividend payout to specific metrics. However, we anticipate consistent annual dividend increases in the high single digits to low double-digit percentage range every year.  Lastly, we expect to allocate the balance of our cash flow to share repurchases and anticipate the amount to be between $900 million and $1.1 billion in 2024. We think this return-focused allocation philosophy provides the organization optimal flexibility to efficiently manage investment while maximizing shareholder returns.  In summary, rolling all this up at the total company level, as mentioned, we plan to grow top line by [indiscernible] 4% to 7% on the daily organic constant currency basis. Note that reported sales growth is a bit higher than our daily organic constant currency range as we are normalizing for the divestiture of our [indiscernible] ENR subsidiary, FX changes and the impact of 2 additional selling days in 2024 compared to the prior year.  A reconciliation of these impacts is provided in the appendix of this presentation. Operating margin, as we discussed ranged from 15.3% to 15.8% leading to expected EPS growth of 3.6% to 10.5% or $38 to $40.50 per share. From a seasonality perspective, we do expect both revenue and profitability to be more back half weighted as we move through the year. This includes a softer start in January from the timing of the New Year's holiday and cold weather disruptions experienced mid-month across a large portion of the U.S. With this, January sales started slowly, but picked up momentum as not progress with preliminary results of 4.4% on a daily organic constant currency basis.  On profitability with more muted inflation in the year, we won't see the price timing favorability we normally captured in the first quarter. With this, those margins will show very little seasonality and remain reasonably subsistent with our full year gross margin outlook throughout the year. For SG&A, we expect year-over-year deleverage in the first quarter as we ramp up investment spending in 2024. Leverage will improve each quarter, looking to a tailwind in the back half of the year. Altogether, this will drive EPS growth to be flat to slightly down in the first quarter and will ramp thereafter as the year [indiscernible]  before I hand it back to D.G., I wanted to quickly touch on our long-term outlook and where we expect to take the business over the next several years. As we discussed on our last call, we made great progress towards the 2025 targets we rolled out at our Investor Day in September 2022. We remain on track to hit our revenue goals that are meaningfully ahead on most of our profitability targets. With this, we're replacing our 2025 targets with an updated long-term earnings framework. The framework is actually quite similar to what we've discussed previously, as we continue to target double-digit annual EPS growth in a normalized MRO market, driven by continued strong top line growth, including 400 to 500 basis points of annual market outgrowth in the High-Touch U.S. business and annual growth in the [indiscernible] stable gross profit margins, which should normalize from the 2024 baseline and SG&A growing Florida sales while still investing in demand generation activities to drive sustainable long-term growth. You will notice we made a few tweaks to the earnings framework, which largely offset.  First, we've widened the top line outlook for analyst assortment as each business there is facing dynamics making it harder to achieve historical growth rate. With MonotaRO, at this stage of their maturity, the business has onboarded most of the large and midsized business within the market. With this, the team is pivoting its marketing strategy from firm level of customer acquisition to end user penetration in an effort to expand total customer share win. As though, following the post-pandemic volume decline from B2C and B2C customers, the business is refocusing their efforts on B2B customers as they work to build long-term profitable relationships with the core -- with this core customer set.  As the business be focused, we think it's prudent to widen range of growth outcomes for this segment over the next few years. Regardless, we still expect to deliver very strong growth through this segment and remain confident in the model's ability to continue to take share and drive profitable operating scale to the total business overall. Second, as we [indiscernible] shadowed last quarter, we expect to maintain elevated gross margins in the High-Touch Solutions segment, which is underpinned by the confidence we have in executing against our 2 core pricing [indiscernible] remaining market price competitive while maintaining price cost neutrality.  Adding these together, net-net, we end at roughly the same outlook as we discussed at Investor Day. Strong earnings growing in double digits annually. When we drive these results, the business with [indiscernible] considerable amount of cash, which we will allocate through a consistent and turn driven approach. This includes continuing to invest in the business at an elevated level for the next few years as we add incremental supply chain capacity and continue to build out our technology capability. And all this up, and we think this represents an attractive return profile, we remain well positioned to drive significant value creation for our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks.\nDonald Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. Grainger continues to build deep trust with our customers as we partner with them to fulfill their MRO needs. While we expect the market in 2024 to be more muted, the Grainger team will continue to focus on what matters advancing our growth drivers to improve the customer experience and providing the exceptional service we are known for. When we live our principles, we can be successful in the man of the cycle. I have full confidence that we will deliver strong results again this year.  With that, we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair.\nRyan Merkel: I wanted to start with gross margin, and I guess it's a 2-parter. Your gross margins are up about 100 basis points since 2019, and I'm just curious what the drivers are. And then for the '24 guide at the high end, you're holding gross margins flat, but I think, you mentioned 50 basis points of onetime price costs that you're going to have to lap. So what backfills that?\nDeidra Merriwether: Let me start with the first question first, and then maybe I'll have you reask the second part of it to make sure I don't forget anything. So when we go back to 2019, I think we've done a pretty good job on just product gross margins in general and being able to prophetize customers based upon the services that we provide from the High-Touch Solutions business. In addition to that, the pricing strategy change has taken allow to be completely executed as we said over a number of years, and that included making sure that we could get pricing right on all of our for -- all of our customers. So some of that evidence also flows into our product GP. And then as of late, we've continued to gain quite a bit of supply chain efficiencies from coming out of the pandemic as well as some other COGS efficiencies related to supplier rebates related to negotiations. Those would be some of the key differences between where we are today and where we were in 2019. So can you repeat your second part of the question for me, please?\nRyan Merkel: Yes. The guidance for gross margins in '24, it's flat at the high end at 39.4%. And I think you mentioned you'll be lapping 50 basis points of onetime price cost help in '23. So what are the offsets? .\nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. So some of the offsets we made to the fact that as we go into this year, we're going to have a faster pricing environment. And based upon that, we want to make sure that we're providing a range such that is realistic for us to hit also in a softer volume environment for the overall business. And so those are some of the 2 primary reasons why being officially flat we would expect to be closer to the high end. We've got some tailwinds that will continue to normalize after some of the disruptions that we've had over the past few years, specific to supply chain and mix, and that will help as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens.\nThomas Moll: I wanted to expand on the gross margin conversation with what's perhaps the obligatory question here. But I just want to make sure that I'm tracking the message correctly over time. So if we go back to your Investor Day, the anchor for your high-touch business was in that 40% range. Since that time, you've outperformed it significantly and indicated that maybe that was too low a number. And if I'm hearing the message correctly today, in 2024 at the midpoint, you're somewhere a little bit north of 41% and 25% and thereafter stable around that range. So I just want to make sure I've tracked all that correctly or if there's anything you'd like to amend there.\nDonald Macpherson: You've tracked that. I think you tracked that correctly. The only other thing I would add is that when we -- during the Investor Day when we said 40%, I think we probably knew that there was -- the supply chain efficiencies is a big bucket. We probably knew that there was a lot of inefficiency. I think we probably maybe have been surprised at how much in efficiency and as we've gotten back to normal, that's been a big a big tailwind for us. And so we probably -- if we had known, it was just difficult to see all that. We probably would have had a higher number of back then as well.\nThomas Moll: Sure. Pivoting to the commentary you offered today on service levels earlier in your remarks, D.G. So it sounds like you're back to roughly your own pre-pandemic service levels. You've invested and will invest substantially in the capacity and automation and other areas as well. So I'm just curious, strategically, do you feel more confident in leaning into these forms of investment and versus what you've communicated in the past, should we read from today that with that increased confidence, you see this as a repeatable and sustainable advantage that you can repeat pretty consistently to take share?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. And I appreciate the question. In terms of returning to near normal service, I would say everything that we directly control is back to normal in terms of our own internal cycle times transportation is back to normal. There's still some elongated supplier lead times, which is the reason we're still probably a little shy of where we were. But from a competitive standpoint, that's all that really matters is a competitive standpoint, we're doing quite well. In terms of the investments we're making, we're filling in gaps where we've grown to the point where having buildings in those locations make sense. And they make sense not only to improve service, but to improve cost in some perspective. So if you think about the Northwest. Most of our product today comes out of California has to clear the mountains and get in there and that's a long haul. We now have enough volume to be able to improve the service dramatically in the Northwest and actually lower transportation cost pretty substantially. So we look at all those factors, service and cost and when we make these decisions, but we're very confident in what we've outlined and announced so far that those are the right things to do for the health of the business.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Jake Levinson with Melius Research.\nJacob Levinson: Good morning, everyone. I know you have some margin headwinds here in '24, and there's been obviously a lot of improvement in the last couple of years. But just on the on the productivity side, I know these you touched on a couple of levers earlier in your prepared remarks, but can you just help us get a sense of the levers that you have or maybe where you're most focused here in '24 that can help offset some of those headwinds?\nDonald Macpherson: I mean I'll start and Dee, if you want to add in, you can. I think the thing to note is that we tend to look at productivity from a core productivity standpoint. So distribution centers, contact centers, seller productivity, all those levers. And we really see opportunity across the business. And I think we're going to see really nice core productivity this year. The headwinds are more around the growth investments, which we think are absolutely the right thing to do, they're high return growth investments. But we are spending more money in marketing and we're investing in the sales force. And so those things make it -- the headline number looked a little more challenging. And it's a time in place when we are investing in those things and believe that's the right thing to do. But we're going to continue to get core productivity. It's an evergreen initiative for us to look everywhere in the business. And I think we've got a whole bunch of things teed up to improve the productivity of the core business.\nJacob Levinson: That makes sense. And your comment about the 35% expansion in the square footage in your supply chain -- square footage isn't everything, maybe that's not the best way to measure it. But is that really you guys catching up to the growth you've seen over the last couple of years or preparing for the next couple of years or maybe it's a mix, but just trying to get [Technical Difficulty].\nDonald Macpherson: It's a mix. It's a mix. And I think it just practically, if you thought about it, we're a lot bigger than 2019. There was almost no way to actually build buildings productively during the pandemic, you couldn't get things going. And so we were a little bit behind. We talked about that in 2022. So a part of it is catch-up but a part of it is planning for the future growth as well. And I would say the square footage isn't exactly capacity because the bulk warehouse portion of those is lower cost and doesn't quite give you as much capacity as does the other buildings, but certainly, Houston and Portland are added capacity similar to the other capacity of the number.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of David Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: First off, a couple of quick ones for Dee. What specifically is the range of price expectations you're baking into the 2024 guidance range? And second, on Slide 20, you talked about stable gross margins. I'm not clear if you're referring to segment gross margins are consolidated. Could you help me with that?\nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. So Dave, I will start with the U.S. price that we're focusing on when you think about that outline of flattish, we're expecting price to be between 0% to 1% for the year in the U.S. And on Slide 20, specifically, stable gross margins really is applying to the total company, and you can also apply that to High-Touch in some ways as well.\nDavid Manthey: And then, D.G., could you talk about what opportunistic M&A would look like to Grainger today?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I mean first and foremost, I would reiterate that we are an organic growth company, and that's where we are focused on most of our energy. We get a lot of looks at things and opportunities. I would say that we get 2 types of looks of the distributors, which probably haven't been as interesting to us. And then there are some potential technology investments and things that might be more interesting to us. So we continue to look at a wide range of opportunities in areas that we think are really important to the success of the business, particularly some specific domains that we think we need to be really good at going forward, and we might invest in those areas. But as I said, we are primarily an organic growth company at this point.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.\nChristopher Snyder: I wanted to ask on the investments that the company are making. And D.G., I appreciate all the color that you provided. And there's a lot going on, but is there any way that you could maybe bucket or talk about the investments between the capacity additions and the efficiency drivers that you're making versus the more demand generative investments like the sales coverage and the marketing. Any way to just kind of think of those 2 respective buckets?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So without getting overly detailed, I would say that the demand generation investments are typically SG&A investments, so marketing and seller ads or SG&A investments. Whereas a lot of the capacity investments we're making in productivity investments or AI investments or technology investments, most of this showing capital, some shows up in expense for sure. But if you think about -- when we talk about spending $450 million, $550 million in capital, the vast majority of that comes from supply chain investments and capacity increases and in technology. And so I would think of it in those terms. And technology is building capabilities and advantage in information assets and supporting the growth initiatives in the core business as well versus marketing to our more direct spend that go into demand generation.\nChristopher Snyder: I appreciate that. And then if we think of the SG&A investments, that are kind of more of that demand generation. Can you just maybe talk about the ability to leverage those and grow operating margin over time? Because in 2024 has guided to be a pretty supportive year for gross margin, but operating margin is kind of flattish despite the top line growth and the stable gross margin because it seems like in some capacities, investments that you're making, do you think that over time, you're able to leverage those and grow operating margin? And then maybe '24 is just kind of a pause year.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes, it talked about it. Yes, we do expect to get SG&A leverage over time, and we are probably making more incremental investments in this year than others. Yes. So that is probably true. We're also -- just I would just point out, in a fairly flat price environment, that SG&A is -- its more difficult to get SG&A leverage as well. So there's a number of factors going on. Dee, do you have any?\nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. The other thing I would point to is just our improvement in return on invested capital. I think that was one of the reasons why that's one of the metrics that we talk about track and are focused on is ensuring that the investments we make, whether they are CapEx investments or SG&A based upon how we calculate ROIC, we are very focused on ensuring that they help us deliver and grow at least not operating margin, operating dollar growth as well for us.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. And the other thing I'd add to that is that both in marketing and seller coverage, we are very well measured. So we are -- everything is tested. We don't make the investments lightly. We know exactly what returns are getting. So if they're a positive return, we will make them even if in the year, they might slow down our SG&A leverage because it is the right thing to do for the overall profitability of the business.\nChristopher Snyder: I appreciate that. All makes sense. And if I can squeeze one last one in. When I look at price mix in the quarter for high touch, I think it was only up 40 basis points I have to think that customer mix was a drag on that. I guess any color on what that customer mix headwind was? And any way to maybe think about what price as a stand-alone was in Q4?\nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. I mean it was really small. And I think if you go back to -- we forecast -- and it should be no surprise with our price cost outcome will be in Q4. We've been looking at this and talking about it for the last 2 years. If you go back to 2022, we noted that we were going to be significantly price cost positive in that year, and it would unwind in 2023 and it did, and you saw that and experience that in the second half of of 2023. And so a lot of it is timing, as we know we talked about price and cost in our business is very lumpy being north of 70% of our business will contract customers and the timing of those things. And so on a 2-year stack being essentially neutral and exiting this year and start in 2024, the neutral footing, I think was really important.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.\nDeane Dray: Love to go a little bit deeper on the comments about January getting off to a slower start. And we've heard this recently from a number of companies pointing to the weather as really hampering some of the activities. So if you could size for us what you think that weather impact was. And a related question is the underlying assumption of MRO for activity for 2024, down 0.5% to up 1.5%. Just given the trends we're seeing now in the ISM coming back, new orders going back above 50, just it seems like you could see a risk to the upside in that and maybe that's a bit conservative and just take us through that assumption as well, please.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes, sure. So I can take the -- I mean, I can try to take both of them. I guess the first one I think there were 2 factors that made January slow start. One was that most of the schools were shut, which show some activity in the first week of January, which last year, schools opened in midweek. And we noticed that and we noticed that in some of the schools we serve as well as just the broader economy. And then obviously, the cold weather week. What I would say is that the last 2 weeks of January were very normal for us. And so while there was some slowness, it wasn't -- in the course of the quarter, it will be very, very small in terms of the impact, but noticeable in a month, of course, because it's many weeks, but it's not huge in the grand scheme of things, it's just noise. And so we don't -- we won't focus too much on that.  I think any forecast for the MRO market any year, I think you could argue could be risk to the upside or downside, I don't know. This is our current forecast, and we have economists internally and external that we look at, and this is the forecast they have right now. So that's what we're going with. But that too will always change and it will never be right until we know that. So again, we want to over-index on the forecast.\nDeane Dray: Got it. And then for Dee or D G. either. The outlook for an expected increase in buybacks for 2024, the uptick there. Just what's the expectation in terms of the pace of the buybacks through the year?\nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. We've been fairly consistent for a number of years in our buyback practices generally under the vail of overall capital allocation strategy and we look to be in the market all the time based upon what the price of shares are. We don't try to time the market from a price perspective, but always looking to be into the market buying shares. And so generally, we have pretty stable pace across the year for the share buybacks.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.\nChristopher Glynn: Congrats on all the significant workplace culture recognitions, indicator of your durability. So I was curious what you're seeing in terms of product cost deflation that you always try to drive as distinctive from, I think you called out, there's some continuing benefits from the macro level supply chain normalization.\nDeidra Merriwether: So this is the -- we've gone from a as you know, over the last year or so a highly cost inflationary environment to something that is much more muted today -- coming down today are much more reasonable or normalized is the term I would use is what we're seeing. I would say, our product management team, utilizes the same sets of strategic and tactical activities with our supply base. We want to remain to be a customer of choice for them. And so we're working to ensure that we continue to have advantage price and advantaged access to products at the best price possible. So things are getting to more normal level for us today.\nChristopher Glynn: Great. And then on the B2C side of Zoro, I think you mentioned that the unwind there, the headwind would be first half weighted and suggest more neutral comps in the back half. So does that mean you're exiting '23 at about the sustainable mix?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So I think what I would say there is that, obviously, as the B2C and B2C like volume shrinks, it becomes less of an impact on the rest of the business and our business customer activity has actually been reasonably healthy through the entire quarter. We do expect some of the decline to be less impactful in the back half of the year. So we should have less drag in the back half of the year than we have in the first half of the year from the decline B2C lifeline.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Ken Newman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nKen Newman: I know there's a lot of moving pieces here, but I am wondering if you are seeing or have seen any impact from some of the [indiscernible] shipping dynamics and how are you thinking about shipping and screen expenses in '24 and how that flows through your OpEx guide for the year?\nDonald Macpherson: So on the Red Sea, we don't have much volume going through that -- those lanes. Most of our shipping volume comes out of Asia through to the West Coast and then as railed to our network. And so that has not been impacted. So we've really seen nothing there. Could you repeat the second half of your question? .\nKen Newman: Yes. Just curious, as a follow-up to that, how you're thinking about freight expenses in general. I feel -- I think most companies are seeing those kind of come up here? And how do you see that flowing through your OpEx line as it relates to your guide for the year? .\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I mean much of our freight, most of our freight actually goes into our gross profit line, but we -- our forecasts haven't changed much given the activity we've seen, given the lines we're in. Certainly, things like fuel increases can have an impact and who knows how that's going to play out. But right now, we're actually still in a favorable position relative to a year ago -- certainly on ocean freight at this point. So we expect that to continue through the first part of the year, and then we'll see what happens.\nKen Newman: Got it. And then if I could just squeeze one more in here. I think you mentioned in the new framework that you expect Zoro and MonotaRO to kind of get back to that low teens type of growth range. It's been a tougher couple of years here recently. As I think about the seasonality comments on the first half year kind of unwinding in the first half, is it reasonable to say, could you get back to that double -- low double-digit range here within the back half of '24? Or is that more of a 25% type of aspirational target?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes, it's probably more of a 25% -- so to be clear, MonotaRO this year, we'll be hitting that already, we think it's low double-digit low teens. So that will be close to that for the year. And then Zoro will start the year lower than that, and we expect them to get a bit better as the year goes along. We probably won't get there by this year, but that would be more in out years, we think that's the target.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan.\nPatrick Baumann: Just had a couple of questions for Dee on the price timing comments that you noted. Maybe if you could help us better understand first what you said with respect to Slide 13. Did the market take up price in the fourth quarter and you waited for the new year? Or was this something like in the comps that caused that disparity?\nDeidra Merriwether: No. No. I think your -- Slide 13, you're kind of looking at what we have listed as what we think the market performance has been by quarter.\nPatrick Baumann: It was about the fourth quarter, you had like you noted like a volume share gain of $475.\nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. And so that difference is really that our price in the quarter was lower than the PMI print in the quarter. And so we were just highlighting for you that if you just look at the volume for IP versus our volume, then our share gain would have been 4.75. So there's a difference in the market price as published today in Q4 versus what we realized from a price perspective. And the comments I was making earlier about timing is that our timing is not always going to be in line with the timing of price in the market. And this quarter was just one example of that. But you also have other examples if you look back over the course of several other quarters as we've outperformed the market. So we try to look at it on a 2-year stack, trying to get to neutral over a longer period of time.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay. And then my follow-up as it relates to the first quarter, I think you also mentioned something about price timing as a factor for gross margins being kind of down year-over-year. So curious if you can give some more color on that, too, like did you put through price early last year and you're not doing the same thing this year? Or is it something else? .\nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. So no, we always put through price if prices warranted early in the year, but it's more like a seasonality question. So I'll probably respond to it in that way. We do expect a lot of the outlook that we've given for 2024 to be back-end weighted. We talked a little bit about pieces of it, which was sales starting slower, tougher comp. Q1 last year was a very strong year for us, which included a whole lot of price in that quarter with a price outlook of 0 to 1. Of course, our price for this year, the quarter will be more muted versus that. And we expect price to become more favorable throughout the year and for gross margins to be relatively stable versus the outlook that we have given. And so that's what I mean when you talk about kind of sales and price in the first quarter versus the prior year.\nDonald Macpherson: Just to add to that, I think the practical reality was that if you think back to 2022, we took a budget price midyear that from a 2023 Q1 to 2022 Q1 comparison made 2023 have very high price increases relative to the year before because we took them in the middle of the year and those -- so it wasn't all taken January 1 last year, but all the inflation run up in 2022 made last year look a little unusual from a first quarter price increase.\nDeidra Merriwether: Q1 and full year.\nDonald Macpherson: Q1 and full year. Absolutely.\nOperator: Our final questions will come from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Sound like suffering. So I feel -- if you repeat yourself here. But just on the seasonality comment, are you saying gross margins much flatter from quarter-to-quarter through the year. Obviously, normally, we see a bit of a seasonal pattern there. So is that the comment? And does that therefore imply that as we go from 4Q to 1Q, we've got a pretty flat Q2Q gross margin structure then. And if it is flattered, I just want to understand why that is. I mean, I get the fact that price is coming through a bit stronger for the year. But any other factors we need to consider? .\nDeidra Merriwether: Well, like we've talked a little bit about freight. We'll continue to get freight and supply chain efficiencies and some product mix. But again, it all starts with the fact that we don't expect to have a lot of price in the market this year, just generally so. We expect gross margins to be reasonably consistent from what we talked about all through the year. So that's the basic reason for that muted price.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's fair. And then the comment you made about SG&A. I think you mentioned some SG&A deleverage in the first quarter. So again, it sounds like the model is here is going to be pretty clean in terms of -- it sounds like SG&A can be pretty flat across the quarters, maybe is that the way you're seeing it? We got some front-end other investments this year?\nDeidra Merriwether: So yes. So yes, SG&A is going to deleverage in the first quarter because we're going to continue, as noted, to ramp our investments in marketing and sellers and others and the like. But we do expect leverage will improve as the year progress, flipping to more of a tailwind in the back half of the year for us. And then just if you kind of move down a little bit, we think operating margin in Q1 will be at its lowest point as well and EPS will be flattish year-over-year in the first quarter as well.\nNigel Coe: Got it year-over-year. Okay. Got it. And since some last question, I feel like maybe I can just squeeze one more in, if I can. Just I want to just clarify the customer mix comment from earlier on in the call. I mean, I noticed the medium-sized customers outgrew large customers. So I'd assume that mix would have been positive, but if I'm wrong [indiscernible] now.\nDeidra Merriwether: I missed that last part. I heard you say that. Could you repeat it? .\nNigel Coe: The customer mix. I assume that maybe customer mix was slightly positive given that medium-sized with large size dynamic. But if I'm wrong there, please let me know.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I think it was basically neutral. We did have -- you're right, midsize customers did grow faster than the largest customers. Overall, it was not a meaningful impact, as I understand it. Dee and I are in different rooms, so she's sequestered. So we're looking at each other through a camera here.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to D.G. MacPherson for closing remarks.\nDonald Macpherson: All right. Sorry, we're a few minutes over. Thanks for joining the call. What I would say is that and we're certainly proud of the results we had in 2023. We are very focused on continuing to drive forward and create value for our customers in 2024 and a lot of that is really the same despite the more muted growth in the market that a lot of that's just a continuation of driving forward the initiatives that matter, both from a growth perspective and a productivity perspective. And we remain very positive about the outlook and our ability to gain share profitably for years to come. So thanks for the time. Hope you all have a great weekend. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thanks for joining the call. In 2023, the Grainger team continued to drive our strategy forward. by remaining focused on what matters most, providing our customers with a great experience and exceptional service. The customers we serve play a vital role in keeping their businesses and institutions running and everything we do is focused on making their jobs easier. We made meaningful progress this year in building new capabilities in both segments to help our customers and team members support the work they do. We've done this by investing in technology, our supply chain network and our High-Touch growth engines to ensure we can provide the best experience as possible.  As a result of this focus, we delivered record sales and earnings for the year. I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made and want to take a few minutes to highlight some of this progress in more detail. The Grainger High-Touch solutions model has undergone a digital transformation over the past several years with strategic investments in our infrastructure, talent and the development of custom capabilities to support our customers. We have built key technology infrastructure capabilities focused on 2 main domains that affect customer experience: one, knowing our products better than anyone else and 2 knowing our customers better than anyone else. These endeavors include the development of homegrown software assets around product information management, or PIM and Customer Information Management or CIM, which allow us to store, codify and scale our data assets.  These investments may seem simple and obvious, but in the MRO industry context, product and customer integration is very challenging. We offer millions of products with many technical attributes unique to each product category and then deliver these products to millions of customers across a wide range of industries. We have made great progress here, but the exciting part is that we still have a long way to go. We have invested in additional technology talent that can partner with our MRO subject matter experts to bring Grainger's industry know-how to life. This partnership of talent is yielding significant benefits and helping us generate high-quality proprietary data insights through PIM and CIM. These insights are fueling our growth engines and helping us drive share. For example, our ability to capture detailed product attributes allows us to bid on more relevant keywords that could ultimately yield higher returns on our marketing spend.  In addition, having this detailed product information, coupled with customized workflows and processes, means we're able to work with more granularity to gain confidence that our products are competitively priced, and we can do that at scale. Honestly, what we know about our customers' business operations through CIM, alongside our detailed product data, allows us to better match products to customers saving in time and increasing confidence in their purchase. These are just a few examples where we have leveraged our data investments in an ecosystem where talent and technology work together to drive great outcomes. This work is serving as a great foundation for the value we deliver through our high-touch strategic growth engines.  Starting with merchandising, we've reviewed roughly 80% of the overall product portfolio at least once, and plan to finish collectively reviewing the entire assortment by the time we close out 2024. We continue to see strong revenue lift equating to several hundred basis points per remerchandise category. Our second and third passes through the assortment have a broader lens in the first pass as we continue to leverage learnings, evolve our PIM capabilities, as we add other relevant areas to our review process. We are seeing strong results from this Evergreen initiative, which we believe sets us up well to continue to drive share gain through this work stream in the future.  Shifting to marketing. We continue to make progress through this initiative. This year, we've put a particular emphasis on leveraging CIM and expanding top of funnel marketing efforts to TV and streaming channels to increase brand awareness. We have seen positive results in many areas and plan to continue to increase investment at attractive returns going forward. Our sales force remains an important demand generator for Grainger. As mentioned at Investor Day, [indiscernible] the use of our enhanced CIM data to redraw seller territories to better serve underpenetrated customer locations.  With this, for the first time in several years, we've added about 200 salespeople to the organization over the last 1.5 years. It takes anywhere from 18 to 24 months for these new team members to ramp to a profitable level. But with the results we've seen so far, we are on the right path and expect this initiative to contribute to outgrowth over the next few years. To ensure that our sales force is most effective, we're investing in tools and technology, which leverage information from PIM and CIM to provide insights to our sellers at scale to help them better plan the day-to-day interactions with customers. We are piloting several different capabilities here in 2024.  Lastly, with our enhanced customer information, we are finding additional opportunities to embed our solutions and reinforce the value we bring to customers. This includes bolstering our value-added services offering and advancing our inventory management capabilities to improve keep stock processes and technology, both of which increase stickiness with customers, improve our productivity and drive share. This has been a multiyear journey, which is creating a significant competitive advantage for our business. As we layer on further enhancements and leverage machine learning and AI capabilities, we will continue to power our growth engines, drive share and deliver customer value.  Moving to the end assortment model, despite more muted top line growth in 2023, the proven flywheel continues to fell forward. MonotaRO continues to execute well. They've seen strong growth with enterprise customers continue to expand with small and midsized customers and are gaining operating leverage as they ramp into their distribution center in Gala. In January, I had the opportunity to visit MonotaRo and was able to see the progress within the Gala, which has been supported by a tight partnership between our U.S. supply chain organization and our Japanese counterparts. The team has progressed on their strategy, expanding their assortment, attracting new customers and improving B2B customer retention.  While repeat rates improved in 2023, the team continues to focus on this evergreen initiative. This includes presenting and personalizing our most advantaged assortment, assessing our price competitiveness and proactively communicating delivery times to highlight where we are advantaged. For many of these efforts, the team continues to work with their MonotaRO peers to share best practices that work together to move the business forward.  Now let's turn to Grainger's advantaged supply chain. We've made great progress to return service back to near normal levels following the unprecedented global supply chain disruption that our industry experienced over the last few years. We continue to hear that Grainger's product availability and our next-day order complete shipping capabilities greatly set us apart from our competitors, allowing us to show up well and win with customers. As I mentioned at our 2022 Investor Day, we set out to accelerate our investment in capacity, automation and sustainability initiatives to further strengthen our service advantage.  We are well on that path as we add new square footage to the network, including the following: Three new bulk warehouses, including a 525,000 square foot facility in Pineville, North Carolina, that's scheduled to open later this year. A 535,000 square foot distribution center currently under construction in Gresham, Oregon which is on track to open in 2025. and as shared earlier this week a new 1.2 million square foot distribution center near Houston, Texas. With the addition of these facilities, we're adding 3.5 million square feet to our supply chain network in total, representing more than a 35% increase from where we began 2023. These latest investments will only strengthen our promise to customers who count on us to provide next-day complete orders to keep their operations running and people safe.  Finally, I think it's important to reinforce how the Grainger Edge is truly the key to all of the success that I just mentioned. Every day, our purpose, we keep the world working, motivates us to do our best for customers, communities and each other. That commitment has driven a culture we are very proud of and one that's continuously being noticed externally. Recently, Grainger ranked third out of 400 of America's largest companies and the American Opportunity Index for our commitment to developing internal talent drive, business performance and individual growth. The index primarily focuses on the experience of workers and non-college degree roles and the company's ability to offer them growth and development on that of their career path. Additionally, Grainger [indiscernible] Glassdoor's 2024 Best Places to Work. Glassdoor has more than 50 million unique monthly visitors, and this recognition is particularly special as it was first time Grainger was named to Glassdoor's U.S. large employer list. Both of these awards are based on third-party facts or proprietary career databases, not surveys. So they eliminate subjectivity and service a testament to the way that Grainger Edge has strengthen our team member experience and employer brand.  Lastly, before switching to the financials, I want to take a second to announce an update to our 2030 sustainability target. Our target approved by the Board early in the fourth quarter of 2023 seeks to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 by 50% and from a 2018 baseline, up from the previous 30% target. This new goal aligns with the level required to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Environmental stewardship, which has long been a standing focus for Grainger remains a key component of our culture and is embedded with the Grainger Edge in everything we do.  To be clear, our investments in sustainability are profitable as our team has been very resourceful at finding ways to improve our missions while also supporting results.  Turning to Slide 9. We finished the year with over $16.5 billion in sales, up 8.6% on a daily basis or 9.5% in daily organic constant currency amidst the normalizing demand [indiscernible] Growth for the year is highlighted by our high-touch solutions U.S. business, which continued to gain profitable share finishing the year with 525 basis points of market outgrowth, exceeding our annual target of 400 to 500 basis points. Alongside the strong top line, the team also did a great job of managing profitability through the year with operating margins up 130 basis points in 2023, finishing the year at 15.7%. Together, these strong results fueled record earnings ROIC and cash flow. For the year, adjusted EPS was up over 23% to $36.67 per share. ROIC finished at 42.8% and operating cash flow was over $2 billion which allowed us to return $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, these strong results for 2023 are the byproduct of a lot of hard work from our entire team, and I'm very proud of what we've been able to accomplish. As we embark on another year, regardless of what market we face, we are well positioned to continue our momentum and expect to drive great results for our stakeholders in 2024 and beyond.  With that, I will turn it over to Dee. Thank you, Dee. Grainger continues to build deep trust with our customers as we partner with them to fulfill their MRO needs. While we expect the market in 2024 to be more muted, the Grainger team will continue to focus on what matters advancing our growth drivers to improve the customer experience and providing the exceptional service we are known for. When we live our principles, we can be successful in the man of the cycle. I have full confidence that we will deliver strong results again this year.  With that, we will open up the line for questions. You've tracked that. I think you tracked that correctly. The only other thing I would add is that when we -- during the Investor Day when we said 40%, I think we probably knew that there was -- the supply chain efficiencies is a big bucket. We probably knew that there was a lot of inefficiency. I think we probably maybe have been surprised at how much in efficiency and as we've gotten back to normal, that's been a big a big tailwind for us. And so we probably -- if we had known, it was just difficult to see all that. We probably would have had a higher number of back then as well. Yes. And I appreciate the question. In terms of returning to near normal service, I would say everything that we directly control is back to normal in terms of our own internal cycle times transportation is back to normal. There's still some elongated supplier lead times, which is the reason we're still probably a little shy of where we were. But from a competitive standpoint, that's all that really matters is a competitive standpoint, we're doing quite well. In terms of the investments we're making, we're filling in gaps where we've grown to the point where having buildings in those locations make sense. And they make sense not only to improve service, but to improve cost in some perspective. So if you think about the Northwest. Most of our product today comes out of California has to clear the mountains and get in there and that's a long haul. We now have enough volume to be able to improve the service dramatically in the Northwest and actually lower transportation cost pretty substantially. So we look at all those factors, service and cost and when we make these decisions, but we're very confident in what we've outlined and announced so far that those are the right things to do for the health of the business. I mean I'll start and Dee, if you want to add in, you can. I think the thing to note is that we tend to look at productivity from a core productivity standpoint. So distribution centers, contact centers, seller productivity, all those levers. And we really see opportunity across the business. And I think we're going to see really nice core productivity this year. The headwinds are more around the growth investments, which we think are absolutely the right thing to do, they're high return growth investments. But we are spending more money in marketing and we're investing in the sales force. And so those things make it -- the headline number looked a little more challenging. And it's a time in place when we are investing in those things and believe that's the right thing to do. But we're going to continue to get core productivity. It's an evergreen initiative for us to look everywhere in the business. And I think we've got a whole bunch of things teed up to improve the productivity of the core business. It's a mix. It's a mix. And I think it just practically, if you thought about it, we're a lot bigger than 2019. There was almost no way to actually build buildings productively during the pandemic, you couldn't get things going. And so we were a little bit behind. We talked about that in 2022. So a part of it is catch-up but a part of it is planning for the future growth as well. And I would say the square footage isn't exactly capacity because the bulk warehouse portion of those is lower cost and doesn't quite give you as much capacity as does the other buildings, but certainly, Houston and Portland are added capacity similar to the other capacity of the number. Yes. I mean first and foremost, I would reiterate that we are an organic growth company, and that's where we are focused on most of our energy. We get a lot of looks at things and opportunities. I would say that we get 2 types of looks of the distributors, which probably haven't been as interesting to us. And then there are some potential technology investments and things that might be more interesting to us. So we continue to look at a wide range of opportunities in areas that we think are really important to the success of the business, particularly some specific domains that we think we need to be really good at going forward, and we might invest in those areas. But as I said, we are primarily an organic growth company at this point. Yes. So without getting overly detailed, I would say that the demand generation investments are typically SG&A investments, so marketing and seller ads or SG&A investments. Whereas a lot of the capacity investments we're making in productivity investments or AI investments or technology investments, most of this showing capital, some shows up in expense for sure. But if you think about -- when we talk about spending $450 million, $550 million in capital, the vast majority of that comes from supply chain investments and capacity increases and in technology. And so I would think of it in those terms. And technology is building capabilities and advantage in information assets and supporting the growth initiatives in the core business as well versus marketing to our more direct spend that go into demand generation. Yes, it talked about it. Yes, we do expect to get SG&A leverage over time, and we are probably making more incremental investments in this year than others. Yes. So that is probably true. We're also -- just I would just point out, in a fairly flat price environment, that SG&A is -- its more difficult to get SG&A leverage as well. So there's a number of factors going on. Dee, do you have any? Yes. And the other thing I'd add to that is that both in marketing and seller coverage, we are very well measured. So we are -- everything is tested. We don't make the investments lightly. We know exactly what returns are getting. So if they're a positive return, we will make them even if in the year, they might slow down our SG&A leverage because it is the right thing to do for the overall profitability of the business. Yes, sure. So I can take the -- I mean, I can try to take both of them. I guess the first one I think there were 2 factors that made January slow start. One was that most of the schools were shut, which show some activity in the first week of January, which last year, schools opened in midweek. And we noticed that and we noticed that in some of the schools we serve as well as just the broader economy. And then obviously, the cold weather week. What I would say is that the last 2 weeks of January were very normal for us. And so while there was some slowness, it wasn't -- in the course of the quarter, it will be very, very small in terms of the impact, but noticeable in a month, of course, because it's many weeks, but it's not huge in the grand scheme of things, it's just noise. And so we don't -- we won't focus too much on that.  I think any forecast for the MRO market any year, I think you could argue could be risk to the upside or downside, I don't know. This is our current forecast, and we have economists internally and external that we look at, and this is the forecast they have right now. So that's what we're going with. But that too will always change and it will never be right until we know that. So again, we want to over-index on the forecast. Yes. So I think what I would say there is that, obviously, as the B2C and B2C like volume shrinks, it becomes less of an impact on the rest of the business and our business customer activity has actually been reasonably healthy through the entire quarter. We do expect some of the decline to be less impactful in the back half of the year. So we should have less drag in the back half of the year than we have in the first half of the year from the decline B2C lifeline. So on the Red Sea, we don't have much volume going through that -- those lanes. Most of our shipping volume comes out of Asia through to the West Coast and then as railed to our network. And so that has not been impacted. So we've really seen nothing there. Could you repeat the second half of your question? . Yes. I mean much of our freight, most of our freight actually goes into our gross profit line, but we -- our forecasts haven't changed much given the activity we've seen, given the lines we're in. Certainly, things like fuel increases can have an impact and who knows how that's going to play out. But right now, we're actually still in a favorable position relative to a year ago -- certainly on ocean freight at this point. So we expect that to continue through the first part of the year, and then we'll see what happens. Yes, it's probably more of a 25% -- so to be clear, MonotaRO this year, we'll be hitting that already, we think it's low double-digit low teens. So that will be close to that for the year. And then Zoro will start the year lower than that, and we expect them to get a bit better as the year goes along. We probably won't get there by this year, but that would be more in out years, we think that's the target. Just to add to that, I think the practical reality was that if you think back to 2022, we took a budget price midyear that from a 2023 Q1 to 2022 Q1 comparison made 2023 have very high price increases relative to the year before because we took them in the middle of the year and those -- so it wasn't all taken January 1 last year, but all the inflation run up in 2022 made last year look a little unusual from a first quarter price increase. Q1 and full year. Absolutely. Yes. I think it was basically neutral. We did have -- you're right, midsize customers did grow faster than the largest customers. Overall, it was not a meaningful impact, as I understand it. Dee and I are in different rooms, so she's sequestered. So we're looking at each other through a camera here. All right.

            "content": "Thanks, D.G. And I pause those upfront, everyone. I'm a little [indiscernible] today, so please bear with me. Turning to our [Technical Difficulty] fourth quarter results. We had a solid quarter to finish out the year with profitability coming in stronger than expected, but also reflected some top line softness as we exited the year. For the total company results, daily sales grew 5.1% or 5.5% on a daily organic constant currency basis, which was driven by growth across both segments. Consistent with what we've seen all year, year-over-year top line growth rates continue to moderate as we wrap price pass in the prior year. While sales finished within our implied guidance range for the quarter, we did see more holiday-related softness than anticipated as we ended the quarter.  The total company gross margin for the quarter finished at 39.1%. And declining by 50 basis points over the prior year period. Both segments saw slight year-over-year margin contraction as expected, which I will detail in the coming slides, but in total, finished the quarter at the top end of our implied fourth quarter guidance. Total company operating margin was up 80 basis points which was aided by a lap of roughly $35 million of onetime expenses in the prior year period. When excluding this impact, SG&A as a percentage of sales was still favorable versus prior year by roughly 40 basis points. In total, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $8.33, which was up over 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2022.  Moving on to segment level results. The High Tech Solutions segment continues to perform well, with sells up 4.7% of both the reported and daily organic constant currency basis, fueled by growth across all geographies. Volume growth remains strong and accounts for a vast majority of the overall year-over-year expansion. In the U.S., almost all customer end markets continue to see growth in the fourth quarter with government contractors and health care seeing the strongest year-over-year performance. Canada grew slowly in Q4, driven by a softer macro but the business remains solidly profitable in the quarter and finished 2023 with their most profitable year and over half a decade.  For the segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 41.4%, down 50 basis points versus the prior year due to negative price/cost spread a year-end inventory cost adjustments, which included the lap of a prior year LIFO inventory benefit that we did not repeat in 2023. These headwinds were partially offset by the continued supply chain tailwinds we've seen all year as improved product availability and lower fuel and container costs drove year-over-year favorability. Although we were price cost negative in the quarter and for the full year of 2023, we are nearly neutral on a 2-year stack as the timing favorability captured in 2022 as fully unwound and we enter 2024 on a neutral [indiscernible].  At the operating margin line, we saw an improvement of 90 basis points year-over-year as the slight GP decline was offset by leverage in the business despite continued investment in marketing and head count to drive long-term growth. As mentioned, the year-over-year SG&A leverage was aided by roughly 90 basis points due to the lap of onetime expenses in the prior year period. Overall, it was another solid quarter for the High-Touch Solutions North American segment, wrapping up a great year.  Looking at market outlook on Slide 13. We estimate that the U.S. MRO market grew in the quarter between 2.5% and 3%, largely driven by price with industrial production, our proxy for volume remaining roughly flat year-over-year. This indicates that the High-Touch Solutions U.S. business achieved roughly 225 basis points of outgrowth in the fourth quarter in total. This more muted quarterly outgrowth reflects higher market-based inflation and Grainger's Q4 price contribution due to the timing of where we pass price versus the market. On a pure volume basis, when looking at our volume contribution versus IP growth our market out growth was closer to 475 basis points.  In any case, as D.G. mentioned, looking at the full year, we achieved an annual outgrowth target by capturing approximately 525 basis points of growth above the market and remain poised to deliver against our target again in 2024.  Moving to our endless assortment segment. Sales increased 6% or 8.2% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 2.6%, while MonotaRO achieved 9.9% growth in local days local currency. At a business level, Zoro's growth reflects the continuation of headwinds they've experienced all year with declines in noncore B2C volume and slowing macro environment impacting its B2B customers.  B2B customer growth remained steady in the high single digits for the quarter while noncore B2C and B2C light customer performance remained down over 20% year-over-year. At MonotaRO, macro-related headwinds continued to impact results, however, the business still drove strong growth with increased sales to new and enterprise customers while also maintaining strong repeat purchase rate. From a profitability perspective, gross margins in the segment declined 60 basis points versus the prior year as MonotaRO favorability was offset by year-over-year declines at Zoro.  As in the prior quarters, MonotaRO results reflect continued freight efficiencies, while the Zoro decline was driven by negative product mix and the impact of unfavorable timing from prior year price increases. Operating margins for this segment expanded by 50 basis points to 7.8% as the unfavorable gross margin was offset by SG&A leverage aided by the lap of onetime distribution center and commissioning costs in the prior year.  Now looking forward to 2024. We expect to deliver another solid year of performance [indiscernible] more muted MRO market. Our outlook for the year includes revenue to be between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion at the total company level with daily organic constant currency sales growth between 4% and 7%, driven by top line growth in both segments. With our High-Touch Solutions segment, we expect daily organic constant currency sales growth between 3.5% and 6.5%. In the U.S., we're planning for the total MRO market growth to be largely flat with a range of down 0.5% to plus 1.5%. This assumes the flattish volume range coupled with price inflation between 0 and 1%.  On top of this market outlook, we expect to continue executing against our strategic growth engines to achieve 400 to 500 basis points of U.S. market outlook in 2024. In the endless assortment segment, we anticipate daily constant grocery sales to grow between 7% and 10%, which normalizes for the impact of 2 additional business days and expected foreign currency exchange headwinds. MonotaRO is expected to grow in the low double digits in local currency and local gains as they continue to ramp new and enterprise customers [indiscernible] an expected slower macro demand environment. Zoro is anticipated to grow in the mid-single digits as we anticipate that many of the macro-related headwinds impacting their core B2B customers hold over to 2024. We also expect the continued unwind of B2C and B2C like customers, which include resellers and marketplaces to impact results, especially in the first half of the year.  In 2024, the team will focus on growing long-term relationships with its core B2B customers, including work to improve targeted marketing, fine-tune their pricing model and drive consistent service for all of their customers.  Moving to our margin expectations. Even after normalizing to some onetime gross margin benefits we realized in 2023, we expect total company operating margins to remain quite healthy in 2024. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, operating margins will stay relatively flat year-over-year between 17.4% and 17.9%. We expect gross profit margins to be down in 2024 after lapping roughly 50 basis points of onetime benefits captured in 2023.  We anticipate price cost for the year will be the only neutral as we worked our way through the timing discrepancy we've seen over the last couple of years. On the SG&A side, we expect modest leverage while we continue to make incremental investments towards our strategic initiatives to fuel our growth. In endless assortment, we are modeling operating margins to be roughly consistent to what we've seen in the back half of 2023 and 7.3% to 7.8% range as the segment rebaseline following Zoro's revenue declines with the noncore B2C and B2C-like customers.  At the business unit level, Zoro's operating margins are expected to decline, while MonotaRO's operating margins are expected to be neutral for the year.  Turning now to capital allocation. We expect the business will continue to generate strong cash flow in the year with an expected range of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, implying operating cash conversion around 100%. We plan to continue to execute a consistent return-driven approach to our capital allocation strategy, meaning our priorities remain largely unchanged from prior years. First, we look at investing in the business and both organic investment and opportunistic M&A. For 2024, we expect capital spending in the range of $400 million to $500 million. Spending here includes continued supply chain expansion in the United States as we worked to [indiscernible] facilities in the Pacific Northwest and the Houston area. We also plan to further invest in our homegrown data and technology capabilities, helping power our growth engines and further our customer value proposition. Lastly, sustainability-related spin remains a priority. We will continue to invest in projects with solid returns to help achieve our emissions targets.  On M&A, we remain highly selective, but are also open to investing in capabilities and acquiring the right assets to further our strategy. And we have a small dedicated team who continually evaluate opportunities in this area. Secondly, we expect to return the balance of our excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. As always, we'll formally set our 2024 dividend in the second quarter, but I can say we remain proud of our history of increasing the dividend for 52 consecutive years we expect to do so in day this year. We do not tie our dividend payout to specific metrics. However, we anticipate consistent annual dividend increases in the high single digits to low double-digit percentage range every year.  Lastly, we expect to allocate the balance of our cash flow to share repurchases and anticipate the amount to be between $900 million and $1.1 billion in 2024. We think this return-focused allocation philosophy provides the organization optimal flexibility to efficiently manage investment while maximizing shareholder returns.  In summary, rolling all this up at the total company level, as mentioned, we plan to grow top line by [indiscernible] 4% to 7% on the daily organic constant currency basis. Note that reported sales growth is a bit higher than our daily organic constant currency range as we are normalizing for the divestiture of our [indiscernible] ENR subsidiary, FX changes and the impact of 2 additional selling days in 2024 compared to the prior year.  A reconciliation of these impacts is provided in the appendix of this presentation. Operating margin, as we discussed ranged from 15.3% to 15.8% leading to expected EPS growth of 3.6% to 10.5% or $38 to $40.50 per share. From a seasonality perspective, we do expect both revenue and profitability to be more back half weighted as we move through the year. This includes a softer start in January from the timing of the New Year's holiday and cold weather disruptions experienced mid-month across a large portion of the U.S. With this, January sales started slowly, but picked up momentum as not progress with preliminary results of 4.4% on a daily organic constant currency basis.  On profitability with more muted inflation in the year, we won't see the price timing favorability we normally captured in the first quarter. With this, those margins will show very little seasonality and remain reasonably subsistent with our full year gross margin outlook throughout the year. For SG&A, we expect year-over-year deleverage in the first quarter as we ramp up investment spending in 2024. Leverage will improve each quarter, looking to a tailwind in the back half of the year. Altogether, this will drive EPS growth to be flat to slightly down in the first quarter and will ramp thereafter as the year [indiscernible]  before I hand it back to D.G., I wanted to quickly touch on our long-term outlook and where we expect to take the business over the next several years. As we discussed on our last call, we made great progress towards the 2025 targets we rolled out at our Investor Day in September 2022. We remain on track to hit our revenue goals that are meaningfully ahead on most of our profitability targets. With this, we're replacing our 2025 targets with an updated long-term earnings framework. The framework is actually quite similar to what we've discussed previously, as we continue to target double-digit annual EPS growth in a normalized MRO market, driven by continued strong top line growth, including 400 to 500 basis points of annual market outgrowth in the High-Touch U.S. business and annual growth in the [indiscernible] stable gross profit margins, which should normalize from the 2024 baseline and SG&A growing Florida sales while still investing in demand generation activities to drive sustainable long-term growth. You will notice we made a few tweaks to the earnings framework, which largely offset.  First, we've widened the top line outlook for analyst assortment as each business there is facing dynamics making it harder to achieve historical growth rate. With MonotaRO, at this stage of their maturity, the business has onboarded most of the large and midsized business within the market. With this, the team is pivoting its marketing strategy from firm level of customer acquisition to end user penetration in an effort to expand total customer share win. As though, following the post-pandemic volume decline from B2C and B2C customers, the business is refocusing their efforts on B2B customers as they work to build long-term profitable relationships with the core -- with this core customer set.  As the business be focused, we think it's prudent to widen range of growth outcomes for this segment over the next few years. Regardless, we still expect to deliver very strong growth through this segment and remain confident in the model's ability to continue to take share and drive profitable operating scale to the total business overall. Second, as we [indiscernible] shadowed last quarter, we expect to maintain elevated gross margins in the High-Touch Solutions segment, which is underpinned by the confidence we have in executing against our 2 core pricing [indiscernible] remaining market price competitive while maintaining price cost neutrality.  Adding these together, net-net, we end at roughly the same outlook as we discussed at Investor Day. Strong earnings growing in double digits annually. When we drive these results, the business with [indiscernible] considerable amount of cash, which we will allocate through a consistent and turn driven approach. This includes continuing to invest in the business at an elevated level for the next few years as we add incremental supply chain capacity and continue to build out our technology capability. And all this up, and we think this represents an attractive return profile, we remain well positioned to drive significant value creation for our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks. Let me start with the first question first, and then maybe I'll have you reask the second part of it to make sure I don't forget anything. So when we go back to 2019, I think we've done a pretty good job on just product gross margins in general and being able to prophetize customers based upon the services that we provide from the High-Touch Solutions business. In addition to that, the pricing strategy change has taken allow to be completely executed as we said over a number of years, and that included making sure that we could get pricing right on all of our for -- all of our customers. So some of that evidence also flows into our product GP. And then as of late, we've continued to gain quite a bit of supply chain efficiencies from coming out of the pandemic as well as some other COGS efficiencies related to supplier rebates related to negotiations. Those would be some of the key differences between where we are today and where we were in 2019. So can you repeat your second part of the question for me, please? Yes. So some of the offsets we made to the fact that as we go into this year, we're going to have a faster pricing environment. And based upon that, we want to make sure that we're providing a range such that is realistic for us to hit also in a softer volume environment for the overall business. And so those are some of the 2 primary reasons why being officially flat we would expect to be closer to the high end. We've got some tailwinds that will continue to normalize after some of the disruptions that we've had over the past few years, specific to supply chain and mix, and that will help as well. Yes. So Dave, I will start with the U.S. price that we're focusing on when you think about that outline of flattish, we're expecting price to be between 0% to 1% for the year in the U.S. And on Slide 20, specifically, stable gross margins really is applying to the total company, and you can also apply that to High-Touch in some ways as well. Yes. The other thing I would point to is just our improvement in return on invested capital. I think that was one of the reasons why that's one of the metrics that we talk about track and are focused on is ensuring that the investments we make, whether they are CapEx investments or SG&A based upon how we calculate ROIC, we are very focused on ensuring that they help us deliver and grow at least not operating margin, operating dollar growth as well for us. Yes. I mean it was really small. And I think if you go back to -- we forecast -- and it should be no surprise with our price cost outcome will be in Q4. We've been looking at this and talking about it for the last 2 years. If you go back to 2022, we noted that we were going to be significantly price cost positive in that year, and it would unwind in 2023 and it did, and you saw that and experience that in the second half of of 2023. And so a lot of it is timing, as we know we talked about price and cost in our business is very lumpy being north of 70% of our business will contract customers and the timing of those things. And so on a 2-year stack being essentially neutral and exiting this year and start in 2024, the neutral footing, I think was really important. Yes. We've been fairly consistent for a number of years in our buyback practices generally under the vail of overall capital allocation strategy and we look to be in the market all the time based upon what the price of shares are. We don't try to time the market from a price perspective, but always looking to be into the market buying shares. And so generally, we have pretty stable pace across the year for the share buybacks. So this is the -- we've gone from a as you know, over the last year or so a highly cost inflationary environment to something that is much more muted today -- coming down today are much more reasonable or normalized is the term I would use is what we're seeing. I would say, our product management team, utilizes the same sets of strategic and tactical activities with our supply base. We want to remain to be a customer of choice for them. And so we're working to ensure that we continue to have advantage price and advantaged access to products at the best price possible. So things are getting to more normal level for us today. No. No. I think your -- Slide 13, you're kind of looking at what we have listed as what we think the market performance has been by quarter. Yes. And so that difference is really that our price in the quarter was lower than the PMI print in the quarter. And so we were just highlighting for you that if you just look at the volume for IP versus our volume, then our share gain would have been 4.75. So there's a difference in the market price as published today in Q4 versus what we realized from a price perspective. And the comments I was making earlier about timing is that our timing is not always going to be in line with the timing of price in the market. And this quarter was just one example of that. But you also have other examples if you look back over the course of several other quarters as we've outperformed the market. So we try to look at it on a 2-year stack, trying to get to neutral over a longer period of time. Yes. So no, we always put through price if prices warranted early in the year, but it's more like a seasonality question. So I'll probably respond to it in that way. We do expect a lot of the outlook that we've given for 2024 to be back-end weighted. We talked a little bit about pieces of it, which was sales starting slower, tougher comp. Q1 last year was a very strong year for us, which included a whole lot of price in that quarter with a price outlook of 0 to 1. Of course, our price for this year, the quarter will be more muted versus that. And we expect price to become more favorable throughout the year and for gross margins to be relatively stable versus the outlook that we have given. And so that's what I mean when you talk about kind of sales and price in the first quarter versus the prior year. Q1 and full year. Well, like we've talked a little bit about freight. We'll continue to get freight and supply chain efficiencies and some product mix. But again, it all starts with the fact that we don't expect to have a lot of price in the market this year, just generally so. We expect gross margins to be reasonably consistent from what we talked about all through the year. So that's the basic reason for that muted price. So yes. So yes, SG&A is going to deleverage in the first quarter because we're going to continue, as noted, to ramp our investments in marketing and sellers and others and the like. But we do expect leverage will improve as the year progress, flipping to more of a tailwind in the back half of the year for us. And then just if you kind of move down a little bit, we think operating margin in Q1 will be at its lowest point as well and EPS will be flattish year-over-year in the first quarter as well. I missed that last part. I heard you say that. Could you repeat it? ."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. \nKyle Bland : Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Vice President and CFO.  As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q3 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website.  This morning's call will focus on our third quarter 2023 results, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis for all periods presented. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements.  Now I'll turn it over to D.G. \nD.G. Macpherson : Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter performance and then pass it to Dee to walk through our results in detail. As I typically do, I'd like to start today's call with some reflections on how our Grainger Edge framework continues to drive our success. Unlike last year, our results in 2023 have not benefited from outsized macro tailwinds and we don't expect this to change for the remainder of the year as MRO market volume growth remained slightly negative. This means we must emphasize the value we bring through our customer experience and supply chain network to drive profitable share gain.  I've recently had the opportunity to spend time with several manufacturing and government customers in California. While the first on their operations, it was clear that our advantaged supply chain, strong digital capabilities and ability to solve complex problems adding value for these customers. All of this is helping us to continue to gain share.  Before we get into the results, I want to share a few examples of how our team members continually deliver our principles and improve the communities where we operate. Last month, our team members assembled more than 4,000 buckets to help natural disaster victims across the U.S. These buckets were strategically placed in regions vulnerable to hurricanes and flooding to ensure residents are prepared to quickly respond when a crisis hits.  And for the second year in a row, Grainger has been recognized as one of Fortune's Best Places to Work for Women. This recognition is based on team member responses to key questions based on trust, respect, credibility, fairness, pride and camaraderie. We know that when team members till heard and recognized, we unlock the full potential of our team and the full potential of our business.  Now let's dive into the quarter.  On Slide 5, you can see we had another strong quarter as demand stayed reasonably steady as we continue to provide strong service and deliver tangible value to our customers. We finished the quarter with sales growth of 6.7% or 8.7% on a daily constant currency basis. Results again were driven by positive performance in both segments, most notably within the High-Touch Solutions segment, where we continue to drive profitable share gain.  Total company operating margin was 15.9%, an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year, has improved gross margin performance driven by continued freight and supply chain efficiencies, along with favorable product mix, largely fell to the bottom line. Combine this with our strong top line performance, and we delivered another quarter of robust EPS growth, record operating cash flow and strong ROIC of over 44%. We also returned a total of $287 million to Grainger shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases.  In the High-Touch Solutions segment, we are advancing our 5 key growth engines as we continue to leverage our technology and data assets to unlock further value for customers. We remain focused on extending our service advantage and officially broke ground on our previously announced distribution center outside of Portland which we expect will help enhance our service performance in the Pacific Northwest. Within the Endless Assortment business, while we continue to see a softer demand environment, we remain focused on acquiring new customers and improving repeat purchase rates across the segment driving long-term profitable growth. Overall, 2023 is shaping up to be another great year as we follow the Grainger Edge, make progress on our strategy and drive value for customers. We remain on track to deliver over 20% earnings growth for shareholders.  And with that, I'll pass it to Dee to go through the details. \nDee Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. On Slide 7, you can see the high-level results for the total company, including strong sales growth of 8.7% on a daily constant currency basis driven by growth across both segments. This is a relatively stable growth rate compared to the second quarter, even as price contribution declined as we wrap inflation pass in the prior year period.  Total company operating margin was up 60 basis points, primarily due to expanded gross margin in High-Touch, which more than offset lower EA gross margin and slight SG&A deleverage across the business. In total, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.43, which was up over 14% versus the third quarter of 2022.  Moving on to segment level results. The High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well, with sales up 8.5% in daily constant currency underpinned by growth across all geographies. Volume accelerated sequentially and contributed 6 percentage points of growth, excluding price contribution for the first time in 5 quarters.  In the U.S., we continue to drive year-over-year growth in all customer in segments with government and transportation growing faster. Canadian daily sales were strong, up 9.1% in local days in local currency. For this segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 41.7%, up 110 basis points versus the prior year. We continue to benefit from improved product availability, which drove freight and supply chain efficiencies in the quarter.  Product mix also remained a tailwind, partially driven by an outsized number of project-related value-added services in the current year period, a level which we don't expect to repeat going forward. As expected, price/cost spread was negative as the timing favorability captured in 2022 continues to unwind. This price/cost trend will continue in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate finishing nearly neutral on a 2-year stack for the full year 2022 and 2023 combined.  At the operating line, we saw improvement of 70 basis points year-over-year as GP favorability was partially offset by continued marketing and headcount investments to drive long-term growth. SG&A leverage was further impacted by one less selling day in the current year period. Overall, it was another strong quarter for the High-Touch Solutions North American segment.  Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market grew between 2.5% and 3.5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 550 basis points of outgrowth for the High-Touch Solutions U.S. business in the quarter. Performance remains above our annual target to outgrow the market by 400 basis points to 500 basis points, driven by consistent execution across our 5 growth engines. We continue to remain confident in our ability to achieve our annual outlook target through any economic cycle.  Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 4.3% or 9.2% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjust for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 1.2%, while MonotaRO achieved 12.6% growth in local days, local currency. At the business level, while we're seeing some signs of macro-related softness at MonotaRO, the business still drove strong growth with new and enterprise customers and remain focused on growing repeat business with its core B2B customer.  At Zoro results reflect a continuation of headwinds discussed last quarter with tough prior year comp decline was noncore B2C volume and a slowing macro environment all contributing to more muted top line growth. Noncore B2C customer performance was down nearly 20% year-over-year as we continue to focus our growth efforts on stickier B2B customers. Core B2B customer growth remains in the high single digits for the quarter and continues to reflect a slower macro for small businesses and in end markets where Zoro is more skewed. We expect these pressures to persist for at least the balance of the year.  From a profitability perspective, gross margin for the segment declined 20 basis points versus the prior year as MonotaRO favorability was offset by year-over-year declines at Zoro. MonotaRO results reflect continued freight efficiencies and strong price realization in the quarter while the Zoro decline was driven by negative product mix and the impact of unfavorable timing from prior year price increases. These gross margin headwinds coupled with the continued demand generation investments in softer Zoro top line drove a 70 basis point decline in operating margins for the segment.  On Slide 11, we continue to propel the Endless Assortment flywheel as we add new users and grow our SKU count. Total registered users were up 15% in total across the segment, and we continue to grow our assortment at Zoro having added roughly 600,000 SKUs in the quarter, pushing the portfolio total to over 12.8 million products offered.  Now looking forward to the rest of the year, you can see that we've narrowed our guidance ranges for the full year 2023. The new outlook includes total company daily sales growth between 8.5% and 9.5% and an EPS range between $36 and $36.60. These updated figures imply a Q4 daily sales growth between 4.5% and 8.5%, which includes 4% month-to-date growth in October, which is in line with our expectations and reflects a total comparison given hurricane-related sales in the prior year. This month-to-date growth is roughly 100 basis points higher in constant currency.  From a margin perspective, we are raising the lower end of our ranges and now expect operating margin for the full year to be between 15.6% and 15.7%, a record year for the total company. The new range implies fourth quarter operating margin will be lower sequentially as we anticipate product mix to normalize with fewer value-added service engagement and SG&A margin to delever in line with typical seasonality in the fourth quarter. Supplemental guidance covering cash flow and share repurchase expectations, which have also been increased can be found in the appendix of the presentation. All told, we're pleased to achieve full year results that includes the absorbed price for sales, profitability and cash flow further strengthening of our track record of delivering strong returns for Grainger shareholders.  With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for closing remarks. \nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Dee. Before we close out, I wanted to quickly reflect on the tremendous progress that we've made over the years since our Investor Day last fall. As you may recall, we outlined an earnings framework that got us to some attractive 3-year targets that included us delivering strong top line growth, ramping to record operating margins and producing double-digit EPS growth through 2025. With the 2023 guidance you just outlined, even if you were to normalize for some of the onetime benefits elevating our margins this year, we are trending favorably towards the 2025 targets.  As we look beyond 2023, the core tenets of this earnings framework remain intact. We will continue to focus on maximizing earnings dollars generation by delivering strong top line growth, maintaining healthy gross margins, which we expect are going to stabilize after adjusting for the onetime benefits we realized in 2023 and gaining expense leverage by growing SG&A slower than sales. Executing against this framework positions us well to deliver attractive returns and consistently produce double-digit EPS growth for our shareholders.  With that, we will open up the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. \nRyan Merkel : Nice quarter. I wanted to start with a high-level question on gross margin, if I could. I think your guidance for gross margin '25 is 37% and you're a good bit above that here, 39% plus. Can you tell us why your gross margins are so much higher than the expectation you laid out at the Investor Day? \nDee Merriwether: Ryan, this is Dee. Thanks for your question. Like, if you kind of go back in time and think about where we were about a year ago, we were in the midst of kind of coming out of the pandemic. Product availability was not exactly where we wanted it to be, even though our relative performance was pretty good. And we were expecting to get back in line with product availability much later in this year. That snapped forward really quickly in Q1, and it helped us significantly improve our margins. That's one piece.  The other piece I will point you to is we target price cost neutrality over time. And last year around that time, we expected cost to come in a lot sooner than what they did this year. We had passed price earlier last year in anticipation of that cost. Costs really are now flowing through GP as we expected. So a lot of things are timing related. We do -- we are performing better than what we had anticipated at that time, but really it's due to product availability, price/cost timing as we continue to focus on neutrality. And then we've continued to do very well as it relates to freight and supply chain efficiencies. That was also another timing element. \nRyan Merkel : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just a question on trends. Government looks like it's performing very well, transport, same thing, maybe just unpack what the drivers are there? And then can you put a fine point on the October, I think you mentioned 4% month-to-date growth, and that's down from September that's closer to 9%? Just what's going on there? \nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So government, I think a lot of that. Government has been very strong across the board. We have won some new contracts that have come on board that have helped us this year. And so that has been certainly a tailwind. When we say transportation, I think, arguably, we mean aerospace there. Aerospace has been very, very strong. I think the aerospace companies can't build enough airplanes now. So we're benefiting from that. And I would say the market in general remains stable. There's puts and takes, but those two have been certainly on the plus side for us.  In terms of the 4% in growth that we've seen through October so far, there's a couple of things going on there. One is our market share gain, we think, is going to be pretty strong in October, but we did have Hurricane Ian basically generated a lot of startle and other sales last year for us. And so that compare makes the month look a little worse than it actually it is. The underlying volumes are actually still quite good. \nDee Merriwether: And as it relates to the second part of your question, related to the October month-to-date top line growth at 4% and versus our implied for Q4 being in the range of 4.5% to 8.5%. I'll point you to one thing. This time last year, we did support sale-through of products for the recovery related to the Hurricane Ian. And so we are in a period where we're cycling a tougher comp but as the quarter moves on, comps will get easier. So we feel pretty good about the range that we've laid out for the quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. \nTommy Moll : D.G., you used the phrase reasonably steady to characterize the demand environment. So my question is, if you could unpack that a little bit or offer any helpful anecdotes, the revenue guidance or the range was -- midpoint rather moves slightly lower. I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, but is there anything behind that worth calling out? Or is it FX noise or something else? \nD.G. Macpherson: Well, I think the reality is the volume this year, the volume in the market has been near 0, pretty much all year. And so all of our volume share gain -- all volume pluses have been share gain, that will continue. I think the biggest difference is moving through the fourth quarter. We had price that happened last year that has been an increase in our revenue line for the first three quarters, but we lapped that going into the fourth quarter. So we don't really see any changes. There's nothing to be made up, but this is exactly how we predicted the year to play out and it's playing out pretty much exactly as we expected. So we are not at all concerned about the revenue line. It's exactly what we expected. \nTommy Moll : Great. And then shifting back to gross margins and specifically around the High-Touch segment. I know 40% is still the official long-term anchor there, and it may be prudent to wait to revise that. But could you even walk us maybe qualitatively from the 41.7% that you just reported in 3Q to how that may progress for 4Q and even into early next year? \nDee Merriwether: Sure. So you're right, it feels a little early for us to start resetting things. At this point, which I've kind of reiterated the last couple of quarters. But what I would say related to High-Touch and if you compare really Q3 to where we think we're going to go sequentially Q4, I will call out, like in my prepared remarks that we've mentioned our service-related or product mix. That happened as a benefit both in Q2 and in Q3. We don't expect that to continue into Q4. In addition to that, there are some other pieces like that fall into the price cost related to rebates last year. Both years we're doing very good in volume as D.G. noted, but again, volume was really strong last year, still very strong, and then that reset some of your rebates. And so that will kind of fall off a little bit and then price/cost will continue to unwind, Q3 to Q4. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jacob Levinson with Melius Research. \nJacob Levinson : Just touching on the margins. I know you talked about some favorable items you have this year, and you're certainly trending well above those 2025 targets that you laid out, but D.G. or Dee, for that manner, maybe you can just give us a sense of how you're thinking about operating leverage in the business going forward because it -- I would think at least that the growth is there that you're probably not going to see margins contracting meaningfully, even if mix was a little bit worse or price/cost is a little bit worse? \nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean -- so what I would say is that the adjustments that -- once you take out the adjustments that you talked about, we believe that the High-Touch model will be relatively stable moving forward. And we are trending favorable to kind of targets as we talked about. The earnings model is share gain and stable gross margins and grow SG&A slower than sales, that formula is not going to change, and we expect to be able to continue to do that moving forward. \nJacob Levinson : Okay. That's helpful. And just switching gears, I think your balance sheet is probably the least levered maybe since you took over D.G., is that reflecting some conservatism on the macro? Or is there appetite for more aggressive share buybacks or special dividend or otherwise returning more cash to shareholders? \nDee Merriwether: You are correct. We are very fortunate to have a strong balance sheet. And at the time, based upon our cash flow generation, we don't see a significant need to further lever the business, use the word conservatism. You can use that word. But we don't see a big need right now for that. Now based upon our cash flow generation, our access to capital, if there ever becomes a need for that, we feel like we are well positioned to go into the capital markets to help us with anything. But right now, based upon our operating cash flow and conversion, we feel like we're in a good place with leverage. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. \nChristopher Glynn : I was curious on HTS price/cost dynamics, a couple of components. What was price in the quarter? And then is it holding well in the baseline? Looking fine on market competitive pricing to expect neutral price/cost margin impact in '24 like the algorithm? \nDee Merriwether: So just to answer your first question, price/cost for High-Touch was 2.5% in the quarter. And again, we take a longer-term view of price competitiveness, remaining price competitive. And due to the lumpiness of all of the components of price and costs that impact the business, if you look at a 2-year stack, we expect to be close to neutral if you accrue '22 and '23. I would say that would be looking ahead, we would not change that position. We are targeting price cost neutrality over time. When we get to early next year and set the 2024 guide, we'll talk in more detail about 2024. \nD.G. Macpherson: The only thing I'd add to that is that we are not seeing a lot of product cost pressure relative to what we've seen in the last few years. As you might expect, there's been a lot of puts and takes, but generally, we're not expecting a lot of product cost inflation heading into the new year. True. \nChristopher Glynn : Okay. And then on Zoro and MonotaRO, just curious how you're thinking about path back to the kind of 16% to 18% long-term top line targets? \nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So what I'd say is Zoro grew -- I'm sorry, MonotaRO grew to about 13% in the quarter. The Japanese market has not been strong. We've been dealing with some inflation for the first time really, in anybody's memory there. I have a lot of confidence that the team is going to be on the right track to continue to deliver strong growth, whether that's approaching 20 like they've done over the last 20 years or something less than that is probably debatable. But there's absolutely no concerns about the performance of that business.  In Zoro, we've seen some competitors to Zoro actually go negative in the last couple of quarters in terms of revenue. And so that has had an impact. The market certainly has had an impact on Zoro. I think you talked about it. The core B2B sales were up high single digits at this point, which is not where we want to be, but not horrible. There's a lot of other factors going on, particularly consumer business that's falling off, and we want that to fall off. But there's a lot of things we're working on that business to continue to get more repeat business out of customers, and we need to get better and better at that, and the team is working to do that. And that will be the real key to us being successful with growth long term as well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. \nDavid Manthey : My question was along the same lines on Zoro. So I guess I'll try to refine it a bit here. D.G., what you just said in terms of the trends, it sounds like the -- what you're seeing there right now is primarily cyclical in nature. You're not concerned about the strategy there. But then you also said that you are implementing strategic moves to grow that business. Could you just outline a couple of those for us, so we know what the drivers are? \nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So what I would say is there's two pieces to growth to Zoro. One is that this a very simplified, but one is acquiring customers, Zoro has always been really good at acquiring customers. They've been a good customer acquisition engine. The other is developing repeat business for those customers, so you become the place of choice to shop. We've had some success with that. We have a lot of long-term customers. We need to get better at that piece. So most of what we're talking about doing is how to make alterations, it's not really a strategy change, but we're testing a bunch of things to figure out how to improve that part of the business. And that will be the big area of focus going forward. \nDavid Manthey : Got it. Okay. And then on the High-Touch side, product and customer information tools have really been a key driver of the outperformance there. Can you update us -- I don't know if you have statistics on the Salesforce's use of those tools or if you've added any new capabilities lately to those applications? \nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean I think that -- let's start with -- as you know, we are building some of our own software for the first time in a long time and customer information and product information were early in the cycle. Product information, in particular, with a core publishing system that we've developed to help the website, help customer positivity on our website, and this helped really drive a lot of growth through both marketing and merchandising.  The customer information system is supporting marketing efforts. It's also supporting seller coverage, which we have been adding sellers and that help us understand where we can add and become more refined in that. So both of those have been a big driver of growth and will continue to be so going forward. And I think that we still have a long ways to go, particularly customer information to leverage it for all of our sales team and all of our marketing activities, but we continue to get better in those areas. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe : So looking at this -- the fourth quarter margin, Dee, you called out, I think, 50 basis points or thereabouts of sequential margin kind of versus third quarter. Is that math correct, first of all? And then how does that shake out between High-Touch and Endless Assortment? And then I've got a follow-on on the Zoro gross margins as well. \nDee Merriwether: Yes. So you're talking about a sequential change from Q3 to\u2026? \nNigel Coe : Yes, 3Q to 4Q gross margin. \nDee Merriwether: Yes. So total company is about 60 bps. And again, I think -- I know that the pieces are the same. And so the favorability that we saw in Q2 and Q3 related to some services, project related revenue, which is accretive to the business. At a total company level, that's about 40 bps and as High-Touch, that's about 60 bps. And then the other piece I called out, which is really related to some smaller headwinds related to price/cost and some -- that flows through rebates, that's about another 20 basis point total company and round up to close to that on the High-Touch level as well. \nNigel Coe : Okay. And then just to calibrate the comments about price/cost normalization. We're no longer looking at 40% gross margin High-Touch, you're thinking you maintain a higher plateau than that? \nDee Merriwether: What we've said and what D.G. set out reiterate that is we've had some onetime benefits if you look at this year. Earlier in the year, we had a freight accrual-related benefit. We had a supplier rebate benefit that we won't see going forward. And then this product mix, which is related to supplier related services -- not supplier, services-related project benefit. When you pull all that together, that's like a 40 basis point headwind year-over-year that we would expect. But outside of those things, we feel like we will be able to maintain relatively stable gross margins. \nNigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick one on the Zoro gross margins because as you burn off B2C focus on B2B, I thought B2B gross margins would have been higher than B2C. So therefore, you actually get a gross margin mix up. So just wanted to understand that dynamic. \nD.G. Macpherson: In Zoro, that's not the way it works. It's basically one price and spot discounts in some cases. But we don't have differentiated pricing for business to consumers. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. \nStephen Volkmann : I wanted to go back to something you said, D.G. I think you said you didn't expect any cost increases or pressures in '24. I'm not sure exactly how you put that. But are we thinking that cost and price are sort of flat in '24? \nD.G. Macpherson: Well, we haven't really talked about that yet. But we do know that we're not seeing as much product cost pressure as we've seen in the last two years. And there are certain categories where costs will be down that are commodity related and certainly will be up. But generally, we're not seeing a lot of cost pressure. We'll talk about price cost and the actual numbers at the end of the year for next year. \nStephen Volkmann : Okay. Fair enough. And in your long-term algo you talked about leveraging on SG&A, but we didn't actually do that this quarter. I guess we're making some investments. Do those continue for a number of quarters? Or how do we think about the sort of trajectory there? \nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean we're going to continue to invest in the business, but we do believe that we will have consistent over -- in any quarter, you may not see it, but over time, we will have SG&A leverage as we continue to find ways to improve our cost position for us to investing into this. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital Markets. \nChris Dankert : I hate to keep harping on Zoro here, but I'm curious, again, you talked about a couple of different initiatives. But I mean, is there a friction in that system that we need to pull out? Or kind of what can you really get that customer acquisition up? Given SKU count has been moving up and doing well, what else kind of has to happen to the system perhaps on a more holistic basis? \nD.G. Macpherson: Yes, I would reiterate that I think on the customer acquisition piece, which the product breadth really does help, we've actually done quite well. And it's after that, where we're trying to get customers to become repeat customers where we've done well in some cases, but we need to improve that part of the model. And again, not to oversimplify that you use the product breadth to get new customers in, and then you have to become intimate with these customers in some way to get them to repeat buy, and that's really what we're focused on doing. \nChris Dankert : Got it. And just as far as like benchmarking, given the greater cyclicality in that business, how should we be thinking about growth there beyond just this year and some of the challenges we've seen? \nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean we still think that it's going to be a real strong growth driver for the company. We're going to -- like I said, we're running some tests here in the fourth quarter. We're going to learn more, and we'll continue to communicate with you what we think the go-forward growth is as we move forward. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. \nDeane Dray : Question on destocking because it's -- I'm not sure it's an issue for you. Certainly not -- it's not coming up on the call here and in your remarks. Any issues with customer destocking, maybe they're lightening up on some of their working capitals, lead times on products and just all sort of the post-COVID normalization. Is that at all impacting your volumes? \nD.G. Macpherson: No. That really never comes up in customer visits. I was out in Northern California last week. And I would say for our types of products, customers just generally don't ever have like overstock of our inventory, they're buying when they need it. And frankly, a lot of our value proposition is helping them not have too much. So we really pride ourselves in making sure that customers have what they need to keep the business running, and that's really all they have. \nDeane Dray : Good. All right. That's -- I like hearing that. And then maybe I'm just more aware of it now, but is there a bigger push on brand building, both in advertising, TV and radio because I'm certainly hearing it a lot more. And how do you measure the returns on that I'm certainly -- it helps on brand building. It helps some of your outgrowth, but do you have any other precision around that? \nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. Certainly, we've talked about it before, marketing has been a big part of what's helping us gain share. In terms of media advertising, we generally measure returns based on A/B tests where we test in certain markets and understand what the actual pull-through is from those. And so we -- I would say our marketing area is probably the -- as well in measured areas you could possibly imagine. So we can tell you with a lot of precision what's working and what's not, and that helps us figure out what to do. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS. \nChris Snyder : I wanted to ask on the project-related value-added services. I guess first, just to confirm, it sounds like that was a 60 basis point boost to high such gross margin in Q3? And then I guess kind of just higher level, can you just talk a little bit about what are these project-related value-added services that the company is providing? And what makes them 1 time or transitory in nature? \nDee Merriwether: So thanks for the questions. So -- we go to market with our customers to help them solve problems, and those problems are solved with a combination of products, as you know, but also services. We have over 400 what we classify as value-added service providers that help us solve those customers' problems. And this is an ongoing revenue stream for us. However, what we have attempted to call out in this quarter and then also it impacted us in Q2 is that we had a larger number of projects in the services area that we do not believe will repeat. Some of those projects include things that are more steady state for us that we have been working with our customers on over the longer period of time are things like lighting retrofits, roofing projects, safety certifications to help them ensure that they are investing in the right products as well as capabilities to ensure that they can pass safety audits, et cetera. \nChris Snyder : And then was that right? Or did you say earlier, it was a 60 basis point boost in Q3 to the High-Touch gross margin? \nDee Merriwether: Yes, that is correct. \nChris Snyder : Okay. Thank you. And then maybe staying on the topic of services. D.G., in your opening remarks, you talked a lot about the value-added services that Grainger is bringing to the table. I guess as we think about those going forward, do you view those services as a way for you guys to continue to drive price even in a cost environment or purchase environment as called out going sideways? Or do you view those more as just -- well, that's why we can outgrow the market by mid-single digits on a volume basis? \nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So I'd probably frame that a little bit differently. So we are first and foremost a product company. We did two things for almost every customer. We help them simplify their purchasing process. We try to make it really easy for them to buy, receive, pay, return if they need to, the products we have, and then we help customers manage inventory. And so for almost all customers that are of any size, we're doing those two things, and those are not actually in the realm of what you would call value-added services, I should just described.  Then there are a whole bunch of value-added things that we provide to our customers often through our supplier partnerships that are service related. They are a minority of our business, but they are important when customers want them. So if the customer wants to do safety audit. It's really important that we can help them understand what challenges they have and help them get better at safety and so we provide that service to our partners. And we will continue to do those things. But generally, I think the thing that's different this quarter is there was, in particular, a couple of very large projects that probably are not likely to repeat, that were driven by things that typically don't happen and so we just wanted to call those out. But our fundamental business model and how we add value to customers is really around helping them get the products they need to keep their operations running, make sure they have the right inventory. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. \nPatrick Baumann : A lot of numbers like flying around on the gross margin side. So I just want to clarify, the 40 basis points, Dee, that you mentioned of gross margin, on an annual basis? \nDee Merriwether: Yes. When I was calling out... \nPatrick Baumann : Is it '23? \nDee Merriwether: Yes, that is if you are looking to normalize '23 and are thinking about gross margins on a go-forward basis, that's the 40 basis points. \nPatrick Baumann : Right. Right. So all else equal, that's -- so if everything else is 40 basis points comes out of your '23 number as kind of like a baseline? \nDee Merriwether: Correct. \nPatrick Baumann : And that's for next year. Okay. And then the follow-up is it sounds like maybe 2024 is a more normal year for pricing based on your comments that there is a lot of product cost pressure. Assuming that's the case, and with the gross margin coming down a bit. Do you see SG&A inflation slowing off to be able to deliver a bottom line margin expansion? It looks like your fourth quarter guide there was flat year-over-year, but I think maybe there was some onetime benefit in SG&A last year that were onetime cost, I think, in SG&A last year that inflated the prior year results. Just curious if you could give any color on that. \nDee Merriwether: Yes. So I think when you look at our results quarter-over-quarter, there are some timing things that happen. We continue to invest in demand generation to help us ensure that we can drive specifically in the U.S. long-term market outgrowth. When you look at prior year quarter, we had a number of things happen. I think you recall, in Q4, we had a LIFO benefit last year that we will all be cycling. But just zooming out a little bit, if you go back to our framework, over time, we want to outgrow the market in the U.S. by 400 to 500 basis points.  D.G. talked a little bit about the fact that we are -- while we are looking to invest in long-term growth, we also look to gain leverage. And if you really looked into how we're doing that, most of our SG&A investments are really targeted towards high-return demand-generating investments. And a lot of the SG&A productivity are leverage. We are gaining in our noncore SG&A expenses and we accomplished that through really continuous improvement. So we're really targeting things that help us with achieving an improved customer experience, but also assist us with operating more efficiently and effectively. Our intent is to continue to invest in demand gen but also look to offset as much of that as we can -- reasonably can do through continuous improvement activities. If you look at that algorithm that we laid out for Investor Day, it talks about driving double-digit EPS growth over the cycle. And so we still expect to do that. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the floor back to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks. \nD.G. Macpherson: All right. Thanks, everyone. We recognize that today is a very busy day for all of you in terms of the number of people that are releasing results, and I appreciate you spending time with us.  Yes, I would just reiterate that we feel really good about the way the year has played out. It's played out pretty similar to what we expected. We continue to invest in the business to drive profitable share gain. That is our primary focus, and we continue to invest not only that, but in our team and in making sure that our customers are successful. So appreciate you joining us. I hope you have a great day. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All participants may disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dee Merriwether",
            "content": "Thanks, D.G. On Slide 7, you can see the high-level results for the total company, including strong sales growth of 8.7% on a daily constant currency basis driven by growth across both segments. This is a relatively stable growth rate compared to the second quarter, even as price contribution declined as we wrap inflation pass in the prior year period.  Total company operating margin was up 60 basis points, primarily due to expanded gross margin in High-Touch, which more than offset lower EA gross margin and slight SG&A deleverage across the business. In total, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.43, which was up over 14% versus the third quarter of 2022.  Moving on to segment level results. The High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well, with sales up 8.5% in daily constant currency underpinned by growth across all geographies. Volume accelerated sequentially and contributed 6 percentage points of growth, excluding price contribution for the first time in 5 quarters.  In the U.S., we continue to drive year-over-year growth in all customer in segments with government and transportation growing faster. Canadian daily sales were strong, up 9.1% in local days in local currency. For this segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 41.7%, up 110 basis points versus the prior year. We continue to benefit from improved product availability, which drove freight and supply chain efficiencies in the quarter.  Product mix also remained a tailwind, partially driven by an outsized number of project-related value-added services in the current year period, a level which we don't expect to repeat going forward. As expected, price/cost spread was negative as the timing favorability captured in 2022 continues to unwind. This price/cost trend will continue in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate finishing nearly neutral on a 2-year stack for the full year 2022 and 2023 combined.  At the operating line, we saw improvement of 70 basis points year-over-year as GP favorability was partially offset by continued marketing and headcount investments to drive long-term growth. SG&A leverage was further impacted by one less selling day in the current year period. Overall, it was another strong quarter for the High-Touch Solutions North American segment.  Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market grew between 2.5% and 3.5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 550 basis points of outgrowth for the High-Touch Solutions U.S. business in the quarter. Performance remains above our annual target to outgrow the market by 400 basis points to 500 basis points, driven by consistent execution across our 5 growth engines. We continue to remain confident in our ability to achieve our annual outlook target through any economic cycle.  Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 4.3% or 9.2% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjust for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 1.2%, while MonotaRO achieved 12.6% growth in local days, local currency. At the business level, while we're seeing some signs of macro-related softness at MonotaRO, the business still drove strong growth with new and enterprise customers and remain focused on growing repeat business with its core B2B customer.  At Zoro results reflect a continuation of headwinds discussed last quarter with tough prior year comp decline was noncore B2C volume and a slowing macro environment all contributing to more muted top line growth. Noncore B2C customer performance was down nearly 20% year-over-year as we continue to focus our growth efforts on stickier B2B customers. Core B2B customer growth remains in the high single digits for the quarter and continues to reflect a slower macro for small businesses and in end markets where Zoro is more skewed. We expect these pressures to persist for at least the balance of the year.  From a profitability perspective, gross margin for the segment declined 20 basis points versus the prior year as MonotaRO favorability was offset by year-over-year declines at Zoro. MonotaRO results reflect continued freight efficiencies and strong price realization in the quarter while the Zoro decline was driven by negative product mix and the impact of unfavorable timing from prior year price increases. These gross margin headwinds coupled with the continued demand generation investments in softer Zoro top line drove a 70 basis point decline in operating margins for the segment.  On Slide 11, we continue to propel the Endless Assortment flywheel as we add new users and grow our SKU count. Total registered users were up 15% in total across the segment, and we continue to grow our assortment at Zoro having added roughly 600,000 SKUs in the quarter, pushing the portfolio total to over 12.8 million products offered.  Now looking forward to the rest of the year, you can see that we've narrowed our guidance ranges for the full year 2023. The new outlook includes total company daily sales growth between 8.5% and 9.5% and an EPS range between $36 and $36.60. These updated figures imply a Q4 daily sales growth between 4.5% and 8.5%, which includes 4% month-to-date growth in October, which is in line with our expectations and reflects a total comparison given hurricane-related sales in the prior year. This month-to-date growth is roughly 100 basis points higher in constant currency.  From a margin perspective, we are raising the lower end of our ranges and now expect operating margin for the full year to be between 15.6% and 15.7%, a record year for the total company. The new range implies fourth quarter operating margin will be lower sequentially as we anticipate product mix to normalize with fewer value-added service engagement and SG&A margin to delever in line with typical seasonality in the fourth quarter. Supplemental guidance covering cash flow and share repurchase expectations, which have also been increased can be found in the appendix of the presentation. All told, we're pleased to achieve full year results that includes the absorbed price for sales, profitability and cash flow further strengthening of our track record of delivering strong returns for Grainger shareholders.  With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for closing remarks. Ryan, this is Dee. Thanks for your question. Like, if you kind of go back in time and think about where we were about a year ago, we were in the midst of kind of coming out of the pandemic. Product availability was not exactly where we wanted it to be, even though our relative performance was pretty good. And we were expecting to get back in line with product availability much later in this year. That snapped forward really quickly in Q1, and it helped us significantly improve our margins. That's one piece.  The other piece I will point you to is we target price cost neutrality over time. And last year around that time, we expected cost to come in a lot sooner than what they did this year. We had passed price earlier last year in anticipation of that cost. Costs really are now flowing through GP as we expected. So a lot of things are timing related. We do -- we are performing better than what we had anticipated at that time, but really it's due to product availability, price/cost timing as we continue to focus on neutrality. And then we've continued to do very well as it relates to freight and supply chain efficiencies. That was also another timing element. And as it relates to the second part of your question, related to the October month-to-date top line growth at 4% and versus our implied for Q4 being in the range of 4.5% to 8.5%. I'll point you to one thing. This time last year, we did support sale-through of products for the recovery related to the Hurricane Ian. And so we are in a period where we're cycling a tougher comp but as the quarter moves on, comps will get easier. So we feel pretty good about the range that we've laid out for the quarter. Sure. So you're right, it feels a little early for us to start resetting things. At this point, which I've kind of reiterated the last couple of quarters. But what I would say related to High-Touch and if you compare really Q3 to where we think we're going to go sequentially Q4, I will call out, like in my prepared remarks that we've mentioned our service-related or product mix. That happened as a benefit both in Q2 and in Q3. We don't expect that to continue into Q4. In addition to that, there are some other pieces like that fall into the price cost related to rebates last year. Both years we're doing very good in volume as D.G. noted, but again, volume was really strong last year, still very strong, and then that reset some of your rebates. And so that will kind of fall off a little bit and then price/cost will continue to unwind, Q3 to Q4. You are correct. We are very fortunate to have a strong balance sheet. And at the time, based upon our cash flow generation, we don't see a significant need to further lever the business, use the word conservatism. You can use that word. But we don't see a big need right now for that. Now based upon our cash flow generation, our access to capital, if there ever becomes a need for that, we feel like we are well positioned to go into the capital markets to help us with anything. But right now, based upon our operating cash flow and conversion, we feel like we're in a good place with leverage. So just to answer your first question, price/cost for High-Touch was 2.5% in the quarter. And again, we take a longer-term view of price competitiveness, remaining price competitive. And due to the lumpiness of all of the components of price and costs that impact the business, if you look at a 2-year stack, we expect to be close to neutral if you accrue '22 and '23. I would say that would be looking ahead, we would not change that position. We are targeting price cost neutrality over time. When we get to early next year and set the 2024 guide, we'll talk in more detail about 2024. Yes. So you're talking about a sequential change from Q3 to...? Yes. So total company is about 60 bps. And again, I think -- I know that the pieces are the same. And so the favorability that we saw in Q2 and Q3 related to some services, project related revenue, which is accretive to the business. At a total company level, that's about 40 bps and as High-Touch, that's about 60 bps. And then the other piece I called out, which is really related to some smaller headwinds related to price/cost and some -- that flows through rebates, that's about another 20 basis point total company and round up to close to that on the High-Touch level as well. What we've said and what D.G. set out reiterate that is we've had some onetime benefits if you look at this year. Earlier in the year, we had a freight accrual-related benefit. We had a supplier rebate benefit that we won't see going forward. And then this product mix, which is related to supplier related services -- not supplier, services-related project benefit. When you pull all that together, that's like a 40 basis point headwind year-over-year that we would expect. But outside of those things, we feel like we will be able to maintain relatively stable gross margins. So thanks for the questions. So -- we go to market with our customers to help them solve problems, and those problems are solved with a combination of products, as you know, but also services. We have over 400 what we classify as value-added service providers that help us solve those customers' problems. And this is an ongoing revenue stream for us. However, what we have attempted to call out in this quarter and then also it impacted us in Q2 is that we had a larger number of projects in the services area that we do not believe will repeat. Some of those projects include things that are more steady state for us that we have been working with our customers on over the longer period of time are things like lighting retrofits, roofing projects, safety certifications to help them ensure that they are investing in the right products as well as capabilities to ensure that they can pass safety audits, et cetera. Yes, that is correct. Yes. When I was calling out... Yes, that is if you are looking to normalize '23 and are thinking about gross margins on a go-forward basis, that's the 40 basis points. Correct. Yes. So I think when you look at our results quarter-over-quarter, there are some timing things that happen. We continue to invest in demand generation to help us ensure that we can drive specifically in the U.S. long-term market outgrowth. When you look at prior year quarter, we had a number of things happen. I think you recall, in Q4, we had a LIFO benefit last year that we will all be cycling. But just zooming out a little bit, if you go back to our framework, over time, we want to outgrow the market in the U.S. by 400 to 500 basis points.  D.G. talked a little bit about the fact that we are -- while we are looking to invest in long-term growth, we also look to gain leverage. And if you really looked into how we're doing that, most of our SG&A investments are really targeted towards high-return demand-generating investments. And a lot of the SG&A productivity are leverage. We are gaining in our noncore SG&A expenses and we accomplished that through really continuous improvement. So we're really targeting things that help us with achieving an improved customer experience, but also assist us with operating more efficiently and effectively. Our intent is to continue to invest in demand gen but also look to offset as much of that as we can -- reasonably can do through continuous improvement activities. If you look at that algorithm that we laid out for Investor Day, it talks about driving double-digit EPS growth over the cycle. And so we still expect to do that."

            "content": "Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our third quarter performance and then pass it to Dee to walk through our results in detail. As I typically do, I'd like to start today's call with some reflections on how our Grainger Edge framework continues to drive our success. Unlike last year, our results in 2023 have not benefited from outsized macro tailwinds and we don't expect this to change for the remainder of the year as MRO market volume growth remained slightly negative. This means we must emphasize the value we bring through our customer experience and supply chain network to drive profitable share gain.  I've recently had the opportunity to spend time with several manufacturing and government customers in California. While the first on their operations, it was clear that our advantaged supply chain, strong digital capabilities and ability to solve complex problems adding value for these customers. All of this is helping us to continue to gain share.  Before we get into the results, I want to share a few examples of how our team members continually deliver our principles and improve the communities where we operate. Last month, our team members assembled more than 4,000 buckets to help natural disaster victims across the U.S. These buckets were strategically placed in regions vulnerable to hurricanes and flooding to ensure residents are prepared to quickly respond when a crisis hits.  And for the second year in a row, Grainger has been recognized as one of Fortune's Best Places to Work for Women. This recognition is based on team member responses to key questions based on trust, respect, credibility, fairness, pride and camaraderie. We know that when team members till heard and recognized, we unlock the full potential of our team and the full potential of our business.  Now let's dive into the quarter.  On Slide 5, you can see we had another strong quarter as demand stayed reasonably steady as we continue to provide strong service and deliver tangible value to our customers. We finished the quarter with sales growth of 6.7% or 8.7% on a daily constant currency basis. Results again were driven by positive performance in both segments, most notably within the High-Touch Solutions segment, where we continue to drive profitable share gain.  Total company operating margin was 15.9%, an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year, has improved gross margin performance driven by continued freight and supply chain efficiencies, along with favorable product mix, largely fell to the bottom line. Combine this with our strong top line performance, and we delivered another quarter of robust EPS growth, record operating cash flow and strong ROIC of over 44%. We also returned a total of $287 million to Grainger shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases.  In the High-Touch Solutions segment, we are advancing our 5 key growth engines as we continue to leverage our technology and data assets to unlock further value for customers. We remain focused on extending our service advantage and officially broke ground on our previously announced distribution center outside of Portland which we expect will help enhance our service performance in the Pacific Northwest. Within the Endless Assortment business, while we continue to see a softer demand environment, we remain focused on acquiring new customers and improving repeat purchase rates across the segment driving long-term profitable growth. Overall, 2023 is shaping up to be another great year as we follow the Grainger Edge, make progress on our strategy and drive value for customers. We remain on track to deliver over 20% earnings growth for shareholders.  And with that, I'll pass it to Dee to go through the details. Thanks, Dee. Before we close out, I wanted to quickly reflect on the tremendous progress that we've made over the years since our Investor Day last fall. As you may recall, we outlined an earnings framework that got us to some attractive 3-year targets that included us delivering strong top line growth, ramping to record operating margins and producing double-digit EPS growth through 2025. With the 2023 guidance you just outlined, even if you were to normalize for some of the onetime benefits elevating our margins this year, we are trending favorably towards the 2025 targets.  As we look beyond 2023, the core tenets of this earnings framework remain intact. We will continue to focus on maximizing earnings dollars generation by delivering strong top line growth, maintaining healthy gross margins, which we expect are going to stabilize after adjusting for the onetime benefits we realized in 2023 and gaining expense leverage by growing SG&A slower than sales. Executing against this framework positions us well to deliver attractive returns and consistently produce double-digit EPS growth for our shareholders.  With that, we will open up the line for questions. Yes. So government, I think a lot of that. Government has been very strong across the board. We have won some new contracts that have come on board that have helped us this year. And so that has been certainly a tailwind. When we say transportation, I think, arguably, we mean aerospace there. Aerospace has been very, very strong. I think the aerospace companies can't build enough airplanes now. So we're benefiting from that. And I would say the market in general remains stable. There's puts and takes, but those two have been certainly on the plus side for us.  In terms of the 4% in growth that we've seen through October so far, there's a couple of things going on there. One is our market share gain, we think, is going to be pretty strong in October, but we did have Hurricane Ian basically generated a lot of startle and other sales last year for us. And so that compare makes the month look a little worse than it actually it is. The underlying volumes are actually still quite good. Well, I think the reality is the volume this year, the volume in the market has been near 0, pretty much all year. And so all of our volume share gain -- all volume pluses have been share gain, that will continue. I think the biggest difference is moving through the fourth quarter. We had price that happened last year that has been an increase in our revenue line for the first three quarters, but we lapped that going into the fourth quarter. So we don't really see any changes. There's nothing to be made up, but this is exactly how we predicted the year to play out and it's playing out pretty much exactly as we expected. So we are not at all concerned about the revenue line. It's exactly what we expected. Yes. I mean -- so what I would say is that the adjustments that -- once you take out the adjustments that you talked about, we believe that the High-Touch model will be relatively stable moving forward. And we are trending favorable to kind of targets as we talked about. The earnings model is share gain and stable gross margins and grow SG&A slower than sales, that formula is not going to change, and we expect to be able to continue to do that moving forward. The only thing I'd add to that is that we are not seeing a lot of product cost pressure relative to what we've seen in the last few years. As you might expect, there's been a lot of puts and takes, but generally, we're not expecting a lot of product cost inflation heading into the new year. True. Yes. So what I'd say is Zoro grew -- I'm sorry, MonotaRO grew to about 13% in the quarter. The Japanese market has not been strong. We've been dealing with some inflation for the first time really, in anybody's memory there. I have a lot of confidence that the team is going to be on the right track to continue to deliver strong growth, whether that's approaching 20 like they've done over the last 20 years or something less than that is probably debatable. But there's absolutely no concerns about the performance of that business.  In Zoro, we've seen some competitors to Zoro actually go negative in the last couple of quarters in terms of revenue. And so that has had an impact. The market certainly has had an impact on Zoro. I think you talked about it. The core B2B sales were up high single digits at this point, which is not where we want to be, but not horrible. There's a lot of other factors going on, particularly consumer business that's falling off, and we want that to fall off. But there's a lot of things we're working on that business to continue to get more repeat business out of customers, and we need to get better and better at that, and the team is working to do that. And that will be the real key to us being successful with growth long term as well. Yes. So what I would say is there's two pieces to growth to Zoro. One is that this a very simplified, but one is acquiring customers, Zoro has always been really good at acquiring customers. They've been a good customer acquisition engine. The other is developing repeat business for those customers, so you become the place of choice to shop. We've had some success with that. We have a lot of long-term customers. We need to get better at that piece. So most of what we're talking about doing is how to make alterations, it's not really a strategy change, but we're testing a bunch of things to figure out how to improve that part of the business. And that will be the big area of focus going forward. Yes. I mean I think that -- let's start with -- as you know, we are building some of our own software for the first time in a long time and customer information and product information were early in the cycle. Product information, in particular, with a core publishing system that we've developed to help the website, help customer positivity on our website, and this helped really drive a lot of growth through both marketing and merchandising.  The customer information system is supporting marketing efforts. It's also supporting seller coverage, which we have been adding sellers and that help us understand where we can add and become more refined in that. So both of those have been a big driver of growth and will continue to be so going forward. And I think that we still have a long ways to go, particularly customer information to leverage it for all of our sales team and all of our marketing activities, but we continue to get better in those areas. In Zoro, that's not the way it works. It's basically one price and spot discounts in some cases. But we don't have differentiated pricing for business to consumers. Well, we haven't really talked about that yet. But we do know that we're not seeing as much product cost pressure as we've seen in the last two years. And there are certain categories where costs will be down that are commodity related and certainly will be up. But generally, we're not seeing a lot of cost pressure. We'll talk about price cost and the actual numbers at the end of the year for next year. Yes. I mean we're going to continue to invest in the business, but we do believe that we will have consistent over -- in any quarter, you may not see it, but over time, we will have SG&A leverage as we continue to find ways to improve our cost position for us to investing into this. Yes, I would reiterate that I think on the customer acquisition piece, which the product breadth really does help, we've actually done quite well. And it's after that, where we're trying to get customers to become repeat customers where we've done well in some cases, but we need to improve that part of the model. And again, not to oversimplify that you use the product breadth to get new customers in, and then you have to become intimate with these customers in some way to get them to repeat buy, and that's really what we're focused on doing. Yes. I mean we still think that it's going to be a real strong growth driver for the company. We're going to -- like I said, we're running some tests here in the fourth quarter. We're going to learn more, and we'll continue to communicate with you what we think the go-forward growth is as we move forward. No. That really never comes up in customer visits. I was out in Northern California last week. And I would say for our types of products, customers just generally don't ever have like overstock of our inventory, they're buying when they need it. And frankly, a lot of our value proposition is helping them not have too much. So we really pride ourselves in making sure that customers have what they need to keep the business running, and that's really all they have. Yes. Certainly, we've talked about it before, marketing has been a big part of what's helping us gain share. In terms of media advertising, we generally measure returns based on A/B tests where we test in certain markets and understand what the actual pull-through is from those. And so we -- I would say our marketing area is probably the -- as well in measured areas you could possibly imagine. So we can tell you with a lot of precision what's working and what's not, and that helps us figure out what to do. Yes. So I'd probably frame that a little bit differently. So we are first and foremost a product company. We did two things for almost every customer. We help them simplify their purchasing process. We try to make it really easy for them to buy, receive, pay, return if they need to, the products we have, and then we help customers manage inventory. And so for almost all customers that are of any size, we're doing those two things, and those are not actually in the realm of what you would call value-added services, I should just described.  Then there are a whole bunch of value-added things that we provide to our customers often through our supplier partnerships that are service related. They are a minority of our business, but they are important when customers want them. So if the customer wants to do safety audit. It's really important that we can help them understand what challenges they have and help them get better at safety and so we provide that service to our partners. And we will continue to do those things. But generally, I think the thing that's different this quarter is there was, in particular, a couple of very large projects that probably are not likely to repeat, that were driven by things that typically don't happen and so we just wanted to call those out. But our fundamental business model and how we add value to customers is really around helping them get the products they need to keep their operations running, make sure they have the right inventory. All right. Thanks, everyone. We recognize that today is a very busy day for all of you in terms of the number of people that are releasing results, and I appreciate you spending time with us.  Yes, I would just reiterate that we feel really good about the way the year has played out. It's played out pretty similar to what we expected. We continue to invest in the business to drive profitable share gain. That is our primary focus, and we continue to invest not only that, but in our team and in making sure that our customers are successful. So appreciate you joining us. I hope you have a great day. Thank you."

I will now turn the conference over to our host, Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nKyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of the various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q2 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning\u2019s call will focus on our second quarter 2023 results, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis for all periods presented. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO\u2019s public statements. Now, I will turn it over to D.G.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I\u2019ll provide an overview of our second quarter performance and then pass it to Dee to walk through the financials in detail. As we work our way through 2023, Grainger continues to stay focused on what matters most: providing our customers with the products and services they need through exceptional service. Everything we do is grounded in our Grainger Edge framework, which I\u2019d like to highlight today in the context of our recently released ESG report. I would encourage you all to check out the full report at graingeresg.com. Grainger has long been a leader in ESG, both for our customers and in our own operations. Internally, we have laid out four near-term ESG focus areas that are important parts of both our culture and operations. Early indications show that we are making meaningful progress. I will start with our customer sustainability solutions. In 2022, revenue in High-Touch U.S. business for our environmentally preferred products was more than $1 billion and has increased steadily over the last few years. Customer conversations around their environmental footprint have become commonplace and we are well positioned to help customers in this space. On the right side, you will see how we are helping our customers achieve their goals by tying sustainability to our product and service offerings. We recently worked with a large container terminal operator that was in search of an opportunity to offset fossil fuel-based energy use, enhance its group resilience and reduce cost. Through our sustainability services offering, the customer purchased and will install more than 300 solar panels. These panels will help them avoid approximately 4,000 tons of CO2 emissions over the next 20 years, the equivalent of 9 million miles driven by a car. This is just one example, but we partner with our customers like this everyday, connecting them to our network of service provider partners and helping ensure we can be the go-to partner for everything they need to run safe, reliable and sustainable operations. Second, supplier diversity. Grainger plays an important role in champion businesses owned by underrepresented groups, including women, minorities, LGBTQ+ and people with disabilities through this program. Last year, we spent more than $2 billion on products from our diverse supplier base and continue to make further progress as we expand partnerships in this space. Third, energy and emissions. Since 2018, we have reduced our global absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 26%, nearing our 2030 goal of a 30% reduction. And finally, diversity, equity and inclusion. DEI is a continuous journey. We are proud to have been named one of Fortune\u2019s Best Places to Work for Women in addition to being recognized by other organizations for our work to celebrate and support all team members no matter their ethnicity, orientation, age, disability or veteran status. Each of these near-term priorities are an important part of our ESG focus and are helping us to scale our actions to make a greater impact for both Grainger and our customers. Our team will continue to follow the Grainger Edge as we make progress toward our own near-term initiatives and partner with our customers as they work to achieve their ESG goals, together positively impacting the communities where we operate. Now to review highlights for the quarter. As you can see, we again delivered a strong quarter of performance as we continue to show up well in supporting our customers. As expected, year-over-year growth rates are decelerating, but demand remains reasonably steady. For the quarter, we finished with daily sales growth of 9% or 10.1% on a daily constant currency basis. Results again were driven by positive performance in both segments, most notably within the High-Touch Solutions segment, which outpaced the broader MRO market by approximately 525 basis points in the U.S. Total company operating margin was 15.8%, an increase of 190 basis points over the prior year as improved gross margin performance was driven primarily by continued supply chain efficiencies and lower freight and container costs. Combine this with our strong top line growth and we delivered substantial EPS growth, robust operating cash flow and continued ROIC of over 40%. We also returned a combined $265 million to Grainger shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Alongside these great results, we continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives. In the High-Touch model, we are advancing our proprietary product and customer information management systems that fuel our growth engines and allow us to advance marketing, merchandising and seller investments in the U.S. The Endless Assortment business is seeing some macro-related demand softening in the U.S. But overall, the team continues to focus on providing reliable service while increasing repeat purchase rates with core B2B customers at Zoro and growing with enterprise customers at MonotaRO. Lastly, a few weeks ago, we announced our plans to construct a new 500,000 square foot distribution center outside of Portland, Oregon, which will support our customers across the Pacific Northwest and is expected to open in 2025. In addition, we are implementing three smaller bulk-style distribution centers in Pennsylvania, Texas and North Carolina, which are each slated to open over the next few quarters. These investments enable us to keep up with strong customer demand and allow us to extend our industry leading service capabilities, which deliver a best-in-class experience focused on next-day complete fulfillment across the United States. As we remain focused on what matters, I am pleased with the progress we have made through the first half of 2023. With our strong execution and as market demand remains reasonably steady, we are raising the midpoint of our full year 2023 revenue and EPS guidance. I will now pass it over to Dee to go through the details.\nDee Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. Starting with Slide 8 you can see the high-level results for the total company, including strong daily sales growth of 10.1% on a daily constant currency basis. Although year-over-year growth rates decelerated compared to Q1 as inflation cools and as we lap a tougher prior year comparison, daily sales dollars remained strong and we are on track to deliver a great year. Total company operating margin was up 190 basis points as expanded gross margins in both segments were further aided by SG&A leverage in the High-Touch Solutions North American segment. In total, we delivered diluted EPS in the quarter of $9.28, which was up 29% versus the second quarter of 2022. Diving into segment level details, for the second quarter, we continued to see strong results within our High-Touch segment, with daily sales up 9.9%, fueled by revenue growth in all geographies. Although year-over-year growth rates have slowed as we lap prior year price inflation, volume growth remains healthy and was generally in line with our expectations for the quarter. In the U.S., we continue to see positive growth in nearly all customer end segments. However, this does include pockets of softness, including decelerating growth in manufacturing and commercial services. However, given our diversified customer base, this is countered by strong growth in other areas such as government and healthcare. In Canada, the economy remains stable and we are seeing strong results with Canadian daily sales up about 7% in local days and local currency. For this segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 41.7%, up 200 basis points versus the prior year. Product availability levels remained high, resulting in fewer packages and shorter distance shipments in the current year as service returned to near pre-pandemic levels. This one coupled with lower fuel and container rates is driving significant fuel and supply chain tailwinds in the quarter. Product mix was also favorable primarily due to improved product availability and a higher mix of margin-accretive products and services. Price/cost spread was slightly negative after adjusting for non-recurring \u2013 a non-recurring 40 basis point supplier rebate benefit recognized in the quarter. As expected, the favorability captured in 2022 began to unwind in the second quarter and we expect this to continue for the remainder of the year as we turn towards our long-term neutrality target. At the operating margin line, we saw improvement of 230 basis points year-over-year as the GP favorability fell to the bottom and revenue growth more than offset continued demand generation investments in headcount and marketing. Overall, this was another strong quarter for the High-Touch North American segment. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10, we estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 4.5% and 5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 525 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter. Although this is a sequential slowdown from Q1, we comped a very strong prior year quarter and performance remains above our annual target to outgrow the market by 400 to 500 basis points through economic cycles. We are well on our way towards achieving that target again in 2023. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment, sales increased 4.5% or 10.1% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 2.8%, while MonotaRO achieved 12.6% growth in local days, local currency. At a business level, MonotaRO continues to execute well and is driving solid year-over-year revenue growth as they increase registered users and grow the enterprise customers. At Zoro, while slower growth partially reflects a tougher prior year comparison, we are seeing slowing demand across their customer base. Similar to Q1, non-core B2C business remained a headwind in the quarter and was down in the mid-teens year-over-year. Further, we have seen a slowdown in Zoro\u2019s core B2B business, which makes up a majority of Zoro\u2019s revenue. While we are still growing in the high single-digits with these core customers, macro-related factors are impacting demand given Zoro\u2019s end market mix as well as their tilt to smaller sized businesses, which seem to be struggling more in this environment. We expect both of these headwinds to persist for the remainder of the year. Stepping back, Zoro has delivered great results over the last 2 years as we have added SKUs to our assortment, increased registered users and served both core and non-core customers well during the pandemic. As we plan for our next leg of growth, the new local leadership team is focusing their efforts to drive repeat profitable growth with core B2B customers. This should help propel our results through the cycle as we continue to provide a one-stop endless aisle with easy-to-find products and a no-hassle delivery experience for smaller, less complex businesses in the U.S. From a profitability perspective, gross margin for the segment expanded 50 basis points versus the prior year due to continued freight efficiencies and strong price realization at MonotaRO, which offset unfavorable product mix at Zoro. Operating margins declined slightly year-over-year to 8.6% as gross margin favorability was offset by continued investments in marketing and slower-than-expected top line growth at Zoro. On Slide 12, we continue to see positive results with our key Endless Assortment operating metrics. On the left-hand side, in line with prior quarter growth, total registered users grew nicely with Zoro and MonotaRO combined up 16% over the prior year. On the right, we also continue to see growth of the Zoro SKU portfolio, which grew by 200,000 SKUs in the second quarter and stands at over 12.2 million in total. Now looking forward to the rest of the year. Given our strong share gain to date and the continued supportive demand environment, we are raising the midpoint of our full year 2023 outlook by increasing the lower end of our revenue and earnings ranges. Our revised outlook includes daily sales growth of 8.5% to 11% for total company, which is roughly a 75 basis point increase at the midpoint compared to the prior range. High-Touch growth continues to trend slightly higher than expected as we continue to gain share amidst a reasonably steady demand environment. The strength in High-Touch is offsetting lower-than-expected top line performance with Endless Assortment primarily due to the softness at Zoro as previously mentioned. Altogether, at the total company level, we are confident in our ability to drive growth in the second half and achieve our updated estimates. Looking specifically at July, we\u2019ve started the third quarter strong and reported month-to-date sales up over 8%, which is roughly 50 basis points higher on a daily constant currency basis. From a margin perspective, both gross profit margin and operating margin rate expectations remain unchanged from our previous update. From a seasonality perspective, we expect Q3 margin rates to decline sequentially quarter-over-quarter as the one-time supplier rebate we captured this quarter falls off and as price/cost favorability continues to unwind. Couple this with the continued rapid demand generation investments, and we expect total company operating margins to be lower in the back half of the year. However, we\u2019re still on track to finish 2023 with full year operating margins at an all-time high. All in, the resulting revised EPS range has been raised and stands between $35 and $36.75. Supplemental guidance covering cash flow and share repurchase, which have also been raised, can be found in the appendix of the deck. In summary, I look forward to the remainder of 2023 feeling confident in our team\u2019s ability to continue to serve our customers well, achieve profitable growth and drive strong results for our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Dee. I am very proud of the way our team continues to show up and support our customers. Our capabilities and deep understanding of our customers\u2019 operation positions us well in the back half of the year and into the future. When we stay focused on the things that matter, helping our customers find the right products and solutions, providing exceptional service and investing in our supply chain and digital capabilities, we will continue to grow and gain share through any cycle. With that, we will open the line up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please state your question.\nTommy Moll: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nTommy Moll: Dee, I appreciate the insight you gave on Zoro\u2019s top line trends through the quarter on the B2C versus the B2B side. And you highlighted that even on the B2B side, there was some weakening though it was still up, I think you said high singles in the quarter. So my question is, is there anything more you can tell us about that B2B deceleration in terms of end market or customer type or anything else you could provide there would be helpful? Thanks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes, Tommy, I\u2019ll take that. Yes. So if you think about the vertical industry mix that Zoro serves, some of the fastest-growing segments in the Grainger model, the High-Touch model would be government healthcare, some manufacturing like aerospace, Zoro does not participate in those really at all. And then the other trend we\u2019re seeing is Zoro is sort of small businesses a lot more than Grainger does. And those customers appear to be a little softer than the larger customers that we serve. So those two factors have a significant impact. Zoro did increase the repeat rate in the quarter, but they have some work to do to continue to increase the repeat rate. So we\u2019re working hard to do that. But the segment mix is a pretty big impact on Zoro right now.\nTommy Moll: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful, D.G. And then I also wanted to ask about the distribution center you announced for Oregon. I guess it\u2019s a two-part question. One, just anything you can give us in terms of timeline to break ground, cut the ribbon, when most of the CapEx hits. And then second part, just a higher-level question. Should we view this as any shift in a competitive strategy or emphasis in that part of the country or it\u2019s more you just outgrew the existing roof line you had and needed to expand? Thanks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So we break ground in a couple of weeks, and like we said, 2025 is when the building will be fully up. And so that\u2019s the time frame on it. What I would say is that we have been serving the Northwest out of our branches and out of a very small distribution center in Seattle, and we have outgrown that pretty substantially. And we\u2019ve also been serving out of Patterson, California. So putting the building up in the Northwest allows us to have more SKUs in market, better service. It also allows us to lower transportation costs because we have much shorter routes from that building to our customers in Seattle, Portland throughout the Northwest. So it\u2019s basically just a normal course of action where we evaluate our footprint and continue to expand where it makes sense.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.\nRyan Merkel: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. A couple of questions on gross margin. So how should we think about gross margins in the second half? Is it around 39? Is that the right metric? And then does it dip a little bit in 3Q and then increase sequentially a little bit in 4Q?\nDee Merriwether: So thanks for the question. I think if you kind of focus on the guide and then kind of look at what that implies for us, we\u2019re expecting GP to decline slightly mostly due to the High-Touch impact and what we have been stating pretty much all year that we started at the beginning of the year related to the unwind of price/cost. If you recall, last year, we took price as we continue to say price and cost continue to be somewhat lumpy. We can\u2019t time those things exactly right. And so we\u2019re going to see higher costs sequentially as we go through the year and a little slightly lower price. So we expect GP to decline a bit in the second half.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a higher-level question on gross margin. I think the guidance you put out there for \u201825 was High-Touch gross margin about 40%. We\u2019re a good bit above that here in \u201823. Are you planning on updating that outlook anytime soon? Or how should we think about any new thoughts you might have there?\nDee Merriwether: So you\u2019re exactly right. And what I would say is we\u2019ve done really well through this period of cost inflation and our ability to price to the market and price well. As I stated last quarter, things still remain fluid. And while we\u2019re gaining some supply chain efficiencies as we would expect as well as diesel fuel and things like that coming down from some highs, I\u2019m still looking to have a couple more quarters here. And we will definitely take a look at our outlook here in the future and provide an update.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Good morning. Also on the sustainability of gross margin, in High-Touch, you cited freight and supply chain and mix, and then there are various factors on the Endless Assortment as well. Are these factors \u2013 are those \u2013 any of those really prone to reversion? Or should we expect gross margin at least within a band to be reasonably sustainable until we get that shift between High-Touch and Endless Assortment back? It seems like that trend is going counter to what the usual trend would have been, which would be EA to outgrow High-Touch. Can you talk about that a bit?\nDee Merriwether: Yes, I do think that\u2019s the right way to look \u2013 to think about it. So we are getting some tailwinds that we have this year specifically related to supply chain and freight efficiencies, which are somewhat significant. And those can flip on us at any time. But right now, we feel like we\u2019re in line with where diesel fuel is as well as we\u2019ve gotten some benefits from those friction costs that we talked about, D.G. just mentioned this, talking about transportation costs and extra legs of transportation that we had over the prior years. We\u2019re fairly normalized in those areas, getting close to pre-pandemic levels as it relates to that. We did have in the quarter some one-time favorability, about 40 basis points related to that one-time rebate. And we are seeing as we kind of talked about price/cost in the quarter turned slightly negative, which we expect to continue. So, those are some of the puts and takes as it relates, but again, our target 40-ish 2025, we are not changing at this point in time. But I do feel very good about the stability of High-Touch margins in that range.\nD.G. Macpherson: The other thing I would add to that, Dave, is that the transportation cost can fluctuate. The supply chain efficiencies, we are for all intents and purposes at this point back to where we were before the pandemic. Those should stay right. Those won\u2019t reverse. That was all pandemic-driven in terms of all the efficiencies we had in the system. So, that should stay. Should that \u2013 those pieces of it should stay stable.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thank you. And then you mentioned price as a driver for High-Touch, but then you have been saying you are in this negative price/cost position. Dee, you had mentioned that it\u2019s a little tricky to line things up exactly from a timing standpoint. What opportunities do you have to take actions over the next six months, say, to reestablish price/cost neutrality if you plan to do that at all?\nDee Merriwether: Well, again, the U.S. team works really hard to remain price competitive. That\u2019s our other tenet that gets us to price/cost neutrality and are always looking for opportunities to the price and optimize price with our customers over time. So, I would say that\u2019s the biggest opportunity we have related to price in the future is ensuring that we are optimizing and each of our customer segments have the appropriate price for the goods and services that we are providing them. But remaining price/cost competitive is the key tenet here that really buoys our growth \u2013 our volume growth over the cycle.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please state your question.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I also wanted to ask on price/cost. And in the prepared remarks you said that price/cost was negative in the quarter and at least on a year-on-year basis. But then you also said that price/cost favorability will unwind in the back half of the year, if I heard that right. So, they kind of sound conflicting a little bit. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a year-on-year or sequential thing. But could you just maybe help me think through that? Thank you.\nDee Merriwether: Yes. So, price/cost in this quarter when you adjust for the one-time supplier rebate was slightly negative. And as we started the year, we provided an outlook that as the year continues to flow that we would become price/cost negative because we had favorable price last year. And costs did not come in as we had expected because we had the opportunity to continue to work with our supply base on the cost inflation, which is now coming this year. So, that is why price/cost will become more negative as we go into the second half of this year.\nChris Snyder: Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. And then I guess maybe just kind of following up on the gross margin topic. I mean is there any way to think about that level of price/cost unwind into the back half of the year? And then also on the 40 basis points supplier rebate, any just more color on that? Usually that\u2019s something that we think of coming into the fourth quarter. Thank you.\nDee Merriwether: Yes. So, I wouldn\u2019t over-pivot on the one-time adjustment. It was related to the prior period. It\u2019s not something that we would expect to continue. And I would say the other thing I would add, if you look at our price/cost over a longer period, maybe a 2-year period, we do not expect it to be negative. That\u2019s how we end up hitting our target of price/cost neutrality over time. So, I would not read into that some of the impacts that we are going to have in the second half of this year are expected to continue any longer than that period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks for taking the question. I had a question on Endless Assortment. Curious how you considered the thought that perhaps the fundamental kind of algorithm for 16% to 18% growth to \u201825 temporary lull or maybe more practical to reconsider long-term, perhaps high-single digits, low-double digits. I know Zoro is rationalizing some of the customer mix, and MonotaRO has some different strategies around customer demographics that have been a bit in flux as well. So, curious how \u2013 what might be a practical update on that metric.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So, I appreciate the question, Chris. I think similar to sort of gross margin outlook, we want to see probably a few more quarters of performance to understand how this plays out. The MonotaRO business in Japan has continued to perform pretty well and not obvious that they are going to be in a different place they have historically going forward at this point. And we do think that some of the Zoro\u2019s issues are fairly temporary as they unwind some consumer business and some other B2B business that \u2013 changes that are going on. So, not really ready to talk about sort of changing the outlook in the future, but certainly, we will consider that as the year goes on.\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. Great. And then I was just curious on the SG&A spend rate in the second quarter, is that a kind of good benchmark to think about stability in that kind of dollar rate range for the second half?\nDee Merriwether: Yes, I think that\u2019s a good thing to consider.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacob Levinson with Melius Research. Please state your question.\nJacob Levinson: Good morning D.G. and Dee.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nDee Merriwether: Good morning.\nJacob Levinson: If you will humor one more price-related question and then we can move on just high level, trying to get a sense of whether your suppliers are talking about or have already put through midyear price increases or if they are talking about further price increases in the latter half of the year or whether with inflation coming down, we are really just past that cycle, if you will?\nDee Merriwether: We are working with our supplier base and get back to some of our normal inflation cadence that was not so normal during the pandemic. So, as it relates to this year, I think we have a good handle on what we believe our cost inflation will be, and we have embedded that in our guide. And of course, later in the year, we will start working with them on what 2024 looks like.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. And we talked about this at the beginning of the year, Jake. I think that almost all of the inflation we are going to see this year is wrapped from last year. And so we are seeing puts and takes, ups and downs with suppliers. But in general, there is just not a lot of additional inflation coming in from our suppliers.\nJacob Levinson: Okay. That makes sense. Just switching gears to inventories for a second. I know your inventory is lose in dollar terms seem to have stabilized here. I am sure that there is some inflation math in there, but how are you thinking about stocking levels going forward, or maybe said differently, is there a new normal post the sort of supply chain disruptions and COVID issues that we have seen in the last couple of years that\u2019s maybe higher than it was back in 2019 or so?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean \u2013 so what I would say is we generally have two premises when we think about inventory levels. The first one is to stock see service levels. So, based on the velocity of items, we have set targets for the service we want to provide on those items that is competitively advantaged. And we basically stock to that. The other is we look at wasteful inventory, inventory that isn\u2019t productive and make sure to manage that down. I don\u2019t think we are necessarily in a new world. We still have some elongated supplier lead times now. Those have mostly come down. And as those continue to come down, I suspect we can be mostly back to where we were historically from an inventory perspective to revenue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nPatrick Baumann: Hi. Good morning. Just I got one more on price. Sorry about that. The \u2013 is there an update to how you think you are going to finish the year on price at High-Touch? And just curious if you are seeing any changes in like demand you will have to see with respect to \u2013 I think you make changes with your web pricing ahead of like making changes in the CRP. Just curious if you\u2019re seeing any changes to velocity [ph] related to moves you are making there? And then on Zoro within the price discussion, has that been holding up as well as it has in the High-Touch segment?\nDee Merriwether: So, I will start. We have made some pricing changes earlier in the year. We don\u2019t see in the U.S. the need to make any significant pricing adjustments for the balance of the year, but the pricing team is always in the market looking at price and making sure that we are competitively priced. The Zoro business, I would say, from a gross margin perspective operates a little bit differently and are targeting a different customer segment as D.G. alluded to. And they also have their own pricing algorithm and pricing team that is focused on remaining competitive with the customers that they are serving and have taken actions to price their products in line with the inflation that that\u2019s been passed on to them.\nPatrick Baumann: And then the price for the year there at High-Touch, prices at High-Touch for the year, do you have an update on that? That was part of the question.\nDee Merriwether: Alright. I understand. So, it still remains around 4% to 5%. That hasn\u2019t changed.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay. And my follow-up is on inventory again. I guess I am just curious what drove the better-than-expected cash guide, the upgrade to the guidance? Was it you are planning to hold a little bit less inventory than you previously planned, or is there something else?\nDee Merriwether: No. Really, the operating cash outlook is really due to the top line improvement at High-Touch that\u2019s really flowed through. And as a result of that, we took the opportunity to update the operating cash flow guide about $75 million at the midpoint.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question. And Dray, your line is open. Please un-mute yourself.\nD.G. Macpherson: We think it\u2019s probably Deane Dray since we know\u2026\nOperator: Sorry Deane Dray. Your line is open, please go ahead, RBC Capital Markets. Here we will move on. And that\u2019s the final question for today. So, I will now turn the floor over to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks. Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: Alright. Thanks for joining the call today. What I would say is the year is playing out pretty much as we expected. We talked a lot about price/cost. It\u2019s actually played out almost exactly like we expected at the beginning of the year. So, there are really no surprises generally in the market at this point. We continue to feel good about our performance, our share gain, our profitability and feel like we are well positioned to have a really strong second half relative to the market. And so we are going to continue to work on that. And I just appreciate you being on the call, and we look forward to seeing you and talking to you down the line. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you all for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dee Merriwether",
            "content": "Thanks, D.G. Starting with Slide 8 you can see the high-level results for the total company, including strong daily sales growth of 10.1% on a daily constant currency basis. Although year-over-year growth rates decelerated compared to Q1 as inflation cools and as we lap a tougher prior year comparison, daily sales dollars remained strong and we are on track to deliver a great year. Total company operating margin was up 190 basis points as expanded gross margins in both segments were further aided by SG&A leverage in the High-Touch Solutions North American segment. In total, we delivered diluted EPS in the quarter of $9.28, which was up 29% versus the second quarter of 2022. Diving into segment level details, for the second quarter, we continued to see strong results within our High-Touch segment, with daily sales up 9.9%, fueled by revenue growth in all geographies. Although year-over-year growth rates have slowed as we lap prior year price inflation, volume growth remains healthy and was generally in line with our expectations for the quarter. In the U.S., we continue to see positive growth in nearly all customer end segments. However, this does include pockets of softness, including decelerating growth in manufacturing and commercial services. However, given our diversified customer base, this is countered by strong growth in other areas such as government and healthcare. In Canada, the economy remains stable and we are seeing strong results with Canadian daily sales up about 7% in local days and local currency. For this segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 41.7%, up 200 basis points versus the prior year. Product availability levels remained high, resulting in fewer packages and shorter distance shipments in the current year as service returned to near pre-pandemic levels. This one coupled with lower fuel and container rates is driving significant fuel and supply chain tailwinds in the quarter. Product mix was also favorable primarily due to improved product availability and a higher mix of margin-accretive products and services. Price/cost spread was slightly negative after adjusting for non-recurring \u2013 a non-recurring 40 basis point supplier rebate benefit recognized in the quarter. As expected, the favorability captured in 2022 began to unwind in the second quarter and we expect this to continue for the remainder of the year as we turn towards our long-term neutrality target. At the operating margin line, we saw improvement of 230 basis points year-over-year as the GP favorability fell to the bottom and revenue growth more than offset continued demand generation investments in headcount and marketing. Overall, this was another strong quarter for the High-Touch North American segment. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 10, we estimate the U.S. MRO market grew between 4.5% and 5%, indicating that we achieved roughly 525 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter. Although this is a sequential slowdown from Q1, we comped a very strong prior year quarter and performance remains above our annual target to outgrow the market by 400 to 500 basis points through economic cycles. We are well on our way towards achieving that target again in 2023. Moving to our Endless Assortment segment, sales increased 4.5% or 10.1% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 2.8%, while MonotaRO achieved 12.6% growth in local days, local currency. At a business level, MonotaRO continues to execute well and is driving solid year-over-year revenue growth as they increase registered users and grow the enterprise customers. At Zoro, while slower growth partially reflects a tougher prior year comparison, we are seeing slowing demand across their customer base. Similar to Q1, non-core B2C business remained a headwind in the quarter and was down in the mid-teens year-over-year. Further, we have seen a slowdown in Zoro's core B2B business, which makes up a majority of Zoro's revenue. While we are still growing in the high single-digits with these core customers, macro-related factors are impacting demand given Zoro's end market mix as well as their tilt to smaller sized businesses, which seem to be struggling more in this environment. We expect both of these headwinds to persist for the remainder of the year. Stepping back, Zoro has delivered great results over the last 2 years as we have added SKUs to our assortment, increased registered users and served both core and non-core customers well during the pandemic. As we plan for our next leg of growth, the new local leadership team is focusing their efforts to drive repeat profitable growth with core B2B customers. This should help propel our results through the cycle as we continue to provide a one-stop endless aisle with easy-to-find products and a no-hassle delivery experience for smaller, less complex businesses in the U.S. From a profitability perspective, gross margin for the segment expanded 50 basis points versus the prior year due to continued freight efficiencies and strong price realization at MonotaRO, which offset unfavorable product mix at Zoro. Operating margins declined slightly year-over-year to 8.6% as gross margin favorability was offset by continued investments in marketing and slower-than-expected top line growth at Zoro. On Slide 12, we continue to see positive results with our key Endless Assortment operating metrics. On the left-hand side, in line with prior quarter growth, total registered users grew nicely with Zoro and MonotaRO combined up 16% over the prior year. On the right, we also continue to see growth of the Zoro SKU portfolio, which grew by 200,000 SKUs in the second quarter and stands at over 12.2 million in total. Now looking forward to the rest of the year. Given our strong share gain to date and the continued supportive demand environment, we are raising the midpoint of our full year 2023 outlook by increasing the lower end of our revenue and earnings ranges. Our revised outlook includes daily sales growth of 8.5% to 11% for total company, which is roughly a 75 basis point increase at the midpoint compared to the prior range. High-Touch growth continues to trend slightly higher than expected as we continue to gain share amidst a reasonably steady demand environment. The strength in High-Touch is offsetting lower-than-expected top line performance with Endless Assortment primarily due to the softness at Zoro as previously mentioned. Altogether, at the total company level, we are confident in our ability to drive growth in the second half and achieve our updated estimates. Looking specifically at July, we've started the third quarter strong and reported month-to-date sales up over 8%, which is roughly 50 basis points higher on a daily constant currency basis. From a margin perspective, both gross profit margin and operating margin rate expectations remain unchanged from our previous update. From a seasonality perspective, we expect Q3 margin rates to decline sequentially quarter-over-quarter as the one-time supplier rebate we captured this quarter falls off and as price/cost favorability continues to unwind. Couple this with the continued rapid demand generation investments, and we expect total company operating margins to be lower in the back half of the year. However, we're still on track to finish 2023 with full year operating margins at an all-time high. All in, the resulting revised EPS range has been raised and stands between $35 and $36.75. Supplemental guidance covering cash flow and share repurchase, which have also been raised, can be found in the appendix of the deck. In summary, I look forward to the remainder of 2023 feeling confident in our team's ability to continue to serve our customers well, achieve profitable growth and drive strong results for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. for some closing remarks. So thanks for the question. I think if you kind of focus on the guide and then kind of look at what that implies for us, we're expecting GP to decline slightly mostly due to the High-Touch impact and what we have been stating pretty much all year that we started at the beginning of the year related to the unwind of price/cost. If you recall, last year, we took price as we continue to say price and cost continue to be somewhat lumpy. We can't time those things exactly right. And so we're going to see higher costs sequentially as we go through the year and a little slightly lower price. So we expect GP to decline a bit in the second half. So you're exactly right. And what I would say is we've done really well through this period of cost inflation and our ability to price to the market and price well. As I stated last quarter, things still remain fluid. And while we're gaining some supply chain efficiencies as we would expect as well as diesel fuel and things like that coming down from some highs, I'm still looking to have a couple more quarters here. And we will definitely take a look at our outlook here in the future and provide an update. Yes, I do think that's the right way to look \u2013 to think about it. So we are getting some tailwinds that we have this year specifically related to supply chain and freight efficiencies, which are somewhat significant. And those can flip on us at any time. But right now, we feel like we're in line with where diesel fuel is as well as we've gotten some benefits from those friction costs that we talked about, D.G. just mentioned this, talking about transportation costs and extra legs of transportation that we had over the prior years. We're fairly normalized in those areas, getting close to pre-pandemic levels as it relates to that. We did have in the quarter some one-time favorability, about 40 basis points related to that one-time rebate. And we are seeing as we kind of talked about price/cost in the quarter turned slightly negative, which we expect to continue. So, those are some of the puts and takes as it relates, but again, our target 40-ish 2025, we are not changing at this point in time. But I do feel very good about the stability of High-Touch margins in that range. Well, again, the U.S. team works really hard to remain price competitive. That's our other tenet that gets us to price/cost neutrality and are always looking for opportunities to the price and optimize price with our customers over time. So, I would say that's the biggest opportunity we have related to price in the future is ensuring that we are optimizing and each of our customer segments have the appropriate price for the goods and services that we are providing them. But remaining price/cost competitive is the key tenet here that really buoys our growth \u2013 our volume growth over the cycle. Yes. So, price/cost in this quarter when you adjust for the one-time supplier rebate was slightly negative. And as we started the year, we provided an outlook that as the year continues to flow that we would become price/cost negative because we had favorable price last year. And costs did not come in as we had expected because we had the opportunity to continue to work with our supply base on the cost inflation, which is now coming this year. So, that is why price/cost will become more negative as we go into the second half of this year. Yes. So, I wouldn't over-pivot on the one-time adjustment. It was related to the prior period. It's not something that we would expect to continue. And I would say the other thing I would add, if you look at our price/cost over a longer period, maybe a 2-year period, we do not expect it to be negative. That's how we end up hitting our target of price/cost neutrality over time. So, I would not read into that some of the impacts that we are going to have in the second half of this year are expected to continue any longer than that period. Yes, I think that's a good thing to consider. Good morning. We are working with our supplier base and get back to some of our normal inflation cadence that was not so normal during the pandemic. So, as it relates to this year, I think we have a good handle on what we believe our cost inflation will be, and we have embedded that in our guide. And of course, later in the year, we will start working with them on what 2024 looks like. So, I will start. We have made some pricing changes earlier in the year. We don't see in the U.S. the need to make any significant pricing adjustments for the balance of the year, but the pricing team is always in the market looking at price and making sure that we are competitively priced. The Zoro business, I would say, from a gross margin perspective operates a little bit differently and are targeting a different customer segment as D.G. alluded to. And they also have their own pricing algorithm and pricing team that is focused on remaining competitive with the customers that they are serving and have taken actions to price their products in line with the inflation that that's been passed on to them. Alright. I understand. So, it still remains around 4% to 5%. That hasn't changed. No. Really, the operating cash outlook is really due to the top line improvement at High-Touch that's really flowed through. And as a result of that, we took the opportunity to update the operating cash flow guide about $75 million at the midpoint."

            "content": "Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our second quarter performance and then pass it to Dee to walk through the financials in detail. As we work our way through 2023, Grainger continues to stay focused on what matters most: providing our customers with the products and services they need through exceptional service. Everything we do is grounded in our Grainger Edge framework, which I'd like to highlight today in the context of our recently released ESG report. I would encourage you all to check out the full report at graingeresg.com. Grainger has long been a leader in ESG, both for our customers and in our own operations. Internally, we have laid out four near-term ESG focus areas that are important parts of both our culture and operations. Early indications show that we are making meaningful progress. I will start with our customer sustainability solutions. In 2022, revenue in High-Touch U.S. business for our environmentally preferred products was more than $1 billion and has increased steadily over the last few years. Customer conversations around their environmental footprint have become commonplace and we are well positioned to help customers in this space. On the right side, you will see how we are helping our customers achieve their goals by tying sustainability to our product and service offerings. We recently worked with a large container terminal operator that was in search of an opportunity to offset fossil fuel-based energy use, enhance its group resilience and reduce cost. Through our sustainability services offering, the customer purchased and will install more than 300 solar panels. These panels will help them avoid approximately 4,000 tons of CO2 emissions over the next 20 years, the equivalent of 9 million miles driven by a car. This is just one example, but we partner with our customers like this everyday, connecting them to our network of service provider partners and helping ensure we can be the go-to partner for everything they need to run safe, reliable and sustainable operations. Second, supplier diversity. Grainger plays an important role in champion businesses owned by underrepresented groups, including women, minorities, LGBTQ+ and people with disabilities through this program. Last year, we spent more than $2 billion on products from our diverse supplier base and continue to make further progress as we expand partnerships in this space. Third, energy and emissions. Since 2018, we have reduced our global absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 26%, nearing our 2030 goal of a 30% reduction. And finally, diversity, equity and inclusion. DEI is a continuous journey. We are proud to have been named one of Fortune's Best Places to Work for Women in addition to being recognized by other organizations for our work to celebrate and support all team members no matter their ethnicity, orientation, age, disability or veteran status. Each of these near-term priorities are an important part of our ESG focus and are helping us to scale our actions to make a greater impact for both Grainger and our customers. Our team will continue to follow the Grainger Edge as we make progress toward our own near-term initiatives and partner with our customers as they work to achieve their ESG goals, together positively impacting the communities where we operate. Now to review highlights for the quarter. As you can see, we again delivered a strong quarter of performance as we continue to show up well in supporting our customers. As expected, year-over-year growth rates are decelerating, but demand remains reasonably steady. For the quarter, we finished with daily sales growth of 9% or 10.1% on a daily constant currency basis. Results again were driven by positive performance in both segments, most notably within the High-Touch Solutions segment, which outpaced the broader MRO market by approximately 525 basis points in the U.S. Total company operating margin was 15.8%, an increase of 190 basis points over the prior year as improved gross margin performance was driven primarily by continued supply chain efficiencies and lower freight and container costs. Combine this with our strong top line growth and we delivered substantial EPS growth, robust operating cash flow and continued ROIC of over 40%. We also returned a combined $265 million to Grainger shareholders in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases. Alongside these great results, we continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives. In the High-Touch model, we are advancing our proprietary product and customer information management systems that fuel our growth engines and allow us to advance marketing, merchandising and seller investments in the U.S. The Endless Assortment business is seeing some macro-related demand softening in the U.S. But overall, the team continues to focus on providing reliable service while increasing repeat purchase rates with core B2B customers at Zoro and growing with enterprise customers at MonotaRO. Lastly, a few weeks ago, we announced our plans to construct a new 500,000 square foot distribution center outside of Portland, Oregon, which will support our customers across the Pacific Northwest and is expected to open in 2025. In addition, we are implementing three smaller bulk-style distribution centers in Pennsylvania, Texas and North Carolina, which are each slated to open over the next few quarters. These investments enable us to keep up with strong customer demand and allow us to extend our industry leading service capabilities, which deliver a best-in-class experience focused on next-day complete fulfillment across the United States. As we remain focused on what matters, I am pleased with the progress we have made through the first half of 2023. With our strong execution and as market demand remains reasonably steady, we are raising the midpoint of our full year 2023 revenue and EPS guidance. I will now pass it over to Dee to go through the details. Thank you, Dee. I am very proud of the way our team continues to show up and support our customers. Our capabilities and deep understanding of our customers' operation positions us well in the back half of the year and into the future. When we stay focused on the things that matter, helping our customers find the right products and solutions, providing exceptional service and investing in our supply chain and digital capabilities, we will continue to grow and gain share through any cycle. With that, we will open the line up for questions. Good morning. Yes, Tommy, I'll take that. Yes. So if you think about the vertical industry mix that Zoro serves, some of the fastest-growing segments in the Grainger model, the High-Touch model would be government healthcare, some manufacturing like aerospace, Zoro does not participate in those really at all. And then the other trend we're seeing is Zoro is sort of small businesses a lot more than Grainger does. And those customers appear to be a little softer than the larger customers that we serve. So those two factors have a significant impact. Zoro did increase the repeat rate in the quarter, but they have some work to do to continue to increase the repeat rate. So we're working hard to do that. But the segment mix is a pretty big impact on Zoro right now. Yes. So we break ground in a couple of weeks, and like we said, 2025 is when the building will be fully up. And so that's the time frame on it. What I would say is that we have been serving the Northwest out of our branches and out of a very small distribution center in Seattle, and we have outgrown that pretty substantially. And we've also been serving out of Patterson, California. So putting the building up in the Northwest allows us to have more SKUs in market, better service. It also allows us to lower transportation costs because we have much shorter routes from that building to our customers in Seattle, Portland throughout the Northwest. So it's basically just a normal course of action where we evaluate our footprint and continue to expand where it makes sense. The other thing I would add to that, Dave, is that the transportation cost can fluctuate. The supply chain efficiencies, we are for all intents and purposes at this point back to where we were before the pandemic. Those should stay right. Those won't reverse. That was all pandemic-driven in terms of all the efficiencies we had in the system. So, that should stay. Should that \u2013 those pieces of it should stay stable. Yes. So, I appreciate the question, Chris. I think similar to sort of gross margin outlook, we want to see probably a few more quarters of performance to understand how this plays out. The MonotaRO business in Japan has continued to perform pretty well and not obvious that they are going to be in a different place they have historically going forward at this point. And we do think that some of the Zoro's issues are fairly temporary as they unwind some consumer business and some other B2B business that \u2013 changes that are going on. So, not really ready to talk about sort of changing the outlook in the future, but certainly, we will consider that as the year goes on. Good morning. Yes. And we talked about this at the beginning of the year, Jake. I think that almost all of the inflation we are going to see this year is wrapped from last year. And so we are seeing puts and takes, ups and downs with suppliers. But in general, there is just not a lot of additional inflation coming in from our suppliers. Yes. I mean \u2013 so what I would say is we generally have two premises when we think about inventory levels. The first one is to stock see service levels. So, based on the velocity of items, we have set targets for the service we want to provide on those items that is competitively advantaged. And we basically stock to that. The other is we look at wasteful inventory, inventory that isn't productive and make sure to manage that down. I don't think we are necessarily in a new world. We still have some elongated supplier lead times now. Those have mostly come down. And as those continue to come down, I suspect we can be mostly back to where we were historically from an inventory perspective to revenue. We think it's probably Deane Dray since we know... Alright. Thanks for joining the call today. What I would say is the year is playing out pretty much as we expected. We talked a lot about price/cost. It's actually played out almost exactly like we expected at the beginning of the year. So, there are really no surprises generally in the market at this point. We continue to feel good about our performance, our share gain, our profitability and feel like we are well positioned to have a really strong second half relative to the market. And so we are going to continue to work on that. And I just appreciate you being on the call, and we look forward to seeing you and talking to you down the line. Thanks so much."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the W.W. Grainger First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Kyle Bland, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Kyle.\nKyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our Q1 earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. This morning's call will focus on our first quarter 2023 results, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis for all periods presented. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and filed Japanese gap which differs from US GAAP and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ somewhat from MonotaRO's public statements. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our first quarter performance and then pass it to Deidra to walk through the financials in detail. Grainger started 2023 focused on what matters most. Providing our customers with the products and services they need through exceptional service. We remain closely embedded with our customers, finding ways to help them manage their inventory, reduce costs, achieve their ESG objectives and successfully run their operations. Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit with several customers in the manufacturing space in one of my favorite Midwest cities. I heard very clearly how well our teams have served them in the last few years, giving us great opportunity to grow with these customers in the future. We win when we serve our customers exceptionally well and my interactions with our teams and customers this quarter have been a great example of how we are winning each day. Many customers, especially those in the industrial space, continue to see solid end market demand for their products. However, we do see some customers with more consumer-facing exposure heading into a softer demand cycle. No matter what economic uncertainties our customers are facing, we remain committed to our overall focus of helping our customers keep their operations running and their people safe. This consistent approach and relentless focus on the customer rallies our team and fuels our results. As you can see, we again delivered a strong quarter of performance to start the year as demand remains resilient and as we continue to execute well. We are making progress on our strategic growth engines in our high-touch model as we further our merchandising efforts, continue to make smart marketing investments, expand our inventory management capabilities for customers and build out tools to better equip our sellers. The Enlist assortment business continues to execute their strategy as they add SKUs at Zoro, expand with enterprise customers at MonotaRO and at a healthy clip of new registered users each quarter. Our momentum is further supported by our world-class supply chain and distribution network, which benefited from an uptick in product availability as supplier lead times improved. This resulted in a sharp improvement in our service metrics to near pre-pandemic levels, faster than we had anticipated at the start of the year. With this swift improvement, we were able to meaningfully decrease frictional costs within the network by reducing average shipping distance and minimizing handling costs. All while delivering a higher percentage of orders complete and next day. This improvement is a reminder of just how much unusual and extraordinary activity we did to get products to customers through the pandemic and subsequent availability challenges. The return to more normal supply chain performance is great news for our customers and our supply chain team. The progress made across all these fronts helped drive great financial results for the first quarter, where we finished with sales growth of 12.2% and or 14.5% on a daily constant currency basis. Results again were driven by solid performance in both segments, most notably within the High Touch Solutions segment, which outpaced the broader MRO market by approximately 750 basis points in the US. Total company operating margins were 16.6%, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year period on improved gross margin performance due primarily to the supply chain efficiencies just discussed. Combined with our strong top line growth, we delivered EPS of $9.61 per share and a strong ROIC of 45.6%. During the quarter, we produced record operating cash flow of $454 million with free cash flow of $356 million, and we returned a combined $229 million to Grainger shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And yesterday, we were pleased to announce a $1.86 quarterly dividend, which represents an 8% increase. This marks our 52nd year of consecutive dividend increases, a track record that we are proud of. Finally, based on the strong start to the year and continued support of trends at April, we are raising our full year 2023 guidance, which Steve will outline in just a bit. With that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on the quarter.\nDee Merriwether: Thanks, DG. I'd like to echo DG's sentiment \u2013 execution on our growth strategy and improved service from a return to more normal supply chain performance helped drive excellent results in the quarter. Starting on slide 7, you can see the high-level results, including strong sales growth of 14. 5% in daily constant currency, driven by double-digit growth locally in both segments. Although year-over-year growth rates decelerated as we moved through the quarter on tougher comps, daily sales dollars remained strong and were reasonably in line with historical sequential growth trend. Total company operating margin was up 200 basis points as expanded gross margins in both segments dropped to the bottom line. SG&A margin was flat year-over-year as investments in headcount, marketing and technology were offset by revenue growth. In total, we delivered diluted EPS in the quarter of $9.61 up 36% versus the first quarter of 2022. Diving into segment level details. For the first quarter, we continued to see strong results within our Hi-tech segment with daily sales of 14.5%, fueled by revenue growth in all geographies. Customer demand was generally in line with expectations for the quarter and continues to remain resilient as a whole despite certain areas of softness. In the US, we are seeing broad-based strength across most of the manufacturing with contractors and government customers to name a few. Retail and warehousing are slowing the most, but still up high single digits. In Canada, the economy remains stable, and we are seeing good results across most end markets with Canadian daily sales up 11% and local days and local currency. For this segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 42.4%, up 195 basis points versus the prior year. This expansion was largely driven by freight and supply chain efficiencies as well as product mix favorability. As DG mentioned, improved product availability and short of supplier lead times drove improved stocking positions in our DCs. This availability improvement resulted in more efficient shipping routes, which helped reduce freight expense and lower our handling costs. Freight expense was further aided by a onetime adjustment, which drove 20 basis points of improvement in the period. Product mix was also a tailwind and partially due to improved product availability and partially from lapping the pandemic fuel spike in safety sales from last year's Omicron variant. For the quarter, price cost per ad was neutral and trended largely as anticipated as price/cost favorability we captured in 2022 began to unwind and offset the structural timing benefit we typically see as we passed price early in the first quarter each year. At the operating margin line, we saw improvement of 215 basis points year-over-year. The strong gross margin in the quarter was fully aided by 20 basis points of SG&A leverage as marketing and headcount investments were more than offset by revenue growth. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the High-Tech Solutions North American segment. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, we estimate that the US MRO market grew between 7% and 8%, indicating that we achieved roughly 750 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter. As we continue to build strong partnerships and make progress with our growth engines, our customers continue to turn to Grainger to help them solve their MRO challenges. Coupled this with our supply chain service advantage, we continue to have a high degree of confidence in delivering against our goal to consistently outgrow the US MRO market by 400 to 500 basis points in any economic cycle. Moving to the endless assortment segment. Sales increased 3.8% or 14% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese hand. So US was up 13.5%, while MonotaRO achieved 12% growth in local stains and local currency. While Zoro generated solid growth, they are off to a slower start than anticipated predominantly due to noncore B2C business, which was down in the mid-teens year-over-year. For small B2B customers who make up a majority of the world's business were up nicely in the first quarter but are softening a bit in April give Zoro more diversified end market customer mix outside of the industrial economy. At MonotaRO, sales were impacted by adverse weather as well as slower return to work patterns with the New Year holiday following midweek. Sales have ramped back over the last several weeks, and we expect results to be more in line with our expectations for the balance of the year. From a profitability perspective, gross margin for this segment expanded 140 basis points versus the prior year due to strong price realization and continued freight efficiencies across both businesses as well as favorable business unit mix for the segment. Operating margins expanded by 15 basis points year-over-year to 8.1% and primarily due to gross margin favorability offsetting investments in marketing and headcount to drive customer acquisition and assortment expansion. On slide 11, we continue to see positive results with our key endless assortment operating metrics. Total registered users are tracking nicely with Zoro and MonotaRO combined up 16% over the prior year. On the right, we show the continued growth of Zoro SKU portfolio, which grew by 900,000 SKUs in Q1 and stands at around $12 million in total. We are well on our way to achieving an annual goal of 2 million SKU additions in 2023. Now looking forward to the rest of the year, given the unexpected sharp improvement in profitability and continued resilient demand environment, we are updating our total company guidance for 2023. In our revised outlook, we are holding top line expectations with daily sales expected to be up 7% to 11% for the total company. This reflects solid Q1 performance in high touch offsetting a slightly slower start across inlets assortment with expected softness to continue for the balance of the year at Zoro. High Touch is trending slightly higher than originally expected on a similar 1% to 5% total US MRO market outlook, which continued strong share gains. And this assortment is trending slightly lower, however, we expect daily sales for this segment to be up low double digits, which is a couple of hundred basis points higher when translated to constant currency. Note that April sales growth for the total company is holding firm with month-to-date sales up 10% year-over-year or nearly 11% in daily constant currency. The larger changes to our guide come on the profitability side. More improved product availability and the resulting step change in service levels is driving better freight dynamics, lower handling costs and improved product mix. With this, we are raising our gross margin range to 39.1% in to 39.4%, up 70 to 100 basis points year-over-year. While we still expect to be price/cost negative over the next few quarters as we unwind prior year favorability. The supply chain improvement is flowing through our P&L much faster than anticipated and is fueling the predominance of our revised outlook. The increase in gross margin largely falls through the op margin improvement and resulting EPS, which we now expect to be between $34.25 and $36.75 and nearly 20% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. We have updated our supplemental guidance, which can be found in the appendix and includes revised segment margins and improved operating cash flow outlook and increased expectations for share repurchases for the year. Our execution has put us on a great path. We are serving customers well -- we're remaining focused on the things that matter and are positioned to continue to take share. I exit the quarter very confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our commitment to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to DG for some closing remarks.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thank you, Deid. Before I open it up for questions, I would make just a few comments. Granger was recently named to the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work -- for list for the second year in a row. As you know, this is an exclusive recognition, one that honors companies with the best cultures, workplaces and people. Along with this list, we have also been named to the best places to work for women and the world's most admired companies, among others. We view this recognition as an output of the work we do to create a welcoming culture and a highly motivated team. I remain confident in Grainger's ability to create tangible value, deliver flawless experience and drive profitable growth over the long haul. And with that, we'll open the floor for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We are now conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Chris Snyder from UBS.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask on outgrowth in the high-touch North America business. It just continues to hold firm between 700 and 800 basis points despite improving product availability, I would imagine, among some of your smaller competitors. Can you just maybe talk about why you think that isn't compressing despite pretty broad indications that supply chains are recovering?\nD.G. Macpherson: Sure. Thanks, Chris. Yes. We are certainly seeing supply chains improve. I do think that a lot of the work we've done through the pandemic in the last three years has helped build some stickiness with our customers. I was -- every customer I go into, we've expanded our KeepStock operation if there of any size. We're filling bins, we're doing more and supporting customers to make sure that they have the right inventory in the right place. And I think that's been a big part of it. We continue to see really good results from merchandising, from marketing, from KeepStock and from our supply chain performance. All those things continue to be an advantage for us and helping us gain share.\nChris Snyder: Thanks. I appreciate that. And then on price cost, I think you mentioned that the guidance assumes price cost negative in the next few quarters on some of the give-back after running a bit ahead. Can you just maybe talk about the level of producer price increases that were kind of pushed through on you guys in February. And then just in general, any response from customers or any pushback on pricing? Thank you.\nDee Merriwether: So yeah, Chris. How you doing? I would talk about the -- the last part of your question, I believe, first, which was you asked about producer price push. That has, of course, become less and less over a period of time. So it's basically modest as what we have seen of late. However, as you know, in the first quarter is when we implemented some of those costs are pulled them through to our system. And so for Q1, it's traditionally a high watermark for us for price cost. And as you noted, we expect to unwind some of our price cost positivity from 2022 as a result through the next couple of quarters.\nD.G. Macpherson: And in terms of customer response, what I would say, Chris, is that all of our -- effectively all of our share gain in the last three years has been on volume and not price. So we are priced competitively. And so we are not seeing unusual reactions from customers because we've maintained that competitiveness in our prices.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tommy Moll from Stephens. Your line is now live.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nTommy Moll: I wanted to stick on the theme of price cost to start here. You articulated several of the drivers for the gross margin performance, high-touch specifically is what I'm talking about here in the first quarter and have clarified the price/cost dynamic as we go through the year. Is it still safe to assume though that for the full year, you could land above that 40% long-term target even if we trend toward it as the year progresses?\nDee Merriwether: So thanks for the question. Obviously, we've had a really strong start to the year. And as I noted, we really feel like from a GP specifically in high touch, we're at a high watermark based upon the unwind that we're going to experience with price costs. A lot of the favorability that we experienced this quarter relates to our availability improving and some of the friction costs coming out faster and probably a little bit more pronounced then we would expect that is driving our results up. We did have a, I would say, a non-comparable freight impact of about 20 bps as you look at the outlook for the rest of the year. But other than that, we feel pretty confident in staying at this level based upon what we see right now.\nTommy Moll: Thank you. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about some of the weakness you identified for Zoro. It sounds like there were some non-core areas where you saw weakness but potentially also just as you rolled everything up to the full year outlook, there may have been other unfavorable factors there, at least versus your original outlook, but anything you could do to unpack what you're seeing there would be helpful. Thank you.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah. So roughly 80% of Zoro's business is business to business customers that are small businesses and midsized businesses those, while they continue to perform pretty well in the first quarter. We are seeing sort of across everything smaller businesses and consumer-facing businesses slow down relative to certainly large and industrial-type businesses. So there's a mix here thing that's going on. And then the 20% that is not business to business, some of that came through the pandemic, as you might imagine. That has been down fairly substantially in the first quarter. So that's been a drag. Net-net, we still expect the endless assortment to be low double-digit growth, and we expect the segment to perform well during the year, but we do expect our -- to be below what we expected at the begin of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Your line is now live.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, everyone. Nice quarter.\nD.G. Macpherson: Thanks, Ryan.\nRyan Merkel: I wanted to start on the freight and supply chain dynamic. Can you just talk about maybe take us from November, December to today? And just talk about how you got surprised by supply chain sort of normalizing? And what sort of happened? Did everyone start to have the lead times improve it at one time in the quarter?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah. I think there's several things that happen, Ryan. I mean if you went back to the fourth quarter of last year, we were really solid in terms of our own distributions at our performance and our own and outbound freight at that point. Inbound freight was getting better and supply lead times are starting to get better, but still fairly elongated. We've seen both supplier lead times domestically and cushion freight come in faster than we expected and recover faster than we expected. So therefore, we have received a whole bunch of products into the system. And I mean it's probably obvious when you think about it. But if you went back a year ago, there were a lot of back-ordered items. And so if a trailer, let's say, came into our Greenville D.C. at once of compressors or something. Everywhere in the network we point to that when it was received and we ship it all over the country to get product to customers. Now we have that same product coming into every DC and so we're shipping shorter distances and that's a big benefit in terms of for us at this point. And the other benefit is we're not having to work over time in our distribution centers where we were a year ago, and that part of that goes into gross margin, too, because that's part of handling costs. So that -- those are the benefits we're seeing. And a lot of it -- supplier lead times are still slightly extended from before the pandemic, but they are getting much, much closer, and there are fewer outliers than we expected at this time.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. That's clear. And then, DG, I wanted to ask your opinion on AI. How do you think that might help Grainger? And what could the impact be to the industry?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah. I mean I won't go into too much detail. Obviously, AI has been a rating topic. If you think about artificial intelligence, or intelligence, there's machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence is their deep learning a lot of what's been talked about lately is deep learning generative AI, which you can write up your favorite song. We have been using machine learning for a long time and things like helping us get search right and effectively, I think the challenge here is to figure out where you can drive improvements through AI from customer interactions from operations for back office, and we have efforts going in all of those areas and it's like any other technology to point it to the right problem. And I think that's probably going to be the most important thing for us to think about as we learn more.\nOperator: Your next question is coming from Jacob Levinson from Melius Research. Your line is now live.\nJacob Levinson: Good morning, everyone.\nD.G. Macpherson: Good morning.\nDee Merriwether: Good morning.\nJacob Levinson: DG, maybe you can just give us a sense of how things are going north of the border in Canada. And I know that, that business has been on a long journey to get back on track. But maybe if you put in innings, what inning are all the in that way.\nD.G. Macpherson: There's a lot of good signs, I would say, in Canada right now, I think we're seeing nice growth in the business, and we continue to see profitability improvements, we're probably in the fifth or sixth inning, I think, of getting to where we want to go. We are exactly on the path we expected to be on in terms of growth and profitability at this point. So the team there has done a really nice job of improving that business and working with the entire North American team to make sure that we are supporting the business and driving profitable growth. We feel pretty good about it.\nJacob Levinson: Okay. Great. And just shifting gears on the balance sheet for a second. Look, we've put positive commentary from quite a few other companies about M&A valuations coming in and maybe being one of the better markets for buyers in a long time. You've obviously got a maybe even an underlevered balance sheet and recall you talking about M&A for the first time, quite a while back at the Investor Day in the fall. I mean, is that -- is M&A is something that you see factoring in over the next months or so.\nDee Merriwether: So good question. I would say, with strong cash generation and M&A is always something that can be on the table. We have a small group here that looks for opportunities mostly in the capability space for us potentially, but nothing on the horizon as of yet. If you know our history, our view is not looking for a roll-up of smaller distributors that don't have a go-to-market focus that matches ours, which is selling on value and service to customers. So those are a little harder to find, I would say, but we do have a team stand that stood up to look at opportunities, but we don't see anything significant in the horizon.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from David Manthey from Baird. Your line is now live.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you, good morning, everyone. In the past, Grainger's estimated market growth by triangulating things like GDP, industrial production, real business investment and nonfarm payrolls. And looking at those factors today, pretty much all of them low single digits and moderating and ISM is continuing to signal sort of further moderation. Could you remind us, as you look at 2023, how you're thinking about real MRO volume trends for the industry? I know you talked about pricing and share gain. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about the underlying market?\nDee Merriwether: Sure. Just to roll up what you said a little bit, we really focus on PPI and IP to -- as a predictor or outlook of the MRO market. And our estimates about where it stood as we put together our guide, which is showing volume down 3% to flat in the US and price between 4% and 5%. So that's where we were at the end of the year as we look at the latest updates of IP and PPI there about there. And so underlying a lot of our assumptions is the MRO market growth, including price and volume of about 1% to 5%.\nDavid Manthey: Great. So no change. Thank you for that. Second, a soft side question here. Congratulations on the great places to work after accolades D.G, you've been with or working with Grainger for, I don't know, 20 years. And it seems there's been something of a cultural shift since you've been CEO. Could you assess the culture at Grainger today and how that's translating to the results you're seeing lately?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yeah. I mean it's a really interesting question. We -- Grainger has always had a wonderful culture, one where people really wanted to do the right thing for customers and very highly ethical company. About six years ago, we went through a process to say what needed to change. And we outlined a set of principles that we talk about at every meeting at every, every day basically and say are we in, in those principles. I think the things that have probably moved the most have been making sure we're starting with the customer, making sure we're competing with urgency and making sure we're acting with intent, meaning working on the things that really matter. I think our culture historically might have not always been as focused on a few things that matter and stay on them as long as needed to make them really great. And I think that's been a big focus for us as a leadership team. And I think that's probably a shift. I mean the shift is slow, to be fair, cultures don't change overnight, and so we're constantly working on it. The business I think we've been most focused on that have been a little bit different from the past.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is now live.\nSteve Volkmann: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. This one is a little bit lucy as well. But it feels like on the logistics and freight costs that there's sort of two things going on. Obviously, the cost of those things has come down, but then you're also managing it much better. And I guess I'm curious if there's more opportunity as we go forward just in terms of how you manage it to continue to see some gains in that area.\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. I mean I think we're -- I wouldn't -- so managing it better is probably relative. I think we did quite an amazing job of managing through the pandemic through what was a really difficult time in the supply chain. I think it was actually extraordinary looking back, I think. But I think now it's easier to manage because we actually have the product in the right place. And so we're able to let our system work the way it's intended to work. In terms of are there further opportunities, there are always further opportunities. We have an expectation that we will get better every single year from that productivity and service basis. The teams are always identifying things to work on that can improve our service to our customers and the productivity, and we'll continue to do that.\nSteve Volkmann: Great. And then my follow-up is just your long-term kind of EPS targets from the Analyst Day. It seems like you're already pretty much there or getting close anyway. How do you think about revisiting those targets over time?\nDee Merriwether: So we had incredible progress towards those targets, as you can see in this quarter and then in the full year last year. But as we all are looking at the environment, the macro environment is still very fluid. And it's been incredibly difficult to forecast, at least more difficult than usual. With that being said, we are doing, of course, better than our performing better than our target, if you extrapolate our performance out. However, I would like to have a couple more data points underneath my belt and have the macro unfold a little bit more, especially with continued recession moving and predictions of a slowdown, and we will revisit those estimates at the right time.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Pat Baumann from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.\nPat Baumann: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Quickly on the April growth rate at constant currency. Is that -- has that been consistent across segments? And then from a seasonality perspective, how do you feel about the progression you're seeing from March to April? Is it stable with how things normally have been, or have you seen any slowing relative to kind of the first quarter trends?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So as we built the plan for this year, we knew that our comparison would get harder as the year went along because we came out of the pandemic in every month last year, we effectively got better. So I'd say we're right where we expect to be right now. The 11% is seasonality-wise, is normal. And the relative growth rate is only down slightly because we continue to improve through the year last year. So we're basically on what we expected to see at this point.\nPat Baumann: Got it. And in terms of Zoro, there was a leadership change there during the quarter. Curious if there's status quo as you look forward, or is there going to be any kind of shifts in kind of the way the business is run with the new leader in place?\nD.G. Macpherson: Yes. So the Masaya Suzuki, who is the CEO of MonotaRO also leads that business and the person reporting to him Kevin he's been with us for 15 years left to take a CEO job, which was great for him. And Sandy Mattison who Officer has moved in, I don't expect to see big shifts Sandy knows the business well, and we're just continuing to push on the core initiatives and Masaya is still supporting her and we're supporting her to make sure we can continue to improve that business and grow.\nOperator: Thank you Next question is coming from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Tyler Boyd on for Deane Dray. Just looking at Slide 21, it looks like was fairly broad-based across end markets. Maybe you noted a little bit of slowing maybe in consumer retail end markets. Is there anything else that you'd call out where demand is waning particularly strong?\nD.G. Macpherson: No, I think you're hitting on it. I think that's right. I think consumer-facing businesses are slowing much more than industrial. But generally, I would say that the pattern is more industrial is doing better, less industrial is slowing more and then bigger companies are generally doing better, I'd say, than smaller companies are.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That's it for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Katie Fleischer from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nKatie Fleischer: Hi. Kind of going off of the prior question, can you just talk about if you've seen any divergence between your small- and medium-sized customers versus the national accounts?\nD.G. Macpherson: We see -- with the high-touch model, we've seen pretty good growth with midsized customers and with national accounts, for sure. I would say the midsized customers are growing significantly faster than national accounts had seen a couple of years ago. So we do feel like, and we see that through the Zoro model too, where we're seeing businesses maybe not grow as fast as larger businesses. But in general, we're still seeing good growth with the high touch across both national accounts and advertised customers.\nKatie Fleischer: Okay. And then just for my follow-up. So one of your competitors recently talked about a slowing cadence of manufacturing activity through the month of March. I was just wondering if you've seen any sort of similar dynamic or any demand issues that you're concerned about?\nD.G. Macpherson: I mean, well, certainly, we -- in the fourth quarter, we saw low 20s growth in manufacturing in the first quarter, we saw mid-teens growth with manufacturing. So still growing strong, a lot of this is sort of looking back at what happened with the pandemic, and we saw huge growth rates coming as we recovered and now we're sort of moderating. But we still see, I'd say, I was with some customers I talked about in the opening. And all of the -- one of them was probably going to shrink a little bit this year, but that was on huge compares to the two years before. So it's not like it's -- activity is not strong. It's just less not growing as much and the other two are going to grow. So I think I think we're still manufacturing activity in general at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. We reach the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to D.G. for any further closing comments.\nD.G. Macpherson: All right. Thanks for joining us. I appreciate you know it's a busy earnings day in the world today. So thanks for taking the time. I would just finish by wanting to thank our team for the right work they're doing to make sure that we continue to gain share continue to serve our customers well and do it the right way. And with that, I'll say goodbye. Thanks for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "name": "Dee Merriwether",
            "content": "Thanks, DG. I'd like to echo DG's sentiment \u2013 execution on our growth strategy and improved service from a return to more normal supply chain performance helped drive excellent results in the quarter. Starting on slide 7, you can see the high-level results, including strong sales growth of 14. 5% in daily constant currency, driven by double-digit growth locally in both segments. Although year-over-year growth rates decelerated as we moved through the quarter on tougher comps, daily sales dollars remained strong and were reasonably in line with historical sequential growth trend. Total company operating margin was up 200 basis points as expanded gross margins in both segments dropped to the bottom line. SG&A margin was flat year-over-year as investments in headcount, marketing and technology were offset by revenue growth. In total, we delivered diluted EPS in the quarter of $9.61 up 36% versus the first quarter of 2022. Diving into segment level details. For the first quarter, we continued to see strong results within our Hi-tech segment with daily sales of 14.5%, fueled by revenue growth in all geographies. Customer demand was generally in line with expectations for the quarter and continues to remain resilient as a whole despite certain areas of softness. In the US, we are seeing broad-based strength across most of the manufacturing with contractors and government customers to name a few. Retail and warehousing are slowing the most, but still up high single digits. In Canada, the economy remains stable, and we are seeing good results across most end markets with Canadian daily sales up 11% and local days and local currency. For this segment, GP margin finished the quarter at 42.4%, up 195 basis points versus the prior year. This expansion was largely driven by freight and supply chain efficiencies as well as product mix favorability. As DG mentioned, improved product availability and short of supplier lead times drove improved stocking positions in our DCs. This availability improvement resulted in more efficient shipping routes, which helped reduce freight expense and lower our handling costs. Freight expense was further aided by a onetime adjustment, which drove 20 basis points of improvement in the period. Product mix was also a tailwind and partially due to improved product availability and partially from lapping the pandemic fuel spike in safety sales from last year's Omicron variant. For the quarter, price cost per ad was neutral and trended largely as anticipated as price/cost favorability we captured in 2022 began to unwind and offset the structural timing benefit we typically see as we passed price early in the first quarter each year. At the operating margin line, we saw improvement of 215 basis points year-over-year. The strong gross margin in the quarter was fully aided by 20 basis points of SG&A leverage as marketing and headcount investments were more than offset by revenue growth. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the High-Tech Solutions North American segment. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, we estimate that the US MRO market grew between 7% and 8%, indicating that we achieved roughly 750 basis points of outgrowth in the quarter. As we continue to build strong partnerships and make progress with our growth engines, our customers continue to turn to Grainger to help them solve their MRO challenges. Coupled this with our supply chain service advantage, we continue to have a high degree of confidence in delivering against our goal to consistently outgrow the US MRO market by 400 to 500 basis points in any economic cycle. Moving to the endless assortment segment. Sales increased 3.8% or 14% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese hand. So US was up 13.5%, while MonotaRO achieved 12% growth in local stains and local currency. While Zoro generated solid growth, they are off to a slower start than anticipated predominantly due to noncore B2C business, which was down in the mid-teens year-over-year. For small B2B customers who make up a majority of the world's business were up nicely in the first quarter but are softening a bit in April give Zoro more diversified end market customer mix outside of the industrial economy. At MonotaRO, sales were impacted by adverse weather as well as slower return to work patterns with the New Year holiday following midweek. Sales have ramped back over the last several weeks, and we expect results to be more in line with our expectations for the balance of the year. From a profitability perspective, gross margin for this segment expanded 140 basis points versus the prior year due to strong price realization and continued freight efficiencies across both businesses as well as favorable business unit mix for the segment. Operating margins expanded by 15 basis points year-over-year to 8.1% and primarily due to gross margin favorability offsetting investments in marketing and headcount to drive customer acquisition and assortment expansion. On slide 11, we continue to see positive results with our key endless assortment operating metrics. Total registered users are tracking nicely with Zoro and MonotaRO combined up 16% over the prior year. On the right, we show the continued growth of Zoro SKU portfolio, which grew by 900,000 SKUs in Q1 and stands at around $12 million in total. We are well on our way to achieving an annual goal of 2 million SKU additions in 2023. Now looking forward to the rest of the year, given the unexpected sharp improvement in profitability and continued resilient demand environment, we are updating our total company guidance for 2023. In our revised outlook, we are holding top line expectations with daily sales expected to be up 7% to 11% for the total company. This reflects solid Q1 performance in high touch offsetting a slightly slower start across inlets assortment with expected softness to continue for the balance of the year at Zoro. High Touch is trending slightly higher than originally expected on a similar 1% to 5% total US MRO market outlook, which continued strong share gains. And this assortment is trending slightly lower, however, we expect daily sales for this segment to be up low double digits, which is a couple of hundred basis points higher when translated to constant currency. Note that April sales growth for the total company is holding firm with month-to-date sales up 10% year-over-year or nearly 11% in daily constant currency. The larger changes to our guide come on the profitability side. More improved product availability and the resulting step change in service levels is driving better freight dynamics, lower handling costs and improved product mix. With this, we are raising our gross margin range to 39.1% in to 39.4%, up 70 to 100 basis points year-over-year. While we still expect to be price/cost negative over the next few quarters as we unwind prior year favorability. The supply chain improvement is flowing through our P&L much faster than anticipated and is fueling the predominance of our revised outlook. The increase in gross margin largely falls through the op margin improvement and resulting EPS, which we now expect to be between $34.25 and $36.75 and nearly 20% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. We have updated our supplemental guidance, which can be found in the appendix and includes revised segment margins and improved operating cash flow outlook and increased expectations for share repurchases for the year. Our execution has put us on a great path. We are serving customers well -- we're remaining focused on the things that matter and are positioned to continue to take share. I exit the quarter very confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our commitment to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to DG for some closing remarks. So yeah, Chris. How you doing? I would talk about the -- the last part of your question, I believe, first, which was you asked about producer price push. That has, of course, become less and less over a period of time. So it's basically modest as what we have seen of late. However, as you know, in the first quarter is when we implemented some of those costs are pulled them through to our system. And so for Q1, it's traditionally a high watermark for us for price cost. And as you noted, we expect to unwind some of our price cost positivity from 2022 as a result through the next couple of quarters. So thanks for the question. Obviously, we've had a really strong start to the year. And as I noted, we really feel like from a GP specifically in high touch, we're at a high watermark based upon the unwind that we're going to experience with price costs. A lot of the favorability that we experienced this quarter relates to our availability improving and some of the friction costs coming out faster and probably a little bit more pronounced then we would expect that is driving our results up. We did have a, I would say, a non-comparable freight impact of about 20 bps as you look at the outlook for the rest of the year. But other than that, we feel pretty confident in staying at this level based upon what we see right now. Good morning. So good question. I would say, with strong cash generation and M&A is always something that can be on the table. We have a small group here that looks for opportunities mostly in the capability space for us potentially, but nothing on the horizon as of yet. If you know our history, our view is not looking for a roll-up of smaller distributors that don't have a go-to-market focus that matches ours, which is selling on value and service to customers. So those are a little harder to find, I would say, but we do have a team stand that stood up to look at opportunities, but we don't see anything significant in the horizon. Sure. Just to roll up what you said a little bit, we really focus on PPI and IP to -- as a predictor or outlook of the MRO market. And our estimates about where it stood as we put together our guide, which is showing volume down 3% to flat in the US and price between 4% and 5%. So that's where we were at the end of the year as we look at the latest updates of IP and PPI there about there. And so underlying a lot of our assumptions is the MRO market growth, including price and volume of about 1% to 5%. So we had incredible progress towards those targets, as you can see in this quarter and then in the full year last year. But as we all are looking at the environment, the macro environment is still very fluid. And it's been incredibly difficult to forecast, at least more difficult than usual. With that being said, we are doing, of course, better than our performing better than our target, if you extrapolate our performance out. However, I would like to have a couple more data points underneath my belt and have the macro unfold a little bit more, especially with continued recession moving and predictions of a slowdown, and we will revisit those estimates at the right time."

            "name": "D.G. Macpherson",
            "content": "Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll provide an overview of our first quarter performance and then pass it to Deidra to walk through the financials in detail. Grainger started 2023 focused on what matters most. Providing our customers with the products and services they need through exceptional service. We remain closely embedded with our customers, finding ways to help them manage their inventory, reduce costs, achieve their ESG objectives and successfully run their operations. Two weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit with several customers in the manufacturing space in one of my favorite Midwest cities. I heard very clearly how well our teams have served them in the last few years, giving us great opportunity to grow with these customers in the future. We win when we serve our customers exceptionally well and my interactions with our teams and customers this quarter have been a great example of how we are winning each day. Many customers, especially those in the industrial space, continue to see solid end market demand for their products. However, we do see some customers with more consumer-facing exposure heading into a softer demand cycle. No matter what economic uncertainties our customers are facing, we remain committed to our overall focus of helping our customers keep their operations running and their people safe. This consistent approach and relentless focus on the customer rallies our team and fuels our results. As you can see, we again delivered a strong quarter of performance to start the year as demand remains resilient and as we continue to execute well. We are making progress on our strategic growth engines in our high-touch model as we further our merchandising efforts, continue to make smart marketing investments, expand our inventory management capabilities for customers and build out tools to better equip our sellers. The Enlist assortment business continues to execute their strategy as they add SKUs at Zoro, expand with enterprise customers at MonotaRO and at a healthy clip of new registered users each quarter. Our momentum is further supported by our world-class supply chain and distribution network, which benefited from an uptick in product availability as supplier lead times improved. This resulted in a sharp improvement in our service metrics to near pre-pandemic levels, faster than we had anticipated at the start of the year. With this swift improvement, we were able to meaningfully decrease frictional costs within the network by reducing average shipping distance and minimizing handling costs. All while delivering a higher percentage of orders complete and next day. This improvement is a reminder of just how much unusual and extraordinary activity we did to get products to customers through the pandemic and subsequent availability challenges. The return to more normal supply chain performance is great news for our customers and our supply chain team. The progress made across all these fronts helped drive great financial results for the first quarter, where we finished with sales growth of 12.2% and or 14.5% on a daily constant currency basis. Results again were driven by solid performance in both segments, most notably within the High Touch Solutions segment, which outpaced the broader MRO market by approximately 750 basis points in the US. Total company operating margins were 16.6%, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year period on improved gross margin performance due primarily to the supply chain efficiencies just discussed. Combined with our strong top line growth, we delivered EPS of $9.61 per share and a strong ROIC of 45.6%. During the quarter, we produced record operating cash flow of $454 million with free cash flow of $356 million, and we returned a combined $229 million to Grainger shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And yesterday, we were pleased to announce a $1.86 quarterly dividend, which represents an 8% increase. This marks our 52nd year of consecutive dividend increases, a track record that we are proud of. Finally, based on the strong start to the year and continued support of trends at April, we are raising our full year 2023 guidance, which Steve will outline in just a bit. With that, I'll turn it over to Dee to take us through more detail on the quarter. Thank you, Deid. Before I open it up for questions, I would make just a few comments. Granger was recently named to the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work -- for list for the second year in a row. As you know, this is an exclusive recognition, one that honors companies with the best cultures, workplaces and people. Along with this list, we have also been named to the best places to work for women and the world's most admired companies, among others. We view this recognition as an output of the work we do to create a welcoming culture and a highly motivated team. I remain confident in Grainger's ability to create tangible value, deliver flawless experience and drive profitable growth over the long haul. And with that, we'll open the floor for questions. Sure. Thanks, Chris. Yes. We are certainly seeing supply chains improve. I do think that a lot of the work we've done through the pandemic in the last three years has helped build some stickiness with our customers. I was -- every customer I go into, we've expanded our KeepStock operation if there of any size. We're filling bins, we're doing more and supporting customers to make sure that they have the right inventory in the right place. And I think that's been a big part of it. We continue to see really good results from merchandising, from marketing, from KeepStock and from our supply chain performance. All those things continue to be an advantage for us and helping us gain share. And in terms of customer response, what I would say, Chris, is that all of our -- effectively all of our share gain in the last three years has been on volume and not price. So we are priced competitively. And so we are not seeing unusual reactions from customers because we've maintained that competitiveness in our prices. Good morning. Yeah. So roughly 80% of Zoro's business is business to business customers that are small businesses and midsized businesses those, while they continue to perform pretty well in the first quarter. We are seeing sort of across everything smaller businesses and consumer-facing businesses slow down relative to certainly large and industrial-type businesses. So there's a mix here thing that's going on. And then the 20% that is not business to business, some of that came through the pandemic, as you might imagine. That has been down fairly substantially in the first quarter. So that's been a drag. Net-net, we still expect the endless assortment to be low double-digit growth, and we expect the segment to perform well during the year, but we do expect our -- to be below what we expected at the begin of the year. Thanks, Ryan. Yeah. I think there's several things that happen, Ryan. I mean if you went back to the fourth quarter of last year, we were really solid in terms of our own distributions at our performance and our own and outbound freight at that point. Inbound freight was getting better and supply lead times are starting to get better, but still fairly elongated. We've seen both supplier lead times domestically and cushion freight come in faster than we expected and recover faster than we expected. So therefore, we have received a whole bunch of products into the system. And I mean it's probably obvious when you think about it. But if you went back a year ago, there were a lot of back-ordered items. And so if a trailer, let's say, came into our Greenville D.C. at once of compressors or something. Everywhere in the network we point to that when it was received and we ship it all over the country to get product to customers. Now we have that same product coming into every DC and so we're shipping shorter distances and that's a big benefit in terms of for us at this point. And the other benefit is we're not having to work over time in our distribution centers where we were a year ago, and that part of that goes into gross margin, too, because that's part of handling costs. So that -- those are the benefits we're seeing. And a lot of it -- supplier lead times are still slightly extended from before the pandemic, but they are getting much, much closer, and there are fewer outliers than we expected at this time. Yeah. I mean I won't go into too much detail. Obviously, AI has been a rating topic. If you think about artificial intelligence, or intelligence, there's machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence is their deep learning a lot of what's been talked about lately is deep learning generative AI, which you can write up your favorite song. We have been using machine learning for a long time and things like helping us get search right and effectively, I think the challenge here is to figure out where you can drive improvements through AI from customer interactions from operations for back office, and we have efforts going in all of those areas and it's like any other technology to point it to the right problem. And I think that's probably going to be the most important thing for us to think about as we learn more. Good morning. There's a lot of good signs, I would say, in Canada right now, I think we're seeing nice growth in the business, and we continue to see profitability improvements, we're probably in the fifth or sixth inning, I think, of getting to where we want to go. We are exactly on the path we expected to be on in terms of growth and profitability at this point. So the team there has done a really nice job of improving that business and working with the entire North American team to make sure that we are supporting the business and driving profitable growth. We feel pretty good about it. Yeah. I mean it's a really interesting question. We -- Grainger has always had a wonderful culture, one where people really wanted to do the right thing for customers and very highly ethical company. About six years ago, we went through a process to say what needed to change. And we outlined a set of principles that we talk about at every meeting at every, every day basically and say are we in, in those principles. I think the things that have probably moved the most have been making sure we're starting with the customer, making sure we're competing with urgency and making sure we're acting with intent, meaning working on the things that really matter. I think our culture historically might have not always been as focused on a few things that matter and stay on them as long as needed to make them really great. And I think that's been a big focus for us as a leadership team. And I think that's probably a shift. I mean the shift is slow, to be fair, cultures don't change overnight, and so we're constantly working on it. The business I think we've been most focused on that have been a little bit different from the past. Yes. I mean I think we're -- I wouldn't -- so managing it better is probably relative. I think we did quite an amazing job of managing through the pandemic through what was a really difficult time in the supply chain. I think it was actually extraordinary looking back, I think. But I think now it's easier to manage because we actually have the product in the right place. And so we're able to let our system work the way it's intended to work. In terms of are there further opportunities, there are always further opportunities. We have an expectation that we will get better every single year from that productivity and service basis. The teams are always identifying things to work on that can improve our service to our customers and the productivity, and we'll continue to do that. Yes. So as we built the plan for this year, we knew that our comparison would get harder as the year went along because we came out of the pandemic in every month last year, we effectively got better. So I'd say we're right where we expect to be right now. The 11% is seasonality-wise, is normal. And the relative growth rate is only down slightly because we continue to improve through the year last year. So we're basically on what we expected to see at this point. Yes. So the Masaya Suzuki, who is the CEO of MonotaRO also leads that business and the person reporting to him Kevin he's been with us for 15 years left to take a CEO job, which was great for him. And Sandy Mattison who Officer has moved in, I don't expect to see big shifts Sandy knows the business well, and we're just continuing to push on the core initiatives and Masaya is still supporting her and we're supporting her to make sure we can continue to improve that business and grow. No, I think you're hitting on it. I think that's right. I think consumer-facing businesses are slowing much more than industrial. But generally, I would say that the pattern is more industrial is doing better, less industrial is slowing more and then bigger companies are generally doing better, I'd say, than smaller companies are. We see -- with the high-touch model, we've seen pretty good growth with midsized customers and with national accounts, for sure. I would say the midsized customers are growing significantly faster than national accounts had seen a couple of years ago. So we do feel like, and we see that through the Zoro model too, where we're seeing businesses maybe not grow as fast as larger businesses. But in general, we're still seeing good growth with the high touch across both national accounts and advertised customers. I mean, well, certainly, we -- in the fourth quarter, we saw low 20s growth in manufacturing in the first quarter, we saw mid-teens growth with manufacturing. So still growing strong, a lot of this is sort of looking back at what happened with the pandemic, and we saw huge growth rates coming as we recovered and now we're sort of moderating. But we still see, I'd say, I was with some customers I talked about in the opening. And all of the -- one of them was probably going to shrink a little bit this year, but that was on huge compares to the two years before. So it's not like it's -- activity is not strong. It's just less not growing as much and the other two are going to grow. So I think I think we're still manufacturing activity in general at this point. All right. Thanks for joining us. I appreciate you know it's a busy earnings day in the world today. So thanks for taking the time. I would just finish by wanting to thank our team for the right work they're doing to make sure that we continue to gain share continue to serve our customers well and do it the right way. And with that, I'll say goodbye. Thanks for joining us."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Kyle Bland, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nKyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of the comments today may include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is included in the company's most recent Form 8-K and other periodic reports filed with the SEC. This morning's call, we'll focus on results for the third quarter of 2024, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis. As a reminder, we have included a daily organic constant-currency sales growth metric within these materials to normalize for the divestiture of our E&R Industrial Sales subsidiary, which was sold at the end of 2023. Definitions and a full reconciliation of this and any other non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO is a public company and follows Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers discussed will differ from MonotaRO's public statements. Now, I will turn it over to D.G.\nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thanks for joining the call. Everything we do at Grainger starts with the Grainger Edge and with a focus on the customer. I've had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with customers past few months and while the demand environment remains muted, these visits have highlighted the value that we bring every day. Our strong capabilities, including digital, supply-chain and on-site support allow us to help our customers succeed. No matter what each is facing, we are there to help them overcome challenges. Before I get into the financials, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the Grainger team for their continued work in helping those impacted by the recent hurricanes in the Southeast. Fulfilling our purpose, we keep the world working and supporting our customer operations when they need us most. Our branch, KeepStock, distribution center and sales team members have gone above and beyond over the last few weeks, providing vital supplies and relief resources. And as we always have, our team will continue to work side-by-side with our partners to make sure that these communities have what they need to navigate the road to recovery. Moving to the third quarter, while demand remains soft, the business continues to perform well as we remain focused on being the go-to MRO partner for our customers. Both segments grew in the period and we continue to make strategic progress across the company. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, we're leveraging our customer and product data assets and strong supply chain capabilities to help us advance our strategic growth engines. We've done great work-in 2024, but I'm particularly pleased with how we're continually utilizing our vast array of proprietary data to improve our customer and team member experience. We've launched new capabilities such as analytical tools that arm our sellers with better insights and data to drive more fruitful conversations with our customers. We're also testing a generative AI model in our call centers, which helps us scale our know-how and equip our customer service agents with fast, relevant responses to help customers get what they need quickly and efficiently. These are just some early examples of how we can leverage our data to help drive share, reduce cost and further improve our service advantage. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead in this space. Driving a great customer experience is also underpinned by our world-class supply chain, one that is built specifically to serve B2B customers and ship next day complete orders. During the quarter, we made progress on enhancing our service capabilities and expanding our distribution center network by officially beginning construction on our New Houston area DC. This along with the continued progress at our new Pacific Northwest distribution center will ensure we maintain our service advantage now and into the future. Within the Endless Assortment segment, our focus on growing share of wallet with enterprise customers at MonotaRO and the changes we've made to better communicate delivery expectations at Zoro have both helped reaccelerate growth over the last couple of quarters. These businesses are on the right track for a strong finish to 2024, setting us up nicely to continue gaining share in 2025 and beyond. Now shifting to third quarter financials. Total company reported sales for the quarter were up 4.3% or 4% on a daily organic constant-currency basis, which normalizes for the E&R divestiture and one more selling day in the current year period. Operating margins for the total company remained healthy at 15.6% and EPS finished the quarter up 4.7% to $9.87. Operating cash flow came in at $611 million in the quarter, which allowed us to return a total of $328 million to Grainger's shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, 2024 is playing out largely as expected as the business continues to perform well and we stay focused on serving customers. With this, we are narrowing our earnings guidance ranges to close out the year, which Dee will outline in a few minutes. As we wrap-up 2024, I'm confident that we will continue to execute well, meet our goals and drive solid results for all stakeholders. Now, I'll turn it over to Dee.\nDeidra Merriwether: Thank you, D.G. Turning to Slide 7, you can see the high level third quarter results for the total company, including 4% revenue growth on a daily organic constant-currency basis. This number includes a headwind of roughly 50 basis points from the lap of a heightened level of service engagement in the prior-year quarter. Within the period, we saw relatively stable gross margins across both segments, along with slight deleverage in High-Touch. This led to total company operating margins to be down 30 basis points in the third quarter, largely in line with expectations. Diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.87 was up $0.44 over the prior-year period as higher sales were further aided by a lower share count in the current year. Moving on to segment level results, the High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well with sales up 3.3% on a reported basis or 2.5% on a daily organic constant currency basis. Results were driven by solid volume growth and improved price contribution within the segment. We also delivered growth across all geographies in the period in local days, local currencies. In the U.S. specifically, we continue to see flat to positive growth in nearly all customer end segments, including persistent strong performance with contractors, warehousing and healthcare customers. For the segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 41.6%, down 10 basis points versus the prior year. In the quarter, we experienced an unfavorable product mix headwind as we lapped a heightened level of service engagements from the third quarter of 2023. This 60 basis point year-over-year headwind was largely offset by several small tailwinds, which included the lap of a one-time adjustment made to clear out unproductive inventory. Price cost for the quarter was roughly neutral. SG&A costs for this segment increased over the period as we continue to invest in demand generation activities, including marketing and seller headcount as well as normal wage inflation. Coupled with the softer topline, this led to SG&A deleverage of 30 basis points. Taking all this together, operating margin for the segment was down 40 basis points versus the prior year, which was largely in line with expectations and remained at a healthy 17.6%. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, using headline industrial production and producer price index, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market grew between 2% and 2.5% in the quarter with price once again contributing nearly all of the market growth. With our High-Touch Solutions U.S. business growing at 2.6% organically, our mathematical market outgrowth in the quarter was roughly 50 basis points in total. This includes approximately 200 basis points of volume outgrowth contribution for the quarter, netted with continued price headwinds when comparing our price contribution to PPI. Volume outgrowth year-to-date is roughly 350 basis points, just shy of our 400 to 500 basis point outgrowth target. As we discussed this year, we're currently in a cycle where the growth rate implied by the headline IP and PPI metrics used in our market model is higher than a number of other external data points across the MRO landscape would suggest. This difference continues to cause noise in our share gain calculation. Although we will not mathematically achieve our market outlook target in 2024, when using our headline market model, we remain pleased with returns we're driving across our outgrowth initiatives and are confident we're taking solid share in the current environment. We believe this market measurement dislocation will normalize overtime and we continue to target 400 basis to 500 basis points of outgrowth annually on average. Now, focusing on the Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 8.1% or 11.5% on a daily constant-currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 11.3%, while MonotaRO achieved 15.4% growth in local days, local constant currency. At a business level, Zoro built on its second quarter performance and once again saw strong growth in the mid-teens from its core B2B customers. The headwinds from non-core B2C and B2C-like customers continues to dissipate with sales to those customers roughly flat versus the prior year. The headwinds we've seen from this group are largely behind us and we should go forward on even footing. At MonotaRO, sales growth remained strong with enterprise customers coupled with solid acquisition and repeat purchase rates with small and mid-sized businesses. On a reported basis, these results were partially offset by foreign exchange as the yen continues to be a year-over-year headwind. On profitability, the operating margins for this segment increased 130 basis points to 8.8% with both businesses contributing leverage year-over-year. MonotaRO margins remained strong at 12.4% with DC operating efficiency driving continued year-over-year improvement. At Zoro, operating margins were up 120 basis points to 4.3%, aided by solid operating leverage and a favorable one-time reserve true-up of roughly 70 basis points. These items more than offset an increase in marketing spend. Overall, we're encouraged by the strong progress we've made across the segment and remain on track to finish the year at or above our original expectations. Now moving to the updated outlook for the full year of 2024. As D.G. mentioned at the beginning of the call, while the market has remained muted, results have largely played out as expected for the year. With this, we're narrowing our full year 2024 earnings outlook. The narrow guide includes daily organic constant currency sales growth of between 4.5% and 5.25% and a diluted adjusted EPS range of $38.65 to $39.35. The updated revenue outlook implies a fourth quarter 2024 daily organic constant currency growth rate in the mid-single digits, which includes month-to-date growth in October of approximately 6.5%. This preliminary daily organic constant currency sales growth rate for October includes roughly 200 to 250 basis points of hurricane-related sales, meaning normalized month-to-date results are closer to 4% and 4.5%. Our operating margin expectations haven't shifted much from our prior guide. If you were to squeeze the operating margins from the updated annual guide, it implies a seasonal sequential step down in the fourth quarter to just above 15% at the midpoint. Supplemental guidance has also been updated, including an increase of $150 million to our operating cash flow outlook at the midpoint. As a note, we've lowered our full year 2024 tax rate assumption to approximately 23.2% or 80 basis points less than the prior guide, which implies our fourth quarter tax rate somewhere between 20% and 21%. This reflects anticipated favorability in the fourth quarter as we adjust audit reserves from prior year tax returns and execute various tax planning strategies. Full-year foreign exchange rates have also been updated in the revised outlook. Overall, the year has played out largely as expected and our updated earnings guidance remains within the original ranges we communicated at the beginning of the year. We look forward with confidence in finishing the year strong. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G.\nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to recognize the Grainger team on earning another notable workplace achievement. Earlier this week, we were named the top ranked company across all industries on the American Opportunity Index, which primarily focuses on the experience of workers in non-college degree roles and the company's ability to offer them growth and development no matter their career path. The index measures the career trajectories of 5 million employees at 400 of America's largest companies via publicly available data. In other words, it's all about the facts, not a submission or a survey, so it's completely objective. This ranking is a testament to our culture, most importantly, our commitment to ensuring every team member can have a meaningful and fulfillment career here at Grainger. We are honored to receive this recognition. With that, we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.\nRyan Merkel: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start, D.G, with the Endless Assortment growth rate really stood out to me this quarter. It was a nice acceleration from what we saw in the first half. Is there anything you'd point out company-specific or otherwise that really drove that growth a lot higher this quarter?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So what I would say is that MonotaRO continues to have really good success with enterprise customers and has also made some improvements with small businesses as well. So that has been a continuation of some improvement. And then Zoro, we talked about B2C and B2C-like customers being a headwind, that is really no longer a headwind. They were roughly flat with those customers. And so what you're seeing now is mostly the strong business-to-business growth, which was strong last quarter and strong this quarter. So the results are much improved.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. And then on the fourth quarter, nice start to October. I'm just curious, are you assuming the macro really just stays the same? And then in November and December, should we assume that the hurricane bump of 2%, 2.5% falls off or is that unclear?\nDonald Macpherson: I think on both of those, we would say, yes, we would agree with you that macro stays the same and then the hurricane bump falls off in the November-December timeframe.\nRyan Merkel: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jacob Levinson with Melius Research. Please state your question.\nJacob Levinson: Hi, good morning, D.G., Dee.\nDonald Macpherson: Good morning.\nDeidra Merriwether: Good morning.\nJacob Levinson: I think it's been quite some time since we've had, at least for you folks, such a sluggish macro backdrop and you're still spending -- understandably spending quite a bit of money on demand-generating investments. I guess, trying to understand how do you -- how do you kind of balance that investment spend when you're trying to manage growth in this type of environment versus holding a line on margins?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So I think the simple answer, of course, is if something on demand generation is worth spending in good times, it's probably worth spending in bad times, you may adjust the levels depending on sort of the market growth, but we'd still expect to spend in areas that we think are going to create long-term advantage for us and help us grow. I think the most important thing to do is to make sure that in all the core areas of the business, we continue to drive productivity. So we have a lot of core operations. We are very much an operation-intensive business and making sure that we're consistently getting productivity in those parts of the business and we've worked on that in the past and continue to work on that going forward is really critical to make sure that you're able to continue to invest in those demand-generating activities.\nJacob Levinson: Okay. That makes sense. And then just quickly on the balance sheet. You're -- I think you're sitting on the largest cash value you've had since maybe the height of the pandemic area. The balance sheet leverage is pretty low. Obviously, the stock has had a pretty phenomenal run at this point, but can you just give us a sense of how you're thinking about your balance sheet options at this point, whether it's buying back stock or even if there are M&A bills out there on your radar?\nDeidra Merriwether: So thanks for the question. And if you look at our cash balance over the quarter, we did increase cash meaningfully, because we closed on our new $500 million bond offering, which we'll use to paydown senior notes early in 2025. And if you pull that to the side, it's important to note that the pace of our cash growth really over several years has been in line with our sales growth. And when you look at the excess cash that we do have and look at our capital allocation strategy, we don't envision any changes to that strategy and we will most likely return that cashback to shareholders in the form of share repo. And if you look at our guide -- updated guide for the end of the year, you can see that represented in that number.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sabrina Abrams with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nSabrina Abrams: Hi, good morning.\nDonald Macpherson: Good morning.\nDeidra Merriwether: Good morning.\nSabrina Abrams: I would -- I just want to ask about the self-help initiatives to gain share in HTS between -- you mentioned the marketing, seller headcount, just looking to understand the traction, anything going particularly well? Anything you're looking to improve on? And just early thoughts on expectations for 2025 in terms of the outgrowth? Thank you.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So I'll start and then Dee may add on to this. But basically what we are doing broadly is leveraging our proprietary data and product information and customer information to provide better solutions, whether that's in marketing, where we get more refined and how we market the customers or whether that's in merchandising where we look to make sure that the website is easier for customers to navigate or add products. And then we also are leveraging some of that customer information to improve seller coverage. So we have continued to add sellers this year at a relatively modest rate, but a consistent rate. And all of those are showing very strong returns and continues to show strong returns. Our expectation is that they will continue to show strong returns into next year as well. We won't update our market expectations for 2025 until after fourth quarter earnings. It's probably safe to say that 2025 will start similarly the way 2024 ends. That's usually the way it works. So probably be muted to start the year. But in any case, we are going to continue to invest in leveraging our data assets to provide better customer solutions and better outreach through marketing through coverage, through merchandising.\nDeidra Merriwether: And the only thing I'd add, Sabrina, is that we still are targeting from the collective investments in demand generation to outgrow the market by 400 to 500 basis points. And as I noted in our prepared remarks, we are in a period where we do have some dislocation versus our headline IP and PPI metrics. However, when we continue to internally test the return on those investments, those investments are still returning as we would expect. And there still is really a lot of noise. I would say if you look at market surveys, other competitive results or other economic data points related to what volume really is, we believe are actually muted and we are performing fairly well versus the competition.\nSabrina Abrams: Okay, great. Thank you guys. And then just a follow-up. I think you mentioned price cost was neutral in the prepared remarks. Do you feel you need to take incremental pricing actions following the May 1st price increase or do you sort of feel you've taken the appropriate measures for the levels of inflation we are at right now?\nDeidra Merriwether: So yes, we did take an additional increase in September. As you know, versus where we expected price to be at the beginning of the year versus where it appears it's landing and based upon 70% of our business in High-Touch being contract-related, we've had to kind of chase to catch-up on some of that. And so our goal would be, as you noted, to exit the year price cost neutral and we are in line with that. Now we're right in the midst of our cost cycle with our suppliers heading into 2025. And as D.G. noted, really not ready to disclose where we think that will head, but we do have a philosophy, of course, as a distributor of passing on cost inflation through price to our customers since we sell on value and we don't expect that to change in 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Good morning.\nDonald Macpherson: Good morning.\nDavid Manthey: My question is, on Slide 9, essentially you're saying the disconnect between your sales and industrial production is just inflation, I guess, or deflation. And so the third quarter '23 share gains might have been overstated while the third quarter of '24 are understated. Is that what you're saying?\nDonald Macpherson: No, no. We think that the third quarter of last year was probably stated correctly. What we're seeing right now is the way we calculate share gain is based on IP and based on market price increases as well. And as we look across different other performance indicators, market surveys, competitor results, economic data points, we think we're performing quite well right now. And so we think that the share gain number we're quoting isn't necessarily reflecting all reality. And so in any case, we expect that dislocation to correct itself over the long-term and we'll continue to gain 400 basis to 500 basis points on average annual market growth.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And then D.G., if I'm trying to square up Slide 19 with Slide 9. 19 as maybe a lens of the U.S. commercial industrial economy that it looks like steady deceleration in most of those categories. And so I'm just trying to understand that relative to you saying the MRO market is kind of steady right now. Is that just Grainger comps that's influencing that or how should we think about 19?\nDonald Macpherson: So we would say that the demand trend has been pretty consistent most of this year. You see some fluctuation. Warehousing is up as an example, but certainly things like heavy equipment is down right now. So there are puts and takes. Net-net, it's not a huge change from the beginning of the year to now, but it's been pretty slow growth all year, I would say.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please state your question.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions.\nDonald Macpherson: Good morning.\nDeidra Merriwether: Good morning.\nTommy Moll: So you mentioned that the year is playing out largely as expected. And I was curious if we go one layer deeper just in terms of the pricing versus volume trends. Would you say the same for each of those, or are there may be some offsets where pricing maybe is coming in a little bit better than expected, volumes a little bit weaker, or the reverse of that?\nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. Market price, as you noted, has been fairly resilient all year. Now for us, as I kind of talked about in a prior question, we started off the year pricing fairly light versus what has actually occurred and have been pulling through price as appropriate while we're still maintaining price competitiveness. From a volume perspective, I think the market is closer to right there. And if you look at those components, it's like flat to down on volume. And as you can kind of see in the U.S., we have actually grown volume positively. I've been around here for about 11 years and when I looked at IP and PPI over time, you'll get to the next year and it does a really good look-back and makes a lot of corrections. When we look at what D.G. kind of talked about, other surveys or other metrics, it feels like those corrections will be to the downside as we look back at 2024 and that's what all of our data as it relates to our AB testing and a lot of our pre- and post-testing on our investments are telling us.\nTommy Moll: And sticking on the market-share theme, are there any anecdotes you could share just on competitive contract wins or things you're seeing in the business that you're winning every day that would also corroborate what you're communicating in terms of the share capture?\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. Well, I think the easiest one is just to look at sort of revenue growth across all the competitors to get a sense for that. I would say from a customer input I've been with a lot of customers last couple of months and generally, there's no panic we're -- and we are viewed as adding a bunch of value to their business. And I think we're doing all the right things and winning contracts and of course, losing some as always. But generally, the customer interactions feel pretty good right now in terms of how they view some of the value that we're creating.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nPatrick Baumann: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first, I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about KeepStock. It feels like it's not something that's come up in a while, not because you haven't had success there, I think. I think it's been growing nicely, but maybe you could provide some perspective on how big it is now in terms of the High-Touch segment, what type of growth you're seeing? And any thoughts on that announcement from Amazon around like the Amazon Business Restock program, like where might they be trying to go after customers in terms of vending, in terms of inventory management? It just seems like they're moving to a higher touch offering than historically. Wondering if you had any thoughts on that at all. I know it's early, so I think that you might not.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes, no, so KeepStock continues to grow faster than the business on the whole. A large majority of our revenue volume comes from customers that have some sort of KeepStock installation as well. So you can track it sort of the volume through KeepStock, which would be probably high-teens or something like that. But you can also track it in terms of how many customers, the total revenue half that KeepStock installation and there's a lot of them. What I would say is that doing KeepStock well requires, particularly in the spaces that we operate in, understanding dirty places in manufacturing plants and making sure you locate them right. And there's a lot of work that goes into that, consulting, having the right industrial products and getting them to customers quickly and being able to stock bins and make sure we're at the right locations within a plant. And so we don't know everything about the Amazon announcement, but it's pretty simple to get vending going, which is what they're talking about doing. And I think they're planning to use third-party as they announce to stock. We don't know how that will play out, but we feel pretty confident in our ability to provide a lot of value on the platform.\nPatrick Baumann: Thanks for the color. And then maybe one for Dee. On the gross margin outlook for the fourth quarter, I'm squeezing into something that's higher sequentially than the third quarter and would be up nicely year-over-year. Just wondering if I'm doing the math right. And if so, what's driving that and if that's right, like should we expect gross margin expansion in '25? It just seems like a nice exit rate for the year.\nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. Maybe I point you to like sequential versus year-over-year. And the price cost, which kind of came up, we were expecting to end the year a positive, mainly due to supplier rebates. That's going to definitely help us. We do have some business unit mix offsets to that and a little bit of freight. But net-net, on a sequential basis going from Q3 2024 to Q4 2024, we do expect to expand gross margins. Since we're not talking about 2025 outlook, like I noted earlier, we're in the midst of our contract negotiations on COGS and of course, watching market pricing. But as D.G. noted, we expect the first quarter or the first half to look a whole lot like we're ending this half and that has been price moderating -- continuing to moderate a bit since we've exited the pandemic. So I don't see it being particularly strong in 2025, but do feel like there will be some price in the market.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I'll hand the floor back to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.\nDonald Macpherson: All right. Well, thank you. Thanks for joining our call. Really appreciate it. As we discussed, we think we continue to perform well in a certainly muted demand environment, but we're really confident in the things we're doing and feel good about the way the company is moving. And we're going to continue to execute on the things that really matter. Appreciate the time. Have a safe and fun Halloween if you're into that and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's call. All parties may disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thanks for joining the call. Everything we do at Grainger starts with the Grainger Edge and with a focus on the customer. I've had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with customers past few months and while the demand environment remains muted, these visits have highlighted the value that we bring every day. Our strong capabilities, including digital, supply-chain and on-site support allow us to help our customers succeed. No matter what each is facing, we are there to help them overcome challenges. Before I get into the financials, I'd like to take a moment to recognize the Grainger team for their continued work in helping those impacted by the recent hurricanes in the Southeast. Fulfilling our purpose, we keep the world working and supporting our customer operations when they need us most. Our branch, KeepStock, distribution center and sales team members have gone above and beyond over the last few weeks, providing vital supplies and relief resources. And as we always have, our team will continue to work side-by-side with our partners to make sure that these communities have what they need to navigate the road to recovery. Moving to the third quarter, while demand remains soft, the business continues to perform well as we remain focused on being the go-to MRO partner for our customers. Both segments grew in the period and we continue to make strategic progress across the company. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, we're leveraging our customer and product data assets and strong supply chain capabilities to help us advance our strategic growth engines. We've done great work-in 2024, but I'm particularly pleased with how we're continually utilizing our vast array of proprietary data to improve our customer and team member experience. We've launched new capabilities such as analytical tools that arm our sellers with better insights and data to drive more fruitful conversations with our customers. We're also testing a generative AI model in our call centers, which helps us scale our know-how and equip our customer service agents with fast, relevant responses to help customers get what they need quickly and efficiently. These are just some early examples of how we can leverage our data to help drive share, reduce cost and further improve our service advantage. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead in this space. Driving a great customer experience is also underpinned by our world-class supply chain, one that is built specifically to serve B2B customers and ship next day complete orders. During the quarter, we made progress on enhancing our service capabilities and expanding our distribution center network by officially beginning construction on our New Houston area DC. This along with the continued progress at our new Pacific Northwest distribution center will ensure we maintain our service advantage now and into the future. Within the Endless Assortment segment, our focus on growing share of wallet with enterprise customers at MonotaRO and the changes we've made to better communicate delivery expectations at Zoro have both helped reaccelerate growth over the last couple of quarters. These businesses are on the right track for a strong finish to 2024, setting us up nicely to continue gaining share in 2025 and beyond. Now shifting to third quarter financials. Total company reported sales for the quarter were up 4.3% or 4% on a daily organic constant-currency basis, which normalizes for the E&R divestiture and one more selling day in the current year period. Operating margins for the total company remained healthy at 15.6% and EPS finished the quarter up 4.7% to $9.87. Operating cash flow came in at $611 million in the quarter, which allowed us to return a total of $328 million to Grainger's shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, 2024 is playing out largely as expected as the business continues to perform well and we stay focused on serving customers. With this, we are narrowing our earnings guidance ranges to close out the year, which Dee will outline in a few minutes. As we wrap-up 2024, I'm confident that we will continue to execute well, meet our goals and drive solid results for all stakeholders. Now, I'll turn it over to Dee. Thanks, Dee. Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to recognize the Grainger team on earning another notable workplace achievement. Earlier this week, we were named the top ranked company across all industries on the American Opportunity Index, which primarily focuses on the experience of workers in non-college degree roles and the company's ability to offer them growth and development no matter their career path. The index measures the career trajectories of 5 million employees at 400 of America's largest companies via publicly available data. In other words, it's all about the facts, not a submission or a survey, so it's completely objective. This ranking is a testament to our culture, most importantly, our commitment to ensuring every team member can have a meaningful and fulfillment career here at Grainger. We are honored to receive this recognition. With that, we will open up the line for questions. Yes. So what I would say is that MonotaRO continues to have really good success with enterprise customers and has also made some improvements with small businesses as well. So that has been a continuation of some improvement. And then Zoro, we talked about B2C and B2C-like customers being a headwind, that is really no longer a headwind. They were roughly flat with those customers. And so what you're seeing now is mostly the strong business-to-business growth, which was strong last quarter and strong this quarter. So the results are much improved. I think on both of those, we would say, yes, we would agree with you that macro stays the same and then the hurricane bump falls off in the November-December timeframe. Good morning. Yes. So I think the simple answer, of course, is if something on demand generation is worth spending in good times, it's probably worth spending in bad times, you may adjust the levels depending on sort of the market growth, but we'd still expect to spend in areas that we think are going to create long-term advantage for us and help us grow. I think the most important thing to do is to make sure that in all the core areas of the business, we continue to drive productivity. So we have a lot of core operations. We are very much an operation-intensive business and making sure that we're consistently getting productivity in those parts of the business and we've worked on that in the past and continue to work on that going forward is really critical to make sure that you're able to continue to invest in those demand-generating activities. Good morning. Yes. So I'll start and then Dee may add on to this. But basically what we are doing broadly is leveraging our proprietary data and product information and customer information to provide better solutions, whether that's in marketing, where we get more refined and how we market the customers or whether that's in merchandising where we look to make sure that the website is easier for customers to navigate or add products. And then we also are leveraging some of that customer information to improve seller coverage. So we have continued to add sellers this year at a relatively modest rate, but a consistent rate. And all of those are showing very strong returns and continues to show strong returns. Our expectation is that they will continue to show strong returns into next year as well. We won't update our market expectations for 2025 until after fourth quarter earnings. It's probably safe to say that 2025 will start similarly the way 2024 ends. That's usually the way it works. So probably be muted to start the year. But in any case, we are going to continue to invest in leveraging our data assets to provide better customer solutions and better outreach through marketing through coverage, through merchandising. Good morning. No, no. We think that the third quarter of last year was probably stated correctly. What we're seeing right now is the way we calculate share gain is based on IP and based on market price increases as well. And as we look across different other performance indicators, market surveys, competitor results, economic data points, we think we're performing quite well right now. And so we think that the share gain number we're quoting isn't necessarily reflecting all reality. And so in any case, we expect that dislocation to correct itself over the long-term and we'll continue to gain 400 basis to 500 basis points on average annual market growth. So we would say that the demand trend has been pretty consistent most of this year. You see some fluctuation. Warehousing is up as an example, but certainly things like heavy equipment is down right now. So there are puts and takes. Net-net, it's not a huge change from the beginning of the year to now, but it's been pretty slow growth all year, I would say. Good morning. Yes. Well, I think the easiest one is just to look at sort of revenue growth across all the competitors to get a sense for that. I would say from a customer input I've been with a lot of customers last couple of months and generally, there's no panic we're -- and we are viewed as adding a bunch of value to their business. And I think we're doing all the right things and winning contracts and of course, losing some as always. But generally, the customer interactions feel pretty good right now in terms of how they view some of the value that we're creating. Yes, no, so KeepStock continues to grow faster than the business on the whole. A large majority of our revenue volume comes from customers that have some sort of KeepStock installation as well. So you can track it sort of the volume through KeepStock, which would be probably high-teens or something like that. But you can also track it in terms of how many customers, the total revenue half that KeepStock installation and there's a lot of them. What I would say is that doing KeepStock well requires, particularly in the spaces that we operate in, understanding dirty places in manufacturing plants and making sure you locate them right. And there's a lot of work that goes into that, consulting, having the right industrial products and getting them to customers quickly and being able to stock bins and make sure we're at the right locations within a plant. And so we don't know everything about the Amazon announcement, but it's pretty simple to get vending going, which is what they're talking about doing. And I think they're planning to use third-party as they announce to stock. We don't know how that will play out, but we feel pretty confident in our ability to provide a lot of value on the platform. All right. Well, thank you. Thanks for joining our call. Really appreciate it. As we discussed, we think we continue to perform well in a certainly muted demand environment, but we're really confident in the things we're doing and feel good about the way the company is moving. And we're going to continue to execute on the things that really matter. Appreciate the time. Have a safe and fun Halloween if you're into that and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, D.G. Turning to Slide 7, you can see the high level third quarter results for the total company, including 4% revenue growth on a daily organic constant-currency basis. This number includes a headwind of roughly 50 basis points from the lap of a heightened level of service engagement in the prior-year quarter. Within the period, we saw relatively stable gross margins across both segments, along with slight deleverage in High-Touch. This led to total company operating margins to be down 30 basis points in the third quarter, largely in line with expectations. Diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.87 was up $0.44 over the prior-year period as higher sales were further aided by a lower share count in the current year. Moving on to segment level results, the High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well with sales up 3.3% on a reported basis or 2.5% on a daily organic constant currency basis. Results were driven by solid volume growth and improved price contribution within the segment. We also delivered growth across all geographies in the period in local days, local currencies. In the U.S. specifically, we continue to see flat to positive growth in nearly all customer end segments, including persistent strong performance with contractors, warehousing and healthcare customers. For the segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 41.6%, down 10 basis points versus the prior year. In the quarter, we experienced an unfavorable product mix headwind as we lapped a heightened level of service engagements from the third quarter of 2023. This 60 basis point year-over-year headwind was largely offset by several small tailwinds, which included the lap of a one-time adjustment made to clear out unproductive inventory. Price cost for the quarter was roughly neutral. SG&A costs for this segment increased over the period as we continue to invest in demand generation activities, including marketing and seller headcount as well as normal wage inflation. Coupled with the softer topline, this led to SG&A deleverage of 30 basis points. Taking all this together, operating margin for the segment was down 40 basis points versus the prior year, which was largely in line with expectations and remained at a healthy 17.6%. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, using headline industrial production and producer price index, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market grew between 2% and 2.5% in the quarter with price once again contributing nearly all of the market growth. With our High-Touch Solutions U.S. business growing at 2.6% organically, our mathematical market outgrowth in the quarter was roughly 50 basis points in total. This includes approximately 200 basis points of volume outgrowth contribution for the quarter, netted with continued price headwinds when comparing our price contribution to PPI. Volume outgrowth year-to-date is roughly 350 basis points, just shy of our 400 to 500 basis point outgrowth target. As we discussed this year, we're currently in a cycle where the growth rate implied by the headline IP and PPI metrics used in our market model is higher than a number of other external data points across the MRO landscape would suggest. This difference continues to cause noise in our share gain calculation. Although we will not mathematically achieve our market outlook target in 2024, when using our headline market model, we remain pleased with returns we're driving across our outgrowth initiatives and are confident we're taking solid share in the current environment. We believe this market measurement dislocation will normalize overtime and we continue to target 400 basis to 500 basis points of outgrowth annually on average. Now, focusing on the Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 8.1% or 11.5% on a daily constant-currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 11.3%, while MonotaRO achieved 15.4% growth in local days, local constant currency. At a business level, Zoro built on its second quarter performance and once again saw strong growth in the mid-teens from its core B2B customers. The headwinds from non-core B2C and B2C-like customers continues to dissipate with sales to those customers roughly flat versus the prior year. The headwinds we've seen from this group are largely behind us and we should go forward on even footing. At MonotaRO, sales growth remained strong with enterprise customers coupled with solid acquisition and repeat purchase rates with small and mid-sized businesses. On a reported basis, these results were partially offset by foreign exchange as the yen continues to be a year-over-year headwind. On profitability, the operating margins for this segment increased 130 basis points to 8.8% with both businesses contributing leverage year-over-year. MonotaRO margins remained strong at 12.4% with DC operating efficiency driving continued year-over-year improvement. At Zoro, operating margins were up 120 basis points to 4.3%, aided by solid operating leverage and a favorable one-time reserve true-up of roughly 70 basis points. These items more than offset an increase in marketing spend. Overall, we're encouraged by the strong progress we've made across the segment and remain on track to finish the year at or above our original expectations. Now moving to the updated outlook for the full year of 2024. As D.G. mentioned at the beginning of the call, while the market has remained muted, results have largely played out as expected for the year. With this, we're narrowing our full year 2024 earnings outlook. The narrow guide includes daily organic constant currency sales growth of between 4.5% and 5.25% and a diluted adjusted EPS range of $38.65 to $39.35. The updated revenue outlook implies a fourth quarter 2024 daily organic constant currency growth rate in the mid-single digits, which includes month-to-date growth in October of approximately 6.5%. This preliminary daily organic constant currency sales growth rate for October includes roughly 200 to 250 basis points of hurricane-related sales, meaning normalized month-to-date results are closer to 4% and 4.5%. Our operating margin expectations haven't shifted much from our prior guide. If you were to squeeze the operating margins from the updated annual guide, it implies a seasonal sequential step down in the fourth quarter to just above 15% at the midpoint. Supplemental guidance has also been updated, including an increase of $150 million to our operating cash flow outlook at the midpoint. As a note, we've lowered our full year 2024 tax rate assumption to approximately 23.2% or 80 basis points less than the prior guide, which implies our fourth quarter tax rate somewhere between 20% and 21%. This reflects anticipated favorability in the fourth quarter as we adjust audit reserves from prior year tax returns and execute various tax planning strategies. Full-year foreign exchange rates have also been updated in the revised outlook. Overall, the year has played out largely as expected and our updated earnings guidance remains within the original ranges we communicated at the beginning of the year. We look forward with confidence in finishing the year strong. With that, I'll turn it back to D.G. Good morning. So thanks for the question. And if you look at our cash balance over the quarter, we did increase cash meaningfully, because we closed on our new $500 million bond offering, which we'll use to paydown senior notes early in 2025. And if you pull that to the side, it's important to note that the pace of our cash growth really over several years has been in line with our sales growth. And when you look at the excess cash that we do have and look at our capital allocation strategy, we don't envision any changes to that strategy and we will most likely return that cashback to shareholders in the form of share repo. And if you look at our guide -- updated guide for the end of the year, you can see that represented in that number. Good morning. And the only thing I'd add, Sabrina, is that we still are targeting from the collective investments in demand generation to outgrow the market by 400 to 500 basis points. And as I noted in our prepared remarks, we are in a period where we do have some dislocation versus our headline IP and PPI metrics. However, when we continue to internally test the return on those investments, those investments are still returning as we would expect. And there still is really a lot of noise. I would say if you look at market surveys, other competitive results or other economic data points related to what volume really is, we believe are actually muted and we are performing fairly well versus the competition. So yes, we did take an additional increase in September. As you know, versus where we expected price to be at the beginning of the year versus where it appears it's landing and based upon 70% of our business in High-Touch being contract-related, we've had to kind of chase to catch-up on some of that. And so our goal would be, as you noted, to exit the year price cost neutral and we are in line with that. Now we're right in the midst of our cost cycle with our suppliers heading into 2025. And as D.G. noted, really not ready to disclose where we think that will head, but we do have a philosophy, of course, as a distributor of passing on cost inflation through price to our customers since we sell on value and we don't expect that to change in 2025. Good morning. Yes. Market price, as you noted, has been fairly resilient all year. Now for us, as I kind of talked about in a prior question, we started off the year pricing fairly light versus what has actually occurred and have been pulling through price as appropriate while we're still maintaining price competitiveness. From a volume perspective, I think the market is closer to right there. And if you look at those components, it's like flat to down on volume. And as you can kind of see in the U.S., we have actually grown volume positively. I've been around here for about 11 years and when I looked at IP and PPI over time, you'll get to the next year and it does a really good look-back and makes a lot of corrections. When we look at what D.G. kind of talked about, other surveys or other metrics, it feels like those corrections will be to the downside as we look back at 2024 and that's what all of our data as it relates to our AB testing and a lot of our pre- and post-testing on our investments are telling us. Yes. Maybe I point you to like sequential versus year-over-year. And the price cost, which kind of came up, we were expecting to end the year a positive, mainly due to supplier rebates. That's going to definitely help us. We do have some business unit mix offsets to that and a little bit of freight. But net-net, on a sequential basis going from Q3 2024 to Q4 2024, we do expect to expand gross margins. Since we're not talking about 2025 outlook, like I noted earlier, we're in the midst of our contract negotiations on COGS and of course, watching market pricing. But as D.G. noted, we expect the first quarter or the first half to look a whole lot like we're ending this half and that has been price moderating -- continuing to moderate a bit since we've exited the pandemic. So I don't see it being particularly strong in 2025, but do feel like there will be some price in the market."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Kyle Bland, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nKyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's second quarter earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is included in the company's most recent Form 8-K and other periodic reports filed with the SEC. This morning's call will focus on the adjusted results for the second quarter of 2024, which exclude $16 million of pre-tax restructuring costs incurred in the quarter. Please remember that we have also included a daily organic constant currency sales growth metric within these materials to normalize for the divestiture of our E&R Industrial sales subsidiary, which was sold at the end of 2023. Definitions and full reconciliations of this and any other non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and followed Japanese GAAP, which differs from US GAAP, and as reported in our results one month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ from MonataRO's public statements. Now I'll turn it over to D.G.\nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. As we pass the midpoint of 2024, I'm proud of the way the team continues to show up for our customers, providing a flawless experience on each transaction. Our team members are consistently living the principles outlined by the Grainger Edge and in doing so we become a trusted partner for our customers, creating tangible value each day. One of the best examples of the value that we create for our customers is by simplifying their purchasing processes. Complicated and high-cost purchasing processes are common in our space, wasting our customers' time and money. Fortunately, we are well-equipped to help customers solve this challenge by assisting them in choosing the right digital solution, setting up necessary workflows and approvals and providing systems training to maximize the benefits. Recently, during negotiations on a multiyear agreement, one of our national account managers identified opportunities where our team could help the customer meet their process improvement goals, most notably in streamlining their procurement systems, engage our internal EDI pro team who worked with the customer to connect their purchasing platform to Grainger. Together, through enterprise-wide integration and training, we were able to move nearly all of the customers' MRO transactions to a digital channel, helping them consolidate orders, lower PO processing costs and driving several hundred thousand dollars in annual savings. These process improvements are part of a broader engagement with this customer, we also help them reduce inventory levels and drive product standardization, further saving them time money. This example is just one of many where our team works to understand the customers' operations, tailor our solutions to meet their needs and drive lower cost. Moving on to our second quarter performance. We delivered another solid quarter of results amidst a slow, generally stable demand environment. Total company reported sales were up 3.1% or 5.1% on a daily organic constant currency basis, with positive contributions from both segments. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, we remain focused on our growth engines and delivered tangible value for our customers, resulting in another quarter of solid performance. Within the Endless Assortment business, our focus on gaining new customers and increasing repeat purchase rates is paying off, and we continue to make progress with these initiatives. From a profitability standpoint, total company operating margin of 15.4% remained strong, but as anticipated, was down 40 basis points versus prior year. EPS finished the quarter at $9.76, up 5.2% versus the prior year. Beyond the P&L, we achieved ROIC of 42.6% and operating cash flow remained healthy in quarter, allowing us to return a total of $345 million to Grainger's shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, the business continues to perform well, as we stay focused on the customer and the things that matter. While 2024 is playing out largely as expected, further yen devaluation and continued pockets of demand stops in the U.S. remain as headwinds. With this, we've trimmed the top end of our earnings guidance range, which Dee will discuss in a bit. Now I'll turn it over to, Dee.\nDeidra Merriwether: Thank you, D.G. Turning to Slide 7. You can see the high-level second quarter results for the total company, including 5.1% growth on a daily organic constant currency basis. The quarter played out largely as anticipated, despite the persistent demand softness D.G. mentioned. Operating margins were down 40 basis points year-over-year, generally following normal seasonal trends. Gross margins were flat year-over-year as the number of items offset within the period and SG&A de-levered 40 basis points as we ramp our demand generation investment. In total, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.76, up 5.2% or $0.48 over the prior year period. Moving on to segment level results, the High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well with sales up 3.1% on a reported basis or 3.7% daily organic constant currency basis. Results were driven by strong volume growth and moderate price contribution across all geographies in the period. In the U.S. specifically, nearly all customer end markets were up year-over-year with warehousing, contractors and healthcare customers having the largest gains. For the segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 41.7%, flat versus the prior year. In the quarter, we expanded an unfavorable lap of roughly 40 basis points from the nonrecurring rebate benefit captured in Q2 of 2023, which was offset by several small tailwinds in the current year period. When excluding the unfavorable lap of nonrecurring rebate, price cost was roughly neutral in the quarter. SG&A de-levered 40 basis points in Q2 as DC capacity came online, and we continue to invest in demand-generating activities like marketing and seller head count. Annual merit increases that went live in April were offset by productivity actions and lower variable compensation expense within the period. Overall, it was a solid quarter of growth and profitability for the High-Touch Solutions business. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market, including volume and price grew in quarter between 2.5% and 3%, with price contributing nearly all of the growth. Within our High-Touch Solutions U.S. business, growing at 3.6% organically, our mathematical market outgrowth in the quarter was roughly 100 basis points in total. This includes approximately 300 basis points of volume outgrowth contribution, netted against the continued price tailwinds when comparing our price contribution to PPI. As we said before, there is no perfect way to measure the MRO market, and we're currently in a cycle where the headline PPI and IP metrics don't completely reflect what we're seeing in the MRO specific space. With the differences in product and customer mix, these disconnects happen from time to time and cause short-term noise within our external market share gain calculation. Given the current dislocation we're seeing this year, it's unlikely we will mathematically achieve our market outlook target in 2024. However, we have several different ways, including both internal and external data points to understand our relative performance and know we're performing quite well in the current environment. History would suggest that this dislocation will normalize over a multiyear period and we believe this metric remains useful in tracking our relative performance over time. We're still generating strong returns on our demand-generating investments, which gives us confidence that over the long-term, we will continue to outload the market by 400 basis points to 500 basis points annually on average. Now turning to the Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 3.3% or 11.7% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro US was up 8.7%, with MonotaRO achieving 13.2% in local days local currency. At a business level, Zoro saw improved growth from core B2B customers who were up mid-teens in the quarter. Performance was driven by B2B customer acquisition and improved repeat purchase rates, which were aided by service enhancements to increase same-day shipping and better communicate delivery date. Headlines from the continued unwind of non-core business, including B2C, B2C like volumes started to dissipate in the quarter but remained down low-double-digits year-over-year. We expect these B2C headwinds to continue to subside as the year progresses. At MonotaRO, sales were strong from continued growth with enterprise customers, coupled with solid acquisition and repeat purchase rates with small and midsized businesses. On a reported basis, these results were all offset by continued foreign exchange rate pressures as the yen continues to show incremental weakness against the dollar. On profitability, operating margins for the segment declined 70 basis points to 7.9%. This decline was driven by lower gross margins at MonotaRO from product and customer headwinds, combined with SG&A deleverage at Zoro as the business ramps marketing investments and re-baselines on lower B2C and B2C like volume. As these volumes normalize, this should create a better baseline to relever the business going forward. Overall, for Endless Assortment, we're encouraged by the strong progress in the quarter, and are track to finish the year at or above our original expectations. Now moving to the updated outlook for the remainder of 2024. As D.G. mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are we are trimming the top end of most estimates to reflect continued market softness as macroeconomic uncertainties persist in the US. With this, now expecting total company daily organic constant currency sales to grow between 4% and 6% for the full year of 2024. When including the continued deterioration of the Japanese yen, this translates to an updated reported sales range between $17 billion and $17.3 billion and an EPS range between $38 and $39.50. As you can see on this slide, we flow these changes through and have also made slight tweaks to the margin outlook based upon how we're performing in the first half. I want to note, while we continue to remain diligent on managing expenses and measuring returns, given the softer top-line, our ability to generate leverage is challenged this year as we invest in our growth engines to power long-term share gain. Setting that aside, we remain strongly committed to growing SG&A slower than sales over time and have a track record of doing so. Supplemental guidance ranges, including increased operating cash flow and share repurchase expectations can be found in the appendix of this presentation. On seasonality, as we move to the second half of the year, we expect relatively normal sequential growth from Q2 to Q3 and into the fourth quarter. There are some puts and takes from a profitability perspective, but we anticipate operating margins and earnings to remain healthy and relatively consistent in the third quarter when compared to the second. As we start the third quarter, a number of external factors have impacted our results in July. The sales started to ramp in the final few days of the month. This led preliminary July sales results to finish up roughly 2% on the total company daily organic constant currency basis. Of note, this number will be approximately 100 basis points higher if you normalize for the tough comp caused by an elevated level of project-related service engagement in July of last year. Altogether, at the total company level, we're performing well and are confident in our ability to drive solid growth and strong profitability in the second half of the year. With that, I'll pass it back to D.G.\nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, Dee. As we head into the second half of 2024, a number of macroeconomic uncertainties remain ahead, but our teams are committed to focusing on what matters most, meeting our customers' needs and creating value for their business. We know that our ability to serve our customers better than our competitors relies on having a strong culture where team members can have a meaningful and fulfilling career. Among several other recognitions this year, Grainger was recently named the best workplace for millennials. These awards are a testament to the well-rounded culture we've built to help us fulfill our purpose. I'm confident that Grainger will continue to be recognized as an employer of choice because of the emphasis we put on living our principles. One of those principles, starting with the customer, it's key to achieving great results for all stakeholders. And I'm confident that we will continue do that in 2024 and for years to come. And with that, we will open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. Please proceed.\nTommy Moll: Good morning and thank you taking my questions.\nDonald Macpherson: Good morning.\nTommy Moll: I wanted to start on the High-Touch business, where once again, the midsized customers outgrew the large. And my question is really, how much do you think this is a function of share gain versus some other factor? How important to the midsized customers is the digital capability versus that level of importance for the larger customers? And what do you think the runway is ahead on these favorable trends for the midsize? Thank you.\nDonald Macpherson: Yes. Thanks, Tommy. I think most -- almost all of the growth in midsize customer and the outgrowth would be share gain. The reality is that -- and I think most people know the story. We, at one point, we're close to $2 billion in revenue. We got down to $800 million. We're back up to where we were. We think there's a long runway ahead. We believe that the digital capabilities we've built and the customer and product information assets we built help us with midsized customers significantly. And so really, we think it's what we're doing to build relationships with them through digital capabilities, a lot of those customers when you look at how they buy, start digital and that's their main channel.\nTommy Moll: Shifting gears. D.G., last quarter, you referenced inflation being stickier than expected and talked about some corrective price actions slated for early May. I'm just curious for an update there, how is realization. And do you still think you'll land and price cost neutrality by the end of this year? Thanks.\nDonald Macpherson: Yeah. Yeah. We do believe we'll land in price cost neutrality by the end of the year, the price realization the realization of the pricing actions on May 1st have been basically as expected. We talked about at the beginning of the year we were a little bit behind on price increases. We are making some of that up as the year progresses. And notably, gross profit remains strong. So we are not concerned about ending the year as we expect.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dave Manthey with Baird. Please proceed.\nDave Manthey: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning everyone. You may have mentioned this, but June average daily sales running up $7 million after sort of $4 million to $5 million all years? Is there anything we can read into that? And again, I apologize if you mentioned it, but did you make any comments on the trends in July so far?\nDeidra Merriwether: Yeah. On the reported remarks, we noted that preliminarily, July is rolling up around 2%. However, if you recall, we believe if you normalize for some project-related service revenue outside, project-related service revenue we had last year, that would -- that would put us north of 3% for July.\nDave Manthey: Okay. Thank you.\nDonald Macpherson: I would just say that, Dave, that I think that June, July, the differences are probably noise. We actually don't think there's -- we look at daily run rates, we are concerned about anything, and there's nothing that I would say that would necessarily cause us other than noise.\nDave Manthey: Yeah, makes sense. Thank you for that. And then, I know other international is small, but we're talking $300 million drag on overall profitability, maybe a distraction, I don't know, could you update us on the other international operations and what you're targeting there medium-term?\nDeidra Merriwether: Yeah. The majority of that is Cromwell plus some other charges and other. But the Cromwell business has been working towards profitability. And if you recall, our results last year, they exited the year profitable. And they continue to see profitability this year. Now in this quarter, they had a little bit of a challenge with some gross margin related to customer mix, but we expect them to end this year profitable as well. And we feel like the U.K. is an important market for us. And we just -- with Brexit and some other challenges over the last couple of years has kind of delayed some of our strategic plans in that business. But that we feel that business is doing really well and have outgrown the market the last six quarters.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed.\nRyan Merkel: Hey everyone. I wanted to go back to pricing. What do you expect for 2024 now? And any more color you can provide on the May and September increases? Was that on specific products or was that across the board?\nDonald Macpherson: So I guess what I'd say is we follow two tenants. We want to make sure that we are priced competitively, and we want to make sure that over time, we're shooting for price/cost neutrality. I think we will do that this year. Our price increases this year will be modest overall. Our cost increases will be modest overall on product cost. But we are making adjustments both at May 1 and September 1, and those adjustments aren't meaningful in aggregate, we would expect to be in that 1% range that we talked about roughly at the beginning of the year, 1% to 2%.\nDeidra Merriwether: 1% to 2%, yes.\nRyan Merkel: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And then just back to the macro, D.G., any factors you would point out that caused you to lower the second half or maybe just rank the things that drove that? And generally, what are you hearing from customers about the outlook?\nDonald Macpherson: Yeah. I think what we're seeing is what everybody is saying, if you look at sort of the general demand environment, it's pretty slow. It's consistent, though, there's not a lot of panic. There are certain industries that have had significant challenges this year, pockets of automotive, pockets of other. I won't get into too many details about those, but certainly, there are -- there are pockets of weakness that have been significant and some pockets of strength. And I think that just continues to be the case. We expect -- I think we came in thinking that volume this year would be flat in our market, roughly something like that, and it's probably going to be down 1 now. So that's probably given what we've seen. That's probably the biggest change we have in our projections.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jacob Levinson with Melius Research. Please proceed.\nJacob Levinson: Good morning, everyone.\nDonald Macpherson: Good morning, Jake.\nJacob Levinson: On the marketing investment, I know you guys have a tight feedback loop there and understanding where to push the accelerator or not. But is that spend something that you would look to actually flex up in sort of a swapper macro environment? Or is it really not demand dependent, if you will?\nDonald Macpherson: So the way we measure marketing, we look at -- we run tests all the time. And that guides us on how much to spend. So you could argue that in certain macro environment, those tests might show different results. But in general, that's not going to change how we think about spending. We're spending to levels that give us a margin return that we expect. And none of that's changed and I wouldn't expect that to change through time.\nJacob Levinson: Okay. That makes sense. And then just on the distribution investments that you're making that's been pretty well telegraphed back at your Analyst Day a few years ago. Can you just help us understand where you are in that cycle? And maybe just give us a sense of maybe what the utilization rates look like today in your network.\nDonald Macpherson: Yeah. We're -- the network is pretty busy, I'd say. We probably -- I think we talked about this in 2022. We were probably a bit behind. It was difficult to actually build anything during the pandemic to get materials and finished things. We have remedied some of that situation, we've put in three new bulk warehouses, the building in the Northwest, the shell the building is up and we will start receiving by end of this year, and start shipping next year. We have a building in Houston. That is just land now, but that's going to go up as well. So we've talked about those two and announced those two buildings. I would say that the biggest bulge in capital right now, we would project would be probably next year as we finish those two buildings out and then we expect to be in probably more normal times after that and being a little bit better shape from capacity perspective. But yeah the plan has just been executed exactly, as we expected and timing that we haven't changed on any of that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nJeff Reive: This is Jeff Reive on for Deane. My first question is on the Endless Assortment segment, pretty nice organic growth this quarter. I know one of your peers had some eCommerce stumbles recently. Curious if, you're winning share there or if that may be created an opportunity to do so?\nDonald Macpherson: I wouldn't necessarily tag what happens to us to any specific competitor. The market is quite big, that Zoro in the U.S. plays in. I think what's happened with us, is we've gotten much better at getting better repeat rates, and we've been able to get better acquisition also this year. So the two things we focus on have gone better, but I wouldn't tag it to any competitor.\nJeff Reive: Got it. And then, just on guidance, the kind of turning the high end. I think you called out kind of the weaker macro and yen devaluation. If you had to kind of peg it percentage to each of those buckets, kind of how should we think about it?\nDeidra Merriwether: Can you repeat that? I'm trying to make sure, I'm following your question around guidance.\nJeff Reive: Yes. Yes. So you trimmed guidance and basically called out, it's a combination of a weaker macro and then also the yen devaluation. I was curious if you could just kind of point to kind of give a percentage to each one into the kind of the reason behind the trimming of the guidance.\nDeidra Merriwether: Okay. Yeah.\nJeff Reive: Is it more macro, is it more yen? Yeah.\nDeidra Merriwether: Okay, so more macro, so probably two-thirds macro and probably a third yen.\nOperator: Our next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nChristopher Glynn: Thanks. Yeah, just Slide 19, you show the verticals for HTs and really pretty remarkable balance across there with just a couple of flat, everything else up was curious about the double-digit categories, warehousing and other and then contract are up high-single digits. I think there is a bit of a grab bag, but those numbers for those sectors seem a little incongruous with general macro, so curious, if you could opine there.\nDonald Macpherson: Yeah. I mean, so for contractors, in particular, I'd also make a point that we're pretty small. So we start with a pretty small base. So I'm not sure that you can compare that to what's going on in the broader market. Warehousing, there's some comparisons to last year with some customers that are positive right now that's driving that. I wouldn't read too much into those just to be fair. I think that we're performing fairly consistently across the segments and then you have sort of in-year impacts that are a little unusual into the [indiscernible].\nChristopher Glynn: Okay. And then, second question is on Zoro. Could we get an update on the path to margins? Clearly, demand Gen is going very well there back to mid-teens for the B2B, but kind of low single-digit margins. How should we maybe just want to revisit the path there to get to target margins?\nDonald Macpherson: Yeah. What I would say is that, probably low point, it was probably fourth quarter was last end of last year. We think from now on, we're going to get better consistently, and we'll be able to get SG&A leverage as we move forward given the growth rates we're seeing. So, it will start to get better through the back half of this year and we think into next year as well. And so we're pretty confident that we'll start the rise. It's not going to be fast. It's going to be very consistent in terms of getting improved margins into the business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nPatrick Baumann: Good morning. Quick one maybe for Dee. Can you talk about the external factors that you mentioned impacting the July growth rate. And you mentioned a ramp back toward the end of the month and something about sequential growth from second quarter to the third quarter, but my line cut out. So just wondering if you could rehash what you were saying on that.\nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. Well, if you look at just July, you're talking about July now and not the prior quarter, right? When we started this month, the month started a little sell. There were a number of things that happened. There was some weather-related impacts that didn't go in our favor. There was also a well-known IT outage that impacted a number of our customers as we cover a lot of people in the US. And then there was just some general holiday softness. This is really unique because a lot of it happened around the same time. So really, really hard to measure. I'll say the good news is the last week of the month has been -- was really strong for us. And so that is a good sign. So those were some of the impacts that we noted on a go-forward basis. I think you're asking the next question sequentially. Sequential sales, am I correct from like this quarter to the next. If you look at that from a top line perspective, we expect that to be reasonably consistent Q2 to Q3 and through the fourth quarter. And then as it relates to some of our other metrics from a sequential perspective, we're expecting profitability sequential growth from the revenue number that I just talked about. We expect profitability there's going to be some puts and takes there, but we anticipate operating margins and EPS to also remain relatively consistent through the balance of the year.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay. And then I may have missed, but did you talk about the restructuring you did in the quarter? Was it just kind of what was it? And what is the expected benefit from it? Is there more to come in terms of the restructuring? Or was it kind of isolated just to the second quarter?\nDeidra Merriwether: Sure. As we've talked about making sure that we could continue to invest in cycle to ensure that we have long-term share gain. A part of that is making sure that we're paying for some of those investments through productivity actions. And so our entire business really focused on continuous improvement and looking at how we can drive productivity. So a lot of those actions were focused on voluntary actions with team members and that happened both in the US and internationally quite a bit. We see that as a onetime specific incident. However, our focus on continuous improvement is longer term. And we -- in doing those things, we are gaining scale on our non-demand generating expenses, and we expect that to continue through the cycle as we continue to invest in demand generation.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to D.G. for closing remarks.\nDonald Macpherson: All right. Thanks for joining us. It must be a busy day because we didn't get them as many questions as normal. But I appreciate you joining. And I would just reiterate that we are -- we feel really good about where we're at. We're going to continue to invest in the core capabilities that we need to build to make sure that we can serve customers better than our competitors. That's really what we're focused on. And we're also focused, as Dee said, on driving productivity through the business. We think doing both of those things at the same time is absolutely critical for our long-term success. So, I hope you enjoy the rest of your summer, and thanks. Thanks for joining our call.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Kyle. Good morning, and thank you for joining the call. As we pass the midpoint of 2024, I'm proud of the way the team continues to show up for our customers, providing a flawless experience on each transaction. Our team members are consistently living the principles outlined by the Grainger Edge and in doing so we become a trusted partner for our customers, creating tangible value each day. One of the best examples of the value that we create for our customers is by simplifying their purchasing processes. Complicated and high-cost purchasing processes are common in our space, wasting our customers' time and money. Fortunately, we are well-equipped to help customers solve this challenge by assisting them in choosing the right digital solution, setting up necessary workflows and approvals and providing systems training to maximize the benefits. Recently, during negotiations on a multiyear agreement, one of our national account managers identified opportunities where our team could help the customer meet their process improvement goals, most notably in streamlining their procurement systems, engage our internal EDI pro team who worked with the customer to connect their purchasing platform to Grainger. Together, through enterprise-wide integration and training, we were able to move nearly all of the customers' MRO transactions to a digital channel, helping them consolidate orders, lower PO processing costs and driving several hundred thousand dollars in annual savings. These process improvements are part of a broader engagement with this customer, we also help them reduce inventory levels and drive product standardization, further saving them time money. This example is just one of many where our team works to understand the customers' operations, tailor our solutions to meet their needs and drive lower cost. Moving on to our second quarter performance. We delivered another solid quarter of results amidst a slow, generally stable demand environment. Total company reported sales were up 3.1% or 5.1% on a daily organic constant currency basis, with positive contributions from both segments. In the High-Touch Solutions segment, we remain focused on our growth engines and delivered tangible value for our customers, resulting in another quarter of solid performance. Within the Endless Assortment business, our focus on gaining new customers and increasing repeat purchase rates is paying off, and we continue to make progress with these initiatives. From a profitability standpoint, total company operating margin of 15.4% remained strong, but as anticipated, was down 40 basis points versus prior year. EPS finished the quarter at $9.76, up 5.2% versus the prior year. Beyond the P&L, we achieved ROIC of 42.6% and operating cash flow remained healthy in quarter, allowing us to return a total of $345 million to Grainger's shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Overall, the business continues to perform well, as we stay focused on the customer and the things that matter. While 2024 is playing out largely as expected, further yen devaluation and continued pockets of demand stops in the U.S. remain as headwinds. With this, we've trimmed the top end of our earnings guidance range, which Dee will discuss in a bit. Now I'll turn it over to, Dee. Thanks, Dee. As we head into the second half of 2024, a number of macroeconomic uncertainties remain ahead, but our teams are committed to focusing on what matters most, meeting our customers' needs and creating value for their business. We know that our ability to serve our customers better than our competitors relies on having a strong culture where team members can have a meaningful and fulfilling career. Among several other recognitions this year, Grainger was recently named the best workplace for millennials. These awards are a testament to the well-rounded culture we've built to help us fulfill our purpose. I'm confident that Grainger will continue to be recognized as an employer of choice because of the emphasis we put on living our principles. One of those principles, starting with the customer, it's key to achieving great results for all stakeholders. And I'm confident that we will continue do that in 2024 and for years to come. And with that, we will open the line for questions. Good morning. Yes. Thanks, Tommy. I think most -- almost all of the growth in midsize customer and the outgrowth would be share gain. The reality is that -- and I think most people know the story. We, at one point, we're close to $2 billion in revenue. We got down to $800 million. We're back up to where we were. We think there's a long runway ahead. We believe that the digital capabilities we've built and the customer and product information assets we built help us with midsized customers significantly. And so really, we think it's what we're doing to build relationships with them through digital capabilities, a lot of those customers when you look at how they buy, start digital and that's their main channel. Yeah. Yeah. We do believe we'll land in price cost neutrality by the end of the year, the price realization the realization of the pricing actions on May 1st have been basically as expected. We talked about at the beginning of the year we were a little bit behind on price increases. We are making some of that up as the year progresses. And notably, gross profit remains strong. So we are not concerned about ending the year as we expect. I would just say that, Dave, that I think that June, July, the differences are probably noise. We actually don't think there's -- we look at daily run rates, we are concerned about anything, and there's nothing that I would say that would necessarily cause us other than noise. So I guess what I'd say is we follow two tenants. We want to make sure that we are priced competitively, and we want to make sure that over time, we're shooting for price/cost neutrality.

            "name": "Deidra Merriwether",
            "content": "Thank you, D.G. Turning to Slide 7. You can see the high-level second quarter results for the total company, including 5.1% growth on a daily organic constant currency basis. The quarter played out largely as anticipated, despite the persistent demand softness D.G. mentioned. Operating margins were down 40 basis points year-over-year, generally following normal seasonal trends. Gross margins were flat year-over-year as the number of items offset within the period and SG&A de-levered 40 basis points as we ramp our demand generation investment. In total, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.76, up 5.2% or $0.48 over the prior year period. Moving on to segment level results, the High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well with sales up 3.1% on a reported basis or 3.7% daily organic constant currency basis. Results were driven by strong volume growth and moderate price contribution across all geographies in the period. In the U.S. specifically, nearly all customer end markets were up year-over-year with warehousing, contractors and healthcare customers having the largest gains. For the segment, gross profit margin finished the quarter at 41.7%, flat versus the prior year. In the quarter, we expanded an unfavorable lap of roughly 40 basis points from the nonrecurring rebate benefit captured in Q2 of 2023, which was offset by several small tailwinds in the current year period. When excluding the unfavorable lap of nonrecurring rebate, price cost was roughly neutral in the quarter. SG&A de-levered 40 basis points in Q2 as DC capacity came online, and we continue to invest in demand-generating activities like marketing and seller head count. Annual merit increases that went live in April were offset by productivity actions and lower variable compensation expense within the period. Overall, it was a solid quarter of growth and profitability for the High-Touch Solutions business. Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9, we estimate that the U.S. MRO market, including volume and price grew in quarter between 2.5% and 3%, with price contributing nearly all of the growth. Within our High-Touch Solutions U.S. business, growing at 3.6% organically, our mathematical market outgrowth in the quarter was roughly 100 basis points in total. This includes approximately 300 basis points of volume outgrowth contribution, netted against the continued price tailwinds when comparing our price contribution to PPI. As we said before, there is no perfect way to measure the MRO market, and we're currently in a cycle where the headline PPI and IP metrics don't completely reflect what we're seeing in the MRO specific space. With the differences in product and customer mix, these disconnects happen from time to time and cause short-term noise within our external market share gain calculation. Given the current dislocation we're seeing this year, it's unlikely we will mathematically achieve our market outlook target in 2024. However, we have several different ways, including both internal and external data points to understand our relative performance and know we're performing quite well in the current environment. History would suggest that this dislocation will normalize over a multiyear period and we believe this metric remains useful in tracking our relative performance over time. We're still generating strong returns on our demand-generating investments, which gives us confidence that over the long-term, we will continue to outload the market by 400 basis points to 500 basis points annually on average. Now turning to the Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 3.3% or 11.7% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro US was up 8.7%, with MonotaRO achieving 13.2% in local days local currency. At a business level, Zoro saw improved growth from core B2B customers who were up mid-teens in the quarter. Performance was driven by B2B customer acquisition and improved repeat purchase rates, which were aided by service enhancements to increase same-day shipping and better communicate delivery date. Headlines from the continued unwind of non-core business, including B2C, B2C like volumes started to dissipate in the quarter but remained down low-double-digits year-over-year. We expect these B2C headwinds to continue to subside as the year progresses. At MonotaRO, sales were strong from continued growth with enterprise customers, coupled with solid acquisition and repeat purchase rates with small and midsized businesses. On a reported basis, these results were all offset by continued foreign exchange rate pressures as the yen continues to show incremental weakness against the dollar. On profitability, operating margins for the segment declined 70 basis points to 7.9%. This decline was driven by lower gross margins at MonotaRO from product and customer headwinds, combined with SG&A deleverage at Zoro as the business ramps marketing investments and re-baselines on lower B2C and B2C like volume. As these volumes normalize, this should create a better baseline to relever the business going forward. Overall, for Endless Assortment, we're encouraged by the strong progress in the quarter, and are track to finish the year at or above our original expectations. Now moving to the updated outlook for the remainder of 2024. As D.G. mentioned at the beginning of the call, we are we are trimming the top end of most estimates to reflect continued market softness as macroeconomic uncertainties persist in the US. With this, now expecting total company daily organic constant currency sales to grow between 4% and 6% for the full year of 2024. When including the continued deterioration of the Japanese yen, this translates to an updated reported sales range between $17 billion and $17.3 billion and an EPS range between $38 and $39.50. As you can see on this slide, we flow these changes through and have also made slight tweaks to the margin outlook based upon how we're performing in the first half. I want to note, while we continue to remain diligent on managing expenses and measuring returns, given the softer top-line, our ability to generate leverage is challenged this year as we invest in our growth engines to power long-term share gain. Setting that aside, we remain strongly committed to growing SG&A slower than sales over time and have a track record of doing so. Supplemental guidance ranges, including increased operating cash flow and share repurchase expectations can be found in the appendix of this presentation. On seasonality, as we move to the second half of the year, we expect relatively normal sequential growth from Q2 to Q3 and into the fourth quarter. There are some puts and takes from a profitability perspective, but we anticipate operating margins and earnings to remain healthy and relatively consistent in the third quarter when compared to the second. As we start the third quarter, a number of external factors have impacted our results in July. The sales started to ramp in the final few days of the month. This led preliminary July sales results to finish up roughly 2% on the total company daily organic constant currency basis. Of note, this number will be approximately 100 basis points higher if you normalize for the tough comp caused by an elevated level of project-related service engagement in July of last year. Altogether, at the total company level, we're performing well and are confident in our ability to drive solid growth and strong profitability in the second half of the year. With that, I'll pass it back to D.G. Yeah. On the reported remarks, we noted that preliminarily, July is rolling up around 2%. However, if you recall, we believe if you normalize for some project-related service revenue outside, project-related service revenue we had last year, that would -- that would put us north of 3% for July. Yeah. The majority of that is Cromwell plus some other charges and other. But the Cromwell business has been working towards profitability. And if you recall, our results last year, they exited the year profitable. And they continue to see profitability this year. Now in this quarter, they had a little bit of a challenge with some gross margin related to customer mix, but we expect them to end this year profitable as well. And we feel like the U.K. is an important market for us. And we just -- with Brexit and some other challenges over the last couple of years has kind of delayed some of our strategic plans in that business. But that we feel that business is doing really well and have outgrown the market the last six quarters. 1% to 2%, yes. Can you repeat that? I'm trying to make sure, I'm following your question around guidance. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so more macro, so probably two-thirds macro and probably a third yen. Yes. Well, if you look at just July, you're talking about July now and not the prior quarter, right? When we started this month, the month started a little sell. There were a number of things that happened. There was some weather-related impacts that didn't go in our favor. There was also a well-known IT outage that impacted a number of our customers as we cover a lot of people in the US. And then there was just some general holiday softness. This is really unique because a lot of it happened around the same time. So really, really hard to measure. I'll say the good news is the last week of the month has been -- was really strong for us. And so that is a good sign. So those were some of the impacts that we noted on a go-forward basis. I think you're asking the next question sequentially. Sequential sales, am I correct from like this quarter to the next. If you look at that from a top line perspective, we expect that to be reasonably consistent Q2 to Q3 and through the fourth quarter. And then as it relates to some of our other metrics from a sequential perspective, we're expecting profitability sequential growth from the revenue number that I just talked about. We expect profitability there's going to be some puts and takes there, but we anticipate operating margins and EPS to also remain relatively consistent through the balance of the year. Sure. As we've talked about making sure that we could continue to invest in cycle to ensure that we have long-term share gain. A part of that is making sure that we're paying for some of those investments through productivity actions. And so our entire business really focused on continuous improvement and looking at how we can drive productivity. So a lot of those actions were focused on voluntary actions with team members and that happened both in the US and internationally quite a bit. We see that as a onetime specific incident. However, our focus on continuous improvement is longer term. And we -- in doing those things, we are gaining scale on our non-demand generating expenses, and we expect that to continue through the cycle as we continue to invest in demand generation."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\n I will now turn the conference over to Kyle Bland, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. \nKyle Bland: Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's first quarter earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Dee Merriwether, Senior Vice President and CFO.\n As a reminder, some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is included in the company's most recent Form 8-K and other periodic reports filed with the SEC.\n This morning's call will focus on results for the first quarter of 2024, which are consistent on both a reported and adjusted basis. As a reminder, we have included a daily organic constant currency sales growth metric within these materials to normalize for the divestiture of our E&R Industrial Sales subsidiary, which was sold at the end of 2023.\n Definitions and full reconciliations of this and any other non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables at the end of this presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on our IR website. We will also share results related to MonotaRO. Please remember that MonotaRO was a public company and followed Japanese GAAP, which differs from U.S. GAAP and is reported in our results 1 month in arrears. As a result, the numbers disclosed will differ from MonotaRO's public statements.\n With that, I'll turn it over to D.G. \nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thanks for joining the call. 2024 started well. As we remain grounded in the Grainger Edge, we are focused on starting with the customer and staying focused on what matters most. I've seen this play out in several ways throughout the quarter.\n In February, we hosted the Grainger Show in Orlando. Over 10,000 of our customers, suppliers and team members came together to showcase the products and solutions that Grainger offers. It remains a great opportunity to work together with our partners to solve customer problems. We've received great feedback on progress since the event.\n I've also had the opportunity to meet with a diverse set of customers from many industries. It has been great to see how the Grainger team continues to deliver value and further embed into our customers' operations. During a recent visit to a musical instrument manufacturer, I had the chance to see how our team partnered with the customer to help them standardize their product portfolio to lower cost and improve efficiency. This included leveraging our strong supplier relationships and expanding our KeepStock solution to ensure they have the right products in the right locations.\n I also spent time with a large public health system, which is in the process of building a new hospital. Throughout the project, we supported their operations as they transition to the new facility, ensuring products remain readily accessible across the campus. By supporting this customer throughout the significant change, we deepened their trust in Grainger and allowed them to focus on their area of expertise, patient care, while we took care of their MRO needs.\n Across all my visits, it's clear that we continue to show up well for our customers. Based on what I've seen, while each industry dynamic is different, overall demand for MRO products has remained soft but generally steady to start the year. Inflation remains a talking point with customers and suppliers and is turning out to be stickier than we had originally anticipated heading into 2024. Dee will provide details in a bit.\n Moving on to our first quarter performance. You can see we started the year largely as expected, delivering another year solid -- another quarter of solid results. Total company sales were up 3.5% or 4.9% on a daily organic constant currency basis with positive contributions from both segments. In High-Touch Solutions, we continue to advance our 5 key growth engines as we leverage our technology and data assets to unlock further value for customers.\n Within the Endless Assortment business, we remain focused on acquiring new customers and improving repeat purchase rates across the segment, and we made solid progress here in the quarter.\n From a profitability standpoint, total company operating margin was down as anticipated to 15.8%, a decrease of 80 basis points over the prior year. EPS finished the quarter roughly flat versus prior year at $9.62.\n Beyond the P&L, ROIC remained strong at 42.9%, and operating cash flow finished at record levels, which allowed us to return a total of $360 million to Grainger shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n Lastly, I want to mention that yesterday, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the 53rd consecutive year of expected dividend increases, something we are very proud of. In addition, the Board refreshed our repurchase authorization, enabling the buyback of up to 5 million shares of common stock. These combined actions reflect our continued commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a balanced and return-focused approach.\n Overall, 2024 started off largely as expected, and the business continues to perform well. With this, we are reiterating our full year 2024 guidance. We are set up to have a strong year results for all stakeholders.\n I'll now pass it to Dee to go through the details. \nDeidra Merriwether: Thanks, D.G. On Slide 7, you can see the high-level results for the total company, including 4.9% growth on the daily organic constant currency basis.\n The quarter played out as anticipated despite tough comps, continued rebaselining of the Endless Assortment business and impact from holiday timing in the period. Operating margins were down 80 basis points year-over-year, finished largely as expected in the quarter. Gross margins were lower by 50 basis points as we lapped outsized favorability in the prior year period, and SG&A delevered 30 basis points as we ramp demand-generating investments to drive long-term, profitable share gain. In total, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.62, up $0.01 over the prior year period and in line with our expectations to start the year.\n Moving on to segment-level results. The High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well with sales up 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.8% on a daily organic constant currency basis. Volume growth remained strong, which offset a slight contraction in price due to timing. All geographies saw growth in the period.\n In the first quarter, the U.S. continued to see strong growth with contractors, government and health care customers. This growth offsets slowing demand in other end markets, including manufacturing and commercial services as well as the impact from holiday timing. Overall, demand remained soft but largely unchanged over the last few quarters.\n For the segment, gross profit finished the quarter at 41.8%, improving sequentially but below normal seasonality amidst a more muted pricing backdrop. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was down 60 basis points primarily due to the timing of price/cost spread along with the lap of a 20 basis point onetime favorable freight adjustment in the prior year. These headwinds were partially offset by continued freight and supply chain efficiencies, which began in the first quarter of 2023 and are now fully normalized.\n While the quarter finished in line with our expectations on the gross margin in total, we were a little more price/cost negative than anticipated as the timing of price and cost is never perfect. As the year progresses, we expect price/cost spread will recover and finish the year closer to neutral.\n SG&A delevered 40 basis points as we continue to invest in our demand-generating growth engines, including marketing and store head count. We will continue to stay disciplined with our spending and rigorous and understanding cause and effect, but feel it's prudent to invest through the cycle to gain share over the long term. Overall, these results position us well for another strong year within the high-touch segment.\n Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9. We estimate that the U.S. MRO market, including volume and price, grew in the quarter between 2% and 3%, nearly all from continued price inflation. This indicates that the High-Touch Solutions U.S. business achieved roughly 150 basis points of market outgrowth in the first quarter in total.\n Similar to last quarter, this more muted quarterly outgrowth reflects the higher PPI-based price inflation in Grainger's [ first ] quarter price contribution. As we mentioned in the past, there is no perfect market for our business, and we're comparing a broader external metric of inflation to our MRO product mix. There can be noise, especially in quarterly periods.\n That being said, as D.G. alluded earlier, inflation has been stickier than we originally anticipated, and we're taking some corrective actions in the second quarter to ensure we adhere to our 2 core pricing tenets: maintaining market [ driven ] prices while ensuring price/cost neutrality over time.\n Importantly, on a pure volume basis, we're looking at our volume contributions versus the growth in industrial production. Our volume outgrowth is closer to 450 basis points, reflecting continued strong performance for our high-touch growth engine.\n Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 3.7% or 10% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 5.1%, while MonotaRo achieved 13.1% growth in local days, local currency.\n At a business level, Zoro saw continued strong growth from B2B customers who remained up year-over-year in the high single digits. This helped offset continued declines with noncore B2C and B2C-light customers, which were down double digits year-over-year. We expect these B2C headwinds to subside as the year progresses.\n At MonotaRO, sales were strong from continued growth with enterprise customers, coupled with solid repeat purchase rates within their core B2B customer base. On a reported basis, however, these strong results are nearly all offset by continued foreign exchange rate pressures as the yen sinks to near all-time lows versus the dollar.\n Operating margins for the segment declined 20 basis points to 7.9% largely driven by gross margin favorability at MonotaRO from freight and supply chain efficiencies, which were more than offset by negative mix at Zoro as gross margins continue to normalize following the last few years of inflation. Overall, it was a good quarter for the Endless Assortment business.\n Now an update on the remainder of the year. Overall, we said Q1 played out much as we expected, and results aligned well within the guidance ranges we laid out at the beginning of the year. This has continued into April with daily organic constant currency sales up 5.7% month-to-date. This gives us confidence to reiterate our current year -- our current full year 2024 guidance, which includes daily organic constant currency sales growth between 4% and 7% and EPS ranging between $38 and $40.50, up roughly 7% at the midpoint.\n On seasonality, top line comps get easier as we move through the year. Operating margin will dip down sequentially in the second quarter as gross margin moderated slightly, and SG&A leverage declines as merit increases go into effect and marketing investments continue to ramp. With that, we expect modest year-over-year EPS growth in the second quarter with earnings ramping from there in Q3 and Q4.\n Although we are maintaining our guidance ranges, I do want to call out the increasing headwind we're seeing from foreign exchange rates. As it stands today, the dollar to yen spot rate sits roughly at 1.55, well above the 1.44 we originally planned in January and still assumed in our current guidance. If rates remain at these elevated levels, this would cause roughly $140 million incremental headwind to our full year 2024 reported net sales guidance at an approximate $0.13 decrease to annual EPS.\n Overall, we're pleased with how the business is performing and remain confident in holding expectations for the year.\n With that, I'll pass it back to D.G. \nDonald Macpherson: Thanks, Dee. Grainger's ongoing success is made possible by our people. And I'm fortunate that I'm routinely able to spend time with our frontline team members. And it's clear that they are deeply connected to our customers, working side by side to help solve their most challenging problems. I believe this commitment to our customers is because of the emphasis we put on building a culture where every team member knows that they can make a difference.\n Earlier this month, Grainger was named to Fortune's Best Place -- Workplaces in 2024 for the third consecutive year. This is an exclusive recognition that honors companies with the best cultures and people, which is a perfect way to describe what we have at Grainger. I'm confident the team will continue to keep working towards our goals and delivering on the things that matter most for our customers, team members and all stakeholders in 2024 and beyond.\n With that, we will open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Manthey with Baird. \nQuinn Fredrickson: This is Quinn Fredrickson on for Dave. First, can you update us on -- you made some comments about taking some pricing actions. I think before you were saying 0% to 1% price in High-Touch this year. Can you update us on that? And then just any gross margin implications from here? \nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So I'll provide a few comments, and then Dee can provide any details. So as you mentioned, inflation has been a bit stickier than we expected. Originally, we thought inflation would be 0% to 1%. It's likely to be 1% to 2% at this point. That outlook is lower than the headline PPI index because our industry-specific factors are different than the PPI index, and that difference has contributed to lower market outgrowth the last few quarters. And we do see these short-term disconnects from time to time. We saw it in 2022 as well. But they smooth out over time.\n We are a little late to judge the increase in prices this year. And so we are taking action 5/1. We price a 5/1 cycle, and that cycle is going to correct -- make some corrections. I think that's well in motion, and that's already basically executed and will start happening next week.\n I think, importantly, when you strip out the lumpiness from pricing, our volume outgrowth has been very good, something like 400-plus basis points. So we continue to see nice volume growth. And we think the pricing will correct. It's just a timing thing. \nQuinn Fredrickson: That's helpful, D.G. Maybe on the Endless Assortment segment. Any color you can share just on that, the B2C portion? I guess, are you seeing that kind of progressed as you would expect and still anticipating that inflecting positively in the back half of the year? And then, obviously, you reported that 10% segment growth even in spite of that. So any change to the 7% to 10% constant currency growth assumption for the year? \nDonald Macpherson: No, we don't have any change. I think we will still have a bit of a headwind for consumers, B2C and B2C-light customers through the second quarter. We think that will go away as the year moves on, and that could become a positive. But generally, that's all built into the 7% to 10%. \nOperator: Our next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: So obviously, the yen is fairly small in the scheme of things, to be honest with you, but I'm curious how that impacts potentially MonotaRO's margins. Because I understand a fair amount of the product is imported into Japan from China and places so. Does that have any impact from a transactional basis as opposed to just translational? What is that $0.13, Dee? Does that cover both transactional and translational? \nDeidra Merriwether: So yes, I'll start with the first part of your question. So the majority of MonotaRO's COGS are in the end. They do have some U.S.-denominated, but it's a much smaller portion of their COGS. And they've done a really nice job over the last several years of being able to pass on inflation through price to account for the disaggregation between the yen and the dollar.\n As it relates to -- I think you kind of talked about when we then consolidate the business, you have the tax effect that impacts us. And then we just end up really with [ one ] to eliminate noncontrolling interest, just have the translation risk. And we generally, from a philosophical perspective, don't attempt to hedge translation risk because it's not real economic risk for us. \nNigel Coe: Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just to tie boon in the second quarter kind of color, I guess. It seems like sales growth might be a little bit better year-over-year. Perhaps, margins a bit more contraction year-over-year than 1Q. How does price/cost look in 2Q versus 1Q in light of the pricing actions? And maybe just talk about how that price/cost develops from 1Q to 2Q. I know there's a lot there, but any more color on 2Q would be helpful. \nDeidra Merriwether: Sure. Yes. I think the first 2 statements you made were correct. And as we look at the balance of the year, starting in the second quarter with the actions that D.G. noted that we are in the process of taking, we expect price/cost to continue to improve from here. And we expect to end the year close to price/cost-neutral. So that team is working really hard, making sure they're following our 2 core tenets, which is, first and foremost, remaining price-competitive, but then also looking through our assortment and estimating the continued cost increases that we're going to experience that we can time that as close to possible as we can so that we can end up price/cost-neutral. \nNigel Coe: D.G., I wanted to start on the core B2B Zoro customers where I think you said from a customer perspective, you're up high singles this quarter. What can you tell us about some of the initiatives internally? We've redoubled efforts to continue to drive that stickiness and repeat transaction rate among that cohort. And how are those initiatives progressing? \nDonald Macpherson: Yes. They're progressing well. Most of the focus is on -- so Zoro has always been a very good acquirer of new businesses, and they continue to do that well. We look at the Japanese business and Zoro when we compare notes, and the repeat business has been lower historically at Zoro than it's been at Japan. But we steadily increased that. And that is a lot of sort of marketing science, looking at what to present to customers after the first order, how to understand who those customers are, presenting the right products and the right offers after we get that first order. \n So most of it is around marketing actions that we're taking. And the Japanese team and the U.S. team are working very closely to make sure we transfer best practices and drive repeat rates up. And we see good results for the last -- probably the last 6 months actually in terms of improved repeat rates. \nNigel Coe: And then a follow-up on inflation, which you've hit on a couple of times here. And it sounds like you're going to address some of the price/cost issues in early May. What are the factors that changed year-to-date? Was it more on the cost input side coming in little hotter than you expected? Or what did you see out there? \nDeidra Merriwether: So I would say it was a couple of things. So one, D.G. talked a little bit about like misjudging the path of inflation here. We started to lower some prices at the end of last year. And so probably did that a little too quickly. And then when we started and assessed the 2024 increases in Q1, probably a little softer there.\n We have a range of outcomes that we attempt to plan for, as everyone else. And we're looking at market outlooks that are continually changing. It's something that we have to deal with every year and we work really hard to get close to -- as close as possible as we can to something that we could definitely execute and hit. And so we also have a range of COGS outcome or cost outcome from our suppliers. And so I'd say the second thing is some of those cost outcomes from the range that we said is coming in a little bit higher than what we had anticipated. \nOperator: Our next question is from Jacob Levinson with Melius Research. \nJacob Levinson: Just on the investment that you folks are making, I assume to see the Grainger ads everywhere these days. But can you give us a sense of where you're spending the money? And is that -- is there any change in the rate of change, if you will, on those investments? Or is this just something you've been doing pretty consistently? And -- or is it -- or is there some sort of opportunity where you see a chance to put a little bit more money to work? And I'll leave it at that. \nDonald Macpherson: I would say that it's all planned. There hasn't been any change in the path. And we invest in many ways, I'd say. But from a cash perspective, supply chain investments, we've talked about the new building in the Northwest and Houston. Those are in full swing. We also invest in technology. That's the other primary investment we make from a cash perspective. And then from an expense perspective, marketing is a big part of it.\n We invest up and down the marketing stack. We invest in advertising. We invest in paid search, of course. And then we invest in what we call mid-funnel, which is more targeted direct marketing with our customers. And what I would say is that we're constantly evaluating the returns on those and making minor tweaks, but what you're seeing today is just normal planned spend. \nJacob Levinson: Okay. That makes sense. Just on a different topic. And you folks have been a pretty consistent repurchaser of your own stock for a very long period of time. But the shares have obviously had a phenomenal run in the last couple of years -- does that. And you've got a potentially underlevered balance sheet. Has that changed the capital at all and how you're thinking about sort of the external capital allocation priorities here? \nDeidra Merriwether: So we expect to maintain the course on our capital allocation strategy. We feel it's been working well for the investment community. It helps us maintain good level of financial flexibility. But we're targeting to return any excess cash after we have invested to drive long-term growth back to shareholders in the form of the dividend and share repurchase. Those 2 vehicles, we feel, are both efficient for us and efficient for shareholders. \nOperator: Our next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. \nChristopher Glynn: Was wondering about the utility and commercial services verticals down mid-single digit. If you could provide any complexion there, particularly maybe in the utility side. It seems like that should be a little stronger. \nDonald Macpherson: Yes. So what I would say is that they're both relatively small for us. And so in utilities in particular, there's a single customer that has had some challenges, and that has had a big impact there. So it isn't really a sector. We don't play big enough in utilities to really be a sector barometer. So I would say it's sort of noise there. \nChristopher Glynn: Okay. Great. And then wanted to ask about the medium customers parallel to, I think it was Jake's question on the small. But you're also developing some regional and vertical models there to support long-term penetration and accelerate the performance there relative to the large customers just given the share differentials and lower penetration with medium. So curious for kind of a diagnostic update on your action plans there with the medium and how you see that unfolding. \nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I mean a lot of the things that we're doing around the business, certainly, we have a supply chain that's built very effectively for both large and midsized customers. We have a lot of our resources attached to large customers, all of our sales force, our inventory management teams and some of our support teams. And that is the lion's share of our revenue.\n Since we made the price change in 2017, we've recaptured virtually all of what we had lost in midsize customers. And certainly, the marketing initiatives have been helpful for that. The merchandising initiatives have been helpful for that in terms of helping us regain that share.\n We continue to grow faster with midsize customers than large, and we expect to do so for a long time. And there's a number of initiatives that we have that are supporting that. Although I would say most of our initiatives raise all boats, I mean, we do a lot of things that sort of scale across the entire business. \nOperator: Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. \nDeane Dray: I joined a little bit late, so I apologize if you had gotten any of the specifics. But I know you called out the timing of the holiday. Just for Easter holiday, can you size that? And was there any impact on January weather that you could detect? \nDeidra Merriwether: Deane, so yes, let me start with the last one, which is January weather. So I would say the impact of January weather for us, we started off a little slower than normal, and then it impacted the quarter a little bit. But by the time we got to the end of the quarter and started to ramp up, it's really immaterial for the overall quarter.\n And then moving to the -- I think you're referencing like the Good Friday holiday. It was about $10 million impact for us in March. And we laid out where we're at month-to-date, up [ 5.7 ]. So we feel like we're in pretty good stead starting off for the second quarter. \nDeane Dray: That's real helpful. And then just second question, any change in the outgrowth dynamics, either what you saw this quarter and expectations for the year? \nDonald Macpherson: No, I don't think there's any change in outgrowth expectations. We talked earlier, if you weren't on, about the fact that price in our market has been a little lower than PPI. Sometimes the broad metrics may not track exactly to our market, but that evens out over time. But our volume growth has been very strong through the quarter, and we're taking action to improve the pricing environment starting May 1. So I think really there's -- we don't think there's really any change dynamic. \nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital Markets. \nChristopher Dankert: Apologies if I missed it, but on the step-up in SG&A in the first quarter here, was there anything onetime there? Maybe just if you could walk through some of the moving parts for the kind of drove that step-up. \nDeidra Merriwether: Yes. No onetime items to call out in nature. I think as we provide color and provide the guide, we've been pretty consistent in noting that as we move through the year, we expect to continue to invest in demand-generating growth engines. And so a lot of the step-up in the quarter was investing in the areas that D.G. kind of called out a couple of questions ago, sorry if you missed that, like marketing and our investments and capacity, those -- that kind of fall into the expense line versus the marketing line.\n I will say that we are very diligent in our spending if it is what we classify as noncore, which is things that are not demand-generating. And those costs were fairly flat in the quarter. And we intend to -- we help those teams invest why they grow, they have to continue to focus on growing much lower than sales. \nChristopher Dankert: Understood. And then just any kind of update on the development and deployment of that customer information tool and kind of how that's been impacting things? \nDonald Macpherson: Yes. I mean -- so we've been on a several year journey to improve our customer information. What I would say is customer information in our market is really messy. So there isn't clean data sources that tell you who customers are and what they do and how many team members they have and that type of thing. So we've been building our own.\n What I would say is it's been super helpful with some of the seller coverage changes we've made. We're now building in some of our marketing processes. So it has a lot of tentacles in the business, and we're excited about the ability for the tool has been built to be leveraged to improve our ability to serve customers. \nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. \nPatrick Baumann: Dee, maybe a quick follow-up on April. The [ 5.7 ], just wanted to make sure I understood, that excludes divestitures and FX, right? And then was -- so you said $10 million impact from holiday timing in March. I guess that's like 1% of sales maybe, I don't know. Was there something like that also benefiting April in terms of timing? \nDeidra Merriwether: Well, you would expect it to flow into April to the extent that we could pick that up, yes. And the answer is yes to your first question because I think you noted it excludes FX. \nPatrick Baumann: Okay. Yes, so that's organic. Yes. Okay. Sorry, I missed that comment. \nDeidra Merriwether: Organic. \nPatrick Baumann: Okay. Great. And then on the follow-up is on SG&A again. So if we get later in the year and the top line isn't picking up from where we started the year, what's like the ability or desire to kind of toggle that SG&A growth back? I know you mentioned that you're diligent on spending if it's noncore. But what's your willingness to toggle back on some of the investment spending if growth doesn't pick up as the guidance expects? \nDonald Macpherson: Yes. Thanks. What I would say is that we are very focused on productivity improvements throughout the business. I think we are seeing productivity improve. The last few years have been a bit odd, to say the least, in terms of some of the challenges that everybody has had to deal with. And we have really sort of refocused our attention on getting better, getting more productive in every part of the operation. We're going to continue to do that.\n In terms of demand generation spending, I think you're asking specifically if it's worth spending in good times, it's probably worth spending in bad times, too. So we wouldn't typically pull back those things. We think that we exist for the long term and we're trying to win over the cycle, not just in the down cycle. So we would expect to not have dramatic changes in what we spend, but we do expect to continue to drive productivity. \nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to D.G. for closing remarks. \nDonald Macpherson: All right. Thanks for joining, everybody. Really appreciate it. I would just highlight that in general, I would say everything in the quarter was as we expected, and we feel very confident in the path we're on. There's not a lot of new news in this quarter, but we do feel good about the path. We do feel good about our ability to gain share, to become more productive and to make sure we remain price/cost-neutral over the long term. So all things point to really good results for the year.\n So appreciate the time. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude our conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thanks, Kyle. Good morning and thanks for joining the call. 2024 started well. As we remain grounded in the Grainger Edge, we are focused on starting with the customer and staying focused on what matters most. I've seen this play out in several ways throughout the quarter.\n In February, we hosted the Grainger Show in Orlando. Over 10,000 of our customers, suppliers and team members came together to showcase the products and solutions that Grainger offers. It remains a great opportunity to work together with our partners to solve customer problems. We've received great feedback on progress since the event.\n I've also had the opportunity to meet with a diverse set of customers from many industries. It has been great to see how the Grainger team continues to deliver value and further embed into our customers' operations. During a recent visit to a musical instrument manufacturer, I had the chance to see how our team partnered with the customer to help them standardize their product portfolio to lower cost and improve efficiency. This included leveraging our strong supplier relationships and expanding our KeepStock solution to ensure they have the right products in the right locations.\n I also spent time with a large public health system, which is in the process of building a new hospital. Throughout the project, we supported their operations as they transition to the new facility, ensuring products remain readily accessible across the campus. By supporting this customer throughout the significant change, we deepened their trust in Grainger and allowed them to focus on their area of expertise, patient care, while we took care of their MRO needs.\n Across all my visits, it's clear that we continue to show up well for our customers. Based on what I've seen, while each industry dynamic is different, overall demand for MRO products has remained soft but generally steady to start the year. Inflation remains a talking point with customers and suppliers and is turning out to be stickier than we had originally anticipated heading into 2024. Dee will provide details in a bit.\n Moving on to our first quarter performance. You can see we started the year largely as expected, delivering another year solid -- another quarter of solid results. Total company sales were up 3.5% or 4.9% on a daily organic constant currency basis with positive contributions from both segments. In High-Touch Solutions, we continue to advance our 5 key growth engines as we leverage our technology and data assets to unlock further value for customers.\n Within the Endless Assortment business, we remain focused on acquiring new customers and improving repeat purchase rates across the segment, and we made solid progress here in the quarter.\n From a profitability standpoint, total company operating margin was down as anticipated to 15.8%, a decrease of 80 basis points over the prior year. EPS finished the quarter roughly flat versus prior year at $9.62.\n Beyond the P&L, ROIC remained strong at 42.9%, and operating cash flow finished at record levels, which allowed us to return a total of $360 million to Grainger shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n Lastly, I want to mention that yesterday, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the 53rd consecutive year of expected dividend increases, something we are very proud of. In addition, the Board refreshed our repurchase authorization, enabling the buyback of up to 5 million shares of common stock. These combined actions reflect our continued commitment to returning cash to shareholders through a balanced and return-focused approach.\n Overall, 2024 started off largely as expected, and the business continues to perform well. With this, we are reiterating our full year 2024 guidance. We are set up to have a strong year results for all stakeholders.\n I'll now pass it to Dee to go through the details. Thanks, Dee. Grainger's ongoing success is made possible by our people. And I'm fortunate that I'm routinely able to spend time with our frontline team members. And it's clear that they are deeply connected to our customers, working side by side to help solve their most challenging problems. I believe this commitment to our customers is because of the emphasis we put on building a culture where every team member knows that they can make a difference.\n Earlier this month, Grainger was named to Fortune's Best Place -- Workplaces in 2024 for the third consecutive year. This is an exclusive recognition that honors companies with the best cultures and people, which is a perfect way to describe what we have at Grainger. I'm confident the team will continue to keep working towards our goals and delivering on the things that matter most for our customers, team members and all stakeholders in 2024 and beyond.\n With that, we will open the line for questions. Yes. So I'll provide a few comments, and then Dee can provide any details. So as you mentioned, inflation has been a bit stickier than we expected. Originally, we thought inflation would be 0% to 1%. It's likely to be 1% to 2% at this point. That outlook is lower than the headline PPI index because our industry-specific factors are different than the PPI index, and that difference has contributed to lower market outgrowth the last few quarters. And we do see these short-term disconnects from time to time. We saw it in 2022 as well. But they smooth out over time.\n We are a little late to judge the increase in prices this year. And so we are taking action 5/1. We price a 5/1 cycle, and that cycle is going to correct -- make some corrections. I think that's well in motion, and that's already basically executed and will start happening next week.\n I think, importantly, when you strip out the lumpiness from pricing, our volume outgrowth has been very good, something like 400-plus basis points. So we continue to see nice volume growth. And we think the pricing will correct. It's just a timing thing. No, we don't have any change. I think we will still have a bit of a headwind for consumers, B2C and B2C-light customers through the second quarter. We think that will go away as the year moves on, and that could become a positive. But generally, that's all built into the 7% to 10%. Yes. They're progressing well. Most of the focus is on -- so Zoro has always been a very good acquirer of new businesses, and they continue to do that well. We look at the Japanese business and Zoro when we compare notes, and the repeat business has been lower historically at Zoro than it's been at Japan. But we steadily increased that. And that is a lot of sort of marketing science, looking at what to present to customers after the first order, how to understand who those customers are, presenting the right products and the right offers after we get that first order. \n So most of it is around marketing actions that we're taking. And the Japanese team and the U.S. team are working very closely to make sure we transfer best practices and drive repeat rates up. And we see good results for the last -- probably the last 6 months actually in terms of improved repeat rates. I would say that it's all planned. There hasn't been any change in the path. And we invest in many ways, I'd say. But from a cash perspective, supply chain investments, we've talked about the new building in the Northwest and Houston. Those are in full swing. We also invest in technology. That's the other primary investment we make from a cash perspective. And then from an expense perspective, marketing is a big part of it.\n We invest up and down the marketing stack. We invest in advertising. We invest in paid search, of course. And then we invest in what we call mid-funnel, which is more targeted direct marketing with our customers. And what I would say is that we're constantly evaluating the returns on those and making minor tweaks, but what you're seeing today is just normal planned spend. Yes. So what I would say is that they're both relatively small for us. And so in utilities in particular, there's a single customer that has had some challenges, and that has had a big impact there. So it isn't really a sector. We don't play big enough in utilities to really be a sector barometer. So I would say it's sort of noise there. Yes. I mean a lot of the things that we're doing around the business, certainly, we have a supply chain that's built very effectively for both large and midsized customers. We have a lot of our resources attached to large customers, all of our sales force, our inventory management teams and some of our support teams. And that is the lion's share of our revenue.\n Since we made the price change in 2017, we've recaptured virtually all of what we had lost in midsize customers. And certainly, the marketing initiatives have been helpful for that. The merchandising initiatives have been helpful for that in terms of helping us regain that share.\n We continue to grow faster with midsize customers than large, and we expect to do so for a long time. And there's a number of initiatives that we have that are supporting that. Although I would say most of our initiatives raise all boats, I mean, we do a lot of things that sort of scale across the entire business. No, I don't think there's any change in outgrowth expectations. We talked earlier, if you weren't on, about the fact that price in our market has been a little lower than PPI. Sometimes the broad metrics may not track exactly to our market, but that evens out over time. But our volume growth has been very strong through the quarter, and we're taking action to improve the pricing environment starting May 1. So I think really there's -- we don't think there's really any change dynamic. Yes. I mean -- so we've been on a several year journey to improve our customer information. What I would say is customer information in our market is really messy. So there isn't clean data sources that tell you who customers are and what they do and how many team members they have and that type of thing. So we've been building our own.\n What I would say is it's been super helpful with some of the seller coverage changes we've made. We're now building in some of our marketing processes. So it has a lot of tentacles in the business, and we're excited about the ability for the tool has been built to be leveraged to improve our ability to serve customers. Yes. Thanks. What I would say is that we are very focused on productivity improvements throughout the business. I think we are seeing productivity improve. The last few years have been a bit odd, to say the least, in terms of some of the challenges that everybody has had to deal with. And we have really sort of refocused our attention on getting better, getting more productive in every part of the operation.

            "content": "Thanks, D.G. On Slide 7, you can see the high-level results for the total company, including 4.9% growth on the daily organic constant currency basis.\n The quarter played out as anticipated despite tough comps, continued rebaselining of the Endless Assortment business and impact from holiday timing in the period. Operating margins were down 80 basis points year-over-year, finished largely as expected in the quarter. Gross margins were lower by 50 basis points as we lapped outsized favorability in the prior year period, and SG&A delevered 30 basis points as we ramp demand-generating investments to drive long-term, profitable share gain. In total, we delivered diluted EPS for the quarter of $9.62, up $0.01 over the prior year period and in line with our expectations to start the year.\n Moving on to segment-level results. The High-Touch Solutions segment continues to perform well with sales up 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.8% on a daily organic constant currency basis. Volume growth remained strong, which offset a slight contraction in price due to timing. All geographies saw growth in the period.\n In the first quarter, the U.S. continued to see strong growth with contractors, government and health care customers. This growth offsets slowing demand in other end markets, including manufacturing and commercial services as well as the impact from holiday timing. Overall, demand remained soft but largely unchanged over the last few quarters.\n For the segment, gross profit finished the quarter at 41.8%, improving sequentially but below normal seasonality amidst a more muted pricing backdrop. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was down 60 basis points primarily due to the timing of price/cost spread along with the lap of a 20 basis point onetime favorable freight adjustment in the prior year. These headwinds were partially offset by continued freight and supply chain efficiencies, which began in the first quarter of 2023 and are now fully normalized.\n While the quarter finished in line with our expectations on the gross margin in total, we were a little more price/cost negative than anticipated as the timing of price and cost is never perfect. As the year progresses, we expect price/cost spread will recover and finish the year closer to neutral.\n SG&A delevered 40 basis points as we continue to invest in our demand-generating growth engines, including marketing and store head count. We will continue to stay disciplined with our spending and rigorous and understanding cause and effect, but feel it's prudent to invest through the cycle to gain share over the long term. Overall, these results position us well for another strong year within the high-touch segment.\n Looking at market outgrowth on Slide 9. We estimate that the U.S. MRO market, including volume and price, grew in the quarter between 2% and 3%, nearly all from continued price inflation. This indicates that the High-Touch Solutions U.S. business achieved roughly 150 basis points of market outgrowth in the first quarter in total.\n Similar to last quarter, this more muted quarterly outgrowth reflects the higher PPI-based price inflation in Grainger's [ first ] quarter price contribution. As we mentioned in the past, there is no perfect market for our business, and we're comparing a broader external metric of inflation to our MRO product mix. There can be noise, especially in quarterly periods.\n That being said, as D.G. alluded earlier, inflation has been stickier than we originally anticipated, and we're taking some corrective actions in the second quarter to ensure we adhere to our 2 core pricing tenets: maintaining market [ driven ] prices while ensuring price/cost neutrality over time.\n Importantly, on a pure volume basis, we're looking at our volume contributions versus the growth in industrial production. Our volume outgrowth is closer to 450 basis points, reflecting continued strong performance for our high-touch growth engine.\n Moving to our Endless Assortment segment. Sales increased 3.7% or 10% on a daily constant currency basis, which adjusts for the impact of the depreciated Japanese yen. Zoro U.S. was up 5.1%, while MonotaRo achieved 13.1% growth in local days, local currency.\n At a business level, Zoro saw continued strong growth from B2B customers who remained up year-over-year in the high single digits. This helped offset continued declines with noncore B2C and B2C-light customers, which were down double digits year-over-year. We expect these B2C headwinds to subside as the year progresses.\n At MonotaRO, sales were strong from continued growth with enterprise customers, coupled with solid repeat purchase rates within their core B2B customer base. On a reported basis, however, these strong results are nearly all offset by continued foreign exchange rate pressures as the yen sinks to near all-time lows versus the dollar.\n Operating margins for the segment declined 20 basis points to 7.9% largely driven by gross margin favorability at MonotaRO from freight and supply chain efficiencies, which were more than offset by negative mix at Zoro as gross margins continue to normalize following the last few years of inflation. Overall, it was a good quarter for the Endless Assortment business.\n Now an update on the remainder of the year. Overall, we said Q1 played out much as we expected, and results aligned well within the guidance ranges we laid out at the beginning of the year. This has continued into April with daily organic constant currency sales up 5.7% month-to-date. This gives us confidence to reiterate our current year -- our current full year 2024 guidance, which includes daily organic constant currency sales growth between 4% and 7% and EPS ranging between $38 and $40.50, up roughly 7% at the midpoint.\n On seasonality, top line comps get easier as we move through the year. Operating margin will dip down sequentially in the second quarter as gross margin moderated slightly, and SG&A leverage declines as merit increases go into effect and marketing investments continue to ramp. With that, we expect modest year-over-year EPS growth in the second quarter with earnings ramping from there in Q3 and Q4.\n Although we are maintaining our guidance ranges, I do want to call out the increasing headwind we're seeing from foreign exchange rates. As it stands today, the dollar to yen spot rate sits roughly at 1.55, well above the 1.44 we originally planned in January and still assumed in our current guidance. If rates remain at these elevated levels, this would cause roughly $140 million incremental headwind to our full year 2024 reported net sales guidance at an approximate $0.13 decrease to annual EPS.\n Overall, we're pleased with how the business is performing and remain confident in holding expectations for the year.\n With that, I'll pass it back to D.G. So yes, I'll start with the first part of your question. So the majority of MonotaRO's COGS are in the end. They do have some U.S.-denominated, but it's a much smaller portion of their COGS. And they've done a really nice job over the last several years of being able to pass on inflation through price to account for the disaggregation between the yen and the dollar.\n As it relates to -- I think you kind of talked about when we then consolidate the business, you have the tax effect that impacts us. And then we just end up really with [ one ] to eliminate noncontrolling interest, just have the translation risk. And we generally, from a philosophical perspective, don't attempt to hedge translation risk because it's not real economic risk for us. Sure. Yes. I think the first 2 statements you made were correct. And as we look at the balance of the year, starting in the second quarter with the actions that D.G. noted that we are in the process of taking, we expect price/cost to continue to improve from here. And we expect to end the year close to price/cost-neutral. So that team is working really hard, making sure they're following our 2 core tenets, which is, first and foremost, remaining price-competitive, but then also looking through our assortment and estimating the continued cost increases that we're going to experience that we can time that as close to possible as we can so that we can end up price/cost-neutral. So I would say it was a couple of things. So one, D.G. talked a little bit about like misjudging the path of inflation here. We started to lower some prices at the end of last year. And so probably did that a little too quickly. And then when we started and assessed the 2024 increases in Q1, probably a little softer there.\n We have a range of outcomes that we attempt to plan for, as everyone else. And we're looking at market outlooks that are continually changing. It's something that we have to deal with every year and we work really hard to get close to -- as close as possible as we can to something that we could definitely execute and hit. And so we also have a range of COGS outcome or cost outcome from our suppliers. And so I'd say the second thing is some of those cost outcomes from the range that we said is coming in a little bit higher than what we had anticipated. So we expect to maintain the course on our capital allocation strategy. We feel it's been working well for the investment community. It helps us maintain good level of financial flexibility. But we're targeting to return any excess cash after we have invested to drive long-term growth back to shareholders in the form of the dividend and share repurchase. Those 2 vehicles, we feel, are both efficient for us and efficient for shareholders. Deane, so yes, let me start with the last one, which is January weather. So I would say the impact of January weather for us, we started off a little slower than normal, and then it impacted the quarter a little bit. But by the time we got to the end of the quarter and started to ramp up, it's really immaterial for the overall quarter.\n And then moving to the -- I think you're referencing like the Good Friday holiday. It was about $10 million impact for us in March. And we laid out where we're at month-to-date, up [ 5.7 ]. So we feel like we're in pretty good stead starting off for the second quarter. Yes. No onetime items to call out in nature. I think as we provide color and provide the guide, we've been pretty consistent in noting that as we move through the year, we expect to continue to invest in demand-generating growth engines. And so a lot of the step-up in the quarter was investing in the areas that D.G. kind of called out a couple of questions ago, sorry if you missed that, like marketing and our investments and capacity, those -- that kind of fall into the expense line versus the marketing line.\n I will say that we are very diligent in our spending if it is what we classify as noncore, which is things that are not demand-generating. And those costs were fairly flat in the quarter. And we intend to -- we help those teams invest why they grow, they have to continue to focus on growing much lower than sales. Well, you would expect it to flow into April to the extent that we could pick that up, yes. And the answer is yes to your first question because I think you noted it excludes FX. Organic."
